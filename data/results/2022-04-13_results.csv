"Lowered oxygen saturation and increased body temperature in acute COVID-19 largely predict chronic fatigue syndrome and affective symptoms due to LONG COVID: a precision nomothetic approach","Background: Long coronavirus disease 2019 (LC) is a chronic sequel of acute COVID-19. The exact pathophysiology of the affective, chronic fatigue and physiosomatic symptoms labeled as physio-affective phenome of LC has remained elusive. Objective: The current study aims to delineate the effects of oxygen saturation (SpO2) and body temperature during the acute phase on the physio-affective phenome of LC. Method: We recruited 120 LC patients and 36 controls. For all participants, we assessed the lowest SpO2 and peak body temperature during acute COVID-19, and the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMD/HAMA) and Fibro Fatigue (FF) scales 3 to 4 months later. Results: Lowered SpO2 and increased body temperature during the acute phase and female sex predict 60.7% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome of LC. Using unsupervised learning techniques we were able to delineate a new endophenotype class, which comprises around 26.7% of the LC patients and is characterized by very low SpO2 and very high body temperature, and depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue, and autonomic and gastro-intestinal symptoms scores. Single latent vectors could be extracted from both biomarkers, depression, anxiety and FF symptoms or from both biomarkers, insomnia, chronic fatigue, gastro-intestinal and autonomic symptoms. Conclusion: The newly constructed endophenotype class and pathway phenotypes indicate that the physio-affective phenome of LC is at least in part the consequence of the pathophysiology of acute COVID-19, namely the combined effects of lowered SpO2, increased body temperature and the associated immune-inflammatory processes and lung lesions.","Not available","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.10.22273660","20220412","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29871,""
"Workplace Infection Prevention Control Measures and Work Engagement During the COVID-19 Pandemic among Japanese Workers: A Prospective Cohort Study","Objectives: It has been widely reported that the COVID-19 pandemic may have a psychological influence on people. Thus, it could be important to note how workplace infection prevention and control (IPC) measures for COVID-19 contribute to positive mental health among workers. We hypothesized that if workplace IPC measures are adequately implemented, they would have a positive effect on employees' work engagement. Methods: We conducted an internet-based prospective cohort study from December 2020 (baseline) to December 2021 (follow-up after one year) using self-administered questionnaires. At baseline, 27,036 workers completed the questionnaires, while 18,560 (68.7%) participated in the one-year follow-up. After excluding the 6,578 participants who changed jobs or retired during the survey period, or telecommuted more than four days per week, 11,982 participants were analyzed. We asked participants about the implementation of workplace IPC measures at baseline and conducted a nine-item version of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9) at follow-up. Results: Four groups were created according to the number of workplace IPC measures implemented. The mean (SD) UWES-9 score of the ""0-2"" group was the lowest at 18.3 (13.2), while that of the ""8"" group was the highest at 22.6 (12.6). The scores of the ""3-5,"" ""6-7,"" and ""8"" groups were significantly higher than that of the ""0-2"" group (all, p<0.001). The p trend of the four groups was also significant (p<0.001). Conclusions: Promoting workplace IPC measures improves workers' work engagement, and a dose-response relationship exists between workplace IPC measures and work engagement.","Not available","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.11.22273753","20220412","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29872,""
"The effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on mental health care use in South Africa: an interrupted time series analysis","AimsIn March 2020, South Africa introduced a lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, entailing the suspension of all non-essential activities and a complete ban of tobacco and alcohol sales. We studied the effect of the lockdown on mental health care utilisation rates in private-sector care in South Africa.

MethodsWe did an interrupted time series analysis using insurance claims from January 1, 2017, to June 1, 2020 of beneficiaries 18 years or older from a large private sector medical aid scheme. We calculated weekly outpatient consultation and hospital admission rates for organic mental disorders, substance use disorders, serious mental disorders, depression, anxiety, other mental disorders, any mental disorder, and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (OR) for the effect of the lockdown on weekly outpatient consultation and hospital admission rates and the weekly change in rates during the lockdown until June 1, 2020.

Results710,367 persons were followed up for a median of 153 weeks. Hospital admission rates (OR 0.38; 95% CI 0.33-0.44) and outpatient consultation rates (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.63-0.87) for any mental disorder decreased substantially after the lockdown and did not recover to pre-lockdown levels until June 1, 2020. Health care utilisation rates for alcohol withdrawal syndrome doubled after the introduction of the lockdown, but the statistical uncertainty around the estimates was large (OR 2.24; 95% CI 0.69-7.24).

ConclusionsReduced mental health care contact rates during the COVID-19 lockdown likely reflect a substantial unmet need for mental health services with potential long-term consequences for mental health patients and their families. Steps to ensure access and continuity of mental health services during future lockdowns should be considered.","Anja Elisabeth Wettstein; Mpho Tlali; John A Joska; Morna Cornell; Veronika W Skrivankova; Soraya Seedat; Johannes P Mouton; Leigh L van den Heuvel; Nicola Maxwell; Mary-Ann Davies; Gary Maartens; Matthias Egger; Andreas D Haas","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.07.22273561","20220411","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29873,""
"Evaluation of an emergency safe supply drugs and managed alcohol program in COVID-19 isolation hotel shelters for people experiencing homelessness","Background During a COVID-19 outbreak in the congregate shelter system in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, a healthcare team provided an emergency â€œsafe supplyâ€ of medications and alcohol to facilitate isolation in COVID-19 hotel shelters for residents who use drugs and/or alcohol. We aimed to evaluate (a) substances and dosages provided, and (b) outcomes of the program. Methods We reviewed medical records of all COVID-19 isolation hotel shelter residents during May 2021. The primary outcome was successful completion of 14 days isolation, as directed by public health orders. Adverse events included (a) overdose;(b) intoxication;and (c) diversion, selling, or sharing of medications or alcohol. Results Seventy-seven isolation hotel residents were assessed (mean age 42Â±14 years;24% women). Sixty-two (81%) residents were provided medications, alcohol, or cigarettes. Seventeen residents (22%) received opioid agonist treatment (methadone, buprenorphine, or slow-release oral morphine) and 27 (35%) received hydromorphone. Thirty-one (40%) residents received prescriptions stimulants. Six (8%) residents received benzodiazepines and forty-two (55%) received alcohol. Over 14 days, mean daily dosages increased of hydromorphone (45Â±32 to 57Â±42mg), methylphenidate (51Â±28 to 77Â±37mg), and alcohol (12.3Â±7.6 to 13.0Â±6.9 standard drinks). Six residents (8%) left isolation prematurely, but four returned. During 1,059 person-days, there were zero overdoses. Documented concerns regarding intoxication occurred six times (0.005 events/person-day) and medication diversion/sharing three times (0.003 events/person-day). Conclusions COVID-19 isolation hotel residents participating in an emergency safe supply and managed alcohol program experienced high rates of successful completion of 14 days isolation and low rates of adverse events.","Brothers, Thomas D.; Leaman, Malcolm, Bonn, Matthew, Lewer, Dan, Atkinson, Jacqueline, Fraser, John, Gillis, Amy, Gniewek, Michael, Hawker, Leisha, Hayman, Heather, Jorna, Peter, Martell, David, Oâ€™Donnell, Tiffany, Rivers-Bowerman, Helen, Genge, Leah","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109440","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence;: 109440, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29874,""
"Managing the COVID-19 pandemic in people with mental disorders: An exploratory telephone interview study in a psychiatric outpatient department","Background The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures reduced well-being in the general population significantly and led to an increase in anxiety and depression symptoms, however, results on the impact on people with mental disorders are heterogeneous to date. The aim of this study was to investigate the mental health status, social support, perceived stress, and the medical care provision of people with mental disorders during the time period immediately after the first COVID-19 lockdown in spring 2020 in Germany. Methods Participants were people with mental disorders currently receiving treatment in the psychiatric outpatient department of the University Hospital Leipzig, Germany. Structured telephone interviews were administered to assess depressive symptoms, self-rated medical care provision, attitudes and social and emotional aspects of the pandemic (social support, perceived stress, loneliness, resilience, and agreeableness). Results A total of NÂ =Â 106 people completed the telephone interview. The most frequent clinician-rated diagnoses were attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD;nÂ =Â 29, 27.4%) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD;nÂ =Â 24, 22.6%). The mean Patient Health Questionnaire-9 sum score was 10.91 (SDÂ =Â 5.71) and the majority of participants (nÂ =Â 56, 52.8%) reported clinically relevant depressive symptoms. A low self-rated medical care provision was significantly associated with higher depressive symptom load. In a regression analysis, higher perceived stress levels and low medical care provision significantly predicted depressive symptoms. Furthermore, 38.1% (nÂ =Â 40) reported to feel relieved as a result of the restrictions and, due to previous experience in dealing with crisis, half of the participants (nÂ =Â 53, 50.5%) stated they were better able to deal with the current situation than the general population. Conclusions This study emphasizes the importance of maintenance of medical care provision for people with mental disorders, as cancelled or postponed treatment appointments and perceived stress were associated with higher depressive symptoms. Regular treatment services showed to have a protective effect. In addition, a majority of people with mental disorders felt prepared for managing the COVID pandemic due to existing crisis management abilities. These resources should also be taken into account for further future treatment considerations.

"Chronic Adolescent Social Instability Stress Leads to Impaired Recognition Memory and Increased Hippocampal FKBP5 and CRHR2 Expression in Adulthood","Background: Recently published studies indicate that the Covid-19 pandemic has dramatically increased rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide in adolescents and young adults. Human and animal studies strongly indicate that early life stress leads to lasting changes to cognition and psychiatric outcomes, but less is known about how chronic adolescent stress may alter brain function across the lifespan. Methods: The current study examines the effects of chronic social instability stress (SIS) on male and female mice from 4 to 11 weeks of age. SIS mice (n=52) experienced twice weekly cage changes, preventing the formation of stable social hierarchies, while control mice (n=48) remained with their original cage mates. Mice were subsequently assessed throughout adulthood for changes in behavior associated with anxiety, affect, aggression, motivation, and recognition memory. At 66 weeks of age, levels hippocampal mRNA expression of genes associated with human early life stress were also compared (CRHR1, CRHR2, FKBP5, SLCA4). Results: Mice exposed to SIS showed decreased novel object recognition (p=0.002) and responded more during the progressive ratio task (p=0.033). At 66 weeks, SIS mice had increased hippocampal FKBP5 (p=0.03) and CRHR2 (p=0.005) expression relative to controls;furthermore, these measures negatively correlated with novel object recognition (FKBP: p=0.007;CRHR2: p=0.04). Conclusions: Chronic adolescent social instability stress led to persistent memory deficits and increased hedonic seeking in adulthood, possibly due to hippocampal damage resultant from lasting alterations to the stress cascade. Future studies will determine the cellular, molecular and circuit-level changes underlying these effects.

"Effects of the Pandemic on Rating Scales","Background: The COVID pandemic adversely impacted the mental health of the country. We compared the change in depression symptoms before and after the onset of the pandemic in our clinic using standardized screening forms. Methods: All patients at an outpatient psychiatric clinic were given a series of screening tests to take prior to their first visit. The tests included among others the PHQ-9 depression screening, the SCL-90, and a pyschosocial history. Patients also complete the PHQ-9 at every visit. A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients seen since 2017. Results: A total of 440 patients completed the intake screening, 309 before the start of COVID, 131 after (post March 2020). Patients reported more severe symptoms on their intake screenings in the time of COVID. Obsessive-compulsive (1.71 vs 1.48), hostility (.94 vs.77), and psychoticism (9.88 vs.74) were all significantly higher on the SCL-90, as were trouble concentrating (1.7 vs 1.4) and thoughts of suicide (.62 vs.42) on the PHQ-9. Despite patients reporting more serious symptoms at intake, patients who started treatment after the start of COVID had lower PHQ-9 scores during their first year (9.5 vs. 10.2). Among patients who had already started treatment pre-pandemic, their average scores showed a significant improvement. The total score for these patients averaged 9.9 across all visits prior to March 2020, compared to 6.3 after (p&lt;.001).

"Risk Factors Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19 Related Depression Among Immigrant Latino Essential Workers in Suffolk County, New York","Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases and deaths remain substantially higher among Latino populations in the United States. Risk of infection may be associated with occupational exposures and a greater burden of depression. This study sought to identify factors associated with COVID-19 infection and COVID 19 related depression among immigrant Latino essential workers. Methods: A cross-sectional telephone survey to assess the prevalence of infection and COVID-19 related needs and concerns was administered. Depression was assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Comparisons by essential worker group: Indoor (i.e. supermarket)/Outdoor (i.e. construction) were determined using Nonparametric Mann Whitney U test, X2, and Fisher tests. Multivariable logistic regression models were estimated to determine factors associated with the probability of prior infection and COVID-19 related depression (PHQ9 score &gt;=10). Results: 227 essential workers (median [IQR] 39.9 [32.7-47.6] years;130 [57.3%] male;213 (93.8%) foreign born) completed the survey. Seventy (30.0%) reported prior COVID-19 infection. Outdoor workers were more likely to be male, report higher housing density, and were less likely to be insured. Outdoor worker status was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 infection. Odds of depression was higher for respondents reporting prior infection, increased with the number of needs reported, and was nearly five times higher for uninsured workers. Conclusions: Data from Latino essential workers in regions with high rates of infection indicate the need for occupational precautions to mitigate risks of reinfection. Results further underscore the need for clinical screenings to identify the burden of COVID-19 related depression in at risk populations. Supported By: Steven and Alexandra Cohen Foundation, Inc.

"Coping During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Maternal Mental Health and Infant Temperament","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased psychological distress on a global scale, particularly for vulnerable people, including new and expecting mothers. We are still determining the magnitude of the toll on parents and their children. Methods: 516 pregnant people completed online questionnaires during the spring of 2020 (T1);296 of these people completed additional questionnaires approximately one year postpartum (T2). Participants reported on mental health, coping behaviors, and infant temperament. A principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted to identify coping factors. Linear regression analyses were conducted to evaluate associations among coping factors, maternal depressive symptoms, and infant temperament. Results: PCA revealed three factors explaining 40.53% of the variance in coping behaviors. The first factor included self-care behaviors (e.g., exercise, mediation);the second, numbing behaviors (e.g., increased screen time, eating comfort foods);and the third, reaching out for help behaviors (e.g., talking to a therapist or other parents). Engaging in reaching out for help coping behaviors was associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms from T1 to T2 (adjusted R2=.03, p=.02). This was most pronounced in participants who reported greater emotion regulation difficulties (R2=.07, p=.04). Further, increases in depressive symptoms from T1 to T2 were associated with higher levels of infant negative affect (R2=.08, p=.004). Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of providing socially focused coping and mental health services for pregnant people to ensure the well-being of new mothers and their children. Future work should evaluate trajectories of emotional development of children who were in utero during the pandemic.

"Mental Health Symptoms Predict Cognitive Performance in Online Gig Economy Workers","Background: The United States has seen rising wealth inequality and the global COVID19 pandemic contribute to a â€œsecondary pandemicâ€ of mental health symptoms. However, not all groups of people have been equally impacted. We report results from a pre-registered study of mental health and cognitive function of over 1000 online gig workers collected before and during the COVID19 pandemic. Methods: We used a browser-based survey and task battery to collect data on mood and cognition from N=1000+ adults age 18-75. Results: Surprisingly, we found no change in self-reported depression or anxiety in the pre-pandemic vs. pandemic-era sample. However, there were significant disparities in mental health outcomes based on group demographics, with the youngest and most highly educated participants reporting the highest depression and anxiety symptoms (p&gt;.001). These symptoms negatively impacted cognitive performance on a visual attention task. Computational modeling of latent cognitive parameters revealed a â€œfast and inaccurateâ€ pattern associated with anxiety, and a â€œslow and noisyâ€ pattern associated with depression (p&gt;.001). Exploratory analyses identified interactions between age, mental health, and cognition, whereby younger participants reported clinically supra-threshold mental health symptoms that negatively impacted cognition;whereas older adults reported sub-threshold symptoms which were positively correlated with cognitive performance (p&gt;.001). An interaction was observed between education levels, age, and mental health symptoms: the most highly educated younger adults in the sample reported the most mental health symptoms(p&gt;.001). Conclusions: Results indicate a high mental health burden particularly among young, highly educated gig economy workers. Anxiety and depression differentially impacted cognitive performance on a visual attention task.

"Which Patients Will Have Mental Disorders After Hospitalization for COVID-19?","Background: Although mental disorders are frequent after acute COVID-19, it is unclear whether they are predicted by acute COVID-19 severity. Methods: Four months after hospital discharge for acute COVID-19 (from March 1 to May 29, 2020), 177 (63.7%) benefited from a standardized psychiatric assessment in an outpatient setting. COVID-19 objective severity was assessed during hospitalization for COVID-19. Results: The mean patient age was 57.5 years (sd=13.2) and 68 (38.4%) patients were women. During acute COVID-19, 97 (54.8%) patients were admitted to the ICU, 51 (28.8%) required invasive ventilation, 29 (16.4%) had acute delirium, and 40 (22.6%) had immunomodulatory treatments. The mean length of hospitalization was 22.0 (16.2) days, the maximum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level was 147.9 (111.5) mg/L, and the maximum creatininemia level was 127.6 (161.1) Âµmol/L. Four months after acute COVID-19, 36 (20.3%) patients had at least one current mental disorder. Twenty-nine (80%) of these 36 patients were diagnosed with a new-onset mental disorder. Nine (5.1%) patients had a significant suicide risk. Mental disorders, new-onset ones and significant suicide risk 4 months after acute COVID-19 were not associated with higher acute COVID-19 severity, as assessed with length of hospitalization, ICU admission, invasive ventilation, acute delirium, immunomodulatory treatments, maximum CRP, and creatininemia levels. Conclusions: In this sample of survivors after a hospitalization for acute COVID 19, we failed to show any association between acute COVID-19 objective severity and mental disorders 4 months later. Assessment of mental disorders should be proposed to patients after hospitalization for COVID-19.

"Associations Among Resilient Coping Strategies, Frontolimbic Functional Connectivity, and Depression and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing stressor that has resulted in millions of deaths and worsening of psychiatric health worldwide. However, we lack knowledge regarding the influence of specific behavioral and neural factors that may alleviate the impact of the pandemic on mental health. Thus, we assessed whether pre-pandemic resilient coping strategy engagement and frontolimbic circuitry influence depression and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. Methods: In 72 young adults (72.2% female, mean age 24 years), we assessed depression and anxiety symptoms (BDI and SCARED-A), resilient coping strategies (CD-RISC), and resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of frontolimbic circuitry using fMRI. We conducted general linear models to test preregistered hypotheses that 1) less resilient coping pre-pandemic and 2) weaker frontolimbic FC pre-pandemic would predict more severe symptoms during the pandemic;and 3) coping would interact with FC to predict symptoms during the pandemic. Results: Anxiety symptoms worsened during the pandemic as compared to pre-pandemic, while depression symptoms improved (ps&lt;0.001). Less resilient coping predicted more severe depression symptoms during the pandemic (p=0.023). Weaker frontolimbic FC pre-pandemic predicted more severe obsessive-compulsive (p=0.015) and separation anxiety symptoms (p=0.040) during the pandemic. Resilient coping interacted with frontolimbic FC to predict depression (p&lt;0.001), obsessive-compulsive (p=0.041), panic (p=0.017), and generalized anxiety (p=0.027) symptoms during the pandemic. Conclusions: Less coping strategy engagement and weaker frontolimbic FC may represent risk factors for poor psychiatric health during the pandemic. This research may inform efforts to ameliorate the adverse psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as subsequent global stressful events.

"Neuroimaging Recovery in Human Drug Addiction: An Eye Towards Intervention Development","Drug addiction is on the rise during these COVID-19 times that intensify the factors contributing to relapse and overdose across drugs of abuse and continents. Using a multimodal approach (neuropsychology, fMRI, ERP), human neuroimaging studies in my lab have elucidated core mechanisms underlying drug addiction, with a focus on the role of the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic circuit, especially the prefrontal cortex, in higher-order cognitive and emotional dysfunction in this population. Our theoretical model is called iRISA (Impaired Response Inhibition and Salience Attribution), postulating that abnormalities in the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (and other cortical regions underlying higher order executive function), contribute to the core clinical symptoms in addiction. Specifically, our program of research is guided by the working hypothesis that drug addicted individuals disproportionately attribute salience and value to their drug of choice at the expense of other reinforcing stimuli, with a concomitant decrease in the ability to inhibit maladaptive drug use. Our complex and multifaceted dataset has allowed us to study the impact of abstinence on recovery in these brain-behavior compromises in treatment-seeking addicted individuals, where non-linear relationships exemplify incubation of craving while other trajectories of change, including in white matter tracks and for small subcortical regions (such as the habenula), are also explored. Novel paradigm shifts in the lab include the use of naturalistic and dynamic stimuli for enhanced generalizability and validity, in addition to development of effective neurorehabilitation strategies (including cognitive reappraisal, mindfulness, and transcranial direct current stimulation) in drug addiction.

"The Impact of Covid-Related Stress on Maternal Sleep During Pregnancy","Background: Poor sleep during pregnancy is very common and is associated with increased risk of adverse maternal and infant outcomes. Maternal psychosocial stress has been found to negatively impact sleep. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has exposed many individuals to an unprecedented level of stress, that will continue for an unknown period of time. Studies are showing that all these factors may not only increase levels of stress, but also influence sleep health. Methods: From March 2020-May 2021, participants were recruited as part of the COVID-19 Mother Baby Outcomes (COMBO) study at Columbia University. Survey data on maternal depression (PHQ-9), perceived stress (PSS), COVID-related stress, and sleep health (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI) were collected. For this analysis, we excluded mothers identified as depressed based on PHQ9. Regressions analyses were implemented to estimate the associations between PSS and COVID-related stress and multiple domains of sleep, accounting for covariates (maternal age, education, gestational age covid infection in pregnancy, time of the pandemic). Results: Our sample consisted of N=155 women;Gestational age at assessment: 30.6Â±5.8 weeks;Age: 32.2Â±5.0 years;non-Hispanic White=66, non-Hispanic Black=12, Hispanic=56, Asian=16, Other=5;69% 4-year college/graduate degree. Mean PSS was 18.3Â±7.0 and COVID-related stress was 3.9Â±1.6. COVID-related stress negatively affected subjective sleep quality (ÃŸ=0.3Â±0.1, p&lt;0.01), latency (ÃŸ=0.4Â±0.1, p&lt;0.001) and sleep disturbances (ÃŸ=0.5Â±0.2, p=0.003). Increased PSS negatively affected sleep duration (ÃŸ=0.09Â±0.2, p&lt;0.001), efficiency (ÃŸ=0.08Â±0.02, p&lt;0.001), and daytime dysfunction (ÃŸ=0.08Â±0.03, p=0.01). Conclusions: Our results suggest that stress related to the current COVID-19 pandemic is uniquely affecting maternal sleep health during pregnancy.

"Prenatal Stress and the Microbiome in the Time of COVID- A Prospective Cohort Study","Background: Given the emerging importance of the role of the gut microbiota-brain-axis in mediating prenatal stress-induced neurodevelopmental outcomes, a prospective cohort study was conducted. The COVID-19 Pandemic occurred halfway through study recruitment (n=35). The study aims to a) evaluate perceived stress across gestation, b) determine whether maternal microbiome composition changes with stress, and c) discern the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal stress, psychometric scores, and alterations in the microbiome. Methods: This longitudinal study design includes five time points across pregnancy and the post-partum period, at which biological samples were collected and psychometrics administered. Samples include maternal rectal and vaginal swabs. Psychometrics include measures of perceived stress, anxiety, depression, sleep, diet, and childhood adversity. Study participants identify as 62.9% White and 31.4% Black or African American. Finally, PacBio full-length 16S rRNA sequencing using SMRT Cell technology is used to identify the maternal rectal and vaginal microbial communities. Results: Participants delivering during the pandemic reporting greater perceived stress (p=0.05). Of note, there were no significant differences in anxiety or depressive symptoms across gestation in the pre-pandemic participants as compared to participants during the pandemic. During the second trimester, increased depression associated with increased rectal alpha diversity, and increased perceived stress was associated with increased levels of Prevotella, Sneathia, and Gardnerella in the rectal samples. In contrast, participants with increased depressive symptoms during the third trimester had reduced vaginal alpha diversity measures at delivery.

"Effort-Related Motivational Effects of Novel Atypical Dopamine Transport Inhibitors: Implications for Psychopathology","Background: People with depression, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, schizophrenia, and other psychiatric disorders suffer from fatigue, avolition, anergia, and other motivational dysfunctions, which can be highly treatment resistant. Animal tasks have been developed to measure effort-related choice, offering the option of high effort actions leading to more valued reinforcers vs. low effort/low reward activities. Such tasks are useful for preclinical studies related to drug development. Methods: A low effort bias can be induced in male and female rats by injection of the vesicular monoamine transport (VMAT-2) inhibitor tetrabenazine (TBZ), which induces depressive symptoms in people. Suppression of lever pressing is also induced by injections of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which provide an inflammatory challenge. These deficits can be reversed by drugs that are known dopamine transport (DAT) inhibitors, including lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and GBR-12909. Because many drugs that block DAT act as major stimulants and produce undesirable side effects, there is a need to develop and characterize novel atypical DAT inhibitors with unique neurochemical profiles. Results: Recent studies have shown that novel atypical DAT inhibitors, including modafinil analogs, also can reverse motivational dysfunctions induced by TBZ and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increase selection of high-effort activities involving physical effort. These compounds include modafinil, CE-123, CE-158, CT-005404, and others. Drugs that stimulate serotonin transmission are not effective in this regard. Conclusions: It is possible that this research will identify new avenues for drug treatment of effort-related motivational symptoms in humans, such as fatigue, avolition, anergia, and COVID-related fatigue.

"Benefits and Challenges of Telepsychiatry Services in SouthEast Asian Nations during the COVID-19 Era: An Integrative Review","COVID-19's long-term consequences on people's mental health include social isolation, job insecurity, illness and sorrow, physical separation, and disrupted access to normal health and mental treatment. Until recently, telepsychiatry has become increasingly mainstream in the delivery of mental health services under COVID-19 and have grown significantly in Western nations. However, telepsychiatry is not generally provided in Asian countries, particularly that of SouthEast countries. In this study, the reviewer made an integrative review of the available literature, in examining the benefits and challenges of telepsychiatry services of SouthEast Asian countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. This review utilized electronic resources such as PubMED, Google Scholar, Taylor and Francis, SAGE, IEEE, Springer, ScienceDirect, Wiley, and ACM. The review covered publications published from December 1, 2019, to December 1, 2021, as well as articles published in English and translated into English. Two (2) articles were included in this review. All the papers studied are classified as having a level of evidence VI. Both publications were based on research done in the Philippines. The total sample size for all papers analyzed was 149 respondents. The telepsychiatry platforms or systems employed in investigations vary. There was no continuous usage of a single telepsychiatry platform. Each research employed a different telepsychiatry service or system, depending on the technology available in the nation where the study was done. Findings in this review show that the concept or notion of telepsychiatry services within SouthEast Asian countries is exceptionally novel and needs further research in the medical and allied health discipline. For countries that are part of the SouthEast Asia, the critical issue today is how to sustain progress and how to increase and maintain care standards, at the same time utilizing telepsychiatry services in this aspect. Contribution to the paper What is already known about the topic? 1.Telepsychiatry is not a new approach in medical and allied health care. 2.There is evidence that shows the relationship between telepsychiatry and telemental services in Western nations and European countries. What this paper adds 1.There is little to no evidence of telepsychiatry services in SouthEast Asian countries in relation to its benefits and challenges. 2.The establishment of the relationship between telepsychiatry services is not yet clearly manifested in the medical and allied health discipline.","Narvaez, Roison Andro","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2022.103114","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Asian Journal of Psychiatry;: 103114, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29887,""
"Nagorno-Karabakh conflict: Mental health repercussions and challenges in Azerbaijan","The Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has made many Azerbaijanis internally displaced (IDP), missing, wounded, disabled, or killed. The war and its aftermath have drastically impacted the mental health of these populations, leading to depression, anxiety, and stress-related psychosomatic illnesses such as dissociative disorder. However, their access to medical and psychological services is limited. Intervention in terms of policy making, healthcare services, information systems, and social support is required to promoting social integration and facilitate accessibility to mental healthcare. National and international organisations, foreign aids, and media support can contribute to this end. The psychological effects of the war on children, healthcare shortage associated with COVID-19, accommodation and welfare problems, limited access to vaccination, technology, and educational opportunities, dangerous explosive remnants, as well as isolation and marginalisation of the IDPs can all be challenges facing the mental health of these populations. Organising programs such as support groups to share wartime experience, resilience promotion, psychosocial support for healthcare providers, religious identification, integral COVID-19 management, beside accommodation and education support are recommended to enhance the condition of these Azerbaijani populations.","shoib, Sheikh, Arif, Nigar, Nahidi, Mahsa, Rumiyya, Karimova, Swed, Sarya, Yushaâ€™u Armiyaâ€™u, Aishatu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2022.103095","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Asian Journal of Psychiatry;: 103095, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29888,""

"Antidepressant Drug Discovery and Development: Mechanism and Drug Design Based on Small Molecules","Depression is one of the most prevalent mental diseases and a primary cause of disability worldwide with high incidence and high recurrence. The current deterioration of the COVID-19 epidemic also pushes up the incidence of depression. Nevertheless, the currently available treatments remain inadequate response and limited efficacy. Therefore, discoveries of more potent and safer antidepressant drugs are urgently needed. In this review, the current potential physiological and pathological mechanisms of depression, and the clinical research progresses of candidate drugs as well as the recent advances in small-molecule drug discovery for potential treatments of depression are systematically summarized. More importantly, the structureâ€“activity relationships of compounds from different classes, the statistical analysis of the blood-brain barrier permeability, the pharmacological targets, and the in vivo models are comprehensively discussed.

"COVID-19 and access to sexual and reproductive healthcare for young people","[...]the incidence of COVID-19 is lower in children than adults,1 and the prevalence of severe disease is lower among children than adults.2-4 Furthermore, medium-term sequelae (four months) have proven rare among children who recover from COVID-19,5 and their case fatality rate is also lower than that of adults.4 The World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescents as individuals aged between 10 and 19 years;however, research often focuses on young people, defined as people under the age of 25 years.6 SRH covers services that promote sexual wellbeing and reproductive health, and prevent and treat sexually transmissible infections (STIs) and blood-borne viruses (BBVs). Adolescence and young adulthood are risky times for the development of mental health problems, with most disorders commencing during this time;however, diagnosis may occur later if healthcare access is limited.12 Young people are often reluctant to seek help, particularly if services are not specifically designed for young people.13 Young people with poor mental health have higher rates of physical health problems, including those related to SRH.12 This makes access to appropriate, high-quality mental healthcare for young people critical for maintaining their SRH. Results Sexual and reproductive wellbeing of young people during the COVID-19 pandemic In an Australian survey during lockdown (66.3% respondents aged 18-29 years), the frequency of sex with a partner varied depending on cohabitation, with the survey suggesting fewer casual partners and less group sex, while use of sex toys and masturbation increased.15 Some women also reported delaying childbearing because of the pandemic.16 Surveys from China reported reduced frequency of sex,17 reduced number of partners,17 increased relationship dissatisfaction18 and increased use of pornography.18 This is likely due to lockdown conditions and the high number of young people who live with their parents.17'18 A US survey of sexual minority males aged 14-17 years mirrored this finding, with online sexting and messaging becoming more common.19 This contrasted with data from African nations, where pockets of increased sexual activity20 led to increases in teenage pregnancy.21 School closures have been implicated with less visibility of children and increased potential for abuse from family and neighbours.21 One article highlighted the potential longer-term reduction in sexual wellbeing, with young people having reduced 'normative experiences' due to lockdown and increased parental scrutiny.22 The authors suggested increasing focus on young people in post-lockdown periods to ensure their sexual wellbeing.22 Access to sexual and reproductive healthcare during COVID-19 In Australia and internationally, SRH - including access to contraception and abortion services, STI screening and treatment, and HIV care - is recognised as an essential service during the COVID-19 pandemic.23-25 Despite this recognition, a rapid survey of 64 nations found services were scaled back across all nations and 5633 SRH clinics closed;26 2 7 00 young people from Africa reported reductions in access to SRH services due to clinic closures and fear of contracting COVID-19.20 As a result, contraception, HIV care, abortion services and comprehensive sexuality education (including menstrual education)20 for youth have been affected.26 A semi-rural area in the UK saw no people aged under 18 years access emergency contraception for six weeks, and there was a fall in accessing other sexual health services, especially for those aged under 18 years.27 This may be appropriate (eg a result of reduced intimacy18'22'27) or inappropriate (eg a consequence of disruption to public transport).28 The review also highlighted that young people may feel judged if they have broken lockdown restrictions and then need SRH.27 Few articles were focused on SRH within a generalist setting, such as general practice, so issues such as opportunistic preventive healthcare, cervical screening and general healthcare were not discussed. In the setting of SRH, telehealth can be used for contraception,10'25'29-33 STI screening,27'34 syndromic management of STIs28'33 and medical abortion.17'23'24'27'30'32'35 However, challenges to providing SRH via telehealth included: * maintaining confidentiality and privacy;especially for young people in crowded housing during lockdown conditions22,27 * providing culturally appropriate care22 * examining sensitive body parts33 * institutional support to implement telehealth, including appropriate funding and access to technology.33 Telehealth is also more difficult for those without access to a device and for individuals with poor internet access.22'31'33 Suggestions for overcoming these barriers are outlined in Table 1.","Sturgiss, Elizabeth, Dut, Garang M.; Matenge, Sethunya, Desborough, Jane, Dykgraaf, Sally Hall, Mazza, Danielle, Kidd, Michael","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+and+access+to+sexual+and+reproductive+healthcare+for+young+people","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Australian Journal of General Practice; 51(4):271-277, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29892,""

"A Cross Sectional Study of Psychological Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic Among Healthcare Workers","Introduction: January 31, 2020, WHO declared the COVID-19 crisis as a â€œPublic Health Emergency of International Concern.â€ Continuous surge in the number of confirmed cases throughout the world led to a sharp decline in the global health, economic development, and also affected social stability because of requirement of strict quarantine measures. As the cases increased around the globe and also in the country it started creating a psychological impact on healthcare workers. Material and Methods: This was a cross sectional study with sample size 222, which was conducted for the duration of 1 year among healthcare workers (consultant doctors, PG resident doctors, intern doctors, nursing staff, technicians) across Maharashtra through Google Forms and manually through direct contacts. Forms were circulated through digital medium and various social media platforms. Forms consisted of general demographic data along with semi-structured proforma to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak on healthcare workers using Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: Total 222 participants which comprised of 54% Consultant Doctors, 30% Resident doctors, 8% interns, 6% nursing staff and 2% technicians were included in the study.

"Psychotic Disorders and Structural Racism: On Considering Complexity","In a policy statement issued in October 2020, the American Public Health Association officially declared that structural racism is a public health crisis, and in April 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention followed suit in declaring racism a ""serious public health threat. STRUCTURAL RACISM AND MENTAL HEALTH Nowhere is the impact of structural racism more directly relevant than in considering mental health problems, which are filtered directly through the cultural lens of society in ways that can exacerbate its effects. Because they are so highly stigmatized, psychotic disorders are particularly sensitive to ""racial and political currents"" that underlie the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of these conditions.4 In this issue of AJPH, Misra et al. In my clinical experience, I have witnessed my Black patients who were hospitalized for stabilization during a mental health crisis removed from their second-generation antipsychotic medications and switched to high doses of haloperidol, a firstgeneration antipsychotic medication that was specifically associated (via print advertisements from pharmaceutical companies to prescribers) with images of aggressive and hostile Black men in the 1 960s.5,6 I have directly observed psychiatrists and other mental health providers misinterpret adaptive suspicious behaviors and symptoms of distress in Black patients as paranoid delusions, leading to misdiagnoses of psychotic illness. The structural level of discrimination within the health care system has effectively penetrated all other levels, including institutions (such as the institution of psychiatry) and individuals.5 The history ofthe reconceptualization of schizophrenia from a psychotic illness affecting docile White women who did not meet gendered, patriarchal expectations for their roles in society to an illness centrally defined as one in which Black men were hostile, aggressive, and ""delusional"" for seeking to assert their civil rights and rejecting notions of White superiority is well documented.5 However, one cannot overstate the impact that this reconceptualization, codified into various editions ofthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,11 has had on the modern conceptualization of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. [...]the bias that clinicians bring to their assessment, including misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis, is the foundation for inequities through racialized perceptions ofthe very definitions of what psychosis is and how it presents in different populations.","Shim, Ruth S.

"Federal Policymakers Should Urgently and Greatly Expand Naloxone Access","Since March 2020, the US federal government has invested tremendous public health effort in COVID-19 responses by expediting the availability of vaccines and have therapeutics. Reduced access to addiction treatment and services combined with fentanyl infiltrating drug supplies resulted in an estimated 100000 fatal overdoses in 2020 alone.1 Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention iCDC;has released official health advisories2 and the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has supported widespread implementation of expanded distribution and use of naloxone in high-risk populations, there is not enou ugh naloxone in the hands of those who need it most. The opioid overdose crisis continues to ravage communities;thus, we call for federal policymakers within the US Department of Health and Human Services or the FDA to facilitate OTC approval of at least one formulation of naloxone, with or without manufacturer request or approval. State legislatures that implemented coprescribing mandates have seen substantial increases in naloxone prescribing, engagement of a larger and more diverse set of prescribers, expanded geographic reach, and reductions in opioid-related harm.18-20 In 2018, a panel of experts at the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee narrowly voted against a coprescribing mandate, citing concerns for potential risks of drug shortages, diverting naloxone from community programs, rise in health care costs, institutional racism benefiting insured patients, and threats to provider autonomy in identifying patient risk.21 Instead, this committee recommended changing opioid prescription labels to encourage coprescription, which was released as an FDA mandate in July 2020 to opioid drug manufacturers.22 Although it remains unclear if these label changes were widely implemented, they serve as a mere nudge for providers to have discussions with their patients about the importance of naloxone, whereas mandatory coprescribing will facilitate increased distribution ofthis lifesaving medication.","Jawa, Raagini M.

"Different Paths and Potentials to Harm Reduction in Different Welfare States: Drug Consumption Rooms in the United Kingdom, Denmark, and France","The harm reduction approach entered British national policy after the Thatcher government-which was no friend of the welfare state-accepted the 1988 recommendation of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which asserted that preventing HIV transmission was more important than insisting that people stop using heroin.16 Rates of HIV and hepatitis C among people who inject drugs are still much lower in the United Kingdom than in the United States. Since the 1990s, support for harm reduction in UK policy and funding has waxed and waned. Cuts to treatment budgets, recommissioning of treatment services, and a push for people to leave treatment drug-free were followed byannual increases in drug-related deaths starting in 2013 and a decrease in the number of people in treatment.20 The most recent UK government drug strategy (published in December 2021) makes little direct mention of harm reduction but does include it in the wide range of services in which GBP780 million of new funding is to be invested from 2022 to 2025 in England.21 The UK government is also reviving punitive rhetoric alongside its new investment in treatment services, blaming drug users rather than blanket prohibition for the harms of organized crime and ruling out DCRs on spurious legal grounds.22 It was left to an activist with a lived experience of problematic drug use to set up the first overdose prevention service in the United Kingdom, which they did in a secondhand vehicle on the streets of Glasgow in 2020-2021. Graduated goals meant that treatment ""should not only aim to 'heal' addiction, but to provide rehabilitating measures while drug abuse continues""28(p132) and should include basic improvement of physical health and improvement of the situation of those who use drugs, including through abstinence. Danish drug policy as It was developed during the 1960s and 1970s was based on the Ideas that criminal sanctions should reduce the supply of drugs and that social welfare measures should reduce the demand for drugs.29 This meant that possession of Illicit drugs for personal use was depenalized from 1969 to 2004.","Jauffret-Roustide, Marie PhD, Houborg, Esben PhD, Southwell, Matthew B.

"The Crucial Role of Black, Latinx, and Indigenous Leadership in Harm Reduction and Addiction Treatment","In 2020, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, Black Americans and Native Americans died of substance overdoses at higher rates than White Americans, and Latinx overdose deaths increased at record rates.1,2 These deaths were closely linked to inequalities in employment, housing conditions, targeted law enforcement, and disproportionate exposure to unregulated illicit drug supplies3-5-making overdose prevention an urgent racial justice issue. In keeping with Chandra Ford's application of critical race theory to public health,6 we illustrate the unique contributions of Black and Latinx practitioners who (1) center the perspectives of racialized groups to inform harm reduction and substance use disorders (SUD) treatment initiatives;(2) use personal, experiential knowledge to relate and build trust with service users;and (3) inform research and practice with their own lived experiences as part of racialized populations.

"Lessons for the Opioid Crisis-Integrating Social Determinants of Health Into Clinical Care","Overdose deaths accelerated with the emergence of COVID-19, and this acceleration was fastest among Black, Latinx, and Native Americans, whose overdose rates had already increased before COVID-19.1,2 COVID-19 led to limits on access to medications for opioid use disorder and harm-reduction services, exacerbating low treatment and retention rates,3-5 in the face of toxic drug supplies laced with high-potency synthetic opioids.6 Disproportionate deaths from substance use disorders (SUDs) and from COVID-19 among low-income people marginalized by race, ethnicity, and migrant status have similar upstream causes of exposure, including unstable and crowded housing, high-risk employment or unemployment, and high levels of policing and incarceration, combined with low levels of access to health care and preventive measures. Punitive drug law enforcement discourages help seeking and treatment and leads to unstable drug supplies that are contaminated with fentanyl and other high-potency synthetic opioids that heighten overdose risk.10 Incarcerated people are at an elevated risk of drug overdose in the weeks following release,11 and communities with high incarceration rates have higher mortality.12 Drug courts disproportionately cite low-income people of color for infractions, leading to imprisonment rather than treatment.13 Economic precarity and unstable housing disrupt the social networks that sustain health and prevent overdose.14 Urban planners often displace residents of Black and Latinx neighborhoods, leaving them exposed to narcotic trade and HIV.15 The child welfare system disproportionately removes low-income Black, Latinx, and Indigenous children from families affected by SUDs, and children raised in foster care are at high risk for SUDs.16,17 Therefore, reducing SUD-related deaths and disability requires the redress of discriminatory public policies. Studies of integration of buprenorphine maintenance with organized healing sessions, fishing, hunting, and community gardening in Canadian First Nations communities have shown high rates oftreatment retention (74%) at 18 months,22 and healing sessions combined with buprenorphine have had high levels oftreatment participation, community-level reductions in criminal charges and child protection measures, increased school attendance, and increased flu vaccination.23 Faith-Based Organizations as Partners Imani Breakthrough is a culturally informed approach based on a partnership of Yale University Department of Psychiatry clinicians with Black and Latinx churches. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians can use their symbolic capital to advocate policies that address SDOH and collaborate with community organizations and nonhealth sectors to identify and act on institutional barriers to their patients' health, such as through a structural competency approach.25 Health systems must engage communities, destigmatize SUD, and link to social services with locally controlled, adaptable funds akin to the Ryan White CARE Act to build community-based infrastructure: accessible, trusted services including in cultural, faith-based, and harm-reduction organizations as well as local businesses such as pharmacies.","Hansen, Helena M.

"Beyond #StopAAPIHate: Expanding the Definition of Violence Against Asian Americans","A woman in Brooklyn, NY, suffered chemical burns after acid was poured on her while she took out the trash.1 An adolescent boy was sent to the emergency room after being attacked by bullies at a high school in San Fernando Valley, California.2 Six women were murdered by a gunman at their place of work in Atlanta, GA.3 These are just three examples out of more than 9000 anti-Asian hate incidences documented since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.4 Since 2020, the United States has seen an immense rise in anti-Asian violence. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, hate incidents could spread COVID-19 through close contact, further exacerbate mental health issues, and add additional burden to already strained health care systems. Systemic violence can include poverty and unemployment-Asian American women have had some the highest joblessness rates during the COVID-19 pandemic.7 It can include the US health care system, which bars permanent residents from Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program eligibility until they've held a green card for five years.8 SLOW VIOLENCE ""Slow violence"" is a term coined to describe the often unnoticed, slowmoving impacts of environmental pollution and racism.9 It can include disparities in the built environment, such as highways that have notoriously been purposefully built in low-income areas, crossing through Chinatowns across the country.10,11 It can include the effects of climate change, such as the fact that nearly all of those who died in New York City's basement flooding because of Hurricane Ida were Asian residents.12 STATE VIOLENCE State violence includes police violence, which targets Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.

"Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Autologous Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Chronic Low Back Pain Due to Severe Lumbar Spinal Degeneration: A 12-Month, Open-Label, Prospective Controlled Trial","Background: Regenerative medicine interventions are applied to assist in the repair, and to potentially replace or restore damaged tissue through the use of autologous/allogenic biologics and it continues to expand. The anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and regenerative properties of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), and investigation into their therapeutic efficacy and safety in patients with severe chronic low back pain, have not been demonstrated in controlled studies. Multiple pain generators have been hypothesized to be responsible in severe spinal degeneration and it is difficult to identify a single pain generator;consequently, resulting in inadequate therapeutic results. Objectives: The study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of autologous bone marrow MSCs in the treatment of chronic low back pain due to severe lumbar spinal degeneration with involvement of multiple structures. Study Design: Prospective, open-label, nonrandomized, parallel-controlled, 2-arm exploratory study. Setting: A private, specialized, interventional pain management and regenerative medicine clinic. Methods: The treatment group patients received a one-time bone marrow concentrate injection into spinal structures (i.e., discs, facets, spinal nerves, and sacroiliac joints), along with conventional treatment, whereas, the control group received conventional treatment with nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs, over-the-counter drugs, structured exercise programs, physical therapy, spinal injections and opioids, etc., as indicated. Outcomes Assessment: Outcomes were assessed utilizing multiple instruments, including the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11), EuroQOL 5-Dimensional Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L), Global Mental Health (GMH), and Global Physical Health (GPH). Multiple outcomes were assessed with primary outcomes being minimal clinically important differences (MCID) in ODI scores between the groups and/or a 2-point reduction in pain scores. In the study group, total nucleated cells, colony forming units-fibroblast, CD34-positive cell numbers and platelets were also recorded, along with post-procedure magnetic resonance imaging changes. Outcomes were assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Results: Significant improvement was achieved in functional status measured by ODI, pain relief measured by NRS-11, and other parameters measured by EQ-5D-3L, GMH, and GPH, in the study group relative to the control group at all time periods. The results showed significant improvements at 12-month follow-up with 67% of the patients in the study group achieving MCID utilizing ODI when compared to 8% in the control group. Greater than 2-point pain reduction was seen in 74% of the patients at 3 months, 66% of the patients at 6 months, and 56% of the patients at 12 months. Both MCID and pain relief of 2 points were significantly different compared to the control group. Opioid use decreased in the investigational group, whereas, there was a slight increase in the control group. Age, gender, opioid use, and body mass index did not affect the outcomes in the stem cell group. Limitations: Single center, nonrandomized study. Conclusions: The first available controlled study utilizing BM-MSCs in severe degenerative spinal disease with interventions into multiple structures simultaneously, including disc, facet joints, nerve roots, and sacroiliac joint based on symptomatology, showed promising results.","Atluri, S.; Murphy, M.

"An analytical insight of discussions and sentiments of Indians on Omicron-driven third wave of COVID-19 using twitter data (preprint)","Microblogging has become one of the most crucial tool for expressing and sharing the opinions and views of everyday life events. Digital channels are being used to monitor public health issues on the Internet. Twitter is a very popular source that provides tweets related to the sentiment of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many researchers have used tweets to monitor the opinion of the people towards the coronavirus vaccine, mental health problems, treatment received by the doctors, impact of lockdown, etc. However, these works were mostly limited to the first and second waves of the pandemic. In this work, we aim to study the impact of the third wave of the pandemic, which started in December 2021 in India. We accomplished this by collecting tweet data set of two months, i.e., December 2021 and January 2022, discussing COVID-19 and having country code as ``IN"". We employed the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique for topic modeling and labeled each tweet message with the topic words that best describe it. We also utilized sentiment labels for each tweet and analyzed the distribution of different topics across different sentiment labels. This helped us to analyze the perspectives and sentiments of the people with respect to different topic discussions. Our analysis discovered that the two most discussed topics were ``precautionary measures"" like get well soon, stay safe, wear mask, etc., and ``vaccine"" where people have discussed about its effectiveness and vaccination drive in India. We found that people mostly had neutral sentiments for the former topic while for the latter, overall sentiment polarity was negative, reflecting peoples' mistrust in the COVID-19 vaccine.","Vatsa, Deepika Vatsa Deepika, Yadav, Ashima Yadav Ashima","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1508291/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29909,""

This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on perceived stress and eating behaviors of the UWI, Cave Hill Campus students. Methods: An online survey questionnaire between June and July 2021 screened for COVID-19 vaccination status and intent, eating behavior and, anxiety and depression. Salzburg Stress Eating Scale, SCOFF and PHQ-4 questionnaires identified factors associated with eating behavior and eating disorders (EDs). Findings: Respondentsâ€™ mean age was 26 years;81.4% were female. Vaccine acceptance was 63.6%, and 42.9% had received the first dose. Relatively high proportions of students screened positive on the PHQ-4 for anxiety (46%) (95%CI: 42%-51%) and depression (43%) (95%CI: 39%-47%);22% (95%CI: 17%-25%) had scores suggestive of severe anxiety. 16.2% (95%CI 13.0-19.4%) screened positive for EDs (SCOFF score = 2);positive screen for eating disorder was more likely positive in obese (36%) vs underweight (15%) students (p&lt;0.0001). In bivariate analyses, eating behavior was positively associated with BMI, programme of study, anxiety, depression, and PHQ-4 score (p&lt;0.05). In multivariable regression analysis, BMI, anxiety, and depression remained significantly associated with eating behavior (p&lt;0.001) and positive screen for eating disorders (p=0.001). Interpretation: A high proportion of students screened positive for anxiety and depression. Prevalence of problematic eating behaviors reflects previously reported trends in the Caribbean, possibly accelerated during the pandemic. Universities should support student health utilizing research data to inform medical services and counselling.","Singh, Keerti, Sobers, Natasha, Campbell, Michael H.; Mansingh, Akshai, Maynard, Donna-Maria, Devonish, Dwayne, Garner-Oâ€™Neale, Leah, Foster, Nicole, Akombo, David, Adams, Peter, Azim Majumder, Md Anwarul","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+COVID-19+Pandemic+on+Perceived+Stress+and+Eating+Behaviors+of+Undergraduate+and+Postgraduate+Students+of+the+UWI,+Cave+Hill+Campus,+Barbados+a+Cross-Sectional+Study+(preprint);+Eating+behaviors+|+Eating+disorders+|+Vaccine+acceptance+|+Perceived+Stress+|+Stress+and+Anxiety+|+University+students+|+Lockdown+|+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29910,""
"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on physical activity and psychological characteristics of the Iranian people (preprint)","Background:  The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on physical activity behaviours, as well as on mental health indicators among Iranian people. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 335 participants were included (155 males, mean age = 30.06 Â± 14.58 years). The eligibility criteria for this study were as follows;1- Having at least 10 years of age. 2- Having a minimum literacy rate 3- Ability to work with networks of smart communication devices such as smartphones and computers 4- Living in Iran for the past 5 years. Participants were selected through the convenience sampling and filled out an online questionnaire measuring physical activity behaviours (The International Physical Activity Questionnaire;IPAQ;Short Form) and two mental health indicators â€“ self-esteem (Rosenberg self-esteem scale) and social physical anxiety ( 7 - items social physique anxiety scale ). Results The results of Wilcoxon test showed that participants reported significant differences from before to during the pandemic in all three variables of physical activity (significant decreases), self-esteem (significant decreases), and social physical anxiety (significant increases). This difference was found, regardless of participantsâ€™ gender. The results of Spearman correlation test between changes in physical activity and changes in mental health indicators showed that COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted self-esteem and social physical anxiety. However, we have not found any significant association of physical activityâ€™s change with social physical anxiety or self-esteemâ€™s changes before and during the pandemic. Conclusions In sum, the findings of the present study indicate a detrimental effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical activity and mental health among Iranianâ€™s people. Public policies aiming to buffer the negative impact on COVID-19 Iraniansâ€™ health are urgently needed.","Saemi, Esmaeel, Nobari, Hadi, Badicu, Georgian, Ghazizadeh, Habibollah, Pashabadi, Ali, Imani, Fatemeh, Clemente, Filipe Manuel, Silva, Ana Filipa, Afrash, Sana","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1192981/v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29911,""
"Internet and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from the UK (preprint)","With the COVID-19 pandemic, the Internet has become a key player in the daily lives of most people. We investigate the relationship between mental health and internet use frequency and purpose six months after the first lockdown in the UK, September 2020. Using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study on the 12-item General Health Questionnaire and the Internet use module, and controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and personality traits, we find that older individuals (aged 59 or above) have a lower internet use frequency (twice a day or less). Younger women use the Internet for social purposes more than men do, while younger men use the Internet for leisure-and-learning purposes more than women and older men do. Both high frequency internet use and use for social purposes appear to be a protective factor for social dysfunction. Interestingly, high internet use is a protective factor for social dysfunction among younger women, but a risk factor for psychological distress among younger men. Finally, while leisure-and-learning purpose is a protective factor for social dysfunction among younger women, it is a risk factor for social dysfunction among younger men.","Quintana-Domeque, Climent, Zeng, Jingya, Zhang, Xiaohui","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.01.22273299","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29912,""
"Machine learning techniques for predicting depression and anxiety in pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional regional study (preprint)","Background:  Maternal depression and anxiety are significant public health concerns that play an important role in the health and well-being of mothers and children. The COVID-19 pandemic, the consequential lockdowns and related safety restrictions worldwide negatively affected the mental health of pregnant and postpartum women. Methods: : This regional study aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model for the prediction of maternal depression and anxiety. The study used a dataset collected from five Arab countries during the COVID-19 pandemic between July to December 2020. The population sample included 3569 women (1939 pregnant and 1630 postpartum) from five countries (Jordan, Palestine, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain). The performance of seven machine learning algorithms was assessed for the prediction of depression and anxiety symptoms. Results:  The Gradient Boosting (GB) and Random Forest (RF) models outperformed other studied ML algorithms with accuracy values of 83.3% and 83.2% for depression, respectively, and values of 82.9% and 81.3% for anxiety, respectively. The Mathewâ€™s Correlation Coefficient was evaluated for the ML models;the NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB) and GB models presented the highest performance measures (0.63 and 0.59) for depression and (0.74 and 0.73) for anxiety, respectively. The featuresâ€™ importance ranking was evaluated, the results showed that stress during pregnancy, family support, financial issues, income, and social support were the most significant values in predicting anxiety and depression. Conclusion:  Overall, the study evidenced the power of ML models in predicting maternal depression and anxiety and proved to be an efficient tool for identifying and predicting the associated risk factors that influence maternal mental health. The deployment of machine learning models for screening and early detection of depression and anxiety among pregnant and postpartum women might facilitate the development of health prevention and intervention programs that will enhance maternal and child health in low- and middle-income countries.","Qasrawi, Radwan, Amro, Malak, VicunaPolo, Stephanny, Abu Al-Halawa, Diala, Agha, Hazem, Abu Seir, Rania, Hoteit, Maha, Hoteit, Reem, Allehdan, Sabika, Behzad, Nouf, Bookari, Khlood, AlKhalaf, Majid, Al-Sabah, Haleemah, Badran, Eman, Tayyem, Reema","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.110090.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29913,""
"â€œCompared to COVID, HIV is nothingâ€: exploring how onshore international students in an Australian city navigate COVID-19 versus BBV/STI risk (preprint)","Background:  While a large body of evidence indicates changes in alcohol and other drug use among young people as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a lack of evidence around changes in sexual practices and how it may be impacting the potential spread of BBVs/STIs. Most of what we know about sex during COVID-19 lockdowns is largely based on solitary sexual practices, which may not answer the critical question around how the pandemic may be shaping BBVs/STIs risk practices among young people. Against this backdrop, this study explored how the COVID-19 pandemic may be shaping BBVs/STIs risk and protective practices among African and Asian international students in Sydney, Australia. Methods:  This phenomenological qualitative study involved a semi-structured telephone and face-to-face interviews with 16 international university students in Sydney, between September 2020â€“March 2021. Generated data were coded using NVivo and analysis was guided by reflexive thematic analysis. Results:  Participants reported elevated mental health distress because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some participants reported engaging in casual sexual hook-ups as a strategy to seek relief from the mental health distress they experienced. Some of those sexual hook-ups were condomless partly because COVID-related disruptions impacted condom accessibility during lockdowns. Also, the preventive practices of some participants who reported being sexually active during the lockdowns were focused on preventing COVID-19 neglecting BBVs/STIs. Conclusion:  This study indicates a need for comprehensive public health response to the evolving and near-endemic COVID-19 situation. Such comprehensive approach should focus on empowering young people to prevent both the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the sexual spread of BBVs/STIs.","Okeke, Sylvester Reuben","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1465507/v3","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29914,""
"COVID-19 IDD: Findings from a global survey exploring family membersâ€™ and paid staffâ€™s perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and their caregivers (preprint)","Background:  A growing body of evidence attests to the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) during the pandemic. This study asked caregivers about their perceptions of how COVID-19 impacted them and the people they support. Method:  An online survey was conducted in 12 countries during August-September 2020 and sought information on demographics, support practices, information and training, experiences of COVID-19, social distancing, and wellbeing, as measured by the DASS12. This study reports on 3,754 family members, direct support professionals, and managers who participated in the survey. Results: : Caregivers observed increases in depression/anxiety, stereotyped behaviours, aggression towards others and weight gain in the person(s) they supported. They also reported difficulties supporting the person(s) to access healthcare.Â  Families reported reducing or ceasing employment and absorbed additional costs when supporting their family member. Direct support professionals experienced changes in staff shifts, staff absences, increased workload and hiring of casual staff. Caregiversâ€™ wellbeing revealed high levels of stress, depression, and less so anxiety. The strongest predictor of wellbeing among families was observation of changes in mood in the person(s) they supported, while for direct support professionals, the strongest predictors of wellbeing were reorganisation of staff shifts and increases in new direct support staff.Â  Discussion:  Findings support the contention of this population experiencing a disproportionate burden during the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting historical inequities in access to healthcare and other human rights violations which are now protected under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.","Linehan, Christine, Birkbeck, Gail, Araten-Bergman, Tal, Baumbusch, Jennifer, Beadle-Brown, Julie, Bigby, Christine, Bradley, Valerie, Brown, Michael, Bredewold, Femmianne, Chirwa, Masauso, Cui, Jialiang, Godoy Gimenez, Marta, Gomeiro, Tiziano, Kanova, Å Ã¡rka, Kroll, Thilo, Li, Henan, MacLachlan, Mac, Narayan, Jayanthi, Nearchou, Finiki, Nolan, Adam, O'Donovan, Mary-Ann, Santos, Flavia, Å iÅ¡ka, Jan, Stainton, Tim, Tideman, Magnus, Tossebro, Jan","https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13497.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29915,""
"Clinical Factors Affecting Depression in Patients with Painful Temporomandibular Disorders during the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Aims: : Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a multifactorial condition associated with both physical and psychological factors. Stress has been known to trigger or worsens TMD. We aimed to investigate whether the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic aggravates depression in patients with painful TMD, and the factors that affect their level of depression. Method:  We included 112 patients with painful TMD (74 females, 38 males;mean age: 35.90Â±17.60 years;myalgia [n=38], arthralgia [n=43], mixed jointâ€“muscle TMD pain [n=31]). TMD was diagnosed based on the Diagnostic Criteria for TMD Axis I. Physical pain intensity was recorded using the visual analog scale (VAS);psycho-emotional status (depression: Beck Depression Inventory [BDI], anxiety: Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI], and generalized stress related to COVID19: Global Assessment of Recent Stress [GARS]) was investigated twice (before [BC] and after COVID-19 [AC]). Additionally, factors affecting BDI-AC were investigated. Results: : BDI (p&lt;0.001), BAI (p&lt;0.001), GARS (p&lt;0.001), and VAS (p&lt;0.01) scores were significantly increased at AC than BC. The depression, anxiety, and stress levels were significantly positively correlated, and the AC and BC values of each factor showed a high correlation. In the mixed TMD group, BDI-AC was positively correlated with VAS-AC (p&lt;0.001). In the multiple regression analysis, clenching habit was the strongest predictor of an increase in the BDI scores from moderate to severe, followed by psychological distress, muscle stiffness, female sex, BAI-AC, and TMJ sounds. Conclusion:  COVID-19 has negatively affected the psycho-emotional state of patients with painful TMD, and several clinical factors, including female sex and clenching habits, have influenced depression.","Lee, Yeon-Hee, Auh, Q.

"Care patterns and TCM constitution as factors of depression and anxiety in systemic scleroderma: a cross- sectional study during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background:  Care patterns and TCM constitution affects systemic scleroderma (SSc) patientsâ€™ emotion and health while the prevalence of covid-19 may aggravate this situation. Thus, we investigated depression and anxiety level in SSc patients during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify the correlation between care patterns, TCM constitution and patients' emotion. Methods: : This was a cross-sectional study. SSc patients and healthy individuals were surveyed through the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire and a modified care pattern questionnaire. Factors correlated with depression and anxiety were screened by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: : A total of 273 SSc patients and 111 healthy individuals were included. The median age was 45 years in both patient and healthy groups. 74.36% of SSc patients were in depression and 51.65% were in anxiety. 69.60% worked remotely and 50.92% experienced a decrease in income, which were both higher than in the healthy group (38.74%, 29.73%). The proportion of income reduction in the online group (56.19%) was higher than that in the hospital group (33.33%) (P = 0.001). 36.99% of SSc patients had disease progression during the pandemic. Yang-deficiency constitution (82.05%) was the TCM constitution characteristic of SSc patients, while Qi-deficiency(73.63%) and Blood-stasis constitution (57.14%) were also more common. TCM constitution of patients from different sources distributed roughly similar. Qi-deficiency (adjusted OR=2.250) and Qi-stagnation (adjusted OR= 3.824) constitution were significantly associated with depression. The major constitution of dampness-heat was associated with a decrease in depression (adjusted OR=0.160). Remote work during the outbreak (adjusted OR= 1.920), decreasing in income (adjusted OR=3.556), and disease progression (P=0.030) were associated with the occurrence of depression. Conclusion:  Chinese SSc patients have a high prevalence of depression and anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the care patterns of Chinese SSc patients in terms of work, income, and ways of getting medical support. Within the care patterns, work, income, disease and change of medications were correlates of depression or anxiety in SSc patients. Qi-stagnation and Qi-deficiency constitution were associated with depression, and Qi-stagnation constitution was associated with anxiety in SSc patients. Further research is needed.

This study investigates factors associated with depression and anxiety symptoms, and quality of life among Malaysiaâ€™s multi-ethnic urban lower-income communities. Methods This is a community-based house-to-house survey conducted from September to November 2020 at the Petaling district in Selangor, Malaysia. Five hundred and four households were identified using random sampling, and heads of eligible households were recruited. Inclusion criteria were age = 18 years with monthly household income =RM6960 (estimated USD 1600) without acute psychiatric illness. The PHQ-9, GAD-7 and EQ-5D were used for depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Multivariable logistic regression was performed for the final analysis. Results A total of 432 (85.7%) respondents with a mean age of 43.1 years completed the survey. Mild to severe depression was detected in 29.6%, mild to severe anxiety in 14.7%, and problematic quality of life in 27.8% of respondents. Factors associated with mild to severe depression were younger age, chronic health conditions, past stressful events, lack of communication gadgets and lack of assets or commercial property. While respiratory diseases, marital status, workplace issues, financial constraints, absence of investments, substance use and lack of rental income were associated with mild to severe anxiety. Not attributing poverty to structural issues, help-seeking from professionals, and self-stigma were barriers, while resiliency facilitated good psychological health. Problematic quality of life was associated with depression, older age, unemployment, cash shortage, hypertension, diabetes, stressful life events and low health literacy. Conclusions A higher proportion had reported mild to severe anxiety and depression symptoms in the sampled urban poor population than previous pre-pandemic reports. The psychosocial determinants should inform policy and direct future research within this underserved population.","Fui, W. M.; Majid, H. A.; Ismail, R.; Su, T. T.; Pin, T. M.; Said, M.

"Decreased psychiatric symptomatology after the onset of COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal college mental health study from Turkey (preprint)","Objective:  COVID-19 pandemic brought significant challenges for college students. This study aimed to investigate changes in psychiatric symptomatology among them compared to the pre-pandemic period alongside their determinants. Methods: : Data were collected before and three months after the onset of the pandemic from 168 students who had applied to a college mental health center. Psychiatric symptomatology was assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale (ASRS). Possible vulnerability factors were screened by a survey on COVID-19-related health and social isolation status, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Social Media Use Disorder Scale (SMDS), Distress Thermometer, Scoff Eating Questionnaire, and International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short-Form (IPAQ). Results: : PHQ-9, GAD-7 and ASRS scores significantly declined in the follow up. Even though the screen time increased, SMDS scores significantly declined. SMDS had a direct effect on PHQ-9 and ASRS levels, in addition to an indirect effect through Stress Thermometer. Higher SMDS scores predicted higher anxious and depressive symptomatology in repeated assessments. Fear of COVID-19 scores had a direct effect on GAD-7 scores only. Conclusion:  This study suggested that stress level and psychiatric symptomatology of the students decreased significantly in the early phases of the pandemic. Level of social media use disorder should be taken into account while following college students with mental health symptoms.","Dogan, Asli Ercan, Kebapci, Dilek, Ertan, Oguz, Kalay, Zeynepgul, Caki, Nurdan Kozan, Sar, Vedat, Eser, Hale Yapici","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1513531/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29920,""

An aggravation in mental health have been suggested in several studies, but the impact on self-injury, suicidality and eating disorders (EDs) are less elucidated. Using two different data setups i.e. longitudinal and repeated cross-sectional data, we compare self-reported self-injury, suicide ideation and -attempt and symptoms of EDs from before through different pandemic periods until spring 2021. The longitudinal data indicate a slight reduction in the proportion of self-injury and suicide ideation in both women and men, as well as symptoms of EDs in women. For suicide attempt no change was observed. In the repeated cross-sectional data, we observed no changes in self-injury, suicide ideation- and attempts or symptoms of EDs.

"Perceived stress, competitive state anxiety, depression andÂ sleep quality in Chinese athletes During theÂ COVID-19Â Pandemic (preprint)","Background:  The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide, and its associated stressors have resulted in decreased sleep quality among athletes. This study aimed to test the correlation between perceived stress and sleep quality and to figure out whether competitive state anxiety and depression mediate this association. Methods: : The Perceived Stress Scale, Self-rating Depression Scale, CSA Inventory-2, and Pittsburgh SQ Index were administered in 590 Chinese athletes (275 females, age = 19.93 + 2.90 years). Mediation analyses were used to investigate whether competitive state anxiety and depression mediate the correlation between perceived stress and sleep quality in athletes. Results: : The results indicated that perceived stress was positively related to poor sleep quality ( r = 0.232, p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, competitive state anxiety (ab = 0.0347, Boot SE =0.0179, Boot 95% CI = [0.0252, 0.1091]) and depression (ab = 0.0235, Boot SE = 0.0120, Boot 95% CI = [0.0032, 0.0502]) mediated the correlation between perceived stress and sleep quality in athletes.

"An economic incentive package to support the wellbeing of caregivers of adolescents living with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa: a feasibility study protocol for a pilot randomised trial (preprint)","Background:  The mental and financial strain linked to unpaid caregiving has been amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. In sub-Saharan Africa, carers of adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) are critical for maintenance of optimum HIV treatment outcomes. However, the ability of caregivers to provide quality care to ALHIV is undermined by their ability to maintain their own wellbeing due to multiple factors (viz. poverty, stigma, lack of access to social support services) which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic incentives, such as cash incentives combined with SMS reminders, have been shown to improve wellbeing. However, there is a lack of preliminary evidence on the potential of economic incentives to promote caregiver wellbeing in this setting, particularly in the context of a pandemic. This protocol outlines the design of a parallel-group pilot randomised trial comparing the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an economic incentive package versus a control for improving caregiver wellbeing. Methods: : Caregivers of ALHIV will be recruited from public-sector HIV clinics in the south of the eThekwini municipality, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following groups: (i) the intervention group (n=50) will receive three cash payments (of ZAR 350, approximately 23 USD), coupled with a positive wellbeing message over a three month period;(ii) the control group (n=50) will receive a standard message encouraging linkage to health services. Participants will be interviewed at baseline and at endline (12 weeks) to collect socio-demographic, food insecurity, health status, mental health (stigma, depressive symptoms) and wellbeing data. The primary outcome measure, caregiver wellbeing, will be measured using the CarerQoL instrument. A qualitative study will be conducted alongside the main trial to understand participant views on participation in the trial and their feedback on study activities. Discussion:  This study will provide scientific direction for the design of a larger randomised controlled trial exploring the effects of an economic incentive for improving caregiver wellbeing. The feasibility of conducting study activities and delivering the intervention remotely in the context of a pandemic will also be provided.

"Probing different paradigms of morphine withdrawal on sleep behavior in male and female C57BL/6J mice (preprint)","The opioid epidemic has increased dramatically over the last few decades resulting in many suffering from opioid use disorder (OUD). The prevalence of opioids and opioid overdose has been driven by the development of new synthetic opioids, increased availability of prescription opioids, and more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. As we see increased in exposure to opioids, the United States has also seen increases in the frequency of instances of Narcan (naloxone) administration as a life saving measure for respiratory depression, and, thus, consequently, naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. Sleep dysregulation is one of the main symptoms of OUD and opioid withdrawal syndrome, and therefore should be a key facet of animal models of OUD. Here we examine the effect of precipitated and spontaneous morphine withdrawal on sleep behaviors in C57BL/6J. We find that morphine administration and withdrawal dysregulates sleep, however not equally across morphine exposure paradigms and not qualitatively the same across sexes. Furthermore, many environmental triggers promote relapse to drug seeking/taking behavior, and the stress of disrupted sleep may fall into that category. We find that sleep deprivation dysregulates sleep in mice that had previous opioid withdrawal experience. These data suggest that the 3-day precipitated withdrawal paradigm has the most profound effects on opioid induced sleep dysregulation, and that further validate the construct of the 3-day precipitated withdrawal model as a model for opioid dependence and OUD.","Bedard, Madigan, Lord, Julia Sparks, Perez, Patric, Bravo, Isabel, Teklezghi, Adonay, Tarantino, Lisa, Diering, Graham, McElligott, Zoe","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.06.487380","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29924,""
"Relationship Between Mental Health and Health Work Functioning During the Covid-19 Pandemic in Uganda (preprint)","Methods:  A cross-sectional study was conducted in the various health facilities and institutions at national and sub-national levels in Uganda. The participants were health care workers and first responders working in the health sector during the COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda. The mental health status of the health workforce was measured using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 instrument. The Nurses Work Functioning Questionnaire was used to measure health work functioning. The data for the study was collected using the Survey Monkey tool and exported and cleaned in Microsoft Excel 2019. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package of STATAÂ® version 16. Descriptive statistics, such as mean values, percentages, frequencies, and charts, were used to summarize the findings. Multinomial logistics regression was used to estimate an ologit model of the relationship between mental health and health work functioning. The results were measured using odds ratio. Results A total of 533 responses were obtained between June and July 2021, from 90 districts in Uganda. Three of the respondents did not consent to the study. 29.26% of responses were excluded during the analysis of the results because of missing data. 374(70.17%) responses from 82 districts in Uganda was used for the analysis. The prevalence of depression was 40.37%, stress was 25.7% and, anxiety was 47.06% among health care workers during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda. The factor of mental health associated with work function impairment were avoidance behavior and lack of energy and motivation. Conclusion The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress was high in Uganda during the peak of the response. Avoidance behavior is a determinant of mental health associated with health work function impairment. The government of Uganda needs to develop interventions that will strengthen the mental health and psychosocial well-being of health workers when providing health care services.","Akello, Harriet, Kennelly, Brendan, Cullinan, John","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1496609/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29925,""
"Psychological distress and well-being assessment among Indian people during COVID-19 pandemic","Background: A rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic restricted millions of people in their homes and affected them with anxiety, stress, and psychological distress. This online study was conducted to assess the psychological distress among the Indian population. Method: This is a cross-sectional study, data collected via an online self-reported questionnaire using a snowball sampling technique. COVID-19 psychological stress was measured through the COVID-19 peritraumatic distress index (CPDI). This questionnaire was open-access and adapted from the Shanghai Mental Health Centre. Data were extracted to Microsoft Excel and analyzed in SPSS 23 version. Ordinal logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio for predicting variables. Results: A total of 625 responses were received. The mean age of the respondents was 26.41 years (standard deviation [SD] = 9.35;range = 17â€“79 years) with 320 (51.2%) males and the majority (68.8%) of the respondents were students. Youth with age group between 21 and 25 years were observed to be having peritraumatic distress 2.42 times more than the other groups (P = 0.001). Females were found to be more nervous and anxious (<U+03C7>2 = 5.12;P = 0.02), more sluggish reaction due to anxiety (<U+03C7>2 = 9.46;P = 0.002) as compared to males. Unmarried respondents were observed to be more sluggish due to anxiety (<U+03C7>2 = 7.2;P = 0.007), felt more tired and exhausted (<U+03C7>2 = 6.12;P = 0.013) in comparison to married. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic crisis significantly affected a major segment of society. The psychological distress level was observed to be high among youth, females, and a group of people in quarantine or isolation.

"Factors Associated with Non-Severe Adverse Reactions after Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2: A Cohort Study of 908,869 Outpatient Vaccinations in Germany","Background: Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 significantly reduces the transmissibility of the virus and the likelihood of a severe course of COVID-19, and is thus a critical component in overcoming the current pandemic. The factors associated with adverse reactions after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been sufficiently evaluated. Methods: We used the Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA) to identify 531,468 individuals who received a total of 908,869 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations in 827 general practices in Germany between April and September 2021. Cox regression models were used to analyze the frequency of vaccination-related side effects reported within 14 days after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, as well as subjects' demographic characteristics and comorbidities. Results: The total number of side effects documented was 28,287 (3.1% of all vaccinations). Pain in the limb (24.3%), fatigue (21.0%), dizziness (17.9%), joint pain (15.7%), fever (9.5%), nausea (7.5%), and myalgia (6.4%) were the most common side effects documented among the 12,575 vaccinations with definite side effects. In the multivariate regression analysis, young age was associated with much higher odds of reported side effects (OR18&ndash;30 years: 4.45, OR31&ndash;40 years: 3.50, OR41&ndash;50 years: 2.89). In addition, pre-existing comorbidities such as dementia (OR: 1.54), somatoform disorder (OR: 1.53), anxiety disorder (OR: 1.43), depression (OR: 1.37), chronic respiratory tract disease (OR: 1.27), hypertension (OR: 1.20), and obesity (1.14) significantly increased the odds of side effects. Finally, the male sex was associated with increased odds of reported side effects (OR: 1.17). Conclusion: Our study, based on a large outpatient database from Germany, identified young age, male sex, and pre-existing comorbidities such as dementia, somatoform disorders, anxiety disorders, and depression as factors associated with vaccine-related adverse events diagnosed in GP practices. These data could help to identify subgroups needing particular advice and care in the context of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations.","Loosen, Sven H.; Bohlken, Jens, Weber, Kerstin, Konrad, Marcel, Luedde, Tom, Roderburg, Christoph, Kostev, Karel","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10040566","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Vaccines; 10(4):566, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29928,""
"Knowledge and Attitudes of Medical Students toward COVID-19 Vaccine in Saudi Arabia","Medical students are the future caregivers of communities, and therefore it is important to rectify their misconceptions about the COVID-19 vaccine. We aimed to explore the knowledge and attitudes among medical students toward the COVID-19 vaccine in Saudi Arabia and to compare the level of knowledge between preclinical and clinical years. This epidemiological cross-sectional study of 1445 (47.3% were pre-clinical and 52.7% were clinical year) medical students was conducted at various universities in Saudi Arabia using a simple random sampling technique. The results revealed that 34.3% students did not know how the Pfizer vaccine worked, with a high proportion in preclinical students (69.4%). Almost 37% of participants thought that one could become infected with COVID-19 via the COVID-19 vaccine, and 67.1% of these students were pre-clinical. About 22.6% of students did not trust COVID-19 vaccine information from the health ministry, and the majority of them (79.8%) were pre-clinical. Vaccine hesitancy was shown by about 33.3% (n = 481) of subjects, and surprisingly, almost half of them (48.6%) thought that the COVID-19 vaccine involved conspiracy;the majority of them were pre-clinical (97.9%). The overall response of students indicates a significantly lower level of knowledge and increased negative attitudes of preclinical students toward the COVID-19 vaccine. However, the vast majority of students agreed on the importance of the COVID-19 vaccine to decrease the spread of the disease.","Habib, Syed Shahid, Alamri, Musab Saleh, Alkhedr, Mudafr Mahmoud, Alkhorijah, Mohammad Abdullah, Jabaan, Rayan Dhafer, Alanzi, Mubarak Khalid","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10040541","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Vaccines; 10(4):541, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29929,""
"Short-Term and Long-Term Replenishment of Water Storage Influenced by Lockdown and Policy Measures in Drought-Prone Regions of Central India","Central India faces a freshwater shortage due to its diverse terrain, sudden change in precipitation patterns and crystalline rock covered subsurface. Here, we investigate the patterns in terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) over the last two decades, and also study the influence of the COVID-19 lockdown on TWSA in the drought-prone regions of central India, mostly covering the Vidarbha region of the Indian state of Maharashtra. The Vidarbha region is arguably the most drought-affected region in terms of farmer suicides due to crop failure. Our forecast data using multiple statistical approaches show a net TWSA rise in the order of 3.65 to 19.32 km3 in the study area in May 2020. A short-term rise in TWSA in April&ndash;May of 2020 is associated with lockdown influenced human activity reduction. A long-term rise in TWSA has been observed in the study region in recent years;the rising TWSA trend is not directly associated with precipitation patterns, rather it may be attributed to the implementation of water management policies.","Bhanja, Soumendra N.; Sekhar, M.","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14081768","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Remote Sensing; 14(8):1768, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29930,""
"Food Involvement, Food Choices, and Bioactive Compounds Consumption Correlation during COVID-19 Pandemic: How Food Engagement Influences Consumers' Food Habits","The containment measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic affected food-related activities, influencing dietary behavior, food habits, and dietary choices. This study aimed to compare the relationship between food involvement and dietary choices before and during the pandemic, investigating the role played by food in dietary habits. Responses given by 2773 Italian consumers to an online survey were studied through the Food Involvement Scale (FIS) and correlated to eating habits. FIS scores were then used to explain the importance given to food in circumstances related to well-being, health, and protection against COVID-19 and used to study the relationship between FIS and bioactive compound knowledge, use, and efficacy against COVID-19. The consumers more involved in food issues recognized the importance of food in circumstances related to well-being, health, and protection against COVID-19 and improved their diet during the pandemic. Moreover, consumers who gave more importance to food also revealed higher attention to the use of healthy substances, such as bioactive compounds, considering them effective against COVID-19. These results showed that food experiencing and involvement could be important elements to promote healthy dietary habits that are essential to maintain physical and mental health during emergency periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Medoro, Chiara, Cianciabella, Marta, Magli, Massimiliano, Daniele, Giulia Maria, Lippi, Nico, Gatti, Edoardo, Volpe, Roberto, Longo, Vincenzo, Nazzaro, Filomena, Mattoni, Silvia, Tenaglia, Federica, Predieri, Stefano","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14071490","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Nutrients; 14(7):1490, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29931,""
"Post-COVID-19 Condition: Where Are We Now?","COVID-19 is currently considered a systemic infection involving multiple systems and causing chronic complications. Compared to other post-viral fatigue syndromes, these complications are wider and more intense. The most frequent symptoms are profound fatigue, dyspnea, sleep difficulties, anxiety or depression, reduced lung capacity, memory/cognitive impairment, and hyposmia/anosmia. Risk factors for this condition are severity of illness, more than five symptoms in the first week of the disease, female sex, older age, the presence of comorbidities, and a weak anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response. Different lines of research have attempted to explain these protracted symptoms;chronic persistent inflammation, autonomic nervous system disruption, hypometabolism, and autoimmunity may play a role. Due to thyroid high ACE expression, the key molecular complex SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect the host cells, thyroid may be a target for the coronavirus infection. Thyroid dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a combination of numerous mechanisms, and its role in long-COVID manifestations is not yet established. The proposed mechanisms are a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on target cells, an indirect effect of systemic inflammatory immune response, and a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis leading to decreased serum TSH. Only a few studies have reported the thyroid gland status in the post-COVID-19 condition. The presence of post-COVID symptoms deserves recognition of COVID-19 as a cause of post-viral fatigue syndrome. It is important to recognize the affected individuals at an early stage so we can offer them the most adequate treatments, helping them thrive through the uncertainty of their condition.","Boaventura, Paula, Macedo, Sofia, Ribeiro, Filipa, Jaconiano, SÃ³nia, Soares, Paula","https://doi.org/10.3390/life12040517","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Life; 12(4):517, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29932,""
"Green Space Visits and Barriers to Visiting during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Three-Wave Nationally Representative Cross-Sectional Study of UK Adults","Green spaces have been found to promote physical activity, social contact, and mental wellbeing, however, there are inequalities in the use and experience of green spaces. The United Kingdom's (UK) response to the COVID-19 pandemic imposed very substantial changes on its citizens' lives which could plausibly affect their willingness to visit green spaces. These sudden lifestyle changes severely affected the population's mental health, leading to a greater dependency on the positive influence of nature in reducing stress and improving mood. Whilst early cross-sectional evidence suggested an increased orientation to nature and visits to green spaces as a response to COVID-19 'lockdowns', there is little longitudinal evidence about how sustained and equal these changes may have been. This study explored green space visits, barriers to visiting, and the inequalities of both of those over an entire year of the pandemic in the UK. Three waves of nationally representative cross-sectional surveys were administered by YouGov in April 2020, November 2020, and April 2021 (N = 6713). Data included reported visits to green spaces and, for those with no or infrequent visiting, perceived barriers including those plausibly related to the risk of COVID-19. Green space visits increased over the year as lockdown restrictions were relaxed;68% of respondents reported green space visits in April 2021, compared with 49% in April 2020. However, the socio-economic inequalities in use were sustained and increased. COVID-19 related barriers fell over time, but there were indications of increased interest in green spaces among younger people. Further action is required to ensure that the positive impacts of green spaces are experienced equally, and that good quality green space is accessible to all.","Burnett, Hannah, Olsen, Jonathan R.; Mitchell, Richard","https://doi.org/10.3390/land11040503","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Land; 11(4):503, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29933,""
"Changes in the Mean of and Variance in Psychological Disease Incidences before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Korean Adult Population","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been suggested to increase the risk of depression and anxiety disorders. This study expanded upon previous findings by estimating the changes in medical visits for various psychological disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before COVID-19. The entire Korean population &ge;20 years old (~42.3 million) was included. The first COVID-19 case in Korea was reported on 20 January 2020. Thus, the period from January 2018 through to February 2020 was classified as 'before COVID-19';, and the period from March 2020 through to May 2021 was classified as 'during COVID-19';. Monthly medical visits due to the following 13 psychological disorders were evaluated: depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, primary insomnia, schizophrenia, panic disorder, hypochondriasis, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorder, anorexia nervosa, addephagia, alcoholism, nicotine dependency, and gambling addiction were evaluated. The differences in the number of medical visits and the variance of diseases before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed using the Mann&ndash;Whitney U test and Levene's test. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to age and sex. The frequencies of medical visits for depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, primary insomnia, panic disorder, hypochondriasis, PTSD, anxiety disorder, anorexia nervosa, addephagia, and gambling addiction were higher during COVID-19 than before COVID-19 (all p &lt; 0.001). However, the frequencies of medical visits for schizophrenia, alcoholism, and nicotine dependency were lower during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the COVID-19 pandemic (all p &lt; 0.001). The psychological disorders with a higher frequency of medical visits during COVID-19 were consistent in all age and sex subgroups. In the old age group, the number of medical visits due to schizophrenia was also higher during COVID-19 than before COVID-19 (p &lt; 0.001). Many psychological disorders, including depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, primary insomnia, panic disorder, hypochondriasis, PTSD, anxiety disorder, anorexia nervosa, addephagia, and gambling addiction, had a higher number of related medical visits, while disorders such as schizophrenia, alcoholism, and nicotine dependency had a lower number of related medical visits during COVID-19 among Korean adults.","Kim, So Young, Yoo, Dae Myoung, Kwon, Mi-Jung, Kim, Ji-Hee, Kim, Joo-Hee, Bang, Woo-Jin, Choi, Hyo Geun","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm12040576","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Personalized Medicine; 12(4):576, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29934,""
"A Cross-Sectional Study Investigating Canadian and Australian Adolescents' Perceived Experiences of COVID-19: Gender Differences and Mental Health Implications","The coronavirus (COVID-19) disease pandemic has been associated with adverse psychological outcomes. This cross-cultural study (N = 1326, 71% female) aimed to investigate Canadian and Australian adolescents' subjective experiences of COVID-19, gender differences, and psychological implications. Mixed-methods analyses were used to examine differences in COVID-19 experiences and mental health outcomes between country and gender in a Canadian (N = 913, 78% female) and an Australian sample (N = 413, 57% female) of adolescents. Canadian adolescents reported increased COVID-19 discussions and more concerns related to their COVID-19 experiences compared to Australian adolescents. Girls consistently reported more concerns related to COVID-19 and poorer psychological outcomes compared to boys. School lockdown for the Canadian sample may have played a role in these country differences. Further, girls might be at significantly more risk for mental health concerns during COVID-19, which should be considered in adolescent mental health initiatives during the pandemic. Although school disruption and separation of peers due to the pandemic likely have a role in adolescent perceived stressors and mental health, the differences between Canadian and Australian adolescents were less clear and future investigations comparing more objective pre-COVID-19 data to current data are needed.","Marie, Riana, Journault, Audrey-Ann, Cernik, Rebecca, Welch, Paul, Lupien, Sonia, McDermott, Brett, Moxon, Joseph V.; Sarnyai, Zoltan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19074407","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):4407, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29935,""
"Depression, Insomnia, and Probable Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder among Survivors of the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake and Related Factors during the Recovery Period Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic","The aftereffects of the severe 2016 Kumamoto earthquake were complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Depression, Anxiety and Stress in Health Professionals in the COVID-19 Context","To assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in health professionals in the COVID-19 pandemic context. Method: Cross-sectional study with non-probabilistic (snow-ball) sampling method. The assessment was performed using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the prevalence of symptoms severity was calculated by point and 95% confidence interval. The analysis of the psychometric properties of DASS-21 was performed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and the following goodness of fit indices: &chi;2/df (chi-square ratio by degrees of freedom), Tucker&ndash;Lewis index (TLI), comparative fit index (CFI) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) with a 90% confidence interval. Results: The study participants were 529 health professionals (82.4% women and 66.7% nursing professionals). CFA of the DASS-21 structural model presented adequate fit for the sample (&chi;2/df = 3.530;CFI = 0.979;TLI = 0.976;RMSEA = 0.069). Regarding prevalence, moderate to extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were found in 48.6%, 55.0% and 47.9% of the participants, respectively. Conclusion: The use of DASS-21 confirmed the validity and reliability of the data. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in the participants indicated a high risk of mental illness in health professionals in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Garcia, Gracielle Pereira Aires, Fracarolli, Isabela Fernanda Larios, dos Santos, Heloisa Ehmke Cardoso, de Oliveira, Samuel Andrade, Martins, Bianca Gonzalez, Santin Junior, Lacir JosÃ©, Marziale, Maria Helena Palucci, Rocha, Fernanda Ludmilla Rossi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19074402","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):4402, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29937,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Academic Stress and Perceived Classroom Climate in Spanish University Students","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused several changes in society, especially in the educational context, where several learning methodologies and social interactions have been modified significantly. This fact could have had a negative impact on academic stress levels of students and the classroom climate, especially in the university context. The main aim of the present study was to identify changes in academic stress and the perceived classroom climate caused by COVID-19 in a sample of Spanish university students. Academic stress was evaluated trough the Stressor Academic Scale (SAS) and perceived classroom climate employing the Perceived Classroom Responsibility Climate (PCRC) questionnaire. A longitudinal study was conducted. 135 students (97 females and 38 males) from the Gastronomy (n = 31) and Criminology (n = 104) degrees were evaluated before and after the COVID-19 lockdown in Spain. Academic stress levels and perceived classroom climate were analyzed before (Time 1) and after (Time 2) the lockdown declaration. An increase in academic stress was found, especially in the categories regarding Teachers' Methodological Deficiencies, Academic Over-Burden and Beliefs About Performances. Females and final year students suffered higher levels of academic stress. No differences were found between Time 1 and 2 in perceived classroom climate. The obtained results point out a significant increase of academic stress in university students due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. The implemented educational changes and the uncertainty that resulted from the pandemic could have a significant negative impact on mental health in this population, resulting in higher levels of academic stress, especially in females and final year students. Future studies should analyze the strategies that students are employing to cope with these educational challenges and intervention strategies to promote them in the context of higher education.","Ruiz-Robledillo, NicolÃ¡s, Vela-Bermejo, Juan, Clement-Carbonell, Violeta, Ferrer-Cascales, Rosario, Alcocer-Bruno, Cristian, Albaladejo-BlÃ¡zquez, Natalia","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19074398","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):4398, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29938,""
"Job Demands, Work Functioning and Mental Health in Dutch Nursing Home Staff during the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Multilevel Study","COVID-19 posed enormous challenges for nursing home staff, which may have caused stress and mental health problems. This study aimed to measure the prevalence of mental health problems among nursing home staff and investigate the differences in job demands, work functioning and mental health between staff with and without COVID contact or COVID infection and across different levels of COVID worries. In this cross-sectional study, 1669 employees from 10 nursing home organizations filled in an online questionnaire between June and September 2020. The questionnaire measured the participants' characteristics, COVID contact, infection and worries, job demands, work functioning, depressive symptoms and burnout. Differences were investigated with multilevel models to account for clustering at the organization level. Of the participants, 19.1% had high levels of depressive symptoms and 22.2% burnout. Job demands, work functioning, depressive symptoms and burnout differed between participants who never worried and participants who often or always worried about the COVID crisis. Differences were smaller for participants with and without COVID contact or infection. Most models improved when clustering was accounted for. Nursing homes should be aware of the impact of COVID worries on job demands, work functioning and mental health, both at the individual and organizational level.","van Dijk, Ylse, Janus, Sarah I.

"Substance Use among Belgian Higher Education Students before and during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic prompted many countries to issue far-reaching policy measures that may have led to increased substance use. Higher education students may have been disproportionally affected due to the rearrangement of educational life and their susceptibility to psychosocial distress and substance use. The current study examined associations between pandemic-related stressors, psychosocial distress, and self-reported alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use before and during the first wave of the pandemic. Data were collected in Belgium as part of the COVID-19 International Student Well-being Study (C19 ISWS) and analyzed using multinomial logistic regression analyses. The sample contained 18,346 higher education students aged 17 to 24 (75% women). Overall use of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis as well as binge drinking decreased during the pandemic, perhaps due to limited social gatherings. Moving back to the parental home was associated with decreased substance use, while depressive symptoms were associated with increased substance use. Perceived threat and academic stress were associated with increased binge drinking among heavy bingers and increased tobacco use. Decreases among students who moved back to their parental home may be explained by increased informal social control. Increased substance use was associated with a number of stressors and psychosocial distress, which suggests that some students may have been self-medicating to manage their mental health amidst the pandemic. Public health policy concerning substance use may prove to be less effective if not tailored to particular subgroups within the student population.","Tholen, Robert, Ponnet, Koen, Van Hal, Guido, De Bruyn, Sara, Buffel, Veerle, Van de Velde, Sarah, Bracke, Piet, Wouters, Edwin","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19074348","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):4348, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29940,""
"The Significance of Angling in Stress Reduction during the COVID-19 Pandemic-Environmental and Socio-Economic Implications","Recreational fishing and other outdoor recreational activities have been proven to have positive effects on mental health, including neutralizing pandemic stress. This study aims to identify the perceptions and behavior of recreational anglers during the COVID-19 pandemic along with identifying the factors that determine attitudes. This study is essential for understanding the complex economic, social, and environmental implications associated with a pandemic. Perceptions of pandemic stress reduction were confirmed by 63.8% of anglers, and nearly 98% felt there was no risk of infection from fishing. These feelings were most strongly positively associated and explained by a preference for fishing with friends and family and the frequency of fishing. Over 26% of respondents fished more frequently during the pandemic. Additional free time and the need to escape the pandemic media hype were the main factors for the increase in angler activity. The balance of benefits from changes in angler pandemic behavior was ambiguous. This was determined by considering the potential increase in pressure on the environmental resources that anglers use. Given the positive effects of angling on stress reduction, it is not advisable for policymakers to restrict recreational fishing access. Instead, best management practices should reduce sanitary bottlenecks to increase safety on fishing grounds.","Karpinski, Emil Andrzej, Skrzypczak, Andrzej Robert","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19074346","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):4346, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29941,""
"What Is the Burnout of Mothers with Infants and Toddlers during the COVID-19 Pandemic? In Relation to Parenting Stress, Depression, and Parenting Efficacy","Background: The purpose of this study was to analyze the factors influencing burnout of mothers with infants or toddlers in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The subjects of this study were 105 mothers who sent their children to daycare centers or kindergartens located in S and G cities. They were women who have experienced caring for children entirely at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Man&ndash;Whitney U test, Pearson's correlation coefficients, and a stepwise multiple regression using the SPSS Window 25.0 program. Results: The subjects' burnout and parenting stress (r = 0.62, p &lt; 0.001), depression (r = 0.58, p &lt; 0.001), and parenting efficacy (r = &minus;0.62, p &lt; 0.001) showed a large correlation. The factors affecting the subjects' burnout were parenting stress (&beta;= 0.28, p &lt; 0.001), parenting efficacy (&beta;= &minus;0.40, p &lt; 0.001), depression (&beta;= 0.27, p &lt; 0.001), and spouse's support (nearly none) (&beta;= 0.18, p = 0.004). These variables explained 64.0% of the subjects' burnout. Conclusions: Through the research results, it was confirmed that parenting stress, parenting efficacy, depression, and spouse's support influence the mother's burnout. Therefore, in future studies, it is necessary to expand mental health programs to lower parenting stress and depression into interventional studies on specific educational strategies such as programs to promote efficacy and improve spouse's support.","Seo, Jeong-Hyo, Kim, Hee-Kyung","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19074291","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):4291, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29942,""
"Technology-Based Mental Health Interventions for Domestic Violence Victims Amid COVID-19","Introduction: Domestic violence is a threat to human dignity and public health. Mounting evidence shows that domestic violence erodes personal and public health, spawning issues such as lifelong mental health challenges. To further compound the situation, COVID-19 and societies' poor response to the pandemic have not only worsened the domestic violence crisis but also disrupted mental health services for domestic violence victims. While technology-based health solutions can overcome physical constraints posed by the pandemic and offer timely support to address domestic violence victims' mental health issues, there is a dearth of research in the literature. To bridge the research gap, in this study, we aim to examine technology-based mental health solutions for domestic violence victims amid COVID-19. Methods: A literature review was conducted to examine solutions that domestic violence victims can utilize to safeguard and improve their mental health amid COVID-19. Databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus were utilized for the literature search. The search was focused on four themes: domestic violence, mental health, technology-based interventions, and COVID-19. A reverse search of pertinent references was conducted in Google Scholar. The social ecological model was utilized to systematically structure the review findings. Results: The findings show that a wide array of technology-based solutions has been proposed to address mental health challenges faced by domestic violence victims amid COVID-19. However, none of these proposals is based on empirical evidence amid COVID-19. In terms of social and ecological levels of influence, most of the interventions were developed on the individual level, as opposed to the community level or social level, effectively placing the healthcare responsibility on the victims rather than government and health officials. Furthermore, most of the articles failed to address risks associated with utilizing technology-based interventions (e.g., privacy issues) or navigating the online environment (e.g., cyberstalking). Conclusion: Overall, our findings highlight the need for greater research endeavors on the research topic. Although technology-based interventions have great potential in resolving domestic violence victims' mental health issues, risks associated with these health solutions should be comprehensively acknowledged and addressed.","Su, Zhaohui, Cheshmehzangi, Ali, McDonnell, Dean, Chen, Hengcai, Ahmad, Junaid, Å egalo, Sabina, da Veiga, Claudimar Pereira","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19074286","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):4286, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29943,""
"Health Service Accessibility, Mental Health, and Changes in Behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study of Older Adults","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the access of older adults to health services. The two objectives of this study are understanding the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults' access to health services and exploring how health service accessibility during the pandemic influenced older adults' mental health and self-reported changes in behavior. This study included 346 older adults. Content analysis produced five themes: (1) decreased physical accessibility to health care providers (78%);(2) increased use of online health services and other virtual health care (69%);(3) growth in the online prescription of medication (67%);(4) difficulty obtaining information and accessing non-communicable disease and mental health indicators (65%);and (5) postponement of medical specialist consultations (51%). Regarding mental health, three themes emerged: (1) increased symptoms of anxiety, distress, and depression (89%);(2) the experience of traumatic situations (61%);and (3) the augmented use of alcohol or drugs (56%). Finally, the following changes in behavior were indicated: (1) frustrated behavior (92%);(2) emotional explosions (79%);and (3) changes in sleeping and eating behaviors (43%). Access to health services may have influenced the mental health and behavior of older adults, hence interventions in a pandemic must address their interactions with health services, their needs, and their well-being.","von Humboldt, Sofia, Low, Gail, Leal, Isabel","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19074277","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):4277, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29944,""
"Neurological and Mental Health Symptoms Associated with Post-COVID-19 Disability in a Sample of Patients Discharged from a COVID-19 Ward: A Secondary Analysis","Recent studies suggest that COVID-19 survivors may experience long-term health consequences: in particular, neurological and mental health symptoms might be associated with long-term negative outcomes. This study is a secondary analysis of a larger cohort study and aims to determine the extent to which neurological and mental health sequelae are associated with survivors' disability. Participants include COVID-19 survivors, with no pre-morbid brain conditions, who were discharged from the COVID-19 Unit of the ASST Spedali Civili Hospital between February and April 2020. At an average of 3.5 months after discharge, they were submitted to a neurological examination and completed the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS-12), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Multivariable regression analysis was carried out to analyze variables that explain WHODAS-12 variation. In total, 83 patients (63 males, average age 66.9, 95% CI: 64.2&ndash;69.7) were enrolled;average WHODAS-12 was 13.2 (95% CI: 9.7&ndash;16.6). Cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, fatigue, and hyposmia/hypogeusia explained 28.8% of WHODAS-12 variation.

The study included 3365 parents with children aged 0&ndash;14 years old who reported their children's mental status during the declared state of emergency. Emotional instability was reported dichotomously by parents. As the primary result, the probability of emotional instability was higher in single-parent households compared with that in two-parent households after adjustments for potential covariates;the adjusted prevalence ratio (95% CI) was 1.26 (1.07&ndash;1.49).

"How Implicit Attitudes toward Vaccination Affect Vaccine Hesitancy and Behaviour: Developing and Validating the V-IRAP","Vaccination is one of the most important ways of fighting infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. However, vaccine hesitancy and refusal can reduce adherence to vaccination campaigns, and therefore undermine their effectiveness. Although the scientific community has made great efforts to understand the psychological causes of vaccine hesitancy, studies on vaccine intention have usually relied on traditional detection techniques, such as questionnaires. Probing these constructs explicitly could be problematic due to defense mechanisms or social desirability. Thus, a measure capable of detecting implicit attitudes towards vaccination is needed. To achieve this aim, we designed and validated a new test called the Vaccine-IRAP, or V-IRAP, which is a modified version of the original Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure, or IRAP, task. The V-IRAP allows the unspoken reasons behind vaccine hesitancy to be investigated, and is able to distinguish between positive and negative beliefs on vaccination. The test was assessed in a sample of 151 participants. The V-IRAP showed good internal reliability and convergent validity, with meaningful correlational patterns with explicit measures. Moreover, it revealed incremental validity over such explicit measures. Lastly, the V-IRAP was able to shed light on the implicit attitudes involved in vaccine refusal, revealing negative attitudes relative to vaccine-related risks in non-vaccinated participants. Overall, these results support V-IRAP as a sensitive and reliable tool that could be used in future studies on implicit attitudes toward vaccination.","Simione, Luca, Vagni, Monia, Maiorano, Tiziana, Giostra, Valeria, Pajardi, Daniela","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19074205","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(7):4205, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29947,""
"Health and Mindfulness during the Syndemic of SARS-CoV-2: An Ethnographic Study","SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has caused physical and mental health problems for a large part of the population. In this context, the practice of mindfulness has become relevant due to its usefulness in channeling and mitigating these problems. The objective of this article is to know the implications of the practice of mindfulness in physical and mental health in this syndemic period throh the perception of its practitioners. To achieve this purpose, we conducted an ethnographic study with fieldwork in three mindfulness training and practice groups. The techniques used were participant observation, open interview and survey. Participant observation was carried out from October 2019 to November 2021. A total of 22 open interviews were conducted. In addition, 44 surveys were carried out on a total population of 54. From the first sessions, 45.5% stated that they had felt beneficial effects on their health, and 100% perceived benefits in different aspects of their mental and physical health. The techniques perceived as most effective were those that focused on the body and emotions. The usefulness of mindfulness in managing the problems derived from the syndemic was unquestionable for 95.4%. In addition, a strong correlation is observed between the time spent practicing mindfulness and the reduction in the impact of the syndemic on the health of the practitioners.","MartÃ­nez Guirao, Javier Eloy, AntÃ³n Hurtado, Fina, SÃ¡nchez Vera, Fulgencio, Tellez Infantes, Anastasia","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10040686","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(4):686, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29948,""
"Tax-Spend or Spend-Tax? The Case of Southern Africa","Whether to increase taxes or cut spending is an important question with profound policy implications, especially as countries attempt to deal with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study, therefore, investigated the relationship between revenues and spending in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), where concerns about rising debt and deficits were raised prior to the pandemic. A panel bootstrap Granger-causality technique was used to analyze annual frequency data covering the 1980&ndash;2018 period. To our best knowledge, this was the first study in Africa to simultaneously account for cross-country differences and cross-section dependence. The findings of the study have in-depth implications for fiscal policy and adjustments towards budgetary equilibria. The study found no evidence of causality between revenues and spending in eleven SADC member states, suggesting that to balance their respective budgets, governments in these countries can alter either spending or revenues, or both. However, in Botswana, we found evidence of the tax-spend hypothesis, implying that governments should consider altering revenues to eliminate budget imbalances. Finally, evidence of the spend-tax hypothesis was found in Mauritius and Mozambique, suggesting that past and current expenditures drive revenues in these countries. Accordingly, cutting spending would be an ideal policy recourse to deal with budgetary disequilibrium.","Nzimande, Ntokozo Patrick, Ngalawa, Harold","https://doi.org/10.3390/economies10040085","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Economies; 10(4):85, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29949,""
"Interior Environment Design Method for Positive Mental Health in Lockdown Times: Color, Textures, Objects, Furniture and Equipment","In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a COVID-19 pandemic accompanied by a series of mass lockdowns. Some of the consequences of these lockdowns were (1) psychological problems, (2) development of simultaneous activities in spaces not prepared for it, and (3) indoor spaces that generate negative emotions in people. To improve people's mental health during times of lockdown, this research proposes a methodology to design positive interior environments through color, texture, objects, furniture, and equipment. For this, 147 qualitative surveys were carried out, the structure of which is based on research methods and tools inherited from marketing discipline (Likert Scale and Customer Satisfaction Score). Several operative graphs were created to make decisions on the design of interior environments. To avoid some of the problems caused by indoor environments during lockdowns it is recommended that users return to paying attention to the design of the interior spaces of their homes. Note that there is no standard solution to this problem, but a method to design interior environments based on people's positive mental health such as the one presented here can help.

"Preferences for Hotels with Biophilic Design Attributes in the Post-COVID-19 Era","Since the COVID-19 crisis has caused the cancellation of a great number of travel plans in the last two years, this study examines the prospects of the post-COVID-19 era, during which we expect tourism will return strongly. The impact of the epidemic on people's attitudes toward tourism, particularly their tourist choices, appears to be a major challenge for post-COVID-19 international tourism development. Very little is known about tourists' accommodation preferences during the period emerging after the COVID-19 crisis. With a long and challenging experience of lockdowns, stress, and fear of disease, the current study attempts to examine peoples' preferences for hotel attributes during the post-COVID-19 era. It examines factors contributing to peoples' preferences for hotels with biophilic attributes. A total of 507 Iranian undergraduate and graduate students participated in the study. They answered questions on their perceived stress, level of depression, the specific burden of COVID-19, the perceived benefits of nature, and their preferences for biophilic design attributes in their accommodation. The online survey was conducted from August to October 2021. We found that the burden of COVID-19 increased the stress level of the respondents, which consequently increased the chance of depression. We further found that perceived stress and the benefits of nature significantly affect tourists' preferences for exposure to nature and hotels with biophilic attributes. Based on the data, we suggest that the demand for biophilic buildings will be strongly increased during the post-COVID-19 era.","Khozaei, Fatemeh, Carbon, Claus Christian, Hosseini Nia, Mahdieh, Kim, Mi Jeong","https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings12040427","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Buildings; 12(4):427, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29951,""
"Cognitive and Functional Abilities in an Older Adult Veteran Before and After Contracting COVID-19","Background: A 76-year-old male Veteran with a historical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment was assessed at baseline and follow-up as part of two separate, ongoing studies. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 during the interim. Objective: To report potential effects on cognitive and functional abilities measured before and after contracting COVID-19. Methods: The patient was administered a series of cognitive tests and self-report procedures assessing cognitive, functional, and neuropsychiatric status. Results: Overall, no discernable pattern of cognitive changes between pre-COVID and post-COVID assessments were noted. Only mild increases in agitation, depression, and irritability were noted on a self-report measure. However, this particular subject has relatively ideal psychosocial circumstances in comparison to the typical older adult Veteran male. It is hypothesized that improved psycho social conditions will result in less negative cognitive and functional outcomes for older adults diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusion: High levels of resilience, social support, and exercise, coupled with lower levels of perceived stress and loneliness may serve as protective factors against cognitive and functional decline in older adults who contract COVID-19.","Okolichany, R.; Padala, P.

"â€œSeven Days in Lockdownâ€: A Performance Autoethnography of Physical Activity and Mental Health","COVID-19 increased anxiety levels worldwide. Significant mental health consequences are becoming evident across society, from children to seniors. The pandemic left millions of people out of work or unable to work. It simultaneously increased stress levels for many who remained in work. It made day-to-day life worse?much worse?for a lot of people. I was not immune to these difficulties. Yet, paradoxically, I found that lockdown also offered circumstances to support a degree of recovery or healing. This performance autoethnography draws on diary excerpts I wrote during lockdown in 2020 to explore how various forms of physical activity can help mental health.

"A Comparative Study of Bot Detection Techniques With an Application in Twitter Covid-19 Discourse","Bot Detection is crucial in a world where Online Social Networks (OSNs) play a pivotal role in our lives as public communication channels. This task becomes highly relevant in crises like the Covid-19 pandemic when there is a growing risk of proliferation of automated accounts designed to produce misinformation content. To address this issue, we first introduce a comparison between supervised Bot Detection models using Data Selection. The techniques used to develop the bot detection models use features such as the tweets? metadata or accounts? Digital Fingerprint. The techniques implemented in this work proved effective in detecting bots with different behaviors. Social Fingerprint-based methods have been found to be effective with bots that behave in a coordinated manner. Furthermore, all these approaches have produced excellent results compared to the Botometer v3. Second, we present and discuss a case study related to the Covid-19 pandemic that analyses the differences in the discourse between bots and humans on Twitter, a platform used worldwide to express opinions and engage in dialogue in a public arena. While bots and humans generally express themselves alike, the tweets? content and sentiment analysis reveal some dissimilitudes, especially in tweets concerning President Trump. When the discourse switches to pandemic management by Trump, sentiment-related values display a drastic difference, showing that tweets generated by bots have a predominantly negative attitude. However, according to our findings, while automated accounts are numerous and active in discussing controversial issues, they usually do not seem to increase exposure to negative and inflammatory content for human users.","Antenore, Marzia, Camacho Rodriguez, Jose Manuel, Panizzi, Emanuele","https://doi.org/10.1177/08944393211073733","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Science Computer Review;: 08944393211073733, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29954,""
"Sensemaking by Employees in Essential versus Non-essential Professions During the COVID-19 Crisis: A Comparison of Effects of Change Communication and Disruption Cues on Mental Health, Through Interpretations of Identity Threats and Work Meaningfulness","This study examines the implications of categorizing workers into essential and non-essential groups due to disruptions in work associated with?and the quality of organizational change communication about?the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we examine how these cues trigger identity threats and influence the meaningfulness of work, consequently affecting the mental health of workers (anxiety, distress, and depression). The results show that change communication reduces identity threat, while also increasing meaningfulness of work, for both work categories. However, the disruptions increase identity threat only for non-essential workers. Conversely, identity threat increases two of the three mental health issues while meaningfulness of work reduces two of them. The study contributes to our growing understanding of the pervasive, though subtle, implications of COVID-19 for the workplace by showing how a process of employee sensemaking and organizational change communication directly and indirectly influence important dimensions of mental health.","van Zoonen, Ward, Rice, Ronald E.; ter Hoeven, Claartje L.","https://doi.org/10.1177/08933189221087633","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Management Communication Quarterly;: 08933189221087633, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29955,""
"Psychosocial factors associated with adolescent depressive and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has created many challenges for adolescents across the world. The current study aimed to investigate the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and suicidal ideation in adolescents living in Melbourne, Australia, during the state of Victoria?s second lockdown. The study also sought to identify pre-existing and current psychosocial stressors associated with adolescent?s depressive and anxiety symptoms, and to identify the extent to which adolescents experiencing mental health difficulties sought professional help during the pandemic. A COVID-19 sub-study of the Mothers? and Young People?s Study?an 18-year longitudinal cohort study?was conducted between July and September 2020, an online survey completed by 257 adolescents aged 14?17 years and their mothers, which asked about pandemic-related stressors, remote learning, family life, and mental health. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical multiple regression analysis were conducted. Mental health difficulties were common with 38% and 20% of adolescents reporting clinically significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, and 21% reporting frequent suicidal or self-harm ideation. Factors associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms included being female, exposure to current maternal depressive symptoms, lower levels of resilience, experiences of loneliness, stressful life events, and school- and family-related stressors. Two-thirds of adolescents who were experiencing clinically significant depressive or anxiety symptoms had not sought professional help. Our findings highlight the urgent mental health need among adolescents and the importance of reducing barriers to accessing support.","Fogarty, Alison, Brown, Stephanie, Gartland, Deirdre, Mensah, Fiona, Seymour, Monique, Savopoulos, Priscilla, FitzPatrick, Kelly, Papadopoullos, Sandra, Giallo, Rebecca","https://doi.org/10.1177/01650254221084100","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Behavioral Development;: 01650254221084100, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29956,""
"COVID-19 and Australian school psychology: Qualitative perspectives for enhancing future practice","The challenges and changes driven by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the education sector have been linked to high rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic symptoms in school-aged populations. Despite this, it is also acknowledged that children and young people can be resilient and adaptable, with the right support in place. In schools, psychologists play an important role in supporting students? learning, behavior, wellbeing, and mental health. The aim of this study is to investigate the practices of Australian school psychologists during COVID-19 related school closures, focusing on their experiences and challenges and how they adapted their practices. Twelve Australian school psychologists were interviewed and, after member checks were undertaken, interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Six interrelated themes were identified including: (a) heightened student psychological stress, (b) alternative delivery modes and associated challenges, (c) close collaboration with families, (d) participants personal challenges during COVID-19, (e) assessment during COVID-19, and (f) possible long-term practice changes post pandemic. The results of this study have implications for policies to support students in future pandemics or where physical school attendance is disrupted (e.g., natural disasters).","Reupert, Andrea, Greenfeld, Daliya, May, Fiona, Berger, Emily, Morris, Zoe A.; Allen, Kelly-Ann, Summers, Dianne, Wurf, Gerald","https://doi.org/10.1177/01430343221091953","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: School Psychology International;: 01430343221091953, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29957,""
"Does State Tightness-Looseness Predict Behavior and Attitudes Early in the COVID-19 Pandemic in the USA?","We investigated how tightness-looseness, reflecting strictness of social norms, of state of residence in the USA predicts behaviors and attitudes related to COVID-19. Because individual-level tightness may better capture current attitudes during the pandemic, whereas state-level archival measures reflect historical factors, we assessed the extent to which tightness-looseness at both levels predicted adherence to public health guidelines and biases toward outgroups related to COVID-19. In Spring 2020, 544 mTurk participants, primarily from the 13 tightest and 13 loosest states, completed survey questions about health behaviors in response to COVID-19, endorsement of future policy changes, feeling of responsibility for lives, and attitudes toward groups marginalized during the pandemic (i.e., Asians, older adults). State-level results indicated some associations with attitudes toward Asians and older adults, but effects were not robust. Results based on individuals? ratings of the tightness of their state indicated that higher levels of perceived tightness were associated with higher levels of protective self-reported public health behaviors (e.g., mask wearing, handwashing) during COVID-19, more endorsement of future policy changes to contain the pandemic, higher reported feelings of responsibility for one?s life, and stronger negative attitudes toward Asians. The relations between tightness and health outcomes persisted after controlling for political attitudes and demographics. Thus, individual, more than state, tightness-looseness accounted for some degree of public health behaviors (unique contribution of individual tightness: R2?=?.034) and attitudes toward marginalized groups (R2?=?.020) early during the COVID-19 pandemic. The implications of these findings for interventions to support behavior change or combat anti-Asian bias are discussed.","Gilliam, Ashley, Schwartz, Danielle B.; Godoy, Ricardo, Boduroglu, Aysecan, Gutchess, Angela","https://doi.org/10.1177/00220221221077710","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology;: 00220221221077710, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29958,""
"Predicting subjective well-being in a high-risk sample of Russian mental health app users","Despite recent achievements in predicting personality traits and some other human psychological features with digital traces, prediction of subjective well-being (SWB) appears to be a relatively new task with few solutions. COVID-19 pandemic has added both a stronger need for rapid SWB screening and new opportunities for it, with online mental health applications gaining popularity and accumulating large and diverse user data. Nevertheless, the few existing works so far have aimed at predicting SWB, and have done so only in terms of Dienerâ€™s Satisfaction with Life Scale. None of them analyzes the scale developed by the World Health Organization, known as WHO-5 â€“ a widely accepted tool for screening mental well-being and, specifically, for depression risk detection. Moreover, existing research is limited to English-speaking populations, and tend to use text, network and app usage types of data separately. In the current work, we cover these gaps by predicting both mentioned SWB scales on a sample of Russian mental health app users who represent a population with high risk of mental health problems. In doing so, we employ a unique combination of phone application usage data with private messaging and networking digital traces from VKontakte, the most popular social media platform in Russia. As a result, we predict Dienerâ€™s SWB scale with the state-of-the-art quality, introduce the first predictive models for WHO-5, with similar quality, and reach high accuracy in the prediction of clinically meaningful classes of the latter scale. Moreover, our feature analysis sheds light on the interrelated nature of the two studied scales: they are both characterized by negative sentiment expressed in text messages and by phone application usage in the morning hours, confirming some previous findings on subjective well-being manifestations. At the same time, SWB measured by Dienerâ€™s scale is reflected mostly in lexical features referring to social and affective interactions, while mental well-being is characterized by objective features that reflect physiological functioning, circadian rhythms and somatic conditions, thus saliently demonstrating the underlying theoretical differences between the two scales.","Panicheva, Polina, Mararitsa, Larisa, Sorokin, Semen, Koltsova, Olessia, Rosso, Paolo","https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-022-00333-x","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: EPJ Data Science; 11(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29959,""

A questionnaire used in previous research has been used after translation in a sample of 375 adults from Iran. The majority of the participants in the study have a favourable attitude towards hand washing, social distancing, self-quarantine/isolation, and governmental policies regarding COVID-19. Similarly, many people feel anxious about partying, traveling, meetings, online shopping, and social contact. Anxiety related to contracting COVID-19 infection is reported in a larger populace. Most (&gt;Â 80 percent) of the participants agree with the need for mental healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Iranian population has a favorable attitude towards the prevention of COVID-19.

"COVID-19, Financial Anxiety and the Psychological Well-being of Hotel Workers","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has inflicted unprecedented damage on the hospitality and tourism industry. However, the mental health fallout of COVID-19 on hotel employees is yet to receive empirical attention. This study, therefore, examines the consequences of COVID-19 on the psychological well-being and financial anxiety of hotel employees. An online survey distributed via a social networking site generated 173 responses, which were analyzed using descriptive statistics and PLS-SEM. The results of the study indicated that COVID-19 risk perception intensified financial anxiety among hotel employees while reducing their social functioning capability. Financial anxiety elicits psychological distress among hotel workers while weakening their social functioning. The relationship between COVID-19 risk perception and psychological distress was mediated by financial anxiety. Implications for hotel practitioners and policymakers are discussed.

"Coping with Pandemics Using Social Network Sites: A Psychological Detachment Perspective to COVID-19 Stressors","Prior research has often portrayed information technology (IT) as a stressor. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate that IT can also be an effective means of coping with life stressors, including those induced by pandemics such as COVID-19. We thus deviate from the common IT-as-a-stressor perspective and adopt an IT-as-a-coping-mechanism viewpoint. To this end, we apply the stressor-detachment model from organisational psychology to the use of social network sites (SNSs) in coping with stressors wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. We examine psychological well-being as our dependent variable and introduce psychological detachment through SNS use as a mediator and moderator of the associations between psychological well-being and two COVID-19 stressors: workâ€“family conflict and perceived isolation. We used structural equation modelling and tested this model with survey data collected from 398 professionals who were in lockdown and working from home during the pandemic. The results indicated that psychological detachment through SNS uses increased psychological well-being and that heightened workâ€“family conflict motivated this detachment strategy. In contrast, consistent with helplessness and motivationâ€“opportunity theories, perceived isolation as a stressor did not influence psychological detachment through SNS use. While perceived isolation directly reduced individual well-being, the effect of workâ€“family conflict on well-being was contingent upon users' levels of psychological detachment through SNS use. These findings suggest that while psychological detachment through SNS use is an effective means of improving one's well-being, it can be positively or negatively affected by stressors. Our study contributes to research on technology-mediated strategies for coping with stress and the psychosocial implications of global pandemics.","MÃ¤ntymÃ¤ki, Matti, Najmul Islam, A. K.

"Associations among perceived built environment, attitudes, walking behavior, and physical and mental state of college students during COVID-19","Owing to strict access control implemented on university campuses during COVID-19, college students experienced increased isolation, resulting in several physical and mental health issues. This study investigates the relationships among perceived built environment, walking attitudes, walking behavior, physical and mental state, and the impact of COVID-19. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among undergraduate students (N = 429) at Dalian University of Technology, China, on September 20 (Sunday) and 21 (Monday), 2020. The survey questionnaire included questions related to socio-demographic factors, perceived environment (accessibility, road condition and safety, and aesthetics), walking attitudes, walking behavior (number of walking trips), physical and mental state, and the impact of pandemic. Subsequently, two structural equation models (SEMs) were developed to analyze the proposed conceptual framework. The empirical results indicated that the SEMs fit the data well, thereby validating the conceptual framework. Perceived environment (especially accessibility), attitudes, and walking behavior significantly influenced physical and mental state. Perceived environment mediated the effects between attitudes and walking behavior and physical and mental state. The pandemic negatively impacted attitudes and physical and mental state. The effect of perceived accessibility on walking behavior and that of walking behavior on physical and mental state were stronger on weekends, whereas the effects of attitudes and the pandemic on physical and mental state were stronger on weekdays. The findings indicate that universities should implement appropriate strategies to improve the objective and subjective built environment, especially accessibility, and cultivate positive attitudes among students to promote walking and improve physical and mental health during COVID-19.","Liu, Meng, Zhao, Shengchuan, Li, Jingyao","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tbs.2022.04.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Travel Behaviour and Society;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29965,""
"COVID-19 PANDEMIC-RELATED POSTTRAUMATIC GROWTH IN A SMALL COHORT OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS: A 1-YEAR LONGITUDINAL STUDY","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all areas of life, with severe potential consequences for people's mental health. Posttraumatic growth (PTG), a positive psychological change that may develop following a traumatic event, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic has only received little attention.

"Avoidance of primary healthcare among transgender and non-binary people in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic","Transgender (trans) and non-binary people experience barriers to culturally competent healthcare and many have reported avoiding care. COVID-19 and related mitigation strategies may have exacerbated avoidance, and poor mental health may be bidirectionally related to avoiding care. This study estimated the prevalence of primary care avoidance during the pandemic in a national sample of trans and non-binary people in Canada with a primary care provider and examined the association between poorer self-rated mental health and avoidance. In Fall 2019, Trans PULSE Canada collected multi-mode survey data from trans and non-binary people. In September to October 2020, 820 participants completed a COVID-19-focused survey. In this cross-sectional analysis, multivariable logistic regression models estimated odds ratios adjusted for confounders and weighted to the 2019 sample. The analysis included 689 individuals with a primary healthcare provider, of whom 61.2% (95% CI: 57.2, 65.2) reported fair or poor mental health and 25.7% (95% CI: 22.3, 29.2) reported care avoidance during the pandemic. The most common reason for avoidance was having a non-urgent health concern (72.7%, 95% CI: 65.9, 79.5). In adjusted analyses, those with fair or poor mental health had higher odds of avoiding primary care as compared to those with good to excellent mental health (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]Â =Â 2.37;95% CI: 1.50, 3.77). This relationship was similar when excluding COVID-related reasons for avoidance (AORÂ =Â 2.52;95% CI: 1.52, 4.17). Expansion of virtual communication may enhance primary care accessibility, and proactively assessing mental health symptoms may facilitate connections to gender-affirming mental health services.","Tami, Abigail, Ferguson, Tatiana, Bauer, Greta R.; Scheim, Ayden I.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101789","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Preventive Medicine Reports; 27:101789, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29967,""
"Sustainable regeneration of a honeycomb carbon aerogel used as a high-capacity adsorbent for Fluoxetine removal","Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) harm ecosystems and human health. The focus is now being put on regulating discharges at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Stressful and lonely lifestyles, accentuated by the COVID-19 outbreak, have led to an increase in the consumption of antidepressants, particularly in the form of Fluoxetine (FLX). A highly effective process for the removal of PPCPs is of key importance for the economic feasibility of the process in the industry. Consequently, a high-capacity adsorption/regeneration system is crucial to solving this problem. In this study, the removal of FLX by an adsorption process and the subsequent in situ regeneration of the adsorbent was evaluated in successive cycles. NQ40 honeycomb 3D carbon aerogel was employed as a high-capacity adsorbent, obtaining uptakes of 125.24 mg/g. A detailed study of NQ40 and the mechanisms governing the adsorption process was conducted, with chemisorption and intra-particle diffusion playing the main role. A Fenton and a Fenton-like process with peroxymonosulfate (PMS) were evaluated for regeneration purposes, finding hydrogen peroxide to be more efficient in removing a high concentration of FLX. A regeneration capacity of 98.85% was achieved in the first NQ40 adsorption-regeneration cycle and 98.04% in the second one, without negatively affecting the structural characteristics of NQ40. Therefore, with a high porosity, low density, high biocompatibility, high chemical stability and 3D structural stability, this aerogel is at the forefront of novel high-capacity adsorbent materials for industrial-scale use in WWTPs.","Escudero-Curiel, Silvia, Pazos, Marta, SanromÃ¡n, Angeles","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molliq.2022.119079","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Molecular Liquids;: 119079, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29968,""
"Post-acute college student satisfaction with telepsychiatry during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives Patient satisfaction with telepsychiatry during the COVID-19 pandemic has generally been positive, but few studies have compared patient experiences across settings, and no study to date has investigated the experience of college students receiving post-acute mental health treatment in an outpatient setting. Participants The current study surveyed college student outpatients (nÂ =Â 101) to understand their experiences using telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An anonymous survey was delivered electronically and included questions regarding patientsâ€™ age, treatment length, telehealth use, and their experience and satisfaction with telepsychiatry. A mixed-methods approach was used to analyze responses between groups through Chi-Square, Kruskal-Wallis, or Mann-Whitney tests, and qualitatively to understand themes across items related to the benefits and challenges of telehealth. Results College students were more likely to utilize video-based telehealth and preferred video-based care. College students receiving medication management were much more likely to endorse telehealth being as helpful as in-person treatment. Several challenges associated with telehealth were raised in both groups. Conclusions Understanding the benefits and challenges of telepsychiatry in this high-risk college population may help enhance access to care during a critical period of development in which most psychopathology emerges.","Michaels, Timothy I.; Singal, Sonali, Marcy, Patricia, Hauser, Marta, Braider, Laura, Guinart, Daniel, Kane, John M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.03.035","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29969,""
"The role of family support and conflict in cyberbullying and subjective well-being among Chilean Adolescents during the Covid-19 period","Introduction Life satisfaction plays a crucial role in integral development and mental health during childhood and adolescence. Recently, it has been shown that cyberbullying has severe consequences for the mental health and wellbeing of victims such as increased anxiety, depressive symptoms and even suicide risk. Although the role of the family in life satisfaction and cyberbullying behaviors has been studied, there is limited information on its impacts during the current pandemic period. Objective The aim of this study is to determine the role of family variables regarding studentsâ€™ levels of life satisfaction and cyberbullying victimization during the pandemic period. Method Structural equation modeling was done using data from a cross-sectional study (n = 287;age ranged 14-18) conducted in six schools in Santiago, Chile during 2020. Results The tested model has a good fit and parsimonious adjustment. It explained 25.9% of the life satisfaction and 9% of the variance of cyberbullying victimization. Family support was positively associated with life satisfaction (p &lt; 0.001) and negatively associated with cyberbullying victimization (p &lt; 0.05). Likewise, family conflict was positively associated with levels of cyberbullying victimization (p &lt; 0.05) and negatively associated with life satisfaction levels (p &lt; 0.001). Finally, family visits were only positively associated with life satisfaction (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions Generating interventions on several levels focused on positive family bonds has become essential and urgent. This is especially important considering their protective impacts on cyberbullying victimization in promotion of adolescent well-being and quality of life.","Rodriguez-Rivas, MatÃ­as E.; Varela, Jorge J.; MarÃ­a Josefina Chuecas, Constanza GonzÃ¡lez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09243","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Heliyon;: e09243, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29970,""
"Evaluating predictive relationships between wristbands and urine for assessment of personal PAH exposure","During events like the COVID-19 pandemic or a disaster, researchers may need to switch from collecting biological samples to personal exposure samplers that are easy and safe to transport and wear, such as silicone wristbands. Previous studies have demonstrated significant correlations between urine biomarker concentrations and chemical levels in wristbands. We build upon those studies and use a novel combination of descriptive statistics and supervised statistical learning to evaluate the relationship between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in silicone wristbands and hydroxy-PAH (OH-PAH) concentrations in urine. In New York City, 109 participants in a longitudinal birth cohort wore one wristband for 48 hours and provided a spot urine sample at the end of the 48-hour period during their third trimester of pregnancy. We compared four PAHs with the corresponding seven OH-PAH using descriptive statistics, a linear regression model, and a linear discriminant analysis model. Five of the seven PAH and OH-PAH pairs had significant correlations (Pearsonâ€™s r=0.35-0.64, p=0.003) and significant chi-square tests of independence for exposure categories (p=0.009). For these five comparisons, the observed PAH or OH-PAH concentration could predict the other concentration within a factor of 1.47 for 50%-80% of the measurements (depending on the pair). Prediction accuracies for high exposure categories were at least 1.5 times higher compared to accuracies based on random chance. These results demonstrate that wristbands and urine provide similar PAH exposure assessment information, which is critical for environmental health researchers looking for the flexibility to switch between biological sample and wristband collection.","Dixon, Holly M.; Bramer, Lisa M.; Scott, Richard P.; Calero, Lehyla, Holmes, Darrell, Gibson, Elizabeth A.; Cavalier, Haleigh M.; Rohlman, Diana, Miller, Rachel L.; Calafat, Antonia M.; Kincl, Laurel, Waters, Katrina M.; Herbstman, Julie B.; Anderson, Kim A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2022.107226","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Environment International;: 107226, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29971,""
"The unique contribution of depression to cognitive impairment in Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection","Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with significant cognitive impairment and increased risk for mental health comorbidities. This study aimed to identify specific associations between cognitive impairment, self-reported disruptions in memory, and psychiatric symptoms including depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and perceived sleep concerns. Methods Data collected from all consecutive patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) who presented to a dedicated Post-COVID Clinic were used to evaluate whether certain psychiatric symptoms were more strongly associated with cognitive impairment and self-reported memory disturbances. Results Univariate and multivariable analyses revealed that depression symptom severity was significantly associated with the severity of cognitive impairment among patients with PASC. This association was driven primarily by lower performance on verbal fluency, attention, and delayed recall tasks among patients with higher depression symptoms severity. Perceived sleep concerns were an important predictor of self-reported memory disturbances. Conversely, neither PTSD symptom severity nor anxiety symptom severity were significant predictors of cognitive impairment or self-reported memory disturbances. Conclusions These findings have important clinical implications for justifying the need for screening patients with PASC for both depression and cognitive impairment.","Brown, Lily A.; Ballentine, Emily, Zhu, Yiqin, McGinley, Emily L.; Pezzin, Liliana, Abramoff, Benjamin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2022.100460","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Brain, Behavior, & Immunity - Health;: 100460, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29972,""

"Frailty and social participation in older citizens in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background This study examined the frailty status of older individuals in Japan at 1Â year after the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic based on involvement in social activities before and during the pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional study analyzed citizens aged 65 and 84 who did not require long-term care in January 2021. A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 3000 citizens in Kitaibaraki City, Japan. The questionnaire included social participation status in January 2020 and January 2021, the Kihon Checklist, working status, and economic status. We classified the respondents into the following groups: Nonparticipating, no participation at either time point;Discontinued, participation only in 2020;and Continued, participation at both time points. We compared the Discontinued and Continued groups in terms of Kihon Checklist items using the t-test. Results Of 2963 individuals who received the questionnaire, 1307 (44.1%) returned it, and 1047 were analyzed. Of the respondents analyzed, 586 (56.0%) were in the Nonparticipating group, 254 (24.3%) were in the Discontinued group, and 207 (19.8%) were in the Continued group. On the Kihon Checklist, oral function and mood differed significantly between the Discontinued and Continued groups. The proportion of those with impairment in multiple categories of the Kihon Checklist was 12.3% in the Nonparticipating group, 5.5% in the Discontinued group, and 3.4% in the Continued group. Conclusions Older individuals who continued participating in social activities at 1Â year into the COVID-19 pandemic might have a lower risk of frailty in terms of oral function and depressed mood.","Ozone, Sachiko, Goto, Ryhei, Kawada, Shogo, Yokoya, Shoji","https://doi.org/10.1002/jgf2.539","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of General and Family Medicine; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29974,""

"Drug-drug interactions between COVID-19 treatments and antidepressants, mood stabilizers/anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines: Integrated evidence from 3 databases","Introduction: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with psychiatric comorbidities leads to a scenario in which the use of psychotropic drugs may be required. This requires the support of evidence-based medicine to take into account possible interactions between antidepressants, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, and coronavirus infection treatments. Methods: Three databases were consulted: (a) Lexicomp Drug Interactions, (b) Micromedex Solutions Drugs Interactions, (c) Liverpool Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. The CredibleMeds QTDrugs List was also queried. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, anakinra, and dexamethasone - drugs used for SARS-CoV-2-were analyzed, and consensus recommendations are made. Results: The potential interactions of agomelatine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, milnacipran, and vortioxetine with COVID-19 treatments shall be considered less risky. Antidepressant interactions with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and azithromycin enhance the risk of QT prolongation, and ECG monitoring is advised for most antidepressants. Antidepressants with lopinavir/ ritonavir involve multiple CYP enzyme interactions (except with milnacipran). Gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin, topiramate, and zonisamide are safe treatment options that have no significant interactions with COVID-19 treatments. Lithium is contraindicated with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and azithromycin. Precaution should be taken in using valproic acid with lopinavir-ritonavir. The use of benzodiazepines does not present a risk of drug interaction with COVID-19 treatments, except lopinavir/ritonavir. Conclusions: Clinicians prescribing antidepressants, mood stabilizers/anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines, should be aware of the probable risk of drug-drug interaction with COVID- 19 medications and may benefit from heeding these recommendations for use to ensure patient safety.

"Risk and protective factors for psychological distress among Italian university students during the COVID-19 pandemic: The beneficial role of health engagement","Comments on an article by Julio Torales et al.(see record 2020-41079-001). Torales et al. stated that global health initiatives should be employed to manage psychosocial stressors, particularly those related to the experience of isolation and quarantine among the general population. Risk factors were assessed by ad hoc items on risk perception and concerns referred to COVID-19 pandemic, while protective factors were assessed by ad hoc items on positive attitudes and trust about the role of public institutions in managing the epidemic. Basing on these preliminary results, we may confirm that the mental health of university students is significantly affected when confronting with public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, and they require careful attention and dedicated support of the society, families and university leaders. Lessons for public institutions include the need to systematically monitor the mental health status of students and to promote educational campaign for positive public health behaviors and health engagement among them.

"Neuropsychiatric drugs against COVID-19: What is the clinical evidence?","Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, the need for effective treatments for COVID-19 led to the idea of ""repurposing"" drugs for antiviral treatment. Several antipsychotics and antidepressants have been tested for in vitro activity against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Chlorpromazine, other phenothiazine antipsychotics, and the antidepressant fluoxetine were found to be rather potent in these studies. However, whether effective plasma concentrations can be obtained with clinically accepted doses of these drugs is not clear. Data of COVID-19 patients are not yet available but several clinical studies are currently underway. The specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine is a potent Sigma-1 receptor agonist and reduces inflammation in animal models of cytokine-stress. Accordingly, fluvoxamine treatment was superior to placebo in reducing impaired respiratory function and other symptoms of inflammation in COVID-19 patients in a placebo-controlled clinical study and another open clinical trial. The beneficial effects of fluvoxamine on the course of COVID-19 were recently confirmed in a large placebo-controlled double-blind trial with several hundred patients. Inflammation represents a major risk factor for many psychiatric disorders which explains the high susceptibilitiy of COVID- 19 patients for psychiatric diseases. Many antidepressants and antipsychotics possess anti-inflammatory properties independent of sigma-1 activity which might be important to reduce psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 patients and to improve respiratory dysfunction and other consequences of inflammation. This might explain the rather unspecific benefit which has been reported for several cohorts of COVID-19 patients treated with different psychotropic drugs.

"Trends in prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms and effects of sociodemographic variables before and after the first wave of COVID-19 in Qatar","Prevalence trends from Arabic speaking countries on psychiatric symptoms before and after COVID-19 pandemic is lacking. We estimated the point prevalence and change in depression and anxiety symptoms scores in relation to sociodemographic variables following the resolution of the first wave in Qatar compared with before the pandemic. We conducted a trend analysis using repeated nationally representative cross-sectional surveys spanning 2017, 2018, 2020/2021 and using the Physician Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms. Negative binomial regression modelled changes in these symptoms in relation sociodemographics and survey year. The two-week prevalence of depressive symptoms (Ã¢â€°Â¥10 on the PHQ-9) was 6.6% in 2017 and 6.5% in 2020/2021 (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.986). The two-week prevalence of anxiety symptoms (Ã¢â€°Â¥10 or higher on the GAD-7) was 3.6% in 2018 and 5.1% in 2020/2021 (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.062). The data for 2020/21 showed a 35.1% and 29.2% decrease in depression and anxiety symptoms scores compared to pre-pandemic years (2017/2018) after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Screening tools rather than structured interviews were to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence for depression and anxiety post the first COVID wave did not differ significantly to pre-pandemic estimates. The end of the first wave of the pandemic had a 'levelling' effect on these symptoms and their associations with traditional sociodemographic risk factors.

"The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental and Emotional Health of Athletes: A Systematic Review","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the cancellation or postponement of virtually every sporting event, resulting in training disruptions, income loss, and career uncertainties for athletes around the world. At present, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental and emotional health of athletes is not well understood. To investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental and emotional health of athletes and to identify risk factors associated with poor mental health outcomes. Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify all articles reporting on athletes' mental and emotional health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Articles were selected based on relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study characteristics, athlete demographics, and COVID-19 mental health data (sex-, type of sport-, and level of play-specific differences) were collected from each included article and analyzed. A total of 35 studies were included in the final analysis, comprising athletes around the world and across numerous sports and levels of play. Most studies utilized at least 1 validated mental health questionnaire and assessed for outcomes such as depression, anxiety, stress, motivation, and athletic identity. Overall, athletes reported worse mental and emotional health during the COVID-19 pandemic, although these effects were attenuated by home training programs and quarantine training camps. Female sex and more elite levels of play were associated with an increased risk for poor mental health outcomes. Type of sport was associated with mixed results, with individual and team sports carrying different increased risks for poor mental and emotional health. Nearly all studies recommended the need for increased psychological support of athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental and emotional health of athletes is complex and multifaceted. Increased social interactions with coaches and teammates, continued access to training facilities and mental health professionals, and active utilization of healthy coping mechanisms can improve mental health outcomes for athletes in the era of COVID-19.","Jia, Carter, Cusano, Li, Kelly, Bartley, Parisien","https://doi.org/10.1177/03635465221087473","20220412","anxiety; athletes; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29983,""
"Depression and stress regarding future career among university students during COVID-19 pandemic","Students generally struggle to build a good career after their graduation in developing countries like Bangladesh. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such struggle increased and faced with stress and depression. We aimed to inquire about the amplitude of depression and stress among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding their future careers and to identify the factors associated with this depression and stress. A total of 516 students at various universities participated in this cross-sectional survey. From October 2020 to February 2021, data was collected through an online survey. An e-questionnaire with socio-demographic, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) questions was created using Google Forms and distributed via Facebook, WhatsApp, and other social media platforms. The universities included into the sample were selected randomly from eight divisions of Bangladesh. Descriptive statistics and Pearson chi-square tests were carried out and the association between the risk factors and the outcome (e.g. depression and stress) was assessed by the odds ratio (OR) including 95% confidence interval (CI) obtained from the binary logistic regression model. Among 516 participants, 380 (73.6%) were male and 136 (26.4%) were female. Around 414 (80.2%) participants had mild to severe depression and 399 (77.3%) reported having low to moderately perceived stress. Female students were 2.1 (95% CI: 1.21-3.76) times more depressed and 3.6 (95% CI: 1.87-6.76) times more stressed than the counterpart. Students, who think delaying graduation due to COVID-19 will reduce the chance of getting a job, were 1.72 (95% CI: 1.07-2.76) times more depressed. Respondents, whose department offers any internship were 36% less depressed (p = 0.053), while skilled students were 46% less stressed though it was not statistically significant (p = 0.43). According to our findings, there is an increasing prevalence of depression and stress among students, particularly among female students and those who do not receive job-related facilities from their institutions or who are unskilled. Universities can provide mental health programs and strive to have enough space for students to participate in internships. In addition, the government and educational institutions should work together to address the growing challenge.","Chowdhury, Suvro, Farhan, Uddin","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266686","20220412","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29984,""
"The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on pain and psychological functioning in young adults with chronic pain","Data are equivocal on the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic on pain and well-being for individuals with chronic pain. Furthermore, little is known regarding its impact on the health of young adults with chronic pain. We conducted a longitudinal study to compare pain, psychological functioning, and substance use before and during the pandemic of 196 young adults with chronic pain. Participants aged 18 to 24 years (M = 21.1 years; 79.6% females) reported on pain, anxiety, depression, and substance use before (October 2018-August 2019) and during the pandemic (October 2020-November 2020), in addition to the assessment of COVID-19 exposure and its impact. Before the pandemic, young adults experienced mild-to-moderate pain intensity (M = 3.75, SD = 2.33) and pain interference (M = 3.44, SD = 2.69). Findings were that pain intensity, pain interference, and depression symptoms remained stable during the pandemic. In contrast, anxiety symptoms increased significantly (M = 8.21, SD = 5.84 vs M = 8.89, SD = 5.95, P = 0.04). Tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis use were unchanged. Mixed linear models revealed that COVID-19 exposure and impact were not associated with changes in pain intensity or interference, with female sex associated with increased pain intensity (ÃŽÂ² = 0.86, P = 0.02) and pain interference (ÃŽÂ² = 0.87, P = 0.02). Our findings indicated relative stability of pain symptoms experienced by young adults with chronic pain. However, the increases in anxiety highlight the need to facilitate treatment access for mental health services to mitigate downstream impact.","Tham, Murray, Law, Slack, Palermo","https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002618","20220412","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29985,""
"Gaming disorder and the COVID-19 pandemic: Treatment demand and service delivery challenges","Gaming activities have conferred numerous benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some individuals may be at greater risk of problem gaming due to disruption to adaptive routines, increased anxiety and/or depression, and social isolation. This paper presents a summary of 2019-2021 service data from specialist addiction centers in Germany, Switzerland, Japan, and the United Kingdom.

"The development and usability of a video game to attenuate pandemic-related stress using an equity lens","The emergence of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has introduced additional pressures on an already fragile mental healthcare system due to significant rise in depression, anxiety and stress among Canadians. While Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is known to be an efficacious treatment to reduce such mental health issues, few people have access to it in an engaging and sustainable manner. To address this gap, a collaboration between The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) developed CBT based self-led, online, clinician-tested modules in the form of a video game, Legend of Evelys, and evaluated its usability in the attenuation of COVID-19 related increase in stress. We discuss the conceptualization and design of new self-care modules in form of a video game, its implementation in a technological infrastructure, and inclusivity and privacy considerations that informed the development of the video game. A usability study of the modules was conducted to assess the video game's usability, user engagement and user perceptions of the video game. The development of the video game involved establishment of a technology infrastructure for secure implementation of the software for the video game modules and a clinician-led assessment of the clinical utility of these modules through two ""whiteboard"" sessions. The usability study was informed by a mix-method sequential explanatory design to evaluate the intervention of the mobile application through two distinct phases including a quantitative data collection analysis using in-application analytics data and two surveys followed by a qualitative data collection by semi-structured interviews. A total of 32 participants trialed the app for two weeks. They used the video game an average of six times and rated the game as good based on the Systems Usability Score. In terms of stress reduction, the study demonstrated a significant difference in the participants' Perceived Stress Score at baseline (mean 22.14, SD 6.187) compared to the two week follow-up (mean 18.04, SD 6.083); t(27)=3.628, P=.001. Qualitative interviews helped participants identify numerous functionality issues and provided specific recommendations, most of which were successfully integrated into the video game for future release. Through this collaboration, we have established that it is possible to incorporate CBT exercises into a video game and have these exercises adopted, to address stress. While video games are a promising strategy to help people with their stress and anxiety, there is a further need to examine the real-world effectiveness of the Legend of Evelys in reducing anxiety.","Minian, Saiva, Gayapersad, Dragonetti, Proulx, Debergue, Lecce, Hussain, Desjardins, Selby","https://doi.org/10.2196/36820","20220412","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29987,""
"Effect of Psychological Intervention on Perceived Stress and Positive Psychological Traits Among Nursing Students: Findings During the COVID-19 Pandemic","High levels of perceived stress and deterioration of positive psychological traits concomitant with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic have endangered the health and academic achievement of nursing students. Effective intervention research in this area should be performed as soon as possible. In the current study, a 15-month trial involving nursing students recruited from a medical university was conducted, in which an experimental group (<i>n</i> = 126) received the Three Good Things exercise based on social network groups. Two follow ups were performed. There was no intervention in the control group.

"The Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown Announcements on Mental Health: Quasi-Natural Experiment in Lombardy, Italy","Evidence showed that mental health problems have risen markedly during COVID-19. It is unclear if part of the mental sufferings relates to the climate of uncertainty and confusion originated by rough communication by health officials and politicians. Here we test the impact of unanticipated policy announcements of lockdown policies on mental health of the older population. We used a representative telephone-based survey of 4,400 people aged 65Ã¢â‚¬â€°years or older in Italy's Lombardy region to compare information on self-reported symptoms of anxiety, depression, and poor-quality sleep of subjects interviewed on the days of policy announcement with that of subjects interviewed on other days. We used regression models adjusting for potential socio-demographic confounders as well study design with inverse probability weighting. On days when policy makers announced to extend the lockdown, mental health deteriorated on average by 5.5 percentage points [95% CI: 1.1 to 9.8] for self-reported anxiety symptoms and 5.1 percentage points [95% CI: 2.7 to 7.4] for self-reported depressive symptoms. The effect of announcement to shorten the lockdown is more moderate but statistically significant. These associations were short term in duration; after just one day, self-reported mental health and sleep quality return to levels better than pre-announcement until a new policy change. Our research shows that lockdown policy announcements are associated with short term worsening in mental distress, highlighting the importance of appropriate communication strategies and political determinations in crisis times.","Wang, Lugo, Amerio, d'Oro, Iacoviello, Odone, Zucchi, Gallus, Stuckler, Gallus, Bosetti, Jarach, Lugo, Stival, Serafini, Amerio, Amore, Stuckler, De Sena, Ghislandi, Wang, Iacoviello, Bonaccio, Gianfagna, Ghulam, Odone, Signorelli, Bertuccio, Mosconi, Vigezzi, Cavalieri d'Oro, Rognoni, Scala, Zucchi, Ciampichini","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckac035","20220412","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; lockdown; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29989,""
"Applications of peer support in disasters: connecting in times of disaster","Disasters invariably result in a surge in demand for mental health services, and this surge quickly exceeds available mental health resources. The pursuit of alternative sources of psychological support for communities adversely affected by disasters has therefore been necessitated. This paper describes the application of an awarding-winner, empirically validated, model for psychological support and its applicability for enhancing community disaster mental health resources that are consistent with United Nations' recommendations for a ""whole society"" approach to disaster mental health. The model utilises the concept of peer-based psychological support. Peer psychological support is defined as the utilisation of individuals specially trained in the provision of acute psychological crisis interventions and psychological first aid, but who do not possess professional-level training or licensure in one of the mental health disciplines. These peer-based crisis intervention services may be delivered telephonically, via the internet, or face-to-face. This model, referred to as Reciprocal Peer Support (RPS), is the peer support activity provided at Rutgers University Behavioural HealthCare (UBHC) National Center for Peer Support in a variety of peer programs. More than 20Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of peer support interventions have been reviewed and assessed to clarify the lessons learned for the application of RPS as a prime exemplar for the utilization of peer support during and after a disaster. The Cop 2 Cop, NJ Vet 2 Vet, and several other UBHC peer support programs, which conform to best practices criteria, have been created, sustained, and expanded based on the RSP principles discussed in this article. RPS and derivative applications for human-made disasters such as the terrorist events of 9/11/2001 as well as natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina or the COVID- 19 pandemic represent platforms for the implementation of peer psychological support and the establishment of a peer-based continuum of psychological connection.","Castellano","https://doi.org/10.1080/09540261.2021.2011160","20220412","RPS; Reciprocal peer support; peer intervention; peer postvention crisis intervention; peer prevention; peer support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29990,""
"EAP 20: reimagining the role of the employee assistance program in the new workplace","Mental illness is a highly prevalent problem that affects millions of individuals. Like many other previous natural disasters and terrorist attacks, the recent Covid-19 pandemic has placed an enormous stress on the world and its workforce. In many ways the pandemic revealed gaps in the quality and availability of mental health resources, and, by magnifying the intense demand, it also spurred innovation. Telemedicine and virtual trauma-related services became examples of ways in which evaluation, treatment and counselling services could be delivered directly and efficiently to people who were confined to their dwellings and hospital beds. For many, the workplace has been a source of stress but also a vital component of one's self-worth, day-to-day purpose, and a resource for wellness programs and brief counselling services, not to mention, at least in many countries like the United States, a source for health insurance. The employee assistance program (EAP) is an example of a workplace-counselling and triage service that has enormous potential to meet the growing needs of individuals both in 'normal' times and during disasters. By better understanding the EAP's current structure alongside the advent of new technologies, it may be possible to develop a new and improved EAP model to meet a changing global landscape. For EAP to succeed and ultimately be scalable in an increasingly competitive and value-conscious marketplace, its processes of care will first require a bottom-up review with meaningful outcomes data. This will be necessary to drive continuous quality improvement and to demonstrate EAP 2.0's value to both employer and employee alike.","Langlieb, Langlieb, Xiong","https://doi.org/10.1080/09540261.2021.2013172","20220412","Occupational psychiatry; disaster mental health; employee assistance program; organisational;; psychology; workplace mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29991,""
"The effects of mandatory home quarantine on mental health in a community sample during the COVID-19 pandemic","Major public and scientific interest exists on, whether quarantine as a containment measure, could have adverse effects on individual's mental health. We investigated psychic well-being and distress, symptoms of depression and anxiety among individuals imposed to home quarantine. By total population sampling in a Finnish suburban city, a total of 57 quarantined cases (participation rate 97%) were identified and followed up for two weeks until expiration of the quarantine. A randomized control group (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°53) was formed of people seeking laboratory testing for suspected Sars-CoV-2 infection. Primary outcome was the psychic well-being and distress experienced during quarantine measured by the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure (CORE-OM). The cases were followed up by the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-10 (CORE-10), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and by the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS). The median CORE-OM score for the cases was 3.53 (95% CI: 2.23-4.66), and for the controls 3.24 (1.76-3.82), being mostly in the nonclinical to mild range. The difference between the groups was statistically nonsignificant (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.19). Higher levels of psychic distress were explained by previous psychiatric disorders and living alone, but not having been quarantined. In comparison to controls, the quarantined participants experienced significantly, but slightly lower level of life functioning. At the follow-up, the quarantined participants rated further low on the CORE-10 (median 2.00; 95% CI: 1.00-3.00), the PHQ-9 (1.50; 0.00-3.00), and the OASIS (0.00; 0.00-0.00).

Data were from population-based cohorts of older adults participating in the 2020 Health, Work and Retirement longitudinal survey (<i>n</i> = 3839, 17.4% informal caregivers). Changes in symptoms of depression and anxiety over 2018-2020 surveys associated with sociodemographic factors, caregiving, cohabitation with the care recipient, assistance provided with activities of daily living, support in providing care, and opportunity cost of care were assessed. Increased depression, but not anxiety, was associated with providing informal care. Among caregivers, lower living standards and cohabitation were associated with increased depression. Lower living standards, unemployment, and lower help from friend/family networks were associated with increased anxiety.

"Mental health symptoms in children and adolescents during COVID-19 in Australia","COVID-19 has led to disruptions to the lives of Australian families through social distancing, school closures, a temporary move to home-based online learning, and effective lockdown. Understanding the effects on child and adolescent mental health is important to inform policies to support communities as they continue to face the pandemic and future crises. This paper sought to report on mental health symptoms in Australian children and adolescents during the initial stages of the pandemic (May to November 2020) and to examine their association with child/family characteristics and exposure to the broad COVID-19 environment. An online baseline survey was completed by 1327 parents and carers of Australian children aged 4 to 17Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. Parents/carers reported on their child's mental health using five measures, including emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms. Child/family characteristics and COVID-related variables were measured. Overall, 30.5%, 26.3% and 9.5% of our sample scored in the high to very high range for emotional symptoms, conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention, respectively. Similarly, 20.2% and 20.4% of our sample scored in the clinical range for anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms, respectively. A child's pre-existing mental health diagnosis, neurodevelopmental condition and chronic illness significantly predicted parent-reported child and adolescent mental health symptoms. Parental mental health symptoms, having a close contact with COVID-19 and applying for government financial assistance during COVID-19, were significantly associated with child and adolescent mental health symptoms. Our findings show that Australian children and adolescents experienced considerable levels of mental health symptoms during the initial phase of COVID-19. This highlights the need for targeted and effective support for affected youth, particularly for those with pre-existing vulnerabilities.","Sicouri, March, Pellicano, De Young, Donovan, Cobham, Rowe, Brett, Russell, Uhlman, Hudson","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221090174","20220412","COVID-19; Child; adolescent; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29994,""
"COVID-19 in Long-Term Care Facilities: A Rapid Review of Infection Correlates and Impacts on Mental Health and Behaviors","Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) with compact, group-living arrangements have become COVID-19 hot spots during the pandemic. Systematic research is needed to understand factors associated with COVID-19 infections in LTCFs and the inadvertent effects of preventive measures adopted by LTCFs. This rapid review identifies factors associated with LTCF residents' COVID-19 infections and the impacts of the pandemic and the corresponding preventive measures on residents' mental health and behavioral problems. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines, we identified and reviewed relevant literature in Medline, PsycINFO, and AgeLine. Thirty-seven articles were identified and reviewed, including 30 reporting factors associated with COVID-19 infections in LTCFs and seven reporting the impact of the pandemic and corresponding prevention measures on LTCF residents. Results revealed four domains of factors associated with COVID-19 infections: facility physical environments, resident characteristics, facility management and testing, and community factors. The pandemic and infection control measures increased residents' depression, anxiety, loneliness, and behavioral problems (e.g., agitation, hallucinations). Residents without cognitive impairments were more vulnerable to these adverse effects. LTCF managers/policymakers and healthcare designers can help mitigate COVID-19 infections by (1) providing additional resources to vulnerable LTCFs; (2) enhancing the training of personal protective equipment use and guideline compliance; and (3) investing in amenities, such as sinks, quarantine rooms, and outdoor spaces. Digital activities and accessible green spaces can mitigate mental health and behavior issues. Future LTCF design can benefit from flexible spaces, natural ventilation, and reducing crowding.","Yang, Rigsby, Zhu, Lee, Ory","https://doi.org/10.1177/19375867221092149","20220412","COVID-19; behavioral problems; infection control; long-term care facilities; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29995,""
"Trends of Internet Search Volumes for Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Korea: An Interrupted Time-Series Analysis","The effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on public mental health has been increasing. Additionally, the underlying psychological stressors remain unexplored, and few studies have been conducted nationally on the social distancing measures. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the psychological impacts of the implementation of social distancing measures by analyzing the Internet search trends of major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms. Using Naver<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> Trends' relative search volumes (RSVs), we analyzed the average search volumes and trend changes of 16 terms, adopted from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 criteria for diagnosing MDD. An interrupted time-series analysis was performed using the data from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020. Furthermore, changes in RSVs, according to the intensity of the social distancing measures implemented from January 1 to December 31, 2020, were determined using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Of the 16 terms, the search trends of 'feeling guilty' (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and 'wanting to die' (<i>P</i> = 0.002) showed a significant increase as of February 29, 2020, when the social distancing measures were officially implemented. Additionally, the average search volumes for 'hopelessness' (<i>P</i> = 0.003), 'sexual desire' (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), 'insomnia' (<i>P</i> = 0.002), 'hypersomnia' (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), 'restlessness' (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and 'feeling lethargic' (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) increased significantly. Moreover, gender analysis showed that the average search volume of 'depressed mood' (<i>P</i> = 0.033) and the trend of 'impaired concentration' (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) increased in males only. However, the average search volume of 'feeling lethargic' (<i>P</i> = 0.001) and the trend of 'feeling guilty' (<i>P</i> = 0.001) increased in females only. The average search volumes for 'depressed mood' (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), 'impaired concentration' (<i>P</i> = 0.038), and 'indecisiveness' (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher during the enforcement of level 2 or higher social distancing measures.

Moreover, the findings suggested the utility of Naver Trends as a feasible big data source to assess future mental health crises.","Kim, Han, Chun","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2022.37.e108","20220412","COVID-19; Interrupted Time-Series Analysis; Major Depressive Disorder; Physical Distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29996,""
"COVID-19 vaccination did not improve employee mental health: A prospective study in an early phase of vaccination in Japan","This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of vaccination to improve mental health among employees in Japan based on a prospective study. The data were retrieved from the Employee Cohort Study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan (E- COCO-J) at T1 (4-10 February 2021) and T2 (22-29 June 2021). Psychological distress was measured by using an 18-item scale of the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ). The analytic sample was limited to individuals employed at both T1 and T2 without missing covariates. Vaccination status was measured at T2. Statistical analysis was conducted to test the differential change in the psychological distress at T1 and T2 with the timeÃ‚Â Ãƒâ€”Ã‚Â group interactions by using repeated ANOVA, adjusting for the covariates (gender, age, marital status, education, chronic disease, company size, industry, and occupation). Of the total sample (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 948), 105 (11.1%) were vaccinated at least once at T2. The crude mean scores of psychological distress at T1 and T2 were 41.8 and 42.0 for vaccinated participants and 41.2 and 41.2 for nonvaccinated participants, respectively, with no significant effect of having been vaccinated (Cohen's dÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.833). After adjusting the covariates, there was no significance (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.446). The COVID-19 vaccination was supposed to have a limited effect on mental health among Japanese employees in an early phase of vaccination. To keep providing mental health care for employees is important even after starting the vaccination program.","Sasaki, Kuroda, Tsuno, Imamura, Kawakami","https://doi.org/10.1002/npr2.12250","20220412","SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; depression; epidemiology; occupational health; prevention; public health; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29997,""
"Job satisfaction, performance appraisal, reinforcement and job tasks in medical healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak","Medical healthcare profession is under immense stress since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak on global scale, and medical healthcare professionals are enduring occupational challenges which entail frontline and non-frontline duties, appraisal and satisfaction with their job. The present study examined perceived job satisfaction as a mediating variable that affects the relationship between performance appraisal and reinforcement on performing job tasks among medical healthcare professionals during COVID-19. A sample (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 550) was selected from public and private hospitals' medical healthcare professionals (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 300 males, and nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 250 females). The results showed that perceived job satisfaction mediates the relationship between performance appraisal and reinforcement on job tasks in medical healthcare professionals. This study could help stakeholders, medical board regulations, mental health practitioners, employers and employees to increment sources which could establish feasible healthcare planning and management.

"Racial Discrimination, Mental Health and Behavioral Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: a National Survey in the United States","While hate crimes rose during the COVID-19 pandemic, few studies examined whether this pandemic-time racial discrimination has led to negative health consequences at the population level. We examined whether experienced and perceived racial discrimination were associated with mental or behavioral health outcomes during the pandemic. In October 2020, we conducted a national survey with minorities oversampled that covered respondents' sociodemographic background and health-related information. A total of 2709 participants responded to the survey (response rate: 4.2%). The exposure variables included (1) experienced and encountered racial discrimination, (2) experienced racial and ethnic cyberbullying, and (3) perceived racial bias. Mental health outcomes were measured by psychological distress and self-rated happiness. Measures for behavioral health included sleep quality, change in cigarette smoking, and change in alcohol consumption. Weighted logistic regressions were performed to estimate the associations between the exposure variables and the outcomes, controlling for age, gender, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, household income, eligibility to vote, political party, COVID-19 infection, and geographic region. Separate regressions were performed in the six racial and ethnic subgroups: non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, East Asian, South Asian, and Southeast Asian respondents. Experienced racial discrimination was associated with higher likelihood of psychological distress (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.18, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.34-3.55). Experienced racial discrimination (AOR = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.34-3.99) and perceived racial bias (AOR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00-1.09) were both associated with increased cigarette smoking. The associations between racial discrimination and mental distress and substance use were most salient among Black, East Asian, South Asian, and Hispanic respondents. Racial discrimination may be associated with higher likelihood of distress, and cigarette smoking among racial and ethnic minorities. Addressing racial discrimination is important for mitigating negative mental and behavioral health ramifications of the pandemic.","Shi, Zhang, Martin, Chen, Li, Han, Wen, Chen, Li, Li, Chen, Ramos, King, Michaud, Su","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-022-07540-2","20220412","COVID-19; cyberbully; mental health; pandemic; racial bias; racial discrimination; substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",29999,""
"Harmonizing Implementation and Outcome Data Across HIV Prevention and Care Studies in Resource-Constrained Settings","Harmonizing measures across studies can facilitate comparisons and strengthen the science, but procedures for establishing common data elements are rarely documented. We detail a rigorous, 2-year process to harmonize measures across the Prevention And Treatment through a Comprehensive Care Continuum for HIV-affected Adolescents in Resource Constrained Settings (PATC<sup>3</sup>H) consortium, consisting of eight federally-funded studies. We created a repository of measured constructs from each study, classified and selected constructs for harmonization, and identified survey instruments. Measures were harmonized for implementation science,Ã‚Â HIV prevention and care, demographics and sexual behavior, mental health and substance use, and economic assessment. Importantly, we present our harmonized implementation science constructs. A common set of implementation science constructs have yet to be recommended in the literature for low-to-middle-income countries despite increasing recognition of their importance to delivering and scaling up effective interventions. Drawing on RE-AIM (Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance) and the Implementation Outcomes Framework, items were harmonized for staff/administrators and study participants to measure reach, adoption, implementation, maintenance, feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and fidelity. The process undertaken to harmonize measures and the codified set of implementation science measures developed by our consortium can inform future data harmonization efforts, critical to strengthening the replication and generalizability of findings while facilitating collaborative research-especially in resource-limited settings. We conclude with recommendations for research consortia, namely ensuring representation from all study teams and research priorities; adopting a flexible, transparent, and systematic approach; strengthening the literature on implementation science harmonization; and being responsive to life events (e.g., COVID-19).

"Prolonged Lockdown due to COVID-19 Alters Sleep-Wake Timings and Negatively Affects Self-esteem, Personality, Depression and Anxiety in College-Going Indian Students","COVID-19 forced the shutdown of colleges and socialization around the world including India and prolonged lockdown could have a significant impact on sleep, mood, emotion and anxiety in students. Here, we designed a survey to assess the effect of lockdown on sleep-wake, self-esteem, depression and anxiety via the survey on 321 Indian college-going students. We assessed the effect of lockdown on sleep-wake (wake up, get up, bed and sleep timing, total time in bed and sleep duration) and self-esteem and depression on students via various questions. We found that students delayed sleep timing by 1Ã‚Â h in lockdown than pre-lockdown days. Specifically, urban male populations were late sleeper than any other group. However, total sleep duration did not differ between groups. In self-esteem questions, most students agreed that they were of no good, felt nervous, displeased, and frustrated about performance in lockdown. Depression and anxiety questionnaire gave more significant results related to mood and mental health. More than 50% of students agreed that they faced a lack of concentration, had been feeling irritated and angry, felt fatigued and tired, and everything had been a failure during lockdown days. Overall, the survey suggests that lack of social life and prolonged lockdown affect the sleep-wake cycle, self-esteem, anxiety and depression of Indian students.

"Neuromodulation through brain stimulation-assisted cognitive training in patients with post-COVID-19 cognitive impairment (Neuromod-COV): study protocol for a PROBE phase IIb trial","A substantial number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 experience long-term persistent symptoms. First evidence suggests that long-term symptoms develop largely independently of disease severity and include, among others, cognitive impairment. For these symptoms, there are currently no validated therapeutic approaches available. Cognitive training interventions are a promising approach to counteract cognitive impairment. Combining training with concurrent transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may further increase and sustain behavioural training effects. Here, we aim to examine the effects of cognitive training alone or in combination with tDCS on cognitive performance, quality of life and mental health in patients with post-COVID-19 subjective or objective cognitive impairments. This study protocol describes a prospective randomised open endpoint-blinded trial. Patients with post-COVID-19 cognitive impairment will either participate in a 3-week cognitive training or in a defined muscle relaxation training (open-label interventions). Irrespective of their primary intervention, half of the cognitive training group will additionally receive anodal tDCS, all other patients will receive sham tDCS (double-blinded, secondary intervention). The primary outcome will be improvement of working memory performance, operationalised by an n-back task, at the postintervention assessment. Secondary outcomes will include performance on trained and untrained tasks and measures of health-related quality of life at postassessment and follow-up assessments (1 month after the end of the trainings). Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of the University Medicine Greifswald (number: BB 066/21).

"Optimising respiratory support for early COVID-19 pneumonia: a computational modelling study","Optimal respiratory support in early COVID-19 pneumonia is controversial and remains unclear. Using computational modelling, we examined whether lung injury might be exacerbated in early COVID-19 by assessing the impact of conventional oxygen therapy (COT), high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNOT), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Using an established multi-compartmental cardiopulmonary simulator, we first modelled COT at a fixed FiO<sub>2</sub> (0.6) with elevated respiratory effort for 30 min in 120 spontaneously breathing patients, before initiating HFNOT, CPAP, or NIV. Respiratory effort was then reduced progressively over 30-min intervals. Oxygenation, respiratory effort, and lung stress/strain were quantified. Lung-protective mechanical ventilation was also simulated in the same cohort. HFNOT, CPAP, and NIV improved oxygenation compared with conventional therapy, but also initially increased total lung stress and strain. Improved oxygenation with CPAP reduced respiratory effort but lung stress/strain remained elevated for CPAP &gt;5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. With reduced respiratory effort, HFNOT maintained better oxygenation and reduced total lung stress, with no increase in total lung strain. Compared with 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O PEEP, 4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O PEEP in NIV reduced total lung stress, but high total lung strain persisted even with less respiratory effort. Lung-protective mechanical ventilation improved oxygenation while minimising lung injury. The failure of noninvasive ventilatory support to reduce respiratory effort may exacerbate pulmonary injury in patients with early COVID-19 pneumonia. HFNOT reduces lung strain and achieves similar oxygenation to CPAP/NIV. Invasive mechanical ventilation may be less injurious than noninvasive support in patients with high respiratory effort.","Weaver, Das, Saffaran, Yehya, Chikhani, Scott, Laffey, Hardman, Camporota, Bates","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2022.02.037","20220412","COVID-19; acute respiratory failure; computational modelling; mechanical ventilation; noninvasive respiratory support; patient self-inflicted lung injury","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30004,""
"Depressive Symptoms and Coping Strategies in Community-Dwelling Older People Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mixed-Method Study","This study aimed to examine depressive symptoms of community-dwelling older people amidst COVID-19 and explore how naturally occurring coping strategies were associated with depression. A mixed-method cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted with 375 older people aged 60Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and above between March and May 2020 in Hong Kong. Trained social workers interviewed participants and assessed depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Attribute coding and thematic analysis were adopted for qualitative data analyses. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to examine the effects of demographics, self-reported risk factors and coping strategies on PHQ-9 scores. Participants' average PHQ-9 score was 1.9 (<i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.9), suggesting a low risk for depression in general. Over half of the participants reported adaptive coping strategies, including learning new things, staying physically, mentally, and socially active, and having a positive mind-set. GLM results indicated that living with family members (other than spouse) and/or others, maladaptive coping, and self-reported risk factors were significantly associated with higher PHQ-9 scores, while adaptive coping was significantly associated with lower PHQ-9 scores.

"Food Insecurity and Mental Well-Being Among Low-Income Families During COVID-19 Pandemic","To examine the interaction effects of adult and child food insecurity on parents' and children's mental well-being. An online survey study was conducted. Two Head Start organizations and the Qualtrics Panel. Four hundred and eight parents under poverty level and having a child aged 3-5Ã‚Â years participated. Food insecurity was assessed by the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module. Parents' stress, anxiety and depression; and children's sadness, fear, anger, and positive affect were measured using instruments from HealthMeasures. Multivariate general linear models were performed in SPSS. Mean age was 31Ã‚Â years, 17% Hispanic, 21% Black. About 51% parents and 37% children were food insecure. After adjusting for demographics and child food insecurity, parents with adult food insecurity had higher stress (<i>B</i> = 2.65, <i>p</i> = .002), anxiety (<i>B</i> = 3.02, <i>p</i> = .001), and depression (<i>B</i> = 3.66, <i>p</i> = .001); and fear in their children (<i>B</i> = 5.03, <i>p</i> = .002) than those without adult food insecurity. Similarly, parents reporting child food insecurity had greater depression than those having no child food insecurity (<i>B</i> = 4.61, <i>p</i> = .020). Black parents had lower stress (<i>B</i> = -1.91, <i>p</i> = .018), anxiety (<i>B</i> = -2.26, <i>p</i> = .012), and depression (<i>B</i> = -4.17, <i>p</i> &lt; .001) than their White counterparts.

"Challenges and adaptations to public involvement with marginalised groups during the COVID-19 pandemic: commentary with illustrative case studies in the context of patient safety research","Patient and public involvement (PPI) is integral to research on patient safety in the NIHR Greater Manchester Patient Safety Translational Research Centre (NIHR GMPSTRC), and is central to our patient safety research within our theme focusing on people in marginalised groups. Due to the impact of COVID-19, researchers had to adapt how they do PPI. For marginalised groups, remote working and digital adaptations (the key adaptations made in accessing and utilising health services in the United Kingdom during COVID-19) can potentially lead to further marginalisation of people already marginalised and provide new barriers to others. This editorial showcases three case examples of PPI with marginalised groups during COVID-19, these are with: (1) adults with vision impairments, (2) adults and carers with lived experience of self-harm and/ or suicide and (3) adults with lived experience of homelessness. In these case examples, we focus on challenges relating to key aspects of PPI during the pandemic. First, setting up a PPI advisory group and secondly maintaining relationships and effective PPI with a pre-existing advisory group. We contrast these examples using more traditional ways of 'doing PPI' i.e. involving public contributors in various stages of the research cycle, with a more fully 'co-produced' approach to research when developing a new patient safety intervention. Important considerations for PPI with marginalised groups during COVID-19 include: how to avoid exacerbating the digital divide when using video conferencing for PPI, the need for enhanced awareness around flexibility and resources, and the value of working closely with specialist charities to enable adaptations that are sensitive to the changed circumstances and needs of PPI contributors. The National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Greater Manchester Patient Safety Translational research Centre (GMPSTRC) carries out research to improve patient safety. We work in partnership with patients and members of the public to plan, manage, design, and carry out the research. This is labelled as patient and public involvement. A key area of GMPSTRC research focuses on people who may be marginalised from healthcare and potentially suffer increased patient safety risks relative to the general population. COVID-19 impacted on research in multiple ways, notably how researchers work with members of the public. Remote working via the use of internet enabled technology has now become more commonplace, although this raises concerns about digital exclusion and how to address barriers when face-to-face PPI is not possible. This article showcases three examples of how researchers and public contributors with lived experience have adapted to working together during the COVID-19 pandemic. These case examples are: (1) setting up a public involvement group for developing an intervention to reduce medication errors for adults with vision impairments; (2) working with a pre-existing group of public contributors who are adults and carers with lived experience of self-harm and/or suicide; and (3) working with a charity called Groundswell who train and support researchers with lived experience of homelessness. Challenges during COVID-19 have been making video conferencing meetings accessible to members who have a range of different needs, and addressing the digital divide by allowing members flexibility in how they contribute to research. The article provides examples of how these challenges were addressed.","Adeyemi, Sanders, Ong, Howells, Quinlivan, Gorman, Giles, Amp, Monaghan, Naseem, Pearson, Cheraghi-Sohi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40900-022-00345-x","20220412","Marginalised groups; Patient and public involvement; Patient safety; Reflections","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30007,""
"Mitigating psychological distress in healthcare workers as COVID-19 waves ensue: a repeated cross-sectional study from Jordan","Jordan has experienced several COVID-19 waves in the past 2 years. Cross-sectional studies have been conducted to evaluate distress in healthcare practitioners (HCPs), but there is limited evidence with regards to the impact of continuing pandemic waves on levels of distress in HCPs. We previously studied psychological distress in HCPs during the start of the pandemic (period 1, when cases were infrequent and the country was in lockdown), and demonstrated that HCPs were experiencing considerable stress, despite the country reporting low caseloads at the time. In this study, we sought to utilize the same methodology to reexamine levels of distress as COVID-19 peaked in the country and HCPs began managing large numbers of COVID-19 cases (period 2). A cross-sectional online survey utilizing a tool previously used during period 1 was completed by HCPs working in various settings. Demographic, professional and psychological factors such as distress, anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep issues, exhaustion, and fear were assessed; and coping strategies also were measured. Items in the tool were assessed for reliability and validity. A multivariable regression was used to identify factors that continued to impact distress during period 2. Samples in both periods (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°937, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°876, respectively) were relatively comparable in demographic characteristics, but in period 2, a greater proportion of nurses and healthcare practitioners reported working in general hospitals. During the pandemic peak (period 2), 49.0% of HCPs reported high levels of distress (compared to 32% in period 1); anxiety and depression scores were approximately 21% higher in period 2; and 50.6% reported fatigue (compared to 34.3% in period 1). Variables significantly associated with greater distress in period 2 included experiencing burnout, experiencing sleep disturbances, being fatigued, having fatalistic fears, and having fears related to workload. Conversely, being male, reporting satisfaction at work, and using positive coping practices were associated with a significantly lower odds of being in distress. Between the two periods (early pandemic and first wave), COVID-19-related mental health continued to deteriorate among HCPs, highlighting the need to do more to support HCP front-liners facing COVID-19 surges.","Obeidat, Dodin, Hawari, Albtoosh, Manasrah, Mansour","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-022-00728-x","20220412","COVID-19; Health personnel; Jordan; Mental health; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30008,""
"Exploring the Potential of a School-Based Online Health and Wellbeing Screening Tool: Young People's Perspectives","Despite high levels of need, many young people who experience health issues do not seek, access or receive support. Between May and November 2021, using semi-structured interviews, we explored the perspectives of 51 young people (aged 13-14) from two schools who had taken part in a novel online health and wellbeing screening programme, the Digital Health Contact (DHC). One school delivered the DHC during home-learning due to COVID-19 restrictions, whilst the other delivered it in school when restrictions were lifted. The DHC was seen as a useful approach for identifying health need and providing support, and had high levels of acceptability. Young people appreciated the online format of the DHC screening questionnaire and thought this facilitated more honest responses than a face-to-face approach might generate. Completion at home, compared to school-based completion, was perceived as more private and less time-pressured, which young people thought facilitated more honest and detailed responses. Young people's understanding of the screening process (including professional service involvement and confidentiality) influenced engagement and responses. Overall, our findings afford important insights around young people's perspectives of participating in screening programmes, and highlight key considerations for the development and delivery of health screening approaches in (and out of) school.","Woodrow, Fairbrother, D'Apice, Breheny, Albers, Mills, Tebbett, Campbell, De Vocht","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19074062","20220412","adolescent; child; health; mental health; schools; screening","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30009,""
"Factors Associated with Emotion Regulation in Men with Internet Access Living in Brazil during the COVID-19 Pandemic","<i><b>Objective:</b></i> to evaluate the factors associated with emotion regulation in men with internet access living in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic. <i><b>Method:</b></i> an epidemiological survey, conducted with 1015 men. An electronic form was applied containing sociodemographic and occupational characteristics, support and coping strategies, as well as emotional and behavioral aspects. Emotion regulation was assessed using the <i>Emotion Regulation Questionnaire</i>. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The prevalence values observed were 44.6% for Low Cognitive Reappraisal and of 47.1% for High Emotional Suppression. The following factors were identified as associated: (a) with Low Cognitive Reappraisal: being aged 30 years old or more, practicing physical activity, worrying about social distancing and having positive emotions and feelings; and (b) with High Emotional Suppression: being heterosexual, non-white race/skin color, having security support or public administration, not sanitizing food, worrying about lack of physical activity and not having negative emotions. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> the adoption of emotion regulation strategies was associated with individual, contextual and emotional/behavioral characteristics.

"Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among adults: A comparative analysis from different communities in Chengmai County, China","Due to these strict measures, the extend of COVID-19 complications goes beyond morbidity and mortality and affects mental health in the long-term. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on mental health and its contributing factors among adults in Chengmai County, China. An online survey was administered through the WeChat-based program Questionnaire Star between March and April/2020. Adults (&gt;50 years old) from local and foreign group communities completed the survey with sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, the GAD-7 (anxiety), and PHQ-9 (depression). Independent t-tests and multiple linear regression analysis were used to investigate differences between anxiety/depression and factors associated with these symptoms across the two groups. Overall, 469 (25% male, 43% &gt;65 years old) responses were received. Of these, 245 (52%) were from the local community group and 224 (48%) from the foreign group. GAD-7 (p=.002) and PHQ-9 (p=.043) mean scores were significantly higher in the local group. Anxiety was significantly more present in the local group (25% vs. 16% from foreign one; p=0.013). Six respondents presented severe anxiety and none severe depression. This study demonstrated that both community groups of adults from the Chinese ""hometown of longevity"" presented anxiety/depression disorders during the first months of the pandemic. Local community groups presented significantly more mental health disorders, which were associated with history of previous psychological disorders.","Xu, Ghisi, Cui, Zeng, Zhou, Yue, Chen","https://doi.org/10.2196/37046","20220411","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30011,""
"Bereavement during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Impact on Coping Strategies and Mental Health","The COVID-19 coronavirus has caused 5.4 million deaths worldwide, including over 800,000 deaths in the United States (as of December 2021). In addition to these staggering statistics, an even greater number of individuals have died from other causes during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, a large portion of the global population has faced bereavement during the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting quarantine. The often rapid and unexpected nature of COVID-19 deaths and the presence of pandemic-related stressors and living restrictions make it more difficult for individuals bereaved during the pandemic to implement effective strategies for coping with the loss compared to non-pandemic periods. Quarantine-related constraints (e.g., social distancing, availability of and access to resources) impede coping strategies that have been found to be adaptive after a loss, such as supportive (e.g., seeking emotional and instrumental support) and active (e.g., problem-focused and cognitive reframing) coping, and they augment avoidant strategies (e.g., substance use, denial, and isolation) that have been found to be maladaptive. Poorer mental health outcomes (including prolonged grief disorder; PGD) have been associated with less healthy coping. This article reviews research findings regarding bereavement during the COVID-19 pandemic, discusses the effects of pandemic-related stressors on bereavement coping strategies, and proposes how different types of coping during the pandemic may account for the poorer mental health outcomes described in recent reports. Interventions for promoting adaptive coping strategies and minimizing maladaptive coping strategies are also outlined.","Fisher, Rice, Zuleta, Cozza","https://doi.org/10.1080/00332747.2022.2051141","20220411","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30012,""
"Effectiveness of a Telerehabilitative Home Exercise Program on Elder Adults' Physical Performance, Depression and Fear of Falling","Our aim in this study was to analyze the effects of a home exercise program of calisthenic exercises delivered through telerehabilitation on physical performance, depression, and risk of falling in elder adults. Our participants were elder adults aged 65 and over, divided into exercise and control groups. We initiated a 4-week telerehabilitation calisthenic exercise program in the exercise group following initial assessments, while our control group received no formal exercise training. Both groups were evaluated online before and after this 4-week period with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES), and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). In total, 255 elder adults participated, with 132 (males = 72, females = 60) allocated to calisthenic exercise and 123 (males = 66, females = 57) allocated to the control group. While the groups did not differ significantly on any of our parameters before the exercise, there were statistically significant post-exercise group differences in GDS (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ .001) and MFES (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ .001) scores related to remarkable physical improvements achieved in the calisthenic exercise group. The exercise group showed significant increases in their scores on the SPPB Balance Test (<i>p</i> = .049), SPPB Chair Test (<i>p</i> = .009), and SPPB Total (<i>p</i> = .002) while there was no significant increase in any of these scores among control group participants (<i>p</i> &gt; .05). Thus, calisthenic exercises performed via telerehabilitation significantly improved elder adults' physical performance, fear of falling, and depression. Telerehabilitation is a useful remote means of assessing, inducing, and following-up exercise training, particularly during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Tekin, Cetisli-Korkmaz","https://doi.org/10.1177/00315125221087026","20220411","depression; elder adults; fall risk; physical performance; telerehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30013,""
"COVID-19 and depressive symptoms among active component US service members, January 2019-July 2021","This study examined the rates of depressive symptoms in active component U.S. service members prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluated whether SARS-CoV-2 test results (positive or negative) were associated with self-reported depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) screening instrument and were defined as positive if the total score was 3 or greater. From 1 January 2019 through 31 July 2021, 2,313,825 PHQ-2s were completed with an increase in the positive rate from 4.0% to 6.5% (absolute % difference, +2.5%; relative % change, +67.1%) from the beginning to the end of the period. While there was a gradual increase of 19.8% in the months prior to the pandemic (1.4%/month average), this increase grew to 40.4% during the pandemic (2.5%/month average). However, no association was found between a positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 test result and the PHQ-2 screening instrument result. These findings suggest that the accelerated increase in depressive symptoms is likely a function of the environment of the COVID-19 pandemic instead of the SARS-CoV-2 infection itself. Further research to better understand specific factors of the pandemic leading to depressive symptoms will improve efficient allocation of military medical resources and safeguard military medical readiness.","Smetana, Patel, Stahlman, Chauhan, Wells, Ying","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+and+depressive+symptoms+among+active+component+U.S.+service+members,+January+2019-July+2021.","20220411","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30014,""

All studies on organizational and welfare changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in neurorehabilitation services were included. Screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts and data extraction were undertaken independently by pairs of reviewers. The summary of results was reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews.Electronic searches after the screening of title and abstract identified 80 studies, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. A narrative summary of results of all included studies were reported in a tabular format. Different organizational models were adopted in neurorehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the therapies time frame, the physical and mental health of healthcare professionals and the caregiver's workload.

"Evaluating the Full Plate Living lifestyle intervention in low-income monolingual Latinas with and without food insecurity","Food insecurity has long been associated with poor physical and mental health, especially among women from underrepresented minorities. Despite efforts to reduce food insecurity, rates continue to rise and remain disproportionately high among Latinx living in the United States, a group reporting worse mental health symptoms than any other ethnic group during the COVID-19 pandemic. The need to reduce the health burden associated with food insecurity among Latinas is urgent and requires a more targeted and innovative approach. Interventions using a popular education approach have proven effective among underserved populations, especially when these are delivered by community health workers. However, food insecurity status of the participants is often unreported and it is not clear whether or not results vary between those with and without food insecurity. The aim of this quasi-experimental study was to examine physical and mental health changes among Latinas with, and without, food insecurity following a multicomponent health intervention led by community health workers using a popular education approach. Enrolled obese Latinas (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°98) with and without food insecurity responded to demographic, health behaviors and mental health surveys and completed biometric measurements at baseline, immediately following the intervention and at 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. At baseline, participants with food insecurity reported more anxiety and depression than those without, but average body mass index was comparable. Depression, anxiety and body mass index were lower at 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months post and no statistically significant differences were seen between the groups. Participants with food insecurity benefited as much from the intervention as those without.We found that, although community health workers are not licensed healthcare professionals, with proper training and support, they were able to successfully reduce the risk of chronic diseases and improve mental health symptoms among food-insecure Latinas. Given the promising results, similar interventions should be implemented on a larger scale in Latino communities among food insecure women. Long-term sustainability should also be explored.","Joachim-CÃƒÂ©lestin, Rockwood, Clarke, Montgomery","https://doi.org/10.1177/17455057221091350","20220412","Hispanic Americans; chronic disease; community health workers; female; food insecurity; social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30016,""
"""They have more than enough to do than patch up people like me"" Experiences of seeking support for self-harm in lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic","National lockdown caused disruption to health services and third-sector organisations offering support to people who self-harm. Early reports suggested self-harm related hospital attendances declined. Lack of knowledge related to the availability and accessibility of support provisions for people who self-harm warrants exploration into how they experienced help-seeking during lockdown. Exploring the experiences of people who self-harm and perspectives on help-seeking. A qualitative study based on telephone and email interviews with 14 people who self-harm in England. Participants identified challenges to coping with life in lockdown, emphasising the role of self-harm. Help-seeking was impeded by feeling like a burden and potential for spreading the virus. People who self-harm exercised self-reliance in response to 'stay home' messaging, but some may have struggled without formal support. Online support served an important role in continuity of care during lockdown but could widen inequalities from limited resources and access. Helping mental health liaison nurses to understand the experiences of people who self-harm during lockdown is critical to providing continuing support to this population. Services should consider how and when they communicate changes to their provisions to the public, and the impact this will have on those in need of support.","Sass, Farley, Brennan","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12834","20220411","covid-19; help-seeking; mental health; online; qualitative; self-harm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30017,""
"Risk factors and multidimensional assessment of long COVID fatigue: a nested case-control study","Fatigue is the most prevalent and debilitating long COVID symptom, however risk factors and pathophysiology of this condition remain unknown.We assessed risk factors for long COVID fatigue and explored its possible pathophysiology. Nested case-control study in a COVID recovery clinic. Individuals with (cases) and without (controls) significant fatigue were included. We performed a multidimensional assessment evaluating various parameters, including pulmonary function tests and cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and implemented multivariable logistic regression to assess risk factors for significant long COVID fatigue. Total of 141 individuals were included. Mean age was 47 (SD 13) years; 115 (82%) were recovering from mild COVID-19. Mean time for evaluation was 8 months following COVID-19. Sixty-six (47%) individuals were classified with significant long COVID fatigue. They had significantly higher number of children, lower proportion of hypothyroidism, higher proportion of sore throat during acute illness and long COVID symptoms, and of physical limitation in daily activities.Individuals with fatigue had poorer sleep quality and higher degree of depression. They had significantly lower heart rate [153.52 (22.64) vs 163.52 (18.53),Ã‚Â p=0.038] and oxygen consumption per Kg [27.69 (7.52) vs 30.71 (7.52),Ã‚Â p=0.036] at peak exercise.The two independent risk factors for fatigue identified in multivariable analysis were peak exercise heart rate (odds ratio [OR] 0.79 per 10 beats/minute, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-0.96,Ã‚Â p=0.019); and long COVID memory impairment (OR 3.76, 95% CI 1.57-9.01,Ã‚Â p=0.003).

"Occupational stress in clinical and non-clinical staff in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS): a cross-sectional study","Previous literature has highlighted high rates of burnout among doctors and nurses in healthcare settings. Non-clinical and support staff such as administrative, housekeeping and managerial staff are also exposed to the stressors of a health care setting, but fewer studies report on their experiences. Therefore, the aim of this research is to examine occupational stress in all staff working in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in Ireland and identify risk and protective factors. Fifty-nine clinical and non-clinical staff (44% response rate) were surveyed. Participants completed the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) and the Effort Reward Imbalance scale, as well as survey-specific questions.

On an inpatient behavioral health unit, low Press Ganey scores related to satisfaction with involvement in care triggered a root cause analysis that identified patients did not feel engaged by nursing during their time together; and discharge meetings with the health care team were not required. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to improve patient perception of involvement in their care as evidenced by increased Press Ganey scores and increased number of patients involved in discharge meetings. Nurses used an evidence-based model for nurse-patient communication: the Seeking information, Engaging in conversation, Exploring options, and Deciding on treatment (SEED) and use of a Control Preferences Scale (CPS) to increase communication about treatment and discharge decisions. A total of 120 patients engaged in the intervention. Patient presence at discharge meetings increased from 39% to 82% (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), and Press Ganey scores evidenced minimal change. Use of the SEED model and CPS by nurses was effective in increasing patients' involvement in their treatment.

"Risk factors, contemporary challenges and psychological well-being of the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh: Policy implications","Over the last few years, the number of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh has increased exponentially. On arrival, they experience poor mental health and psychological well-being. This commentary explores the risk factors and contemporary challenges that deteriorate Rohingyas' psychological well-being in Bangladesh. The onslaught of Covid-19 compounds the pre-existing psychological health conditions of the Rohingyas living in cramped and flimsy camps. The recent relocation to Bhashan Char may likely trigger tensions and eventually exacerbates their existing psychological well-being. The relocation to Bhashan Char has presumably happened against their volition. Meanwhile, the Myanmar military's coup has added additional fear about their bleak future of a safe and dignified return from Bangladesh to Myanmar. All these have contributed to the worsening of their existing psychological well-being. In order to subside their psychological health challenges, this commentary suggests: (a) the immediate execution of 'National Deployment and Vaccination Plan for Covid-19 Vaccines and initiation of vaccine rollout among the refugees; and (b) involving Rohingyas in economic activities and making them a self-reliant and economically empowered community. We suggest that safe and dignified repatriation is the only solution to the challenges they have been going through in Bangladesh and to preserve their psychological well-being.","Hossain, Huda, Ullah, Renzaho","https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3472","20220411","Rohingya refugees; contemporary challenges; policy implications; psychological health; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30023,""
"Mental health research in the Arab region in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review","The ongoing pandemic has led to a global surge in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related mental health research. However, most related publications come from Western countries or China, and their findings cannot always be extrapolated to Arab countries. This study provides a quantitative and qualitative analysis of mental health research pertaining to Arab countries' response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A scoping review of the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database for publications on mental health was conducted by authors affiliated with Arab institutions, including articles from inception to 24 October 2020. The included publications were evaluated for their national distribution, international collaboration, publication type, and main research themes. Methodological quality analysis of the included research studies was performed using the original and modified versions of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. In total, 102 articles were included in this study, averaging 4.6 articles per Arab country. Most of the articles emerged from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt. A majority of publications demonstrated international collaboration. Most of the publications were original research studies and cross-sectional in design. The predominant research theme was examining the pandemic's mental health effects on the general population and healthcare workers. Only 28.0% of the studies were of high methodological quality, whereas 41.5% were moderate and 30.5% were low in quality.

"The Swedish HealthPhys Study: Study Description and Prevalence of Clinical Burnout and Major Depression among Physicians","The study purpose was to describe the Swedish HealthPhys cohort. Using data from the HealthPhys study, we aimed to describe the prevalence of clinical burnout and major depression in a representative sample of Swedish physicians across gender, age, worksite, hierarchical position, and speciality in spring of 2021, during the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The HealthPhys questionnaire was sent to a representative sample of practising physicians (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6699) in Sweden in February to May of 2021 with a 41.3% response rate. The questionnaire included validated instruments measuring psychosocial work environment and health including measurements for major depression and clinical burnout. Data from the HealthPhys study showed that among practising physicians in Sweden the prevalence of major depression was 4.8% and clinical burnout was 4.7%. However, the variations across sub-groups of physicians regarding major depression ranged from 0% to 10.1%. For clinical burnout estimates ranged from 1.3% to 14.5%. Emergency physicians had the highest levels of clinical burnout while they had 0% prevalence of major depression. Prevalence of exhaustion was high across all groups of physicians with physicians working in emergency departments, at the highest (28.6%) and anaesthesiologist at the lowest (5.6%).

"Factors Associated With Psychological Outcomes Among Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Health Care Workers Against COVID-19 Infection in Bangladesh","Vaccination of healthcare workers (HCWs) is recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce the risk of infection for themselves and their patients, as well as to encourage their patients to get immunized. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological outcomes and associated factors among vaccinated and unvaccinated HCWs against COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh. From March to August 2021, an online nationwide survey was conducted with a total of 2,038 Bangladeshi HCWs. The frequency of symptoms of general health problems, depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, and loneliness was assessed using the Bangla versions of the GHQ-12, PHQ-2, GAD-2, PSS-4, PC-PTSD-5, ISI, and UCLA-LS scales, respectively. Compared with unvaccinated HCWs (<i>n</i> = 1,058), vaccinated HCWs (<i>n</i> = 980) had a statistically significant lower prevalence of general health problems (16.7 vs. 59.1%), depression (15.6 vs. 31.9%), post-traumatic stress disorder (22.3 vs. 30.8%), insomnia (23.8 vs. 64.9%), and loneliness symptoms (13.9 vs. 21.8%). Among vaccinated HCWs, females were significantly associated with a higher risk of symptoms of general health problems (AOR, 2.71; 95% CI, 0.97-7.60), anxiety (AOR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.14-4.13), and loneliness (AOR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.11-5.73). Except for anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, participants living in urban areas had a significantly lower risk of all psychological outcomes (e.g., depression: AOR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.27-0.67; stress: AOR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.47-0.88). Respondents who were married were significantly less likely to experience symptoms of general health problems (AOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02-0.39), depression (AOR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.22-0.82), insomnia (AOR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.20-1.03), and loneliness (AOR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10-0.92). Participants who worked as doctors were significantly less chance of experiencing symptoms of general health problems (AOR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.08-0.37), depression (AOR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30-0.87), and anxiety (AOR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.37-0.78). On the other hand, unvaccinated HCWs who were 18-29 years old and had &lt;5 years of work experience were significantly associated with a higher risk of all psychological outcomes except anxiety and insomnia symptoms (e.g., depression among 18-29 years old: AOR, 1.83; 95% CI, 0.27-2.60; stress among those with &lt;5 years of work experience: AOR, 2.37; 95% CI, 0.93-6.07). Participants who worked as nurses were significantly more likely to suffer from depression (AOR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.84-2.46), anxiety (AOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.24-1.73), and stress (AOR, 1.55; 95% CI, 0.31-0.89) symptoms. Except for anxiety and stress symptoms, respondents who worked as frontline workers and provided direct care to infected patients were the significantly higher chance of experiencing all psychological outcomes (e.g., depression among who worked as frontline workers: AOR, 2.41; 95% CI, 0.23-3.73; insomnia among those who provide direct care to infected patients: AOR, 2.60; 95% CI, 0.34-3.06). Participants who were infected with COVID-19 had a significantly less chance of experiencing symptoms of general health problems (AOR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.65-1.22), depression (AOR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48-0.92), and anxiety (AOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.87). To control the infection and improve psychological outcomes, this study suggests emphasizing the vaccinated to unvaccinated HCWs as soon as possible. They also required special attention, health-related education, and psychological support.","Alam, Paul, Momi, Ni, Xu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.852922","20220411","Bangladesh; COVID-19; health care workers; immunization; psychological outcomes; refusal; uptake","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30026,""

"Developing a healthcare worker psychological preparedness support programme for the COVID-19 outbreak","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused worldwide disruptions to healthcare systems. The emerging evidence indicates that mental health problems have consequently become an occupational hazard in frontline healthcare workers. We aimed to develop a psychological preparedness training (PPT) programme to support frontline health workers in three resource-limited hospitals in South Africa dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak and to evaluate its effectiveness using an audit tool. We established a theoretical framework and goals for a psychological preparedness programme to support healthcare workers at the study sites. Data were collected at the Dora Nginza Hospital, Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital and Elizabeth Donkin Hospital. We employed an observational, descriptive, and cross-sectional design. A group psychological intervention was developed and implemented at the three sites in South Africa, from mid-April 2020 over 20 weeks. We collected data using an audit tool to measure healthcare workers' perceptions of the outbreak before and after the intervention. We analysed the data to test for a statistically significant difference between the pre-intervention and post-intervention audit tools. We supported 761 healthcare workers during the 20 weeks of the programme. Statistical analysis showed a significant positive change from pre- to post-intervention measures in perceptions of health worker about the outbreak, their anxiety associated with the outbreak, their ability to control reactions to stress and the perception of their ability to support others. Feedback comments indicated that the programme was beneficial for the majority of those who attended. Health workers who attended the programme reported improvement in stress levels and in perceptions about their ability to cope with the outbreak, as well as in their perceptions of being able to support others.","Zingela, van Wyk, Bronkhorst, Groves","https://doi.org/10.4102/sajpsychiatry.v28i0.1665","20220411","COVID-19; health worker; mental health; psychological; support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30028,""
"Mechanistic Insights Into the Immune Pathophysiology of COVID-19; An In-Depth Review","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus-19 (COVID-19), has caused significant morbidity and mortality globally. In addition to the respiratory manifestations seen in severe cases, multi-organ pathologies also occur, making management a much-debated issue. In addition, the emergence of new variants can potentially render vaccines with a relatively limited utility. Many investigators have attempted to elucidate the precise pathophysiological mechanisms causing COVID-19 respiratory and systemic disease. Spillover of lung-derived cytokines causing a cytokine storm is considered the cause of systemic disease. However, recent studies have provided contradictory evidence, whereby the extent of cytokine storm is insufficient to cause severe illness. These issues are highly relevant, as management approaches considering COVID-19 a classic form of acute respiratory distress syndrome with a cytokine storm could translate to unfounded clinical decisions, detrimental to patient trajectory. Additionally, the precise immune cell signatures that characterize disease of varying severity remain contentious. We provide an up-to-date review on the immune dysregulation caused by COVID-19 and highlight pertinent discussions in the scientific community. The response from the scientific community has been unprecedented regarding the development of highly effective vaccines and cutting-edge research on novel therapies. We hope that this review furthers the conversations held by scientists and informs the aims of future research projects, which will potentially further our understanding of COVID-19 and its immune pathogenesis.","Shafqat, Shafqat, Salameh, Kashir, Alkattan, Yaqinuddin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.835104","20220412","Coronavirus; immunopathogenesis; pathophysiology; protective immunity; vaccine; COVID-19; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Cytokines; Humans; Immune System Diseases; Respiratory Distress Syndrome; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30029,""
"Effects of Transcranial Pulse Stimulation (TPS) on Young Adults With Symptom of Depression: A Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial Protocol","Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been lots of published work examining the association between COVID-19 and mental health, particularly, anxiety and depression in the general populations and disease subpopulations globally. Depression is a debilitating disorder affecting individuals' level of bio-psychological-social functioning across different age groups. Since almost all studies were cross-sectional studies, there seems to be a lack of robust, large-scale, and technological-based interventional studies to restore the general public's optimal psychosocial wellbeing amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) is a relatively new non-intrusive brain stimulation (NIBS) technology, and only a paucity of studies was conducted related to the TPS treatment on older adults with mild neurocognitive disorders. However, there is by far no study conducted on young adults with major depressive disorder nationwide. This gives us the impetus to execute the first nationwide study evaluating the efficacy of TPS on the treatment of depression among young adults in Hong Kong. This study proposes a two-armed single-blinded randomised controlled trial including TPS as an intervention group and a waitlist control group. Both groups will be measured at baseline (T1), immediately after the intervention (T2), and at the 3- month follow-up (T3). A total of 30 community-dwelling subjects who are aged 18 and above and diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) will be recruited in this study. All subjects will be computer randomised into either the intervention group or the waitlist control group, balanced by gender and age on a 1:1 ratio. All subjects in each group will have to undertake functional MRI (fMRI) before and after six 30-min TPS sessions, which will be completed in 2 weeks' time. Baseline measurements and post-TPS evaluation of the psychological outcomes (i.e., depression, cognition, anhedonia, and instrumental activities of daily living) will also be conducted on all participants. A 3-month follow-up period will be usedto assess the long-term sustainability of the TPS intervention. For statistical analysis, ANOVA with repeated measures will be used to analyse data. Missing data were managed by multiple mutations. The level of significance will be set to <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05. Results of this study will be used to inform health policy to determine whether TPS could be considered as a top treatment option for MDD.

"On the Parental Influence on Children's Physical Activities and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","While neighborhood safety and stranger danger have been mostly canonized to play a part in parents' physical activity (PA) avoidance, less is known about the impact of parental stress and perceived risk on children's PA avoidance and consequently on children's level of PA and wellbeing. Understanding the contributors to children's wellbeing during pandemic disease is the first critical step in contributing to children's health during epidemic diseases. This study employed 276 healthy children, aged 10-12 years, and their parents. Data were collected in October and November 2020, about 9 months after the local closing of schools due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Parents and children answered a separate set of questions. Besides the demographic information, the parents responded to questions on their stress level, perceived risk of COVID-19, and PA avoidance for children. Children responded to questions on their PA and wellbeing in the last week. Data were analyzed using SmartPLS and IBM SPSS 22. The result of the study supported the four directional research hypotheses of the sequential study model. As hypothesized, parents' stress and perceived risk levels of COVID-19 negatively affected children's PA. The PA level was shown to predict children's wellbeing and mental health. Housing type, parents' job security, number of siblings, number of members living together in-home, and history of death or hospitalization of relatives or family members due to COVID-19 were found to be associated with parents' stress and children's mental health. This study sheds light on parents' role in children's wellbeing and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents with higher stress and high restrictive behaviors might put their children at risk of mental disorders in the end.","Khozaei, Carbon","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.675529","20220411","COVID-19; children mental health; mental health; parental stress; perceived risk; physical activity; physical activity avoidance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30031,""
"Mental Health Day Hospitals and Lockdown Due to COVID-19 in Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic has forced changes in patient care in Mental Health Day Hospitals (MHDHs). To study the interventions performed in MHDHs during the pandemic in comparison with those performed in other facilities and to analyze the new hospital admissions in both groups. A retrospective multicenter cohort study comparing the interventions received by a group of 161 patients admitted in MHDHs during the lockdown period in Spain with the interventions of another group of 109 patients who were treated at other facilities during lockdown. MHDHs reduced their face-to-face interventions during lockdown just as much as other facilities but implemented telematic intervention methods to a greater extent. Patients attached to MHDHs during lockdown were admitted significantly less and presented fewer urgent consultations in the following 6 months. The use of telepsychiatry made it feasible to adapt MHDHs to periods of lockdown, being useful to improve the continuity of care during the pandemic. In addition, it was possible to maintain a reduction in hospital admissions in patients treated at MHDHs.","SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Guarnido, Lucena, Torrent, Bosa, Martinez-LÃƒÂ³pez, Cuartiles-Berenguer, Batalla","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.769015","20220411","COVID-19; compliance; day hospital; mental health; social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30032,""
"The Psychological Benefits of an Uncertain World: Hope and Optimism in the Face of Existential Threat","We examine how prior mental health predicts hopes and how hopes predict subsequent mental health, testing hypotheses in a longitudinal study with an Australian nation-wide adult sample regarding mental health consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak during its initial stage. Quota sampling was used to select a sample representative of the adult Australian population in terms of age groups, gender, and geographical location. Mental health measures were selected to include those with the best psychometric properties. Hypotheses were tested using generalized linear models with random intercepts, with the type of GLM determined by the nature of the dependent variable. Greater anxiety, depression, distress, and loneliness predict less hope, but impaired quality of life and stress <i>positively</i> predict hopes of gaining new skills. Distress and loneliness predict hopes for social connectedness and an improved society, suggesting that predictors of hope depend on what is hoped for. These findings suggest the need for more nuanced theories of hope. Greater hopes for societal improvement predict lower anxiety, depression, distress, and impaired quality of life, but greater hopes for skills and better mental health predict <i>higher</i> levels of these covariates. Moreover, when relevant prior psychological states are more intense, the impact of hope state declines. These findings indicate that the consequences of hope are heterogeneous, and suggest a possible explanation for the seemingly inconsistent therapeutic effectiveness of raising hope.","Smithson, Shou, Dawel, Calear, Farrer, Cherbuin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.749093","20220411","anxiety; coronavirus; depression; hope; optimism; uncertainty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30033,""
"Emotional State of Chinese Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Pandemic","Anti-epidemic work against coronavirus disease (COVID) has become routine work in China. Our study was intended to investigate the emotional and psychological state of healthcare workers and look for the association between sociodemographic factors/profession-related condition and emotional state. A cross-sectional survey was conducted online among healthcare workers from various backgrounds. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed by the Chinese versions of the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. Supplementary questions (Supplementary Material) were recorded to describe the participants' information about workplace violence, profession, and attitude related to the COVID pandemic. Wherever suitable, independent <i>t</i>-test, and one-way ANOVA were performed to detect group differences of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 total scores after grouping by sociodemographic variables, respectively, such as age, gender, marital status, educational level, after-tax income, department category, job title, experience of workplace violence, and anti-epidemic participation. Multiple linear regression analyses (stepwise method) were utilized in order to look for the potential associated factors of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 total scores. A total of 2,139 questionnaires with valid response were completed. Approximately 86.44% of participants had minimal symptoms of anxiety, 11.08% mild, 1.59% moderate, and 0.89% severe. Meanwhile, 81.34% had minimal symptoms of depression, 14.07% mild, 2.90% moderate, 1.17% moderately severe, and 0.51% severe. Student's <i>t</i>-test showed that participants with female gender, with experience of workplace violence scored higher on both GAD-7 and PHQ-9, and participants with experience of anti-epidemic front-line work during pandemic scored lower on both GAD-7 and PHQ-9. ANOVA showed that participants aging from 31 to 40, with higher educational level, with middle level of annual after-tax income, with department of internal medicine or surgery, or with middle level of job title scored higher on both GAD-7 and PHQ-9. Regression analyses showed that female gender, high job title, and the experience of workplace violence positively were associated with anxiety or depression. Doctoral education, department (other <i>vs</i>. psychiatry), job enthusiasm, and professional self-identity were negatively associated with anxiety or depression. Additionally, psychological support was negatively associated with depression. As the epidemic prevention and control against COVID-19 become normalized in China, emotional state of healthcare workers deserves extensive attention. Our study revealed that gender, educational level, department category, job title, the experience of workplace violence, job enthusiasm, and professional self-identity are the most important influencing factors of physician's anxiety and depression. Self-tailored psychological intervention should be based on the predisposing factors above to mentally prepare healthcare workers for this long-lasting battle against COVID-19.","Jiang, Shao, Rao, Ling, Pi, Shao, Zhao, Yang, Wang, Chen, Tang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.854815","20220411","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; healthcare workers; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30034,""
"Quality of Life, Sexual Health, and Associated Factors Among the Sexually Active Adults in a Metro City of India: An Inquiry During the COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Lockdown","Sexual dysfunction (SD) and its effect on our life is an important but less studied topic especially during post-COVID era. This study examines the extent of SD and other mental health predictors and their effect on quality of life. A cross-sectional survey of sexually active adults was conducted in an Indian metro-city. Along with sociodemographic data, sexual dysfunction, depression, anxiety, stress, and quality of life were assessed by Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), and WHOQOL-BREF, respectively. Structural equations modeling was used to understand their relationship. Out of the total 1,376 respondents, 80.52% were male, 65.98% were married, and 48.54% were graduates. The mean age of the participants was 34.42 (Ã‚Â±9.34) years. Of the participants, 27.18% had sexual dysfunction. Majority of the respondents did not have depression (59.30%), anxiety (52.33%), or stress (44.48%). Mild and moderate levels were the commonest findings among those who had depression, anxiety, or stress. Among the respondents, 27.18% had sexual dysfunction as per the ASEX instrument. Increase in age and female gender were associated with sexual dysfunction overall and also all its components. Presence of depression adversely affected ease of achieving orgasm and satisfaction from orgasm and was associated with sexual dysfunction overall. The respondents had a mean score of 73.57 (Ã‚Â±13.50) as per the WHO-QOL. Depression and stress emerged as statistically significant factors for poor quality of life, while sexual dysfunction was not associated statistically. More than one-fourth of the study population reported sexual dysfunction during the first wave of the pandemic in India. The study findings highlight the role of poor mental health issues in this regard. In fact, issues like depression and stress were associated with poor quality of life as well. The current findings unequivocally warrant specific interventions to improve mental health of the respondents.","Chatterjee, Bhattacharyya, Chakraborty, Lahiri, Dasgupta","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.791001","20220411","anxiety; depression; pandemic; psychosexual; quality of life; sexual dysfunction; stress; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30035,""
"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Systematic Review","The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions may contribute to a deterioration in mental health; individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be particularly affected. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects of the current pandemic on people diagnosed with OCD, and whether pandemics may affect the development of OCD symptoms. We conducted a systematic search using NCBI PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar on February 9, 2021. Research articles related to OCD and COVID-19 or other pandemics were attempted to be identified using pre-defined search terms. Case reports, clinical guidelines, letters, and clinical research articles including Ã¢â€°Â¥100 participants were included; reviews were excluded. The systematic review adheres to PRISMA guidelines and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of the included clinical research articles. A total of 79 articles were included in the full-text assessment. Of these, 59 were clinical research articles, two were clinical guidelines, six were case reports, and 12 were letters. The research articles examined OCD symptoms in adult patients with diagnosed OCD, the general population, pregnant women, healthcare workers, students, and young adults, children, and adolescents. Only one study on OCD in previous pandemics was identified. This systematic review found that people both with and without diagnosed OCD prior to the pandemic generally experienced a worsened landscape of symptoms of OCD during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the responses are heterogeneous and many factors other than the pandemic seemed to affect the development of OCD symptoms. To prevent the impairment of symptoms and the development of new cases, close monitoring of patients with OCD and education of the general public is essential. Literature is still limited; thus, multinational and cross-cultural, longitudinal studies are warranted to gain further insights on this topic.","Linde, Varga, Clotworthy","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.806872","20220411","COVID-19; Coronavirus; OCD; mental health; obsession; obsessive-compulsive disorder; pandemic; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30036,""
"Sleep Habits, Quality of Life and Psychosocial Aspects in the Older Age: Before and During COVID-19","This study aimed to describe sleep habits, quality of life and psychosocial aspects in older people and analyze associated differences considering the time before COVID-19 pandemic and during its first wave in Portugal. Online survey used for data collection received answers from 914 elderly (age range 65 - 90y), from April to August 2020. Symptoms of self-perception of depression, anxiety, irritability and economic problems were not prominent in the elderly, except for worries concerning uncertainty about the future. There was no difference in sleep duration before and during the pandemic, although there was a worsening of some aspects related to sleep, such as sleep quality, sleep efficiency, awakening quality, sleep latency and nocturnal awakenings. Gender comparisons showed a higher vulnerability in women. Some morbidities got worse during the pandemic among the elderly, such as Insomnia, Headaches, Depression, Tinnitus, among others. Even though our data suggest that the pandemic did not have a great impact on quality of life, sleep quality and psychosocial aspects in the elderly, they were still affected by the worsening of their health conditions, including sleep and morbidities. Some behaviors may act as protective factors in this population, such as walking and keeping contact with others, as well as other aspects like financial stability, high level of education and family support, as they can help them to cope better with difficulties.","de Almondes, Castro, Paiva","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2022.694894","20220411","COVID-19; mental health; older people; quality of life; sleep disorders; sleep habits","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30037,""
"Perceived parental support and college students' depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: The mediating roles of emotion regulation strategies and resilience","The current study examined the mediating roles of emotion regulation strategies (i.e., cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and resilience in the relationship between perceived parental support and depressive symptoms among college students during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. A large sample of Chinese college students (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2, 423) participated in this investigation.

"Black Kin Caregivers: Acceptability and Cultural Adaptation of the Family Check-Up/Everyday Parenting Program","Black children join kinship care disproportionately and black kin caregivers often face financial, housing, mental health, and parenting challenges when caring for relative children. Few interventions have been developed specifically for kin caregivers, let alone Black kin caregivers. This study evaluated the initial acceptability of an evidence based parenting intervention and worked to culturally adapt it for Black kin caregivers. The intervention was delivered in a family camp format. Feedback from participant interviews were analyzed for this study. Participants felt that overall the intervention was culturally appropriate. However, they also proposed changes to the curriculum, as well as to the process and format of the intervention.

"COVID-19 hardships and self-reported sleep quality among American adults in March and April 2020: Results from a nationally representative panel study","To analyze the association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hardships and self-reported sleep troubles in a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States. Prospective study in March and April 2020. Population-based. About 8130 respondents who participated in the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel in March and April of 2020. Self-reported sleep troubles were defined as a report of 3 or more days per week with trouble sleeping in March and April (separately). Respondents were asked about COVID-19 stressors such as COVID-19 Threat and COVID-19-specific hardships including pay cuts/hours reductions, job loss, and childcare difficulties. Logistic regression models were fit to test associations between COVID-19 hardships and sleep troubles adjusted for sociodemographic covariates (age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, marital status, nativity, education, income, health insurance, and past diagnosis of mental health problems). Reported sleep troubles increased from March (29.0%) to April (31.4%). For March, we found that COVID threat, losing a job, getting a pay cut, and difficulty with childcare were separately associated with sleep troubles. In April, COVID-19 threat and difficulty with childcare, but not losing a job or getting a pay cut were associated with sleep troubles even after additionally accounting for reported sleep troubles in March. We found that COVID-19-specific stressors, especially a broad measure of COVID-19 Threat and stress over childcare, were associated with sleep troubles in March and April. These findings identified novel stressors related to COVID-19, which may affect the sleep of the American population.","Cobb, Sheehan, Nguyen, Johnson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2022.01.001","20220411","COVID-19; Sleep; childcare; job loss; stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30040,""
"Dispositional Mindfulness May Have Protected Athletes from Psychological Distress During COVID-19 in Australia","Promoting athlete wellbeing has become a priority in elite sport, and the COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated the need for a comprehensive understanding of risk and protective factors. Existing sport research has not yet considered whether specific cognitive factors such as dispositional mindfulness and executive function may protect athletes against psychological distress. In a sample of high-performance Australian football athletes (<i>n</i> = 27), we administered measures of dispositional mindfulness (MAAS), executive function (AOSPAN; eStroop), and psychological distress (APSQ) at pre-season, coinciding with the initial (2020) COVID-19-related sport shutdown in Australia. Measures of executive function and psychological distress were re-administered at the end of the COVID-19 affected competitive season in 2020. Athletes reported significantly elevated psychological distress relative to previous estimates of distress among high-performance athletes established in prior studies. Executive functions, including working memory and inhibitory control were not significantly associated with psychological distress or dispositional mindfulness at either timepoint. However, baseline mindfulness was associated with reduced distress at both pre-season (r = -0.48, <i>p</i> = .03) and end of season (r = -0.56, <i>p</i> = .004), suggesting that dispositional mindfulness may have afforded protective buffering against symptoms of distress. Correlation data alone does not establish a directional connection from mindfulness to reduced distress, and future research is required to elucidate this association and/or establish the mechanism/s by which dispositional mindfulness may protect against psychological distress in this population.","O'Connor, Crozier, Murphy, Immink","https://doi.org/10.1177/00315125221087523","20220411","athlete; australian football; cognition; inhibitory control; mindfulness; psychological strain; sport, mental health; wellbeing; working memory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30041,""

All professional groups of public hospitals in Italy and Switzerland were asked to complete a 38 questions online survey investigating demographic, marital and working status, presence of stress symptoms and need for psychological support. Within 38 h a total of 3,038 responses were collected. The subgroup analysis identified specific categories at risk according to age, type of work and region of origin. Critical care workers, in particular females, reported an increased number of working hours, decline in confidence in the future, presence of stress symptoms and need for psychological support. Respondents reporting stress symptoms and those with children declared a higher need for psychological support. The large number of participants in such a short time indicates for a high interest on topic among health-care workers.

"Implementation of a Community-Based Psychosocial Support Focal Point Response for Internally Displaced Persons in Myanmar During COVID-19","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Global Mental Health research group at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health worked with three local partner organizations in Myanmar to develop a psychosocial support (PSS) program that could be delivered by community-based focal points in internally displaced persons camps. This PSS program was designed to be delivered in communities with limited access to regional mental health services due to pandemic travel restrictions. The content of the PSS program was based on materials from an ongoing Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) mental health program; CETA counselors based in the three partner organizations were available to provide telephone-based CETA counseling. In April 2020, the partners organizations recruited and trained PSS focal points in 25 IDP camps to establish a multi-tiered system of MHPSS supports. The PSS program including psychoeducation handouts focused on stress and coping during COVID-19 and skills for cognitive restructuring (i.e., changing unhelpful thoughts) in simplified terms, audio recordings of the content of these handouts and referral opportunities for telephone-based services by CETA counselors located outside of the camps. PSS focal points distributed the handouts, had the recordings played <i>via</i> radio and loudspeaker, and were available to answer questions and provide access to a PSS program phones to connect with the CETA counselors. After 6 months of implementation, program monitoring logs were reviewed and a cross-sectional evaluation was conducted to assess the PSS program's reach, understanding, and perceived utility. Forty-one focal points implemented the PSS program in 25 IDP camps in Kachin and northern Shan States. From May to September 2020, the focal points distributed handouts to 5,725 households and reported 679 visits by IDPs, including facilitating 332 calls to a CETA counselor. Data from the program evaluation (<i>n</i> = 793 participants) found high levels of handout readership and perceived utility of the information, and good comprehension of the content and application of skills. Findings suggest that provision of a multi-tiered MHPSS program, with PSS focal points providing direct information and linkages to further mental health services <i>via</i> telephone, was feasible despite the constraints of the pandemic. Utilizing camp-based focal points was acceptable and successful in delivering basic psychosocial supports to a broad population while serving as points of contact for individuals who wanted and needed telephone-based counseling services.","Lee, Schojan, Myo, Doe, San, Bass","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.854490","20220412","Myanmar (Burma); conflict; distance services; internally displaced person (IDP); psychosocial support; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Inosine Diphosphate; Myanmar; Pandemics; Psychosocial Support Systems; Refugees","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30043,""

"Daily Food Insecurity Predicts Lower Positive and Higher Negative Affect: An Ecological Momentary Assessment Study","Food insecurity (FI) is a dynamic phenomenon, and its association with daily affect is unknown. We explored the association between daily FI and affect among low-income adults during a 2-seasonal-month period that covered days both pre- and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 29 healthy low-income adults were recruited during fall in 2019 or 2020, 25 of whom were followed in winter in 2020 or 2021. Daily FI (measured once daily) and affect (measured 5 times daily) were collected over the 2nd-4th week in each month. Time-Varying-Effect-Models were used to estimate the association between daily FI and positive/negative affect (PA/NA). Overall, 902 person-days of daily-level data were collected. Daily FI was associated with lower PA in the 3rd and 4th week of fall and winter and with higher NA in the second half of winter months. Similar patterns of FI-affect relations were found pre- and during COVID-19 in the second half of a given month, while unique patterns of positive affect scores in the 2nd week and negative scores in the 1st week were only observed during COVID days. Our study supports a time-varying association between FI and affect in low-income adults. Future large studies are needed to verify the findings; ultimately, better understanding such associations may help identify, target, and intervene in food insecure adults to prevent adverse mental health outcomes.","Na, Dou, Liao, Rincon, Francis, Graham-Engeland, Murray-Kolb, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.790519","20220411","EMA; food insecurity; mood; season; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30045,""

"Characterizing the Relationship Between the COVID-19 Pandemic and US Classical Musicians' Wellbeing","The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the economic and social wellbeing of communities worldwide. Certain groups have been disproportionately impacted by the strain of the pandemic, such as classical musicians. The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly harmed the classical music industry, silencing the world's concert halls and theaters. In an industry characterized by instability, a shock as great as COVID-19 may bring negative effects that far outlast the pandemic itself. This study investigates the wellbeing of classical musicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. 68 professional classical musicians completed a questionnaire composed of validated measures of future time horizons, emotional experience, social relationships, and life satisfaction. Findings show that feelings of loneliness had a significant negative association with other measures of wellbeing and were significantly mediated by increased social integration and perceived social support from colleagues, friends, and family. These findings help to characterize the present psychological, emotional, and social wellness of classical musicians in the United States, the first step toward mitigating the hazardous impacts of COVID-19 on this vulnerable group's mental health and wellness.","Wang, Fram, Carstensen, Berger","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2022.848098","20220411","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; mental wellbeing; musicians; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30047,""

"A follow-up on quantitative and qualitative olfactory dysfunction and other symptoms in patients recovering from COVID-19 smell loss","Sudden smell loss is a specific early symptom of COVID-19, which, prior to the emergence of Omicron, had estimated prevalence of ~40% to 75%. Chemosensory impairments affect physical and mental health, and dietary behavior. Thus, it is critical to understand the rate and time course of smell recovery. The aim of this cohort study was to characterize smell function and recovery up to 11 months post COVID-19 infection. This longitudinal survey of individuals suffering COVID-19-related smell loss assessed disease symptoms and gustatory and olfactory function. Participants (n=12,313) who completed an initial survey (S1) about respiratory symptoms, chemosensory function and COVID-19 diagnosis between April and September 2020, were invited to complete a follow-up survey (S2). Between September 2020 and February 2021, 27.5% participants responded (n=3,386), with 1,468 being diagnosed with COVID-19 and suffering co-occurring smell and taste loss at the beginning of their illness. At follow-up (median time since COVID-19 onset ~200 days), ~60% of women and ~48% of men reported less than 80% of their pre-illness smell ability. Taste typically recovered faster than smell, and taste loss rarely persisted if smell recovered. Prevalence of parosmia and phantosmia was ~10% of participants in S1 and increased substantially in S2: ~47% for parosmia and ~25% for phantosmia. Persistent smell impairment was associated with more symptoms overall, suggesting it may be a key marker of long-COVID illness. The ability to smell during COVID-19 was rated slightly lower by those who did not eventually recover their pre-illness ability to smell at S2. While smell ability improves for many individuals who lost it during acute COVID-19, the prevalence of parosmia and phantosmia increases substantially over time. Olfactory dysfunction is associated with broader persistent symptoms of COVID-19, and may last for many months following acute COVID-19. Taste loss in the absence of smell loss is rare. Persistent qualitative smell symptoms are emerging as common long-term sequelae; more research into treatment options is strongly warranted given that even conservative estimates suggest millions of individuals may experience parosmia following COVID-19. Healthcare providers worldwide need to be prepared to treat post COVID-19 secondary effects on physical and mental health.","Ohla, Veldhuizen, Green, Hannum, Bakke, Moein, Tognetti, Postma, Pellegrino, Hwang, Albayay, Koyama, Nolden, Thomas-Danguin, Mucignat-Caretta, Menger, Croijmans, Ãƒâ€“ztÃƒÂ¼rk, YanÃ„Â±k, Pierron, Pereda-Loth, Nunez-Parra, Martinez Pineda, Gillespie, Farruggia, Cecchetto, Fornazieri, Philpott, Voznessenskaya, Cooper, Rohlfs Dominguez, Calcinoni, de Groot, Boesveldt, Bhutani, Weir, Exten, Joseph, Hayes, Niv","https://doi.org/10.4193/Rhin21.415","20220410","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30050,""

"Influence of suicidality on adult perceptions of COVID-19 risk and guideline adherence","Suicide rates have been increasing for decades, and the challenges of a global pandemic seem to have worsened suicide risk factors. The relationship between suicidality, COVID-19 risk perceptions, and guideline adherence was examined to inform potential barriers to the implementation of behavioral interventions aimed at preventing future pandemics. A national sample of 159 MTurk participants (M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯37.64Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years, SDÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯11.92; 48.4% female) completed an online survey containing the following: demographics, Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale, Broadly Applicable Measure of Risk Perception of COVID-19, and Adherence to COVID-19 Guidelines and Perceived Risk Scale. Multiple linear regressions assessed how suicidality related to perceived risk subscales and each adherence indicator while controlling for biological sex, age, and essential worker status. Over 25% of participants reported suicidality over the past month, and 19% were at high risk of suicidal behavior. Greater suicidality was associated with lower general COVID-19 risk perceptions (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.326, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001), decreased handwashing (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.423, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001), lower likelihood of planning to self-quarantine if infected with COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.400, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001), less social distancing (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.457, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001), and increased attendance of large gatherings (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.405, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001). Temporal relationships were unable to be assessed due to the cross-sectional nature of the data used. The low internal reliability of the risk probability subscale precluded its inclusion in analyses.

We applied a connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) approach to identify the functional connectome supporting vicarious traumatization based on a 268-region-parcellation assigned to network memberships. The CPM analyses showed that only the negative network model stably predicted individuals' vicarious traumatization scores (q<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.18, MSEÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯617, r <sub>[predicted, actual]</sub>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.18, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.024; indicating that the model was performing worse than guessing the mean of the vicarious traumatization scores), with the contributing functional connectivity primarily distributed in the fronto-parietal, default mode, medial frontal, salience, and motor network. Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed that vicarious traumatization mediated the influence of brain functional connectome on general distress. Importantly, our results were independent of baseline family socioeconomic status, other stressful life events and general mental health as well as age, sex and head motion. Our study is the first to provide evidence for the functional neural markers of vicarious traumatization and reveal an underlying neuropsychological pathway to predict distress symptoms in which brain functional connectome affects general distress via vicarious traumatization.","Suo, Zuo, Lan, Pan, Zhang, Kemp, Wang, Gong","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119185","20220410","COVID-19; connectome-based predictive modeling; general distress; resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging; vicarious traumatization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30053,""
"Global mental health research and practice: a decolonial approach","The global health movement is having a paradigm crisis-a period characterised by a questioning of one's values, goals, and sense of identity. Despite important advances in population health worldwide, global health and global mental health often produce and reproduce power imbalances and patterns of oppression and exploitation that perpetuate the current modern world system (ie, Eurocentric, capitalist, and patriarchal) and its entangled global hierarchies (eg, gender, economic, epistemic, and linguistic). A consensus is emerging to decolonise global mental health, but it is not clear how to move from rhetoric to action. In this Personal View, we aim to share our experiences and the practices developed in the context of the COVID-19 health care workers (HEROES) Study. To do so, we present our HEROES decolonial team approach, which comprises three underlying principles: epistemic justice, pragmatic solidarity, and sovereign acts. We have developed decolonial team practices such as co-creating communication spaces to foster horizontal and equitable dialogue, locating and managing the study database in Chile, and ensuring local teams' rights and access to the data without barriers.","Rivera-Segarra, Mascayano, Alnasser, van der Ven, MartÃƒÂ­nez-AlÃƒÂ©s, Durand-Arias, Moro, Karam, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Torres, AlarcÃƒÂ³n, Ramos-Pibernus, Alvarado, Susser","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(22)00043-8","20220410","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30054,""
"6 and 12Ã‚Â month outcomes in patients following COVID-19-related hospitalization: a prospective monocentric study","The long-term consequences of COVID-19 in those who recover from acute infection requiring hospitalization have not been defined yet. In this study, we aim to describe the long-term symptoms and respiratory outcomes over 12Ã‚Â months in patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19. In this prospective cohort study, patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 were prospectively followed up at 6 and 12Ã‚Â months after discharge from the Hospital of Fermo, Italy. Patients were interviewed for persisting symptoms and underwent physical examination, routine blood test, pulmonary function tests, chest high-resolution CT (HRCT), and 6Ã‚Â min walking test. A total of 64 patients were evaluated and participated in this study. The mean age of participants was 68Ã‚Â years, 41 (64%) were males, and the median body mass index (BMI) was 26Ã‚Â kg/m<sup>2</sup>. After 6Ã‚Â months, 36% of patients reported persistent dyspnea, 37.5% persistent fatigue, 30.6% hair loss, 14% arthralgia and 11% memory and attention deficits. The rate of these symptoms reduced at the 12Ã‚Â month follow-up. At least 50% of the patients reported anxiety and depression symptoms. At 6Ã‚Â months 57.4% of patients showed reduced DLCO and 21.3% reduced FVC% and improvement at 12Ã‚Â months was noted for FVC but not for DLCO and TLC. Persistent radiographic abnormalities, most commonly ground-glass opacities and interstitial changes, were observed at both timepoints in many patients. Long-term symptoms and pulmonary deficits are common in patients admitted for severe COVID-19. Further studies are needed to assess the clinical significance of long-term consequences of severe COVID-19.","Martino, Benfaremo, Bitti, Valeri, Postacchini, Marchetti, Angelici, Moroncini","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-022-02979-x","20220410","COVID-19; Complications; Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30055,""
"COVID-19 prevalence and mortality in longer-term care facilities","This essay considers the factors that have contributed to very high COVID-19 mortality in longer-term care facilities (LTCFs). We compare the demographic characteristics of LTCF residents with those of community-dwelling older adults, and then we review the evidence regarding prevalence and infection fatality rates (IFRs), including links to frailty and some comorbidities. Finally, we discuss policy measures that could foster the physical and mental health and well-being of LTCF residents in the present context and in potential future pandemics.","Levin, JylhÃƒÂ¤vÃƒÂ¤, Religa, Shallcross","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-022-00861-w","20220410","SARS-CoV-2; care facilities; infection fatality rate; nursing homes; seroprevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30056,""
"Personality disorders (PD) and interpersonal violence (IV) during COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review","Not only did the ongoing CoronaVIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic cause a massive number of casualties, but also there is growing concern that the burden of its psychological aftermaths will only show up years down the road. This systematic review summarises the existing literature reporting the impact of COVID-19 on personality disorders (PDs)-related violence. MEDLINE and APA PsycINFO were independently searched for relevant studies by two authors. Eligible studies had to be identifiable through database searching, published and fully accessible. This systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. An initial pool of 241 studies were found, out of which 69 met the selection criteria and were, therefore, included. The majority reported a worse Mental Health Outcome (MHO) during the pandemic as related to dysfunctional personality and positive personality traits predicting a better outcome. Furthermore, increased levels of interpersonal violence (IV) and self-directed violence were reported. Further research should be conducted on the reciprocal interaction of PDs and IV during the time of pandemic. Nevertheless, the dramatic impact of restrictive measures on PDs has still to be appropriately addressed.","Di Stefano, Di Pietro, Talevi, Rossi, Socci, Pacitti, Rossi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12991-022-00388-0","20220410","COVID-19; Disorder; Lockdown; Pandemic; Personality; Review; Violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30057,""
"Symptoms of COVID-19 contagion in different social contexts in association to self-reported symptoms, mental health and study capacity in Swedish university students","The present study investigates if symptoms of COVID-19 contagion in different social contexts (cohabitants, family, acquaintances, and others) are associated with university students' own self-reported symptoms of COVID-19 contagion, mental health, and study capacity. This was investigated by a cross-sectional survey administrated in Sweden during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, at the time when universities were locked down to limit viral spread and contagion. Mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 in cohabitants and family members were associated with student's self-reported symptoms of contagion, while no associations could be seen in relation to mental health and study capacity. Symptoms of COVID-19 contagion in acquaintances and others were not associated with students' self-reported symptoms, nor with their mental health and study capacity. To conclude, during the initial lockdown of universities students' self-reported symptoms of contagion were mainly associated with cohabitants and family members, while symptoms of contagion in different social contexts were not associated with mental health and study capacity. Findings suggest that lockdown of universities may have contributed to limiting infection pathways, while still allowing students to focus on their studies despite significant contagion among others known to the student.","Andersson, Bendtsen, Molander, Granlund, Topooco, EngstrÃƒÂ¶m, Lindfors, Berman","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-022-06009-z","20220412","COVID-19; Contagion in others; Mental health; Self-contagion; Study capacity; University students; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Self Report; Social Environment; Students; Sweden; Universities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30058,""
"Parents of young infants report poor mental health and more insensitive parenting during the first Covid-19 lockdown","The Covid-19 pandemic has put an unprecedented pressure on families with children. How parents were affected by the first Covid-19 lockdown during the early postpartum period, an already challenging period for many, is unknown. To investigate the associations between Covid-19 related stress, mental health, and insensitive parenting practices in mothers and fathers with young infants during the first Dutch Covid-19 lockdown. The Dutch Covid-19 and Perinatal Experiences (COPE-NL) study included 681 parents of infants between 0 and 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months (572 mothers and 109 fathers). Parents filled out online questionnaires about Covid-19 related stress, mental health (i.e. anxiety and depressive symptoms), and insensitive parenting. Hierarchical regression models were used to analyze the data. Parents of a young infant reported high rates of Covid-19 related stress, with higher reported stress in mothers compared to fathers. Additionally, the percentages of mothers and fathers experiencing clinically meaningful mental health symptoms during the pandemic were relatively high (mothers: 39.7% anxiety, 14.5% depression; fathers: 37.6% anxiety, 6.4% depression). More Covid-19 related stress was associated with more mental health symptoms in parents and increased insensitive parenting practices in mothers. The results emphasize the strain of the pandemic on young fathers' and mothers' mental health and its potential negative consequences for parenting. As poor parental mental health and insensitive parenting practices carry risk for worse child outcomes across the lifespan, the mental health burden of the Covid-19 pandemic might not only have affected the parents, but also the next generation.","van den Heuvel, Vacaru, Boekhorst, Cloin, van Bakel, Riem, de Weerth, Beijers","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04618-x","20220412","Abuse; COVID-19; Fathers; Mothers; Parenting; Stress; COVID-19; Child; Communicable Disease Control; Fathers; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Mental Health; Mothers; Pandemics; Parenting; Parents; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30059,""
"Retrospective analysis of patterns of opioid overdose and interventions delivered at a tertiary hospital emergency department: impact of COVID-19","Opioid-related overdoses cause substantial numbers of preventable deaths. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist available in take-home naloxone (THN) kits as a lifesaving measure for opioid overdose. As the emergency department (ED) is a primary point of contact for patients with high-risk opioid use, evidence-based recommendations from the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia THN practice guidelines include the provision of THN, accompanied by psychosocial interventions. However, implementation of these guidelines in practice is unknown. This study investigated ED opioid-related overdose presentations, concordance of post-overdose interventions with the THN practice guidelines, and the impact, if any, of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic on case presentations. A single-centre retrospective audit was conducted at a major tertiary hospital of patients presenting with overdoses involving opioids and non-opioids between March to August 2019 and March to August 2020. Patient presentations and interventions delivered by the paramedics, ED and upon discharge from the ED were collated from medical records and analysed using descriptive statistics, chi square and independent T-tests. The majority (66.2%) of patients presented to hospital with mixed drug overdoses involving opioids and non-opioids. Pharmaceutical opioids were implicated in a greater proportion (72.1%) of overdoses than illicit opioids. Fewer patients presented in March to August 2020 as compared with 2019 (26 vs. 42), and mixed drug overdoses were more frequent in 2020 than 2019 (80.8% vs. 57.1%). Referral to outpatient psychology (22.0%) and drug and alcohol services (20.3%) were amongst the most common post-discharge interventions. Naloxone was provided to 28 patients (41.2%) by the paramedics and/or ED. No patients received THN upon discharge. This study highlights opportunities to improve ED provision of THN and other interventions post-opioid overdose. Large-scale multi-centre studies are required to ascertain the capacity of EDs to provide THN and the impact of COVID-19 on opioid overdose presentations.","Potaka, Freeman, Soo, Nguyen, Sim, Moullin","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12873-022-00604-w","20220412","Emergency department; Interventions; Opioid overdose; Take-home naloxone; Aftercare; Analgesics, Opioid; COVID-19; Drug Overdose; Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans; Naloxone; Opiate Overdose; Patient Discharge; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Tertiary Care Centers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-13","",30060,""
"Web-Based Single Session Intervention for Perceived Control Over Anxiety During COVID-19: Randomized Controlled Trial","Anxiety is rising across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, and social distancing mandates preclude in-person mental health care. Greater perceived control over anxiety has predicted decreased anxiety pathology, including adaptive responses to uncontrollable stressors. Evidence suggests that no-therapist, single-session interventions can strengthen perceived control over emotions like anxiety; similar programs, if designed for the COVID-19 context, could hold substantial public health value. Our registered report evaluated a no-therapist, single-session, online intervention targeting perceived control over anxiety in the COVID-19 context against a placebo intervention encouraging handwashing. We tested whether the intervention could (1) decrease generalized anxiety and increase perceived control over anxiety and (2) achieve this without decreasing social-distancing intentions. We tested these questions using a between-subjects design in a weighted-probability sample of US adults recruited via a closed online platform (ie, Prolific). All outcomes were indexed via online self-report questionnaires. Of 522 randomized individuals, 500 (95.8%) completed the baseline survey and intervention. Intent-to-treat analyses using all randomized participants (N=522) found no support for therapeutic or iatrogenic effects; effects on generalized anxiety were d=-0.06 (95% CI -0.27 to 0.15; P=.48), effects on perceived control were d=0.04 (95% CI -0.08 to 0.16; P=.48), and effects on social-distancing intentions were d=-0.02 (95% CI -0.23 to 0.19; P=.83). Strengths of this study included a large, nationally representative sample and adherence to open science practices. Implications for scalable interventions, including the challenge of targeting perceived control over anxiety, are discussed.

"Assessment of Canadian perinatal mental health services from the perspective of providers: Where can we improve?","Purpose: Perinatal mental health disorders are common, and rates have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear where providers may improve perinatal mental health care, particularly in countries lacking national guidelines, such as Canada. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of perinatal health providers was conducted to describe the landscape of perinatal mental health knowledge, screening, and treatment practices across Canada. Providers were recruited through listservs, social media, and snowball sampling. Participants completed an online survey that assessed their perinatal mental health training, service provision types, their patient wait times, and treatment barriers, and COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts. Results: A total of 435 providers completed the survey, including physicians, midwives, psychologists, social workers, nurses, and allied non-mental health professionals. Most (87.0%) did not have workplace mandated screening for perinatal mental illness but a third (66%) use a validated screening tool. Many (42%) providers stated their patients needed to wait more than 2 months for services. More than half (57.3%) reported they did not receive or were unsure if they received specialized training in perinatal mental health. Most (87.0%) indicated there were cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers to accessing services. Over two-thirds (69.0%) reported the COVID-19 pandemic reduced access to services. Conclusions: Survey findings reveal significant gaps in training, screening tool use, and timely and culturally safe treatment of perinatal mental health concerns. There is critical need for coordinated and nationally mandated perinatal mental health services in Canada to improve care for pregnant and postpartum people.","Laurel M.
