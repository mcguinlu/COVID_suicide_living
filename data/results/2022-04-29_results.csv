"Mobile Primary Healthcare for post-COVID Patients in Rural Areas: a Proof-of-Concept Study","Introduction Post-COVID syndrome is increasingly recognized as a new clinical entity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients living in rural areas may have to travel long with subjectively great effort to be examined using all necessary interdisciplinary tools. This problem could be addressed with mobile outpatient clinics. Methods In this prospective observational study, we investigated physical fitness, fatigue, depression, cognitive dysfunction and dyspnea in patients with post-COVID syndrome in a mobile interdisciplinary post-COVID outpatient clinic. Upon referral from their primary care physician, patients were offered an appointment at a mobile post-COVID outpatient clinic close to their home. Results We studied 125 patients (female, n=79; 63.2%) in our mobile unit. All patients reported symptoms lasting for more than 12 weeks after acute infection. 88.3% and 64.1% of patients reported significant impairment in physical and mental quality of life. Patients reported a median of three symptoms. The most frequently reported symptoms were fatigue (86.4%), cognitive dysfunction (85.6%), and dyspnea (37.6%). 56.0% of patients performed at <2.5th percentile at the 1 min sit-to-stand test compared to age and sex-matched healthy controls and 25 patients (20.0%) exhibited a drop in oxygen saturation. A questionnaire given to each patient regarding the mobile unit revealed a very high level of patient satisfaction. Conclusion There is an increasing need for high-quality and locally available care for patients with post-COVID syndrome. A mobile post-COVID outpatient clinic is a new concept that may be particularly suitable for use in rural regions. Patients satisfaction following visits in such units is very high.","Andreas Stallmach; Katrin Katzer; Bianca Besteher; Kathrin Finke; Benjamin Giszas; Yvonne Gremme; Rami Abou-Hamdan; Katja Lehmann-Pohl; Maximilian Legen; Jan C Lewejohann; Marlene Machnik; Majd Moshmosh Alsabbagh; Luisa Nardini; Christian Puta; Zoe Stallmach; Philipp Reuken","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.26.22274329","20220428","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30697,""
"CRISIS AFAR: An International Collaborative Study of the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Youth with Autism and Neurodevelopmental Conditions","Importance: Heterogeneous mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic are recognized in the general population, but it has not been systematically assessed in youth with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), including autism spectrum (ASD). Objective: Identify subgroups of youth with ASD/NDD based on the pandemic impact on symptoms and service changes, as well as predictors of outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a naturalistic observational study conducted across 14 North American and European clinical and/or research sites. Parent responses on the Coronavirus Health and Impact Survey Initiative (CRISIS) adapted for Autism and Related Neurodevelopmental Conditions (AFAR) were cross-sectionally collected from April to October 2020. The sample included 1275, 5-21 year-old youth with ASD and/or NDD who were clinically well-characterized prior to the pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures: To identify impact subgroups, hierarchical clustering analyzed eleven AFAR factors measuring pre- to pandemic changes in clinically relevant symptoms and service access. Random forest classification assessed the relative contribution in predicting subgroup membership of 20 features including socio-demographics, pre-pandemic service, and clinical severity along with indices of COVID-19 related experiences and environments empirically-derived from AFAR parent responses and global open sources. Results: Clustering analyses revealed four ASD/NDD impact subgroups. One subgroup - broad symptom worsening only (20% of the aggregate sample) - included youth with worsening symptoms that were above and beyond that of their ASD/NDD peers and with similar service disruptions as those in the aggregate average. The three other subgroups showed symptom changes similar to the aggregate average but differed in service access: primarily modified services (23%), primarily lost services (6%), and average services/symptom changes (53%). Pre-pandemic factors (e.g., number of services), pandemic environments and experiences (e.g., COVID-19 cases, related restrictions, COVID-19 Worries), and age emerged in unique combinations as distinct protective or risk factors for each subgroup. Together they highlighted the role of universal risk factors, such as risk perception, and the protective role of services before and during the pandemic, in middle childhood. Conclusions and Relevance: Concomitant assessment of changes in both symptoms and services access is critical to understand heterogeneous impact of the pandemic on ASD/NDD youth. It enabled the delineation of pathways to risk and resilience that include universal and ASD/NDD specific contributors.","Bethany Vibert; Patricia Segura; Louise Gallagher; Stelios Georgiades; Panagiota Pervanidou; Audrey Thurm; Lindsay Alexander; Evdokia Anagnostou; Yuta Aoki; Catherine S.N.

"Education Racial and Gender Disparities in COVID-19 Worry, Stress, and Food Insecurities across Undergraduate Biology Students at a Southeastern University","The global spread of the novel coronavirus first reported in December 2019 led to drastic changes in the social and economic dynamics of everyday life. Nationwide, racial, gender, and geographic disparities in symptom severity, mortality, and access to health care evolved, which impacted stress and anxiety surrounding COVID-19. On university campuses, drastic shifts in learning environments occurred as universities shifted to remote instruction, which further impacted student mental health and anxiety. Our study aimed to understand how students from diverse backgrounds differ in their worry and stress surrounding COVID-19 upon return to hybrid or in-person classes during the Fall of 2020. Specifically, we addressed the differences in COVID-19 worry, stress response, and COVID-19-related food insecurity related to race/ethnicity (Indigenous American, Asian/Asian American, black/ African American, Latinx/Hispanic, white, or multiple races), gender (male, female, and gender expressive), and geographic origin (ranging from rural to large metropolitan areas) of undergraduate students attending a regional-serving R2 university, in the southeastern U.S. Overall, we found significance in worry, food insecurity, and stress responses with females and gender expressive individuals, along with Hispanic/Latinx, Asian/Asian American, and black/African American students. Additionally, students from large urban areas were more worried about contracting the virus compared to students from rural locations. However, we found fewer differences in self-reported COVID-related stress responses within these students. Our findings can highlight the disparities among students' worry based on gender, racial differences, and geographic origins, with potential implications for mental health of university students from diverse backgrounds. Our results support the inclusion of diverse voices in university decisioning making around the transition through the COVID-19 pandemic.","Correia, K. M.; Bierma, S. R.; Houston, S. D.; Nelson, M.

"Mental Health Costs of Lockdowns: Evidence from Age-Specific Curfews in Turkey","Using a strict, age-specific lockdown order for adults aged 65 and older in Turkey, we examine the mental health consequences of an extended period of tight mobility restrictions on senior adults. Adopting a regression discontinuity design, we find that the curfew-induced decline in mobility substantially worsened mental health outcomes, including somatic and nonsomatic symptoms of mental distress (approximately 0.2 standard deviation). Exploring potential channels, we document an increase in social and physical isolation, with no evidence of robust changes in labor market outcomes or intrahousehold conflict for this subpopulation.","Altindag, O.; Erten, B.; Keskin, P.","https://doi.org/10.1257/app.20200811","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: American Economic Journal-Applied Economics; 14(2):320-343, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30700,""
"MOOD STATES AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PARALYMPIC BOCCIA ATHLETES IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Introduction: Although studies have been conducted in the athlete population during the pandemic, its impacts on Paralympic athletes are still unknown. Objective:To evaluate the mood and quality of life of Paralympic boccia players during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Method: Questionnaires assessing mood, quality of life, and demographic data were sent electronically via social media.The study included 43 athletes from all functional classes (BC1= 8, BC2 = 12, BC3 =11, and BC4 = 11) and four regions of Brazil (Northeast= 12, Southeast = 12, Central-West = 3, and South = 17). ANOVA, t test, and similar non-parametric tests were used, with the respective effect sizes (ES). Resu Its: Regarding mood states, BC4 athletes differed from BC1 athletes in the depression subscale score (25.5 vs.14.5, p = 0.026, ES=1.47).The fatigue subscale score differed between BC4 and BC1 athletes (17.8 vs. 10.4, p= 0.023, ES=138) and between BC4 and BC2 athletes (17.8 vs 10.3, p = 0.008, ES=1.32). BC4 athletes had higher total mood disturbance (TMD) values than BC1 (175 vs. 141, p = 0.025, ES=1.35) and BC2 (175 vs.141, p = 0.025, ES=0.97) athletes. Lower stress (18.5 vs.21.8, p = 0.027, ES=0.64) and TMD (148.0 vs 162.0;p = 0.044;ES= 0.53) values were observed among the national level athletes. In terms of quality of life, differences were found between BC4 and BC2 athletes in the psychological health domain (3.73 vs. 4.49, p = 0.024, ES=0.89) and between athletes from the Northeast and South in the environment domain (3.39 vs. 4.18, p=0.030, ES=0.44). Conclusion: BC4 athletes are more susceptible to negative mood and quality-of-life perceptions. Additionally, athletes from the Northeast region may have poorer perceptions of quality of life related to the environment in which they live.","de Arruda, S. F.; de Oliveira, J. I. V.; Dantas, M. J.

"Assessment of the Quality of Life and Living Conditions of the Rural Population of the Kazakhstan during the COVID-19 Pandemic","BACKGROUND: Low availability of medical care and low level of comfort living in rural areas, underdeveloped infrastructure, and difficult working conditions lead to the deterioration of health of rural residents. Rural areas are characterized by less comfortable living conditions than in the city, which can affect health-related quality of life. AIM: The purpose of this study was to assess the satisfaction of the population with the quality of life in rural areas as well as to study the quality of life of the rural population of the Republic of Kazakhstan related to health. METHODS: This study was a one-stage cross-sectional study. Online questionnaire was asked by 411 local residents, of which only 302 were suitable for processing. RESULTS: The results showed that almost a third of the respondents are unemployed (27.2%). In the course of the survey, respondents could subjectively assess their own health, for example, almost a third of respondents (35.76%) assess their health as â€œpoorâ€ and â€œbelow average.â€ At the same time, 18.21% of respondents are not satisfied with the quality of medical services provided in rural areas. The coefficients of correlation between the desire to move to the city and age, income level, family composition, marital status, and type of housing were established. The universal social functioning-36 index was 0.6 (Â±0.02) for women and 0.55 (Â±0.033) for men CONCLUSIONS: We can say that the quality of life of the rural population remains quite low. This is evidenced by low income, high unemployment, and the problem of drinking water. Quarantine measures related to COVID-19 also had an impact on the increase in unemployment, however, during the quarantine, there is a deterioration in mental health indicators among men compared to women. The results of the study confirmed that the issue of accessibility of medical services remains very urgent for rural residents.","Tulegenova, A.

"Psychological Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic in Dental Healthcare Workers","Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the mental health status of Dental Health Care Workers (DHCWs) in a dental emergency university clinic treating urgent patients during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: A hundred fifteen participants were selected from DHCWs who actively worked during the pandemic in a Dental Emergency Clinic of a university. Depression, anxiety and stress levels of participants were measured with the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale and their insomnia levels were assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index. Correlations between independent continuous and dependent variables tested with Spearman test. Mann-Whitney U and KruskalWallis tests were used used to evaluate possible effects of independent variables. The psychological data of the aerosol-generating treatment group were compared to the rest of the participants using Mann-Whitney U tests. In all tests alpha=0.05 significance level was set. Results: The rates of DHCWs scored above the cut-off points were 54% for depression, 40% for anxiety, 36% for stress and 40% for insomnia. Feeling negative emotions before the pandemic significantly interacted with all psychometric measurements. Younger age, feeling anxious about changing working conditions and/or obtaining personal protective equipment was correlated positively with stress points (p=0.035, p=0.008, p=0.007, respectively). A significant percentage of DHCWs presented high scores on depression, anxiety, stress and insomnia in this study. Conclusion: The authorities and healthcare executives must show programmed leadership and support for DHCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak. The integration of programs developed to mitigate stress among DHCWs recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Demirci, G. K.; Bilgi, M. M.; Erdogan, E.; Bilgi, I. K.; Caliskan, M.

"Cancer patientsâ€™ experience during the COVID-19 pandemic and their satisfaction with telehealth","Objective: Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound emotional impact in general population and, especially, in patients with chronic diseases, like cancer patients. Moreover, it has placed unparalelled demands on healthcare systems. The aim of the present study is to explore this impact on oncology patients from their own experience, assess their coping strategies and also know their opinion about the healthcare assistance received. Method: One hundred and eighteen oncology patients from 5 different hospitals around Barcelona participated in the study. Data was collected using both HADS and an ad-hoc questionnaire which evaluated emotional distress, coping strategies, risk-contagion perception, social support and assessment of changes in healthcare assistance. Results: A total of 51.4% of the subjects presented high rates of anxiety and 36% depression. Worry (73.7%), fear (72.8%), anxiety and sadness (56.1%) were the most frequent emotions expressed. Around 74.1% of the sample felt very satisfied with the healthcare services and 94.6% felt supported by their health team. A 40.7% of the patients disagreed with telemedicine assessment, while 33.7% had predominantly a positive perception. Conclusions: Oncology patients considered that COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected their emotional status and quality of life. Getting to know patientsâ€™ opinions about telemedicine may aid in facilitating care and improving its design to provide better and more efficient care.","Bruzos, E. R.; Lumbreras, S.

"Effects of Yoga in PTSD Post COVID-19","Introduction: Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is due to exposure to extreme lifetime traumatic events and there seems to be no cure. In COVID-19 era PTSD is very common among people due to permanent disability and death of near and dear ones. These people suffer daily from the recurring thoughts of reliving the trauma again. I chose this topic because I came across so many people with post COVID-19 stress and depression. Aims: To determine alternative ways to treat PTSD rather than the use of traditional therapies. Materials and methods: Yoga is a whole body and mind practice that in stills peace and empowerment. A total of 30 minutes yoga daily is beneficial at the cellular and even genetic level to enhance the immune system and reduce stress. Balancing the stress-response system: shift from sympathetic (energy burning) to parasympathetic (energy recharging) helps in dealing with post COVID-19 stress and depression. Results: Previous studies have shown effect of yoga on hippocampus which is thought to be responsible for intrusive memories and flashbacks that occur in people with this PTSD. Yoga helps in learning to tolerate feelings and sensations by increasing the capacity for introspection, moderate arousal and learning that after confrontation with physical helplessness it is essential to engage in taking effective action. Sensory input can automatically stimulate hormonal secretions and activation of brain regions involved in attention and memory. Conclusion: People doing yoga showed significant decrease in frequency of intrusions and severity of hyperarousal symptoms. These people reported a sense of awareness that they had not experienced before and learned to sense and focus on their bodies after the yoga sessions.","Ayushi, Gitanjali, Ajeet","https://doi.org/10.7860/JCDR/2022/43626.16017","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research; 16(SUPPL 2):63, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30706,""
"Practices, Perceptions and Challenges of Postgraduate Medical Students on Breaking Bad News: A Mixed Method Study","Background: Any information which will affect adversely and drastically a patient's view of his/her future is called as bad news. Breaking a bad news involves ethical, legal, professional and human rights related issues. But there was no proper training currently among most of the postgraduate medical students of India. This results in miscommunication of information and ultimately lack of trust and piling up of legal cases. Medical fraternity including postgraduates of clinical departments has had some experience of breaking bad news at any point of time. There was limited mixed method study to explore this aspect of communication skills in India. Description: It was a Mixed Method Study conducted among 122 medical postgraduates excluding non-clinical postgraduates of a tertiary care hospital, Tamil Nadu by Universal Sampling Method using Focus Group Discussion with FGD Guide and a pre-validated questionnaire through Google forms. Quantitative data analysed through SPSS software and qualitative data analysed through manual thematic analysis. Outcome: Around 51% were from non-Tamil origin and 53% were aware of some type of communication models. SPIKE, ABCDE and BREAK were the models mentioned by the participants About 89% had experience of delivering bad news in the past and among the bad news delivered 75.3% was declaring deaths, 67.1% was communicating the patients about COVID positivity status, 64.7% was communicating the patients about a non-reversible complication of a disease, 38.8% was about communication of cancer diagnosis, 18.8% was about HIV positivity status and 10.6% was communication of positive genetic test results. Challenges mentioned by the participants were language issues, lack of better communication skills, not expertise in the field to answer the questions of the patients/relatives, fear of physical assault, fear of legal issues, personal mental health issues, lack of counselling skills, lack of self-confidence, fear of losing reputation of a life-saving Doctor and fear of questions faced in death audit/case audit. About 58% of the participants did not feel comfortable in delivering bad news and 57.7% felt empathic towards them. In addition, 96.5% maintained privacy while delivering the bad news. Before conveying the bad news, 42% of them agreed that warning shots should be given and 52% felt that after communicating the bad news, the patients should be encouraged to express their feeling and they should clarify their doubts. Around 80% felt that breaking a bad news is a skill and it needs training and expressed that they want to undergo intense training on the same. Conclusion: Breaking a bad news is a skill and half of the participants felt uncomfortable in delivering bad news. Three fourth of them mentioned that they need further training for delivering bad news even after though they have undergone initial training during PG orientation program and expressed various challenges including language issues and lack of communication and counselling skills. Hence, reinforcement of training in breaking bad news should be part of their teaching to reduce ethical and legal issues in future.","Annadurai, K.","https://doi.org/10.7860/JCDR/2022/53534.15841","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research; 16(SUPPL 1):10-11, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30707,""
"Practical guidelines for management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in a child and adolescent psychiatric ward","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic - in addition to its many widely described negative consequences - has created a challenge for the mental health care system in every country, including Poland to safely manage psychiatric disorders in addition to preventing and treating COVID-19. In Poland, online mental health services are provided for the outpatients. Still there are patients with severe psychiatric disorders who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and need to be treated in a psychiatric hospital. The Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of the Medical University of Warsaw was appointed by local authorities to hospitalize children with mental disorders and with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. This created an urgent need to adapt our department for treating COVID-19 infected patients.

"Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) Practices from the Perspective of Classroom Teachers Teaching in Disadvantaged Suburban Primary School","The current study aims to determine how emergency remote teaching (ERT) practices were conducted in a disadvantaged suburban public primary school during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, a disadvantaged suburban public primary school in the Marmara region, Turkey, was selected as a case and an instrumental case study design was chosen for the study. For data collection, in-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview form with 10 classroom teachers. In addition, natural observations were conducted by one of the researchers who is also a teacher in the same school. As a result of the thematic analysis, two main themes were identified: ""disadvantage experienced by students"" and ""the consequences of disadvantage."" The disadvantage experienced by the students has two different dimensions, social and economic. It was found that these disadvantages lead to different effects on students and teachers. The results of the study show that students face economic disadvantages in purchasing the imperative learning materials to participate in the online course.

"The impact of the UK national lockdown on trauma patterns and the pre-hospital advanced trauma team response within metropolitan London","Introduction: The societal changes triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant lockdowns have the potential to alter the incidence and nature of injuries within affected populations. We aimed to investigate these changes within metropolitan London and the impact lockdown had on Londonâ€™s Air Ambulanceâ€™s (LAA) response to incidents. Methods: This retrospective cohort study compared data from all LAA missions in the two-month period following instigation of the first UK national lockdown in 2020 to the equivalent period in 2019. Patient demographics, nature and severity of injuries, incident details and LAA mission parameters were assessed. Results: LAA saw a significant reduction in the mean (standard deviation) of activations per week under lockdown (32.75 [4.95] vs. 54.25 [4.53], p &lt; 0.001). The distribution of patients across different trauma aetiologies differed significantly under lockdown, with proportionately more injuries resulting from domestic violence (DV) (0.7% vs. 3.8%) and deliberate self-harm (DSH) (16.5% vs. 12.4%), although the absolute number of DSH fell. Significantly fewer incidents occurred in central areas of London, but injury severity was unaffected by lockdown. After adjustment for confounders, lockdown was associated with shorter drive times, but not overall response times. There was no association between lockdown and aetiology or severity of injuries. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing UK national lockdown had a substantial impact on major trauma patterns within London and the subsequent LAA response. The feared rise in suicide was not observed, but there was a notable increase in DV frequency.","Milne, A.; Saggers, R.; Hurst, T. P.; Henry, C.

"A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Prevalence of Depressive Symptoms among Healthcare Workers in Pakistan during Covid Pandemic","Workload and stress of healthcare workers has increased manifolds as result of COVID-19. Healthcare workers in developing countries like Pakistan face lack of resources and psychological support in addition to changes in work routines, fear, isolation and separation from families. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence of depressive symptoms among healthcare workers in Pakistan during COVID-19 pandemic. PubMed and Google Scholar were searched on January 2nd 2022. We included cross-sectional studies published during COVID outbreak in Pakistan (from January 2020 to December 2021). We extracted data on study characteristics and depression prevalence. Random effects models was used to conduct Meta-analysis. In total, 10 studies involving 12507 participants were included. The pooled prevalence of depression was 25.5% (95% CI, 19.5% to 32.5%), with significant between-study heterogeneity (I2= 95.83%, Q=216.15, p &lt; 0.001).

"The effect of fear of COVID-19 on quality of life in patients with epilepsy","Objective: In the COVID-19 pandemic period, the effect of COVID-19 fear on quality of life was uncertain. This present study examined the effect of fear of COVID-19 on quality of life in patients with epilepsy through anxiety and depression. Methods: This single-center, cross-sectional study was conducted with a total of 319 adult patients with epilepsy. The mean age of the patients was 36.0 (+/- 11.1) years, and 53% were male. The mean duration of diagnosis was 16.0 (+/- 10.6) years, and more than half of the patients (52.4%) were using two and more antiepileptic drugs. Data were collected online between 15 December 2020 and 5 January 2021. COVID-19 Fear Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Worry and Anxiety Questionnaire, and Epilepsy Quality of Life Scale-10 were used for data collection. Serial mediation analysis was conducted to determine the effect of COVID-19 fear on quality of life. Results: Although there was a significant correlation between them, the fear of COVID-19 did not directly affect the quality of life. The fear of COVID-19 increased anxiety and depression respectively, the increase in the mediators also decreased the quality of life. Conclusion: The fear of COVID-19 experienced by patients with epilepsy did not have a significant direct effect on the quality of life. However, it was found that it had an indirect effect on the quality of life by increasing mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, the indirect effect was mostly on anxiety.","Yeni, K.; Tulek, Z.; Ozer, A.; Cavusoglu, A.; Inan, G.

"WORKING MODES AND EVALUATION OF PERCEIVED STRESS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Introduction. The global sanitary crisis due to covid 19 has had an unprecedent impact on human health and on the global economy creating unexpected challenges on work life. In Italy in order to limit the velocity of virus transmission, measures aimed towards social distancing were adopted by suspending all non essential working activities, with the recommendation of the maximum use of smart working (DPCM 01 MARCH 2020). Literature regarding precedent experiences worldwide on the impact of epidemic or pandemic flu viruses on the working enviroment report of a strong presence of correlated work stress. Objectives. The study is focalized in identifying the individual stress level correlated to work percieved in workers in the context of the unexpected scenario in adapting to work in a short time period relative to the emergency context. Materials and Methods. An epidemiological observational survey was conducted on the web during the months of May and June. The workers were invited in answering a questionnaire using a dedicated link. The questionnaire consisted in a introductive scheme(card) built ad hoc for the study containing information for the socio-demographic variables and work experience. The Evaluation Rapid Stress scale (VRS) was used for the rating of the subjective stress. The t Student test was used for the independant samples in the assay for the average scores of the VRS for sex and age. The ANOVA test was used in order to compare the various scores of the VRS in the three different working modes investigated (work on site, smart working or for both the modalities). A p0.05 was considered as level of significance. The statistical assay was conducted with the STATA software packet. Results. 337 workers answered the questionnaire. The rating of the VRS scores for sex highlighted significative differences between men and women in the levels of anxiety, depression, somatization and aggression showing higher values in women. The highest total scores of the VRS questionnaire and those related to the anxiety and somatization dimensions express higher levels of stress levels in response to the emergency situation in workers who carry out their activity in a on-site mode over the age of 40 and in parents. The comparison with the scores reported between the different working modes was resulted statistically significant. Conclusions. The results of our investigation are an expression of the perception of a widespread danger, linked to the threat of contracting the COVID-19 virus, whose mode and speed of transmission is surprising and for which therapy and in definitive treatment is not yet available. This leads to a series of emotional reactions in which stress is the main condition. The timely exploration aimed at the individuation of a stress problem in the working environment is extremely important especially in emergency situations in order to implement appropriate strategies of prevention.","Angelone, A.

"Public health issues and health rendezvous for migrants from conflict zones in Ukraine: A French practice guideline","Given the number of people leaving the war zone in Ukraine and arriving in France, the French high council for public health (HCSP) has drawn up a number of recommendations. The experts have taken into account the vulnerability of migrant populations, which is exacerbated by (a) promiscuity that increases the risk of exposure to infectious agents; (b) the psychological consequences of conflict, family separation and exile; (c) prevalence in Ukraine of communicable diseases such as (possibly) multi-resistant) tuberculosis, HIV and HCV; (d) low vaccination coverage (risk of circulation of poliovirus) and (e) the risk of spreading infectious diseases (Covid-19, measlesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦).Consequently, experts recommend that priority be given to: i) Initial (immediate) reception, which will help to provide emergency care and to assess immediate needs (psychological disorders, risk of medication breakdown and risk of infection); (ii) Other priority measures (vaccination catch-up, including vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and mandatory vaccination for children's entry into school, screening for post-traumatic stress disorder and tuberculosis) must be implemented as soon as feasible. At this stage, it is imperative: To ensure coordination and access to information throughout the country, by providing medico-social support (opening of social rights and access to care); To digitize medical data for the purposes of traceability; To use professional interpreting and/or health facilitators, or else, if necessary, digital translation tools.

"Anticipatory worry and returning to campus during the COVID-19 pandemic","Assessing the psychological needs of students and employees as they return to campus is crucial to resuming University life in a safe and secure way. The current research aimed to explore how safety concerns, anticipatory worry, and mitigation efforts affected the well-being of individuals within a campus community. A five-part survey was distributed via student &amp; employee listservs in the Fall 2020 at a midsize private university in the Mid-Atlantic Mid-Atlantic United States. Participants were surveyed about sources of worry regarding Covid-19, levels of anticipatory worry, amenability to various mitigation strategies and whether intended implementation of safety mitigation measures impacted worry levels. Data collected from 559 students and employees indicated a relationship between source of worry and level of distress, with the greatest source of worry being fear of getting sick. Anticipatory worry after thinking about safety mechanisms was significantly lower than anticipated worry before thinking about safety mechanisms. No differences were found between students and employee experiences of worry, and there was no moderating effect of role on the difference between anticipated worry after, as compared to before, thinking about the mechanisms. Findings highlight how different sources of concern related to Covid-19 are associated with varying levels of distress, the significant impact that the presence of mitigation strategies can have on reducing overall levels of anticipatory worry, and the universality of distress associated with Covid-19.","Pandit, Monda, Campbell","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2022.2057803","20220428","Anticipatory worry; COVID-19; coronavirus pandemic; health anxiety; mental health; mitigation strategies; return to campus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30723,""
"Emotional Impact in Adolescents in Ecuador Six Months after the Beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the emotional health of adolescents, especially those with low resilience and life satisfaction.

Satisfaction, resilience, anxiety, depression, stress and worries about COVID-19 were assessed. Structural equation models (SEM) and models based on qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) were performed. The results indicate that worries are associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. However, higher physical health worries are associated with lower emotional distress. SEM models indicate that life satisfaction is negatively associated with emotional distress. In QCA models, emotional distress is explained by high worries, low resilience, and life satisfaction. Life satisfaction plays a mediating role in emotional distress.In conclusion, adolescents are one of the groups particularly vulnerable to this situation of restriction created by COVID-19. It is necessary to detect signs of risk and protection in emotional adjustment, especially life satisfaction, that appears like principal damper variable.","Coello, Valero-Moreno, Herrera, Lacomba-Trejo, PÃƒÂ©rez-MarÃƒÂ­n","https://doi.org/10.1080/00223980.2022.2054921","20220428","COVID-19; Emotional distress; adolescence; life satisfaction; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30724,""
"Factors associated with psychological symptoms in hospital workers of a French hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic: Lessons from the first wave","The COVID-19 pandemic has put hospital workers around the world in an unprecedented and difficult situation, possibly leading to emotional difficulties and mental health problems. We aimed to analyze psychological symptoms of the hospital employees of the Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital Group a few months after the 1st wave of the pandemic. From July 15 to October 1, 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among hospital workers in the two locations of our hospital group using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist (PCL) to measure anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms. Factors independently associated with these symptoms were identified. In total, 780 participants (47% caregivers, 18% health administrative workers, 16% physicians, and 19% other professionals) completed the survey. Significant symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD were reported by 41%, 21%, and 14% of the participants, respectively. Hierarchical regression analysis showed a higher risk of having psychological symptoms among those (1) who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 or had colleagues or relatives infected by the virus, (2) who retrospectively reported to have had an anxious experience during the first wave, and (3) with a previous history of burnout or depression. In contrast, job satisfaction appeared to be a protective factor. Overall, hospital workers showed the statistically same levels of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms, regardless of their profession and whether they had worked in units with COVID-19 patients or not. Our cross-sectional survey of 780 hospital workers shows that after the first wave, hospital employees had a significant burden of mental health symptoms. Specific preventive measures to promote mental well-being among hospital workers exposed to COVID-19 need to be implemented, first among particularly vulnerable staff, and then, for all hospital staff for whom anxiety is detected early, and not only those who were directly exposed to infected patients.","d'Ussel, Fels, Durand, Lemogne, Chatellier, Castreau, Adam","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267032","20220428","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30725,""
"Relational Uncertainty, Interdependence, and Psychological Distress during COVID-19:A Longitudinal Study","Drawing on the relational turbulence theory, this study explored the associations of self, partner, and relationship uncertainty, and partner interference and facilitation with psychological distress symptoms during the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. A longitudinal study of 313 individuals was conducted in Israel at 3 time points, spanning from the first lockdown (April 2020) and through the alleviation of the severe restrictions (June 2020). Multilevel modeling indicated divergent associations between the different sources of relational uncertainty and interdependence and somatization, depression, and anxiety. Further analyses pointed to divergent findings regarding how change in self, partner, and relationship uncertainty predicted change in somatization, depression, and anxiety over the course of the study, depending on whether the three sources of relational uncertainty were analyzed separately or simultaneously in the same model. Change in interference from a partner did not predict changes in psychological distress. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. This article is protected by copyright.

"Impact of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among the Libyan population","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have a potentially serious effect on mental health and increase the risk of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorders in people. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of psychological illness and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Libyan population's mental health. A cross-sectional survey, conducted in both online and paper modes and consisting of five sections, was completed in more than 30 cities and towns across Libya. The first section consisted of questions on basic demographic characteristics. The second section contained a survey related to the lockdown status, activities, related stress levels, and quarantine. The third section comprised the self-administered 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The fourth section contained the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and the fifth section contained the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Of the 31,557 respondents, 4,280 (13.6%) reported severe depressive symptoms, with a mean [standard deviation (SD)] PHQ-9 score of 8.32 (5.44); 1,767 (5.6%) reported severe anxiety symptoms, with a mean (SD) GAD-7 score of 6 (4.6); and 6,245 (19.8%) of the respondents reported post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with a mean (SD) score of 15.3 (18.85). In multivariate analysis, young age, being female, unmarried, educated, or victims of domestic violence or abuse, work suspension during the pandemic, and having increased workload, financial issues, suicidal thoughts, or a family member with or hospitalized due to COVID-19 were significantly associated with a high likelihood of depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as PTSD. Internal displacement due to civil war was also associated with PTSD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and civil war in Libya. Further study on the development of strategies and interventions aimed at reducing the mental disease burden on the Libyan population is warranted.","Elhadi, Msherghi, Khaled, Alsoufi, Alhadi, Kareem, Ashini, Alsharif, Alhodiri, Altaeb, Hamed, Itrunbah, Mohmmed, Alameen, Idheiraj, Shuwayyah, Alhudhairy, Alansari, Abraheem, Akl, Nagib, Almugaddami, Aljameel, Muamr, Alsuwiyah, Alsghair, Soula, Buzreg, Alagelli, Aldireewi, Bareem, Alshareea, Gemberlo, Zaid","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267426","20220428","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30727,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic as traumatic stressor: Distress in older adults is predicted by childhood trauma and mitigated by defensive functioning","It has been broadly anticipated that COVID-19 pandemic-related experiences may constitute traumatic stressors, and that older adults' might be especially at risk of experiencing mental health symptoms during the pandemic. The present study aimed to examine older adults' psychological distress: posttraumatic stress, Covid-related fears, anxiety, and depression during the pandemic, and the relationship between present distress, defensive functioning, and childhood trauma. We also explored potential differences between older adults (between 65 and 74 years), and older-older adults (75 years and above). A large-scale online survey was conducted during the early months of the pandemic, for the present study, we included participants above 65 years old (N = 1,225) mainly from the United States and Canada. Results showed that age, adverse childhood experiences, and overall defensive functioning were significantly related to posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression. Specifically, younger age and more reported childhood adversity were related to higher distress, whereas the use of more adaptive defenses was related to less distress. Covid-related fears were not associated with age. Our final model showed that defensive functioning mediated the relationship between childhood trauma and distress. Our results support the relative resilience of older-older adults compared to older adults, as well as the long-lasting impact of childhood adversity through defensive functioning later in life, specifically in times of heightened stress, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies are warranted to identify further factors affecting defensive functioning as adults age, as well as processes that are associated with resilience in response to stressors in older adulthood.

"Differences in posttraumatic stress disorder networks between young adults and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been frequently reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there is evidence for age differences in PTSD symptoms, many studies assume that PTSD is a latent entity and overlook such differences. To address this gap, the aim of this study was to use network analysis to examine and compare PTSD symptom networks across different ages. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 1,153 young adults and 683 adolescents were selected to complete self-report questionnaires. Two networks shared core symptoms (e.g., exaggerated startle response and irritability) in the arousal cluster. A network comparison test indicated that the young adult network was significantly stronger than the adolescent network. Except for exaggerated startle response and lack of positive emotion, symptoms in the young adult network exhibited higher centrality than in the adolescent network. An age difference in PTSD at the symptom level and provide practical evidence that could inform mental health interventions after the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Increases in preventable diseases due to antivaccination beliefs: Implications for schools","Human history is replete with pandemics caused by virulent diseases that have produced overwhelming suffering and death. Our future will require swift, sensible, and near-universal vaccine response as viruses evolve and thrive. When viruses like COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 emerge and mutate, vaccine researchers must be nimble and responsive to quickly develop effective vaccines. However, averting a preventable disease and consequent pandemic also requires the participation of all members of society, and there remain a considerable number of individuals who refuse to accept vaccination as a safe and effective prophylaxis. This refusal stems from deeply rooted fears and values and is further reinforced by antivaccination propaganda circulating the internet and media. By considering the psychological underpinnings of antivaccination attitudes, vaccination advocates, scientists, and policy makers can adapt and target their vaccination campaigns to appeal to those with doubts and concerns about vaccines. Schools serve an important role in promoting and mandating vaccinations to help prevent disease, and vaccinations are vital in school settings where densely populated classrooms facilitate the propagation of disease. School administrators and school nurses have important roles in establishing vaccination requirements and ensuring compliance, and school psychologists and mental health staff can help address vaccination concerns, doubts, and fears among school staff, parents, and students. It is vital that scientists, health care providers, and school staff work collaboratively to communicate with families and children about vaccination and counter antivaccination narratives with emotionally compelling stories that promote vaccine uptake and prevent disease outbreaks.

"Implications of epidemic-pandemic convergence for routine care adoption of contingency management: A case study","The significant increase in opioid-related drug overdoses during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has put an unprecedented burden on hospital emergency departments, who saw as high as an approximate 150% increase in emergency department (ED) admission rates in the initial months of the pandemic. Although overdose is a clear sign of problem drug use, only a small proportion of nonfatal overdose patients enroll in treatment within 30 days of their overdose. To bridge the gap between opioid overdoses and treatment entry, a smartphone-smart debit card contingency management program was developed to promote entry into medication-assisted treatment by out-of-treatment opioid users who have recently received care in a hospital emergency department. The case study described in this article highlights a successful implementation of this intervention despite numerous disruptions related to COVID-19 that would have made engagement difficult without the remote access to contingency management provided by this technology. Patient status over time is presented in conjunction with contingency management earnings. Technology-based contingency management may provide improved scalability, rigorous outcomes metrics, and lower costs than prior onsite, manual contingency management (CM) approaches. The COVID-19 pandemic, in combination with the opioid epidemic has created a context in which historical obstacles to the adoption of contingency management may be overcome. This case study demonstrates the potential utility of smartphone-based contingency management when in-person care is difficult to access or disrupted. The requirement for further research demonstrating the efficacy of these approaches is discussed.

"The Impact of Harm Review Service on Patients Awaiting Elective Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Surgery for More Than 52 Weeks","Background and objective There has been a significant increase in waiting times for elective surgical proceduresÃ‚Â in orthopaedic surgery as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As per the hospital policy, patients awaiting elective surgery for more than 52 weeks were offered a consultant-led harm review. The aim of this study was to objectively assess the impact of this service on the field of foot and ankle surgery. Materials and methods The data from harm review clinics at a District General Hospital related to patients waiting to undergoÃ‚Â elective foot and ankle procedures in the year 2021 (wait time of more than 52 weeks) were assessed. Clinical data points like change in diagnosis, need for further investigations, and patients being taken off the waiting list were reviewed. The effect of the waiting time on patients' mental health and their perception of the service was assessed as well. Results A total of 72 patients awaiting foot and ankle procedures for more than 52 weeksÃ‚Â were assessed as a part of the harm review service. It was noted that 25% of patients found that their symptoms had worsened while 66.1% perceived them to be unchanged. Twelve patients (16.9%) were sent for updated investigations. Twenty-one patients (29.5%) were taken off the waiting lists for various reasons with the most common one being other pressing health concerns; 9% of patients affirmed that the wait for surgery had a significant negative impact on their mental health. Conclusion This study concludes that the harm review service is a useful programme as it helps guide changes in the diagnosis and clinical picture. The service is found to be valuable by most patients, and its impact on the service specialities and multiple centres could be further assessed to draw broad conclusions.","Virani, Asaad, Divekar, Southgate, Dhinsa","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.23444","20220428","efficacy of harm review clinic; elective foot and ankle surgeries; foot and ankle 52 weeks wait; harm review clinic during covid-19; harm review service impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30735,""
"Brief Mindfulness Intervention for Emotional Distress, Resilience, and Compassion in Family Physicians During COVID-19: A Pilot Study","There are high rates of professional burnout among family physicians and trainees. We undertook this study to investigate whether a brief mindfulness intervention could help manage burnout and improve well-being among family physicians in a residency program. A total of 21 family physicians participated in a brief, 8-week mindfulness program. We used a single-sample, pre/post design at a Midwestern family medicine residency program. At two points in time (baseline and postintervention), participants completed an online survey measuring burnout, depression, anxiety, stress, perceived resilience, and compassion. We used linear mixed models to estimate the effect of the intervention on the outcome measures. Participants had improvements after the 8-week intervention. At postintervention, they had significantly better scores on anxiety (<i>P&lt;</i>.004), stress (<i>P&lt;</i>.001), perceived resilience (<i>P&lt;</i>.001), and compassion (<i>P&lt;</i>.001). There were no significant changes on the personal accomplishment, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization subscales of either the abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory or the depression subscale of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21. This brief mindfulness program was associated with significant reduction in the scores of anxiety and stress as well as significant improvement in perceived resilience and compassion scores.

"Increased Anxiety and Depression Among Belgian Sexual Minority Groups During the First COVID-19 Lockdown-Results From an Online Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic most likely had a negative impact on mental health. Sexual minorities are at higher risk for adverse mental outcomes such as depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. Such mental health disparities may have exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to restricted real-life social contact. The study aim was to examine changes in depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation among Belgian sexual minority adults between the periods before and during the first COVID-19 lockdown. We conducted an online survey, which was disseminated by community organizations throughout Belgium in April 2020. The questionnaire included two-item Generalized-Anxiety-Disorder (GAD-2) and Patient-Health-Questionnaire (PHQ-2) measures. To assess how such symptoms and other factors (e.g., loneliness) had changed, we asked to what extent these occurred before and since the lockdown. We included 965 fully completed questionnaires in the analysis. The proportions of participants screening positive for depression and anxiety were significantly higher during the lockdown than before the lockdown, based on their reported symptoms for these periods: 29.3%% vs. 13.5% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and 37.1% vs. 25.7% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) respectively. Lonely and young participants were more likely to acquire depression. About one in five participants reported suicidal ideation. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated already existing mental health disparities between sexual minority adults and the general population. These exacerbations may be the result of increased loneliness and social isolation. The results highlight the need for stimulating and strengthening social connectedness within the LGBTQI community during and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the need for maintaining mental health services for such groups during pandemic restrictions.","Reyniers, Buffel, Thunnissen, Vuylsteke, Siegel, NÃƒÂ¶stlinger, Wouters","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.797093","20220428","COVID-19; LGBT; anxiety; depression; lockdown; physical distancing; social contact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30737,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on sleep quality among medical and general science students: King Saud University Experience","Sleep is a vital component for overall health and well-being, and it plays an essential role in social, physical, psychological, and cognitive health. This study aimed to appraise the sleep quality in medical and science students during the COVID-19 pandemic. This questionnaire-based cross sectional study was conducted in the Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during September-December 2020. In this study, a validated self-administered electronic questionnaire was distributed to 1000 students, 782 (78.2%) of whom completed the study. The selection of students was based on using the stratified random sampling. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) instrument scale was used to assess the sleep quality among medical and general sciences students. Out of 782 respondents, 410 (52.4%) were medical students, and 372 (47.6%) were science students, including Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Statistics, Botany, and Zoology. Among the medical students, 143 (34.9%) were in pre-clinical years (1st and 2nd), while 266 (64.9%) of them were in clinical years (3rd, 4th, and 5th). Among all medical and general sciences students, it was found that 669 (85.5%) had poor sleep quality with a mean PSQI global score (mean 8.356) among them 336 (50.2%) were medical, and 333 (49.8%) were science students. Science students' sleep quality was poorer (mean 8.78) than their medical counterparts (mean= 7.93). The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant negative impact on students' mental health and sleep quality. Both medical and general science students showed alarming levels of sleep deprivation and concerning low sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sleep deprivation among students may be due to the sudden change of pedagogy in education driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Relation between ADHD and COVID-19: A Narrative Review to Guide Advancing Clinical Research and Therapy","<b>Objective:</b> To cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, national health authorities temporarily closed cultural, religious, and educational institutions such as universities and schools. Children and adolescents with ADHD were challenged with the restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic such as homeschooling and reduced physical activity. The present narrative review aimed to summarize the state-of-the-art regarding associations between COVID-19-related social restrictions and possible psychological and behavioral issues in children and adolescents with ADHD. Additionally, we discussed the underlying possible reasons of the association focusing on the role of parental influence and physical activity, vulnerabilities of individuals with ADHD to Covid-19 infection and to school closure and remote learning. <b>Method:</b> To collect data for the present narrative review, recent publications on these topics between February 1st, 2020 and January 10th, 2021 were retrieved from the most popular search engines (PubMed; Scopus; Google Scholar; Psych Info; Embase) through a comprehensive search using relevant keywords. <b>Results:</b> During confinement, children and adolescents with ADHD reported increased behavioral and ADHD-related symptoms and overall decreased psychological well-being. Factors negatively impacting children's and adolescents' behavioral symptoms and well-being were: less physical activity, adverse parental behavior, difficulties in coping with preventive guidelines, and school closure and remote learning consequences. <b>Conclusion:</b> Children and adolescents with ADHD and their caregivers faced both specific and general psychological issues related to the school lockdowns and homeschooling. Additionally, Individuals with ADHD seem to be more vulnerable to Covid-19 infection which highlights the need for better healthcare adaptation.","Davoody, Goeschl, Dolatshahi, Davari-Ashtiani, Saffarpour, Sodeifian, Brand","https://doi.org/10.18502/ijps.v17i1.8055","20220428","Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; COVID-19; Mental Health; Psychiatry; Review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30739,""
"Maternal Perceived Stress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Pre-Existing Risk Factors and Concurrent Correlates in New York City Women","<b>Objective:</b> We examined whether pre-pandemic mental health and sociodemographic characteristics increased the susceptibility of pregnant women and mothers of young children to stress in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Between April and August 2020, we surveyed 1560 women participating in a sociodemographically diverse birth cohort in New York City. Women reported their perceived stress, resiliency, and financial, familial/societal, and health-related concerns. We extracted pre-pandemic information from questionnaires and electronic health records. <b>Results:</b> Pre-pandemic history of depression, current financial difficulties, and COVID-19 infection were the main risk factors associated with high perceived stress. Being Hispanic and having higher resiliency scores and preexisting social support were protective against high perceived stress. Major contributors to current perceived stress were financial and familial/societal factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among pregnant women, changes to prenatal care were common, as were changes to experiences following birth among postpartum women and difficulties in arranging childcare among mothers of young children. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that major risk factors of higher stress during the pandemic were similar to those of other major traumatic events.","Ghassabian, Jacobson, Kahn, Brubaker, Mehta-Lee, Trasande","https://doi.org/10.3389/ijph.2022.1604497","20220428","COVID-19; maternal stress; population health; post-birth; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30740,""
"The positive impact of GIRFT (getting it right first time) on arthroplasty services in times of COVID-19","This observational study evaluates the trends in arthroplasty services across National Health Services (NHS) following the COVID-19 pandemic about GIRFT (Getting it Right First Time) guidelines concerning National joint registry data (NJR data). Since the advent of the COVID-19 crisis sustainability of elective arthroplasty services have become a burning question in NHS. Capacity crisis, unknown COVID-19 infection status, lack of ring-fenced beds, winter crisis, and unprecedented trauma have aggravated the situation further leading to severe impairment in quality of life and service provision. GIRFT guidelines have suggested a few solutions to this crisis and one of them is dividing the hospitals into Hot (trauma) and cold (elective) sites. To review NJR data for pre and post COVID era along with the service structure of the hospital and test the hypothesis that whether redistribution of services into hot and cold sites is a possible solution for sustainable arthroplasty service across NHS. A search was made into the NJR data from 2019, 2020, and 2021. The First 7 months were taken from each year I.e. From Ist January to 31st of July. A review of entries for arthroplasty was considered for all hospitals across England and Wales. Hospitals in Scotland, Ireland, and Isles of Man and major trauma centers were excluded.Any hospital that was recording at least 15 arthroplasty cases for 4 out of 7 months in 2021 was considered for review. A brief evaluation of their service structure was made, and hospitals were divided into Elective Centres (EC), Urgent Care Centres (UCC), and District General Hospitals (DGH) with in-house emergency services based on the information provided on their official website. In NJR data ""completed operations by submission date"" column was considered as a reference for data collection. A total of 1807, 1800, and 1810 were identified for 2019, 2020, and 2021 respectively.However, after applying inclusion criteria total number of entries was reduced to 120 hospitals. Data analysis and selection of hospitals were reviewed twice by two authors (MMK and AP) at different times to avoid any bias and reduce the chances of human error that can affect the outcome. A sub-analysis of data for the last 3 months (May, June, and July) was also performed for the respective years to get a better picture of arthroplasty trends and reduce the flaws of data interpretation. A formal approval was taken from the NJR team in the UK before the data processing was initiated. The data source being used was available for public review on the NJR website. The team was happy for us to process and evaluate the data as per needs of our study. However, they requested a disclaimer and appreciation note for the members of the NJR team and hospital personnel across the UK that have made the provision of data and subsequent analysis leading to this study feasible. 18 EC were included. The mean number of cases recorded per center was 427, 68, 348 for 2019, 2020, and 2021 respectively.20 UCC were identified. The mean number of cases performed were 213, 24, and 195 in 2019, 2020, and 2021 respectively.Similarly, 60 DGH with emergency services were included and the average number of cases recorded were 194, 27, and 166 for 2019, 2020, and 2021 respectively. Compared to 2019 out of 148 DGH in 2019 only 60 can provide a sustainable arthroplasty service signifying a drop of 40% in 2021 in the number of DGH which are contributing to elective services. The overall productivity of theatres in terms of arthroplasty services has decreased since the reinitialization of services in 2021. There is a need of hour to divide the services into hot and cold sites in terms of A/E and elective centers to provide safe and uninterrupted provision of arthroplasty services and address long waiting times for patients. Provisional of ring-fenced beds and arthroplasty wards is more technically feasible in centers that are not providing in-house emergency admission pathways or are specialist, dedicated elective centers.","Khan, Khawar, Perkins, Pardiwala","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103655","20220428","Arthroplasty; National Health Services; National Joint Registry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30741,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare and psychosocial well-being of patients with inflammatory bowel disease","COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented disruptions to several aspects of gastroenterology healthcare services worldwide. In particular, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represent a sensitive population that must retain access to healthcare services to avoid potential disease exacerbation under the continuous threat of viral infection. Emerging evidence also highlights the severe impact on these patients' mental well-being, leading to a constant cycle of stress/depression and disease activity relapse. In an effort to circumvent these healthcare challenges in a newly-shaped environment, physicians implemented telemedicine consultative care programs as a novel alternative follow-up method highly favored by the patients. The situation is still far from perfect, since a large proportion of patients are lost to follow up and/or lose adherence to their medication, especially when the exact timeframe or optimal strategy for the post-COVID era remains to be defined. Cancelation of elective endoscopic procedures has led to a significant decline of new IBD diagnoses. This review summarizes the data on the global impact of COVID-19 on IBD patients' healthcare and their psychosocial status.","Theodorou-Kanakari, Gkolfakis, Tziatzios, Lazaridis, Triantafyllou","https://doi.org/10.20524/aog.2022.0686","20220428","COVID-19; impact; inflammatory bowel disease; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30742,""
"Perspective: Implications of the COVID-19 Pandemic for Family-Focused Practice With Parents With Mental Illness and Their Families","The goal of this perspective piece is to suggest challenges to family-focused practice with parents with mental illness and their children that have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss implications for practice, policy, and research that will benefit from rigorous study in the future, as we sift through lessons learned. The impact of the pandemic on the mental health and well-being of people around the world has been documented. Common adaptations in service delivery have included a shift to telehealth and digital tools. The pandemic has posed challenges to practice across the EASE Framework components for family-focused practice (i.e., Engage, Assess, Support, and Educate) for both parents/families and practitioners. Governmental policy and funding responses will be critical to addressing the impact of stresses, disruptions and losses endured during the past months. Pandemic experiences and consequences have implications for research measures, methods, and outcomes, given the dramatic changes in people's lives and the contexts in which they live. The shift to research implementation in virtual environments has resulted in challenges in maintaining confidentiality, and the privacy and security of data. As we move forward, it will be important to acknowledge the remaining uncertainty about the future and accommodate the profound changes in family life, professional practice, and research implementation related to the pandemic in our efforts to demonstrate the effectiveness of positive lessons learned while developing new approaches for dealing with the negative consequences of the pandemic.","Obradovic, Nicholson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.806550","20220428","COVID-19; adaptations; children of parents with mental illness; family-focused practice; pandemic; parents with mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30743,""
"Perceived Social Support Promotes Nursing Students' Psychological Wellbeing: Explained With Self-Compassion and Professional Self-Concept","The psychological distress of nursing students is ongoing and getting worse during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Numerous calls for future research on exploring the effects of perceived social support would be an effective way to improve nursing students' mental health. However, the pathway(s) between perceived social support and psychological wellbeing (PWB) remain unknown. The aim of this study was to explore how self-compassion and professional self-concept mediate the relationship between perceived social support and PWB to explain the theoretical mechanisms of the relationship. This study is the analytical cross-sectional research based on online self-reports and completed validated measures of perceived social support, PWB, self-compassion, and professional self-concept. The Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used to estimate the mediation effects on the relationship between perceived social support and PWB. To examine the directionality of effects, this study also tested the reverse serial mediation model. Multigroup SEM was used to test gender differences in the mediation model. The results of an empirical study involving 487 undergraduate nursing students verified an integrative model of social support. In addition, no gender difference was found in these associations. These findings suggest that self-compassion and professional self-concept accounted for the association between perceived social support and PWB, and self-compassion was a significant predictor of professional self-concept. There is a pathway of self-compassion and professional self-concept through which perceived social support may improve PWB. Also, improving nursing students' perceived social support, self-compassion and professional self-concept are beneficial for promoting their mental health. It is meaningful for nursing educators to take measures to develop nursing students' PWB and enhance their professional self-concept.","Zhou, Sukpasjaroen, Wu, Gao, Chankoson, Cai","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.835134","20220428","nursing students; perceived social support; professional self-concept; psychological wellbeing; self-compassion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30744,""
"Wellbeing of School Communities in the Context of COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study in Chilean Low-SES Schools","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact schools and how education is conveyed to students. One of the aspects that has gained strength is supporting the wellbeing of educational communities. The purpose of this study was to describe and understand the construction of school wellbeing during the pandemic, based on the notion of collective and sustainable wellbeing. Through a qualitative design, we conducted a study in four Chilean low-SES schools in which a national school mental health program is implemented. A total of 41 in-depth interviews and one group interview were conducted with students, parents, teacher, teacher assistants, school principals, psychosocial professionals, and the school mental health officers during the second half of the 2020 school year. Thematic content analyses showed that, while facing the school closure challenges, schools strived to protect students' and teachers' wellbeing. However, participants highlighted necessary conditions for sustaining the school community's wellbeing and mental health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: assuring digital connectivity for all students; coordinated work with families and within the school; strengthening networks; curriculum adaptation and diversified pedagogical strategies; and emotional support toward teachers, families, and students. We discuss these findings and their implications for a sustainable and collective perspective of the wellbeing of school communities in low-SES schools, as well as for policy, practice, and research from the perspective of schools for social justice and health promotion.","LÃƒÂ³pez, RamÃƒÂ­rez, LÃƒÂ³pez-Concha, Ascorra, ÃƒÂlvarez, Carrasco-Aguilar, Jervis, Squicciarini, Simonsohn, Contreras, Opazo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.853057","20220428","Chile; mental health; pandemic (COVID-19); school; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30745,""
"Analysis of Drug and Health Resource Use Before and After COVID-19 Lockdown in a Population Undergoing Treatment for Depression or Anxiety","The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic modified the functions of Primary Care (PC) teams, which were forced to focus their resources on the diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The disrupted healthcare of individuals with pre-existing mental disorders (depression or anxiety), as well as the psychological decompensation resulting from the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, may have modified the use of drugs and health resources by these patients. The aim of this study is to determine the changes in these parameters, between the 6 months prior to the lockdown (09/14/2019 to 03/15/2020) and the 6 months following its end (05/03/2020 to 11/04/2020), in a population undergoing active treatment for depression or anxiety, according to the electronic clinical record. Real world data observational study of 110,694 individuals aged &gt;16 years suffering from active or undergoing treatment for depression or anxiety according to the electronic medical records of the Aragon Regional Health Service (Spain). Pharmacological variables [daily dose per inhabitant (DHD) dispensed by pharmacies of: anxiolytics, hypnotics/sedatives, and antidepressants] and variables related to the use of healthcare resources (number of primary and specialized healthcare visits) were considered. Student's <i>T</i>-tests for paired samples were performed to analyze differences between periods (pre-post). The level of significance was established at 5% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The use of anxiolytic drugs increased as compared to its use over the 6 months prior to the lockdown. In contrast, the consumption of antidepressants was found to decrease. The use of health resources continued to be below pre-pandemic levels, 6 months post-lockdown end. Changes in the use of health resources could have a negative impact on the parameters of these diseases. The increase in drug use, especially benzodiazepines, may suggest a worsening of the symptoms during the lockdown and in the subsequent months. It is a worrying sign, which points to the growth of this public health problem and the need for its prevention.","Lear-Claveras, ClaverÃƒÂ­a, Couso-Viana, Nabbe, OlivÃƒÂ¡n-BlÃƒÂ¡zquez","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.861643","20220428","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; lifestyle; primary health care; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30746,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Self-Reported Substance Use, Well-Being, and Functioning Among United States Veterans: A Cross-Sectional Study","As the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps the globe, many veterans with substance use issues have faced the closure of treatment facilities, mandates to shelter in place, and social distancing measures. To better understand their pandemic experiences, substance use changes, and functioning, a survey was nationally administered to a sample of United States veterans reporting substance use issues during the pandemic. The purpose of this cross-sectional online survey for veterans (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°409) was to report on COVID-19 experiences, safety behaviors, and infection experiences while also investigating the relationship among addictive behaviors, mental and physical health, and COVID-19 impact. Measures also assessed specific substance use concerns, pandemic-related loneliness, and functioning. Though few veterans reported personally receiving a confirmed COVID-19 medical diagnosis (10.5%), the impact of pandemic stressors was evident, with a majority reporting anxiety related to contracting COVID-19 (61.4%) or fear of a family member or close friend contracting COVID-19 (58.7%). Participants reported increased use of alcohol (45.3%), sedatives (36.6%), inhalants (35.7%), tobacco (35.0%), and cannabis (34.9%), attributed specifically to the pandemic. Regression analyses revealed that even when controlling for the contribution of problematic substance use issues, negative pandemic impacts and self-reported COVID-19 related loneliness were related to more impaired physical and mental health functioning during the pandemic. Findings from this sample of veterans with addiction issues add to the growing literature suggesting unique and adverse effects of COVID-19 stressors on functioning while also revealing specific pandemic impacts for this group.","Reilly, Chamberlin, Duarte, Harris, Shirk, Kelly","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.812247","20220428","addiction; functioning; pandemic (COVID19); substance use disorders; veterans","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30747,""
"Anxiety, Depression, and Concern About Employment Status of Hotel Housekeepers in the Balearic Islands During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study","Tourism is a crucial economic sector in the Balearic Islands (Spain). COVID-19 pandemic might severely impact hotel housekeepers (HHs) due to their already precarious employment situation. The purpose is to assess the evolution of the concern about employment status, anxiety, and depression of HHs. This is a longitudinal study conducted with a subset of participants from a primary care, health promotion intervention study. Two additional visits were added (March-April and October-December 2020) for the purpose of this study. We recruited 290 HHs in March-April 2020; 237 were again interviewed during October-December 2020. In the first visit, high level of concern about employment was associated with age under 50, temporary contracts and external locus of control (LOC). Moderate-severe anxiety was associated with low social support and external LOC; moderate-severe depression was associated with low social support. Regarding the second visit, age, years working as HH, type of contract, social support, and LOC were not associated with concern about employment status, anxiety, and depression. There was a larger proportion of HHs with moderate-severe anxiety and depression among HHs with high degree of concern. Concern increased significantly among HHs: over 50Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age; with more than 15Ã¢â‚¬â€°years in the job, a recurring seasonal contract and normal social support. After adjusting by age, type of contract, LOC, and social support, we found a statistically significant increase (12.0%) of HHs highly concerned about their job situation: compared to the first visit, HHs were 2.3 more likely to have a high degree of concern in December 2020. In contrast, increases in moderate-severe anxiety (0.3%) and depression (4.3%) between the two periods were not significant. In HHs, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant concern about employment status and symptoms of depression and anxiety. In the uncertain times of the pandemic, mental wellbeing benefits from variables that confer stability, such as internal LOC, perception of social support, and a stable job. Longitudinal results point at long lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. It is crucial to allocate additional resources in primary care to adequately address the anticipated influx of needs.","Chela-Alvarez, Leiva, Gallardo-Alfaro, Bulilete, Vidal-Thomas, Llobera","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.842335","20220428","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; employment status; hotel housekeepers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30748,""
"Burnout and intent to leave during COVID-19: A cross-sectional study of New Jersey hospital nurses","To examine staffing, personal protective equipment (PPE) adequacy and physical exhaustion that contributed to burnout and intent to leave among hospital nurses during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Burnout is associated with adverse nurse and patient outcomes. Identifying the magnitude of burnout that occurred during the pandemic can prepare managers for the long-term mental health effects on nurses. A cross-sectional, electronic survey was administered to examine perceptions of burnout and intent to leave among all New Jersey hospital nurses from October 6 to October 26, 2020. 3,030 nurses responded with 64.3% reporting burnout and 36.5% reporting intent to leave the hospital within a year. There was a significant association between high levels of burnout and intent to leave (c<sup>2</sup> =329.4; p=0.001). There was no association between staffing and burnout, however, reporting inadequate PPE (OR =1.77 [95% CI:1.34-2.34]) and physical exhaustion (OR=3.89 [95% CI: 3.19 - 4.76]) remained predictors of burnout among nurses. Inadequate PPE and physical exhaustion coupled with short staffing contributed to burnout and intent to leave. Managers should continue to utilize evidence-based mental health interventions and advocate within their nursing professional organizations for relief funds to reduce burnout.","de Cordova, Johansen, Grafova, Crincoli, Prado, Pogorzelska-Maziarz, de Cordova","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13647","20220428","COVID-19; burnout; hospitals; intent to leave","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30749,""
"Public opinion on sharing data from health services for clinical and research purposes without explicit consent: an anonymous online survey in the UK","UK National Health Service/Health and Social Care (NHS/HSC) data are variably shared between healthcare organisations for direct care, and increasingly de-identified for research. Few large-scale studies have examined public opinion on sharing, including of mental health (MH) versus physical health (PH) data. We measured data sharing preferences. Pre-registered anonymous online survey, measuring expressed preferences, recruiting February to September 2020. Participants were randomised to one of three framing statements regarding MH versus PH data. Open to all UK residents. Participants numbered 29 275; 40% had experienced an MH condition. Most (76%) supported identifiable data sharing for direct clinical care without explicit consent, but 20% opposed this. Preference for clinical/identifiable sharing decreased with geographical distance and was slightly less for MH than PH data, with small framing effects. Preference for research/de-identified data sharing without explicit consent showed the same small PH/MH and framing effects, plus greater preference for sharing structured data than de-identified free text. There was net support for research sharing to the NHS, academic institutions, and national research charities, net ambivalence about sharing to profit-making companies researching treatments, and net opposition to sharing to other companies (similar to sharing publicly). De-identified linkage to non-health data was generally supported, except to data held by private companies. We report demographic influences on preference. A majority (89%) supported a single NHS mechanism to choose uses of their data. Support for data sharing increased during COVID-19. Support for healthcare data sharing for direct care without explicit consent is broad but not universal. There is net support for the sharing of de-identified data for research to the NHS, academia, and the charitable sector, but not the commercial sector. A single national NHS-hosted system for patients to control the use of their NHS data for clinical purposes and for research would have broad support.

"Rhabdomyolysis in Young Adult Male Stabilized on Mirtazapine and with History of COVID-19 Infection","The purpose of this case study is to review the clinical presentation and medical workup of a young adult male presenting with rhabdomyolysis in the setting of suspected contributing factors, including treatment with mirtazapine and history of COVID-19 infection. This case study involves a 19-year-old male in a residential setting with a psychiatric history of major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder who had been stabilized on mirtazapine for 9Ã‚Â months. Then, the patient exhibited fever, sore throat, cough, nausea, diarrhea, and malaise and was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection; he did not require hospitalization, was treated with supportive care, and signs and symptoms resolved uneventfully. Approximately 2Ã‚Â months later, in the winter, the patient presented for clinical assessment due to hematuria and painful urination. History revealed that he had been exercising excessively exercising over the past 24Ã‚Â hours, completing hundreds of push-ups and sit-ups. The patient presented to a nearby community hospital and was found to have creatine kinase of over 500,000. He was transferred to a large Midwestern university hospital for further evaluation and management. The patient's serum creatine kinase level was found to be 510,000 U/L. Patient's ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase were 283, 79, and 76 IU/L, respectively, while creatinine was 0.92. Patient received vigorous hydration, supportive care, and further evaluation. Treatment with mirtazapine was discontinued. The following week he developed severe nausea and vomiting; creatine kinase had decreased to 920, while hepatic function tests remained mildly elevated. Evaluation for hepatitis, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus were negative, as was Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis. Further medical workup for other potential causes of rhabdomyolysis was negative. The patient recovered and is asymptomatic with return to normal lab values. He remains in psychiatric follow-up. The patient's presentation of rhabdomyolysis may have been attributable to multiple factors. Independently, sustained excessive physical activity, COVID-19 infection, and treatment with mirtazapine have all been implicated in the development of rhabdomyolysis. Caution should be taken when prescribing mirtazapine in individuals at higher risk of developing rhabdomyolysis, including those engaged in excessive exercise or who have had COVID-19 infection.

"Depression Screening of Patients with Neurological Disorders in an Outpatient Setting","Depression is a widespread comorbidity associated with a number of neurological disorders. Untreated depression has negative impacts on patients with neurological disorders, including intensification of pain, increase in symptomatology, impaired quality of life, and nonadherence to treatment. Nonadherence can lead to disease progression, resulting in poor outcomes. Early detection of depression and prompt intervention can substantially impact the mortality, morbidity, and disease burden of this at-risk population. The American Academy of Neurology recommends screening for neurological disease-specific depression comorbidities, while the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends routine depression screening for the general adult population. However, fewer than 5% of adults are screened in primary care, and as many as 50% of patients remain undiagnosed without a standardized program. Specialty neurology clinic visits could be a point of screening for high-risk neurology patients to positively affect outcomes. A review of the literature supports using a validated tool such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to screen for depression in outpatient settings. This quality improvement project was implemented at a private neurology practice that currently has no formalized protocol to identify depressive symptomatology. The PHQ-9 was integrated into the review of systems for patients meeting inclusion criteria with the aim of screening 90% of patients and referring 90% of those who screen positive to mental health services. Descriptive data were used to evaluate current practice status and indications for change. A total of 476 patients were seen during the time frame for this quality improvement inquiry. There were 100 patients excluded related to cognitive impairment for a sample total of nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 376. Over a period of 30Ã‚Â days, the goal was to screen 90% of patients. Despite challenges related to the impact of COVID-19 on the practice's delivery of care, 83.2% of patients received screening, which was 92% of our goal.

"Trends in suicide attempts and suicide deaths before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Taipei City, Taiwan: an interrupted time-series analysis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented global health crisis that may cause mental health problems and heighten suicide risk. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trends in suicide attempts and suicide deaths in New Taipei City, Taiwan. The current study used the official daily data on suicide attempts and deaths in New Taipei City, Taiwan (4 million inhabitants) between 2015 and 2020 from the Taiwan National Suicide Prevention Reporting System. Interrupted time-series (ITS) analyses with parameters corrected by the estimated autocorrelations were applied on weekly aggregated data to examine whether the suicide trends during the early COVID-19 pandemic (late January to July 2020) deviated from previous trends (January 2015 to late January 2020). The impact due to the suicide prevention policy change was also examined (since August 2020). ITS analyses revealed no significant increases in both mean and trend on weekly suicide deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and after the policy change. In contrast, there was a significant increasing trend in weekly suicide attempts since the COVID-19 outbreak at the rate of 1.54 attempts per week (95% confidence interval 0.49-2.60; p = 0.004). Sex difference analysis revealed that, however, this increasing trend was observed only in females not in males. The COVID-19 pandemic has different impacts on suicides attempts and deaths during the early pandemic in New Taipei City, Taiwan. The COVID-19 outbreak drastically increased the trend of suicide attempts. In contrast, the number of suicide deaths had remained constant in the investigated periods.","Su, Yu, Liu, Lu, Tu, Lin, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722001155","20220428","COVID-19; Taiwan; interrupted time-series analysis; suicide attempts; suicide deaths","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30754,""
"The efficacy of Narrative Exposure Therapy for Children (KIDNET) as a treatment for traumatized young refugees versus treatment as usual: update to the study protocol for the multi-center randomized controlled trial YOURTREAT","The trial YOURTREAT aims to compare the pragmatic, short-term psychotherapy Narrative Exposure Therapy for Children (KIDNET) with treatment as usual (TAU) for the treatment of young refugees in Germany. This update outlines changes made to the study protocol in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of allowing the continuation of the clinical trial while ensuring the safety of the staff and the participants, maintaining methodological quality, and ensuring compliance with legal regulations. The major amendments to the original study protocol include (1) the possibility of using telehealth technology for the conduction of diagnostic and therapy sessions, (2) a reduction of the diagnostic set, and (3) an increased flexibility in the time frame of the study protocol. The adaptations to the study protocol made it feasible to continue with the trial YOURTREAT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the diagnostic set had to be shortened, the primary outcomes and the main secondary outcomes remain unimpaired by the amendment. Therefore, we expect the trial to provide evidence regarding effective treatment options for young refugees in Germany, a population that has received little scientific attention so far and has only very limited access to mental health care in the German health care system. In light of the current pandemic, which globally increases the risk of mental problems, the situation for young refugees is likely to aggravate further. Thus, the clinical and social relevance of the present trial YOURTREAT is even more important in these particular times.

"The prevalence and associated factors of depression, anxiety, and PTSD among Moroccan medical doctors in the COVID-19 pandemic: a national study","COVID-19 pandemic is facing healthcare professionals with unprecedented challenges, which might alter their mental health. We targeted assessing depression, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) of Moroccan medical doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic; this would allow identifying the associated factors. A cross-sectional national study was carried out on 1267 exposed and unexposed public health medical doctors to COVID-19 patients. The study was conducted between May 15 and 15 June 2020. An anonymous self-administered questionnaire was completed online voluntarily and randomly. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and the PTSD Checklist for DSMÃ¢â‚¬â€˜5 (PCL-5) to assess depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD, respectively. The respondents' rate was 63.3%. The mean age was 30.97Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 6.65Ã‚Â years old, and 59.3% (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 751) were females with a sex ratio M/F of 0.68. The sample included 43.0% (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 545) of COVID-19 frontline doctors. Among all participants, 31.5% (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 400) had depression, 29.2% (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 370) had generalized anxiety, and 21.7% (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 276) had PTSD. The average scores of the PHQ-9, the GAD-7, and the PCL-5 were 7.79 (Ã‚Â± 5.54), 6.12 (Ã‚Â±5.72), and 18.58 (Ã‚Â±17.62), respectively. The multivariate logistic regression showed that working in primary and secondary hospitals, moderate and high-stress perceptions, a chronic physical illness, and a family history of psychiatric disorder were independently associated factors of depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD. The females expressed significantly more anxiety. Doctors living in a family consisting of member with chronic disease showed a significantly higher risk of PTSD. The security sense of contamination risk and low threat perception of COVID-19 were significantly protective factors of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Moroccan medical doctors are in psychological distress. It is essential to preserve medical doctors' mental well-being health for a better fight against the COVID-19 pandemic through effective and targeted health policies.","Ouazzani Housni Touhami, Maiouak, Ouraghene, Hammani, Abdi, Benhammou, Tahiri, Rabhi, Bennani, Bout, Aarab, Boujraf, El Fakir, Aalouane","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2067574","20220428","COVID-19 pandemic; PTSD; anxiety; depression; medical doctors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30756,""
"Piloting a statewide emergency department take-home naloxone program: Improving the quality of care for patients at risk of opioid overdose","Emergency department (ED) patients with nonfatal opioid overdose are at high risk for subsequent fatal overdose, yet ED programs aimed at reducing harm from opioid use remain underdeveloped. The objective was to pilot a statewide ED take-home naloxone program and improve the care of patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) and risky drug use through training and interprofessional network building. Nine hospital EDs with pharmacy, nurse, and physician champions were recruited, surveyed, and trained. Take-home naloxone rescue kits were developed, disseminated, and tracked. Two overdose prevention summits were convened prior to the COVID pandemic, and two X-waiver training courses aimed at emergency physicians and advanced practice providers were arranged, both in person and virtual. A total of 872 naloxone rescue kits were distributed to ED patients at risk of opioid overdose during the first phase of this project, and more than 140 providers were trained in the use of medications for OUD in acute care settings. A statewide ED take-home naloxone program was shown to be feasible across a range of different hospitals with varying maturity in preexisting OUD resources and capabilities. Future work will be aimed at both expanding and measuring the effectiveness of this work.","Dora-Laskey, Kellenberg, Dahlem, English, Gonzalez Walker, Brummett, Kocher","https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.14435","20220428","Analgesics, Opioid; COVID-19; Drug Overdose; Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans; Naloxone; Narcotic Antagonists; Opiate Overdose; Opioid-Related Disorders; Quality of Health Care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30757,""
"Perceptions of Social Rigidity Predict Loneliness Across the Japanese Population","Loneliness is associated with mental and physical health problems and elevated suicide risk, and is increasingly widespread in modern societies. However, identifying the primary factors underlying loneliness remains a major public health challenge. Historically, loneliness was thought to result from a lack of high-quality social connections, but broader cultural factors (e.g. social norms) are increasingly recognized to also influence loneliness. Here, we used a large-scale survey (N=4977) to assess to what degree the loneliness epidemic in Japan is associated with traditional measures of social isolation (number of close friends), cultural factors (perceptions of social rigidity, as measured by relational mobility), and socioeconomic factors (e.g. income). We confirmed that a lack of close friends is a dominant factor underlying loneliness in Japan. We also found that perceptions of the social rigidity in oneâ€™s environment was a major influence on loneliness. Subjects who perceived lower levels of rigidity in their social environments felt significantly less lonely than those who perceived higher levels of social rigidity, though the association was weak in low income males. Thus, Japanese society and other high social rigidity cultures may need to reflect on the possibility that inflexible traditional norms of socialization are exacerbating loneliness.","Ryan Paul Badman et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0116-D39-5E0","20220429","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; human behavior; cultural psychology; covid-19; japan; culture; socioeconomic status; income; social rigidity; loneliness; relational mobility","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-29","",30758,""
