"Tobacco Use Cessation in Three Patients Suffering from Psychotic Disorders: The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Tobacco use is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality amoung patients suffering from psychotic disorders. The association between severe COVID-19 and tobacco use is still debated. The aim of this paper is to enhance the importance of providing up to date informations about nicotine and tobacco use in connection with the SARS-CoV-2-related conditions. We present 3 cases of sudden tobacco use cessation in 3 long-term heavy smokers receiving mental health care for chronic psychotic disorders. Fear of severe form of COVID-19 was their principal motivation. Nicotine replacement therapy and quitline counseling were provided and no major withdrawal symptoms were declared. As mass media later wrongly presented tobacco use as a protective factor regarding COVID-19, all three patients resumed smoking. Rigorous counseling took advantage of psychotic symptoms to correct false informations and finally promote tobacco use cessation. The COVID-19 pandemic might paradoxically represent a great motivational factor to quit smoking, espacially when considering patients suffering from severe mental health disorders. Beyond the terrible suffering it causes, we illustrate with a case serie that this opportunity must be exploited by mental health professionals to improve quality and life expectancy of their patients.","Theuerkauff, Hanak","https://www.google.com/search?q=Tobacco+Use+Cessation+in+Three+Patients+Suffering+from+Psychotic+Disorders:+The+Impact+of+the+COVID-19+Pandemic.","20200905","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-06","",4427,""
"The Role of Fatigue of Compassion, Burnout and Hopelessness in Healthcare: Experience in the Time of COVID-19 Outbreak","In the times of serious health alarm, as it is happening in the COVID-19 pandemic, burden of healthcare is likely to explode. The current pandemic is having a profound effect on all aspects of society, including mental health and physical health. In a previous study we showed interaction between compassion fatigue, burnout and workload. In our study, we have evaluated stress levels in 102 healthcare workers recruited in different rehabilitation departments (psychiatric and multidisciplinary). In particular, we evaluated the fatigue of compassion, vicarious trauma, burnout and hope (hopelessness) in the first two months of lookdown due to the COVID-19. The results obtained after the administration of the following evaluation scales: sCFs, CBI, Pro QOL, HBS, showed an overall increase in the scores in all professional figures. Significant compassion fatigue and burnout percentage is present in several groups. The highest levels of hopelessness in some professional figures, while higher educational levels can protect workers from the risk of developing high levels of work stress. The data obtained with this study are similar to those of our previous study, although they may indicate that during the period of the coronavirus pandemic the scores of the several scales used are higher.","Franza, Basta, Pellegrino, Solomita, Fasano","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Role+of+Fatigue+of+Compassion,+Burnout+and+Hopelessness+in+Healthcare:+Experience+in+the+Time+of+COVID-19+Outbreak.","20200905","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-06","",4428,""
"Using Rapid Design Thinking to Overcome COVID-19 Challenges in Medical Education","The rapid rise of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to the implementation of public health measures on an unprecedented scale. These measures have significantly affected the training environment and the mental health of health care providers and learners. Design thinking offers creative and innovative solutions to emergent complex problems, including those related to training and patient care that have arisen as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design thinking can accelerate the development and implementation of solution prototypes through a process of inspiration, ideation, and implementation. Digital technology can be leveraged as part of this process to provide care and education in new or enhanced ways. Online knowledge hubs, videoconference-based interactive sessions, virtual simulations, and technology-enhanced coaching for health care providers are potential solutions to address identified issues. Limitations of this model include inherent bias towards utilitarian instead of egalitarian principles and the subsequent threat to diversity, equity, and inclusion in solutions. Although medical educators have embraced digital transformation during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need to ensure that these changes are sustained.","Thakur, Soklaridis, Crawford, Mulsant, Sockalingam","https://doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000003718","20200905","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-06","",4429,""
"The Attitude towards Preventive Measures and Knowledge of COVID-19 Inpatients with Severe Mental Illness in Economically Underdeveloped Areas of China","Patients with severe mental illnesses (SMI) were at high risk of infection during Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study examined hospitalized SMI patients' attitude and knowledge towards the COVID-19 infection. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in five psychiatric hospitals located in Gansu province, the most economically underdeveloped area in China. Patients' attitude towards preventive measures and knowledge of COVID-19 were measured by a self-report questionnaire. A total of 925 hospitalized patients with SMI were recruited. Of them, 84.8% (95%CI: 82.4%-87.1%) had positive attitudes towards preventive measures of the COVID-19 outbreak. Being married (OR: 1.55, 95%CI: 1.05-2.30) and a higher educational level (OR: 1.63, 95%CI: 1.12-2.38) were independently associated with positive attitudes towards COVID-19 preventive measures, whereas higher educational level was associated with better knowledge of the COVID-19 outbreak (ÃŽÂ²: 0.231, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Patients mainly received COVID-19 relevant knowledge from public media (58.9%), followed by their clinicians (33.2%). Most hospitalized SMI patients in economically underdeveloped areas in China showed positive attitudes towards COVID-19 preventive measures. However, public health education on COVID-19 relevant knowledge by mental health professionals was inadequate to reduce the risk of transmission and infection.","Zhu, Li, Huo, Jin, Zhang, Yun, Gao, Cheung, Hall, Yang, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09835-1","20200905","Attitude; COVID-19; Economically underdeveloped; Severe mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-06","",4430,""
"The psychosocial risk of being 'extremely vulnerable' during Covid-19 and the role of behaviour activation","Many individuals shielding from Covid-19 because of extreme clinical vulnerability are reporting worsening mental health (ONS, 2020) and may need assistance to change their shielding behaviour to regain their social connections. Isolation is strongly linked to depression and anxiety, which provoke further social withdrawal (Santini et al, 2020), creating a downward spiral of low mood, lack of motivation, anxiety, and further isolation through avoidance behaviour.","Webb","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12684","20200905","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-06","",4431,""

"The psychosocial impact of flu influenza pandemics on healthcare workers and lessons learnt for the COVID-19 emergency: a rapid review","During a pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) are essential to the health system response. Based on our knowledge, little information is available regarding the psychosocial impact on HCWs or interventions for supporting them during pandemics. Therefore, the study aimed to assess available literature on perceived stress and psychological responses to influenza pandemics in HCWs and identify implications for healthcare practice and future research. This is a rapid review of the literature. The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Across all the studies-both qualitative and quantitative-HCWs working during the epidemic reported frequent concerns regarding their own health and the fear of infecting their families, friends and colleagues. Moreover, social isolation, uncertainty, fears of stigmatization and reluctance to work or considering absenteeism were frequently reported. Moreover, many studies highlighted a high prevalence of high levels of stress, anxiety and depression symptoms, which could have long-term psychological implications in HCWs. This rapid review offers an overview of the major concerns regarding HCWs' psychosocial well-being and possible preventive strategies, which could be useful for the current COVID-19 outbreak and similar future pandemics. Studies suggested to invest on preventive psychological, social, family and physical support and to guaranteeing reasonable work conditions and others in order to protect HCWs from the long-lasting psychological effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Barello, FalcÃƒÂ³-Pegueroles, Rosa, Tolotti, Graffigna, Bonetti","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00038-020-01463-7","20200905","COVID-19; Health personnel; Nurse; Pandemics; Physician; Psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-06","",4433,""
"The effect of coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV) during pregnancy and the possibility of vertical maternal-fetal transmission: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Coronavirus is challenging the global health care system from time to time. The pregnant state, with alterations in hormone levels and decreased lung volumes due to a gravid uterus and slightly immunocompromised state may predispose patients to a more rapidly deteriorating clinical course and can get a greater risk of harm for both the mother and fetus. Therefore, this systematic review was aimed to assess the effect of coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV) during pregnancy and its possibility of vertical maternal-fetal transmission. A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library until the end of April. AllÃ‚Â authors independently extracted all necessary data using excel spreadsheet form. Only published articles with fully accessible data on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV, MARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 were included. Data on clinical manifestations, maternal and perinatal outcomes were extracted and analyzed. Out of 879 articles reviewed, 39 studies involving 1316 pregnant women were included. The most common clinical features were fever, cough, and myalgia with prevalence ranging from 30 to 97%, while lymphocytopenia and C-reactive protein were the most common abnormal laboratory findings (55-100%). Pneumonia was the most diagnosed clinical symptom of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infection with prevalence ranged from 71 to 89%. Bilateral pneumonia (57.9%) and ground-glass opacity (65.8%) were the most common CT imaging reported. The most common treatment options used were hydroxychloroquine (79.7%), ribavirin (65.2%), and oxygen therapy (78.8%). Regarding maternal outcome, the rate of preterm birth &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°37Ã‚Â weeks of gestation was 14.3%, preeclampsia (5.9%), miscarriage (14.5%, preterm premature rupture of membranes (9.2%) and fetal growth restriction (2.8%). From the total coronavirus infected pregnant women, 56.9% delivered by cesarean, 31.3% admitted to ICU, while 2.7% were died. Among the perinatal outcomes, fetal distress rated (26.5%), neonatal asphyxia rated (1.4%). Only, 1.2% of neonates had apgar scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°7 at 5Ã‚Â min. Neonate admitted to ICU was rated 11.3%, while the rate of perinatal death was 2.2%. In the current review, none of the studies reported transmission of CoV from the mother to the fetus in utero during the study period. Coronavirus infection is more likely to affect pregnant women. Respiratory infectious diseases have demonstrated an increased risk of adverse maternal obstetrical complications than the general population due to physiological changes occurred during pregnancy. None of the studies reported transmission of CoV from the mother to the fetus in utero, which may be due to a very low expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 in early maternal-fetal interface cells.","Diriba, Awulachew, Getu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40001-020-00439-w","20200905","Coronavirus; Infection; Middle East respiratory syndrome; Novel coronavirus-2019; Pregnancy; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2; Vertical transmission","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-06","",4434,""
"Anxiety and depression symptoms in the same pregnant women before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives With clinical experience from previous coronavirus infections, public health measures and fear of infection may have negative psychological effects on pregnant women. This study aimed to compare the level of anxiety and depression in the same pregnant women before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The pregnant women continuing pregnancy who participated in the first study which was undertaken to clarify the factors associated with mental health of pregnant women before the COVID-19 pandemic, were included for the current study during the outbreak. Anxiety and depression symptoms of the same pregnant women were evaluated by using the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms II and Beck Anxiety Inventory twice before and during the pandemic. Results A total of 63 pregnant women completed questionnaires. The mean age of the women and the mean gestational age was 30.35Ã‚Â±5.27 years and 32.5Ã‚Â±7Ã‚Â weeks, respectively. The mean total IDAS II score was found to increase from 184.78Ã‚Â±49.67 (min: 109, max: 308) to 202.57Ã‚Â±52.90 (min: 104, max: 329) before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. According to the BAI scores the number of patients without anxiety (from 10 to 6) and with mild anxiety (from 31 to 24) decreased and patients with moderate (from 20 to 25) and severe anxiety (from 2 to 8) increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that obesity and relationship with her husband are the best predictors of IDAS II scores. Conclusions This study indicated that COVID-19 outbreak affects the mental health of pregnant women negatively which leads to adverse birth outcomes. The level of anxiety and depression symptoms of pregnant women during the COVID-19 infection significantly increased. Healthcare professionals should establish comprehensive treatment plans for pregnant women who are highly vulnerable population to prevent mental trauma during the infectious disease outbreaks.","Ayaz, HocaoÃ„Å¸lu, GÃƒÂ¼nay, YardÃ„Â±mcÃ„Â±, Turgut, Karateke","https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0380","20200905","COVID-19; IDAS II; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-06","",4435,""

"Health behaviors and mental health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal population-based survey","Background: Health behaviors such as physical activity and a balanced diet are essential to promote and maintain health. Especially during a crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, they have the potential to buffer against stress and protect mental health. Method: In a longitudinal study with four measurement points over 3 months during the COVID-19 pandemic, about 3,500 randomly selected participants representative of the German population reported their mental health (i.e., anxiety, depression, loneliness), screen time, snack consumption, and physical activity. Results: Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and loneliness were highest during the first month of the pandemic-related lockdown, particularly in women and people in poor health, and decreased over time. Screen time and snacking increased and physical activity decreased compared to pre-lockdown. Snacking and physical activity went back to pre-lockdown levels within 2 months; screen time increased further over time. Snack increase and physical activity decrease was stronger in women than men throughout the lockdown. Generally, more screen time, more snacking, and less physical activity were related to higher symptoms of anxiety, depression, and loneliness across all time points. Changes in health behaviors over time did not predict changes in mental health symptoms. Conclusions: Mental health and health behaviors worsened as an immediate response to stress but mostly returned to pre-crisis levels within 2 to 3 months. Engaging in healthier behaviors is associated with better mental health. This study provides important descriptions of (unintended) side effects of a national crisis and contributes to our understanding of how to preserve mental health.","Jutta Mata et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46029-F3A-32A","20200906","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; covid-19; lockdown; snacking; screen time; physical activity; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-06","",4437,""
