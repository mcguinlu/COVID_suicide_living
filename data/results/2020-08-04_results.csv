"Psychological Distress in Outpatients With Lymphoma During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Cancer patients are a population at high risk of contracting COVID-19 and, also of developing severe complications due to the infection, which is especially true when they are undergoing immunosuppressive treatment  Despite this, they had still to go to hospital to receive chemotherapy during lockdown  In this context, we have evaluated the psychological status of onco-hematological outpatients receiving infusion and not deferrable anti-neoplastic treatment for lymphoproliferative neoplasms, with the aim of both measuring the levels of post-traumatic symptoms, depression, and anxiety during the pandemic and also of investigating the perception of risk of potential nosocomial infection  The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were administered to all patients  Moreover, patients were investigated about their worries regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their lives as onco-hematologic patients  Since the 2nd to the 29th April 2020 (during the first phase of the lockdown period in Italy), 77 outpatients were prospectively evaluated  They were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/Small lymphocytic lymphoma  The mean age was 56 6 (range 22â€“85)  We found that 36% of patients had anxiety (HADS-A), 31% depression (HADS-D), and 43% were above the cut-off for the HADS-General Scale;36% fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)  Women and younger patients were found to be more vulnerable to anxiety and PTSD  The study firstly analyzes the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the frail population of patients affected by lymphoproliferative neoplasms, to underly the importance of screening patients for emotional and distress conditions and then offering them psychological support","Romito, F.; Dellino, M.; Loseto, G.; Opinto, G.; Silvestris, E.; Cormio, C.; Guarini, A.; Minoia, C.","https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.01270","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Frontiers in Oncology;10, 2020.; Publication details: Frontiers in Oncology;10, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-04","",3635,""
"Seven Shades of Black Thoughts: COVID-19 and Its Psychological Consequences on Cancer Patients","An outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that started in China at the end of 2019 has rapidly spread all over the world  COVID-19 is plaguing people not only physically but also psychologically, and cancer patients are particularly exposed to this emotional threat  Herein, we describe the psychological threats posed by COVID-19 to cancer patients  Our analysis is based on the concerns of our patients during our daily clinical interactions in both outpatient and inpatient settings  We have summarized the patients' psychological issues: logistic overload, loneliness, fear, oxymoronic thoughts, helplessness, frustration, and emotional siege  We describe these psychological threats, provide clinical context for them, and offer practical suggestions for managing them, for the benefit of patients, their caregivers, and clinicians  Our hope is that, by sharing our clinical experience, we can help other oncologists increase their awareness of the psychological impact of the pandemic on cancer patients and implement solutions  Managing these challenges now should translate into improved standards of care when this infective storm is over  Paradoxically, COVID-19 could be an opportunity to learn how to better manage cancer care","Garutti, M.; Cortiula, F.; Puglisi, F.","https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.01357","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Frontiers in Oncology;10, 2020.; Publication details: Frontiers in Oncology;10, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-04","",3636,""
"Psychological Status of Healthcare Workers during the Covid-19 Pandemic","OBJECTIVE: To assess the levels of health anxiety and Beck depression according to demographic variables among a sample of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, analytical study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Firat University and Medical Park Hosspital, Elazig, Turkey, from MarchÂ  to April 2020. METHODOLOGY: A total of 270 healthcare workers (100 males and 170 females) filled out health anxiety inventory (HAI), Beck depression inventory (BDI), questionnaires. Evaluations of HAI and BDI were conducted according to demographic variables ( age, gender, marital status, jop, life style, smoking habits, sistemic disease). RESULTS: Female healthcare workers had higher HAI and BDI scores than male (p <0.001, p <0.001). Young healthcare workers had higher HAI scores than aged healthcare workers (p=0.021) Healthcare workers with more knowledge about COVID-19 had lower HAI and BDI in (p=0.021, p=0.019). There is statistical significant differences in HAI and BDI scores in marital status (p = 0.022, p=0.002). The HAI and BDI scores of participants, who had close contact, were significantly higher than those who had no contact (p = 0.009 p=0.028). There were significant correlations between the two scales (p <0.05). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, psychological support should be provided to all healthcare workers and working conditions should be corrected to relieve the anxiety and worry.

"Love in the time of Corona","OBJECTIVE: As the world struggles to come to terms with ""corona,"" we find our collective experience to be entirely alien, struggling to find meaning in the forms of feeling being evoked. When words cannot provide meaning to experience, metaphor is often utilized. CONCLUSIONS: Words like ""love"" are informed autobiographically as ""growing words,"" with no rules defining their use. The significance of ""love"" to an individual is created through personal history, such that sophisticated understanding is only constructed following a lifetime of experience. ""Corona"" is perhaps a growing word; we cannot yet grasp its meaning in the face of cÃ³lera (passion) and pati (suffering) informing our collective traumatic script. Psychiatrists should aim to focus on the positive forms of feeling emerging during the pandemic, in order to be better equipped to meet the impending ""second wave"" of mental health complications.","Alchin, David; McLean, Loyola; Korner, Anthony","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1039856220936142","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Australas Psychiatry;: 1039856220936142, 2020 Jul 28.; Publication details: Australas Psychiatry;: 1039856220936142, 2020 Jul 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-04","",3638,""
"Age Differences in Risk and Resilience Factors in COVID-19-Related Stress","Older adults are at higher risk for death and infirmity from COVID-19 than younger and middle-age adults. The current study examines COVID-19-specific anxiety and proactive coping as potential risk and resilience factors that may be differentially important for younger and older adults in understanding stress experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Five hundred and fifteen adults aged 20-79 in the U.S. reported on their anxiety about developing COVID-19, proactive coping, and stress related to COVID-19 in an online survey. Although there were no age differences in stress levels, anxiety about developing COVID-19 was associated with more COVID-19 stress for older adults relative to younger adults, but proactive coping was associated with less COVID-19 stress for older adults relative to younger adults. Our results suggest that anxiety might function as a risk factor whereas proactive coping may function as a resilience factor for older adults' COVID-19 stress. We encourage future context-dependent investigations into mental health among older adults during this pandemic and beyond.","Pearman, Hughes, Smith, Neupert","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa120","20200803","age differences; anxiety; coping; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-04","",3639,""
"&quot;Pandemonium of the pandemic&quot;: Impact of COVID-19 in India, focus on mental health","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global health threat, with every nation facing unique challenges during the outbreak. Such pandemics are much beyond biological phenomena. They have psychosocial and economic implications that might long outlast the infection itself. India recently crossed 50,000 cases and is undergoing a historic nationwide lockdown in an attempt to control the outbreak. Considering the sociocultural diversity, limited public health resources, increasing psychological comorbidities, and substantial number of vulnerable populations (e.g., homeless, migrants), the subcontinent is facing unprecedented challenges at all fronts. This commentary glances at the COVID-19 scenario in India through the psychosocial lens, highlights the strategies so far, and discusses the recommended ways ahead.

"Coping and tolerance of uncertainty: Predictors and mediators of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","The current pandemic wave of COVID-19 has resulted in significant uncertainty for the general public. Mental health and examining factors that may influence distress have been outlined as key research priorities to inform interventions. This research sought to examine whether intolerance of uncertainty and coping responses influence the degree of distress experienced by the U.K. general public during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a cross-sectional online questionnaire design, participants were recruited (<i>N</i> = 842) using snowball sampling over a 10-day period in the early &quot;lockdown&quot; phase of the pandemic. Around a quarter of participants demonstrated significantly elevated anxiety and depression, with 14.8% reaching clinical cutoff for health anxiety. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance indicated those in &quot;vulnerable&quot; groups were significantly more anxious (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), and also more anxious in relation to their health (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). Mediation modeling demonstrated maladaptive coping responses partially mediated the predictive relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and psychological distress. Mental health difficulties have become significantly raised during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, particularly for the vulnerable. Findings support emerging research suggesting the general public is struggling with uncertainty, more so than normal. Vulnerable groups are more anxious about their health, but not more intolerant of uncertainty than the nonvulnerable. Finally, this study indicated two modifiable factors that could act as treatment targets when adapting interventions for mental health during the COVID-19 global health crisis.

"The impact of COVID-19 on doctors' well-being: results of a web survey during the lockdown in Italy","On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of a new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), to be a pandemic. From the beginning, Italy (in particular the Northern regions) was the first large European country to be hit and one of the most affected countries worldwide. This had a significant impact on the workload and psychological health of health workers. The aim of this web-based cross-sectional study is to assess the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian doctors' well-being and psychological distress, in respect of demographic and occupational characteristics, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown period. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey based on GoogleÃ‚Â® Forms to collect data. The participation was available during the lockdown period that started in Italy on March 9, 2020 and it was voluntary and anonymous. The questionnaire explored demographic and occupational variables, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown, perceived well-being and psychological distress. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted. Our study reported the very alarming psychological conditions of Italian doctors, especially among those who worked in the most affected regions, where a level of psychological distress of 93.8% and poor well-being of 58.9% were registered. These percentages were even higher in the case of female hospital workers with low job seniority, and those caring for COVID-19 patients. Our findings reported a significant psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Italian doctors, particularly among those working in the most affected regions of the country. Further studies are necessary to better understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on doctors' well-being and mental health over time, in order to implement effective prevention measures.","De Sio, Buomprisco, La Torre, Lapteva, Perri, Greco, Mucci, Cedrone","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202007_22292","20200803","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-04","",3642,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the adult population in Bangladesh: a nationwide cross-sectional study","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has imposed threats on both physical and mental health since its outbreak. This study aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among a representative sample of home-quarantined Bangladeshi adults. A cross-sectional design was used with an online survey completed by a convenience sample recruited via social media. A total of 1,427 respondents were recruited, and their mental health was assessed by the DASS-21 measure. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms was 33.7% and 57.9%, respectively, and 59.7% reported mild to extremely severe levels of stress. Perceptions that the pandemic disrupted life events, affected mental health, jobs, the economy and education, predictions of a worsening situation, and uncertainty of the health care system capacities were significantly associated with poor mental health outcomes. Multivariate logistic regressions showed that sociodemographic factors and perceptions of COVID-19 significantly predict mental health outcomes. These findings warrant the consideration of easily accessible low-intensity mental health interventions during and beyond this pandemic.","Banna, Sayeed, Kundu, Christopher, Hasan, Begum, Kormoker, Dola, Hassan, Chowdhury, Khan","https://doi.org/10.1080/09603123.2020.1802409","20200803","Bangladesh; COVID-19; DASS-21; Home-quarantine; mental health; perceptions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-04","",3643,""

"Lifestyle and Mental Health Disruptions During COVID-19","COVID-19 has affected daily life in unprecedented ways. Using a longitudinal dataset linking biometric and survey data from several cohorts of young adults before and during the pandemic (N=685), we document large disruptions to physical activity, sleep, time use, and mental health. At the onset of the pandemic, average steps decline from 9,400 to 4,600 steps per day, sleep increases by about 25-30 minutes per night, time spent socializing declines by over half to less than 30 minutes, and screen time more than doubles to over 5 hours per day. The proportion of participants at risk of clinical depression increases to 65%, over twice the rate in the same population prior to the pandemic. Our analyses suggest that disruption to physical activity is a leading risk factor for depression during the pandemic. However, restoration of those habits--either naturally or through policy intervention--has limited impact on restoring mental well-being.","Giovanni Giuntella et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46013-408-4CF","20200804","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; covid-19; higher education; depression; sleep; physical activity; health; mental health","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-04","",3645,""
"Maintaining contact with blue-green spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic associated with positive mental health","There is growing evidence that exposure to the natural world (blue-green spaces) has potential benefits for mental health and well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to control it provide a natural experiment to investigate the links between nature exposure and mental health under extreme conditions. Using a survey distributed online and based on 6,080 responses, we tested three hypotheses: (1) people will show different levels of symptoms of depression and anxiety depending on the level of lockdown (severity) and ability to maintain contact with outdoor spaces; and (2) where access to outdoor public spaces was restricted, those with access to private outdoor spaces (2a) or even a green-blue nature view (2b) will show fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety and a more positive mood. Lockdown severity significantly affected mental health, while contact with nature helped people to cope with these impacts. The buffering effect of nature was especially relevant for those under strict lockdowns. People perceived that nature helped them to cope with lockdown measures; and emotions were more positive among individuals with accessible outdoor spaces and blue-green elements in their views. These findings can help decision-makers in developing potential future lockdown measures to mitigate the negative impacts, helping people to be more resilient and maintain better mental health.","Sarai Pouso et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46095-496-4DD","20200804","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies; natureâ€™s contributions to people; depression; ecosystem services; anxiety; green-blue infrastructure","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-04","",3646,""
