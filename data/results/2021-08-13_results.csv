"Self-cosmetic care during the COVID-19 pandemic and its psychological impacts: Facts behind the closed doors","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in significant negative psychological impacts in our life. Not doing adequate cosmetic care of skin, hair, and nails might be one of the underexplored but preventable reasons for the same. To identify the change in cosmetic care habits of female undergraduate medical students during the coronavirus disease pandemic and to identify its psychological impacts on them. A total of 218 individuals participated in this online study. Data were collected using a preset pro forma as a Google questionnaire to fulfill the objectives. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 11.5 and presented as percentage, mean, SD, median, IQR in tables and graphs. Mean age of the participants was 21.56Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 1.95Ã‚Â years. Maximum respondents (66.0%) are not taking cosmetic care of skin, hair, and nail during the pandemic as before. More than two-thirds (68.8%) are feeling bad, 31.2% are neutral, whereas none are feeling good because of this change. Second-year students and the participants from rural locations are taking least cosmetic care (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). However, coronavirus disease infection and major life events in the family did not affect it. Nail care was prioritized by the maximum (64.2%). Of all participants who are not doing cosmetic care as before, a maximum (50.0%) had lost self-satisfaction followed by increased irritability (43.8%). A huge number of female medical students are not doing cosmetic care of their skin, hair, and nail during the coronavirus disease lockdown; they also perceive significant negative psychological impact because of this change.","Marahatta, Singh, Pyakurel","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.14380","20210812","COVID-19; attractiveness; cosmetics; mental health; skincare; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-13","",17047,""
"Children's Expressions of Worry During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Sweden","Sweden is an international exception in its public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a higher number of deaths, albeit not pediatric, compared with other Nordic countries. The objective of this study was to investigate what worries children and adolescents living in Sweden expressed in relation to the pandemic. Using an anonymous web-survey, 1,047 children (4-12Ã¢â‚¬â€°years; NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°717) and adolescents (13-18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years; NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°330) responded to five background and four open-ended questions, one of which was: Is there anything that you are worried about when it comes to 'Corona'? The responses were coded using manifest content analysis. Interrater reliability was .95, assessed on the code level. Worry was common (77%); mostly (60%) related to disease or death of elderly relatives, parents, the child him/herself or general worry for the elderly/risk groups. Existential worry (15%) comprised worries about the future, including economy and worries about the world perishing or the contagion becoming uncontrollable. A developmental trajectory was evident in the nature of responses. Adolescents' worries about the future included missing out on their youth and employment. They also worried about society (6%), for example, the future of democracy and the world economy. There was no indication of socioeconomic status or geographic area (urban vs. rural) affecting the presence of worrisome thoughts. Worry about ""Corona"" was common. Universal preventative mental health intervention is warranted and could be conducted in the school setting. Intervention could be tailored by age, covering discussion on financial aspects with adolescents.","Sarkadi, Sahlin Torp, PÃƒÂ©rez-Aronsson, Warner","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab060","20210812","COVID-19; adolescents; qualitative methods; school-age children","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-13","",17048,""
"Changes in the top 25 reasons for primary care visits during the COVID-19 pandemic in a high-COVID region of Canada","We aimed to determine the degree to which reasons for primary care visits changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used data from the University of Toronto Practice Based Research Network (UTOPIAN) to compare the most common reasons for primary care visits before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the number of visits and the number of patients seen for each of the 25 most common diagnostic codes. The proportion of visits involving virtual care was assessed as a secondary outcome. UTOPIAN family physicians (N = 379) conducted 702,093 visits, involving 264,942 patients between March 14 and December 31, 2019 (pre-pandemic period), and 667,612 visits, involving 218,335 patients between March 14 and December 31, 2020 (pandemic period). Anxiety was the most common reason for visit, accounting for 9.2% of the total visit volume during the pandemic compared to 6.5% the year before. Diabetes and hypertension remained among the top 5 reasons for visit during the pandemic, but there were 23.7% and 26.2% fewer visits and 19.5% and 28.8% fewer individual patients accessing care for diabetes and hypertension, respectively. Preventive care visits were substantially reduced, with 89.0% fewer periodic health exams and 16.2% fewer well-baby visits. During the pandemic, virtual care became the dominant care format (77.5% virtual visits). Visits for anxiety and depression were the most common reasons for a virtual visit (90.6% virtual visits). The decrease in primary care visit volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic varied based on the reason for the visit, with increases in visits for anxiety and decreases for preventive care and visits for chronic diseases. Implications of increased demands for mental health services and gaps in preventive care and chronic disease management may require focused efforts in primary care.","Stephenson, Butt, Gronsbell, Ji, O'Neill, Crampton, Tu","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255992","20210812","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-13","",17049,""
"Psychosocial distress amongst Canadian intensive care unit healthcare workers during the acceleration phase of the COVID-19 pandemic","Intensive care unit healthcare workers (ICU HCW) are at risk of mental health issues during emerging disease outbreaks. A study of ICU HCW from France revealed symptoms of anxiety and depression in 50.4% and 30.4% of workers at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. The level of COVID-19 exposure of these ICU HCW was very high. In Canada, ICU HCW experienced variable exposure to COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic, with some hospitals seeing large numbers of patients while others saw few or none. In this study we examined the relationship between COVID-19 exposure and mental health in Canadian ICU HCW. We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study of Canadian ICU HCW in April 2020, during the acceleration phase of the first wave of the pandemic. Psychosocial distress was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Participants were asked about sources of stress as well as about exposure to COVID-19 patients and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). Factors associated with clinically-relevant psychosocial distress were identified. Responses were received from 310 Canadian ICU HCW affiliated with more than 30 institutions. Of these, 64.5% scored Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3 points on the GHQ-12 questionnaire, indicating clinically-relevant psychosocial distress. The frequency of psychosocial distress was highest amongst registered nurses (75.7%) and lowest amongst physicians (49.4%). It was also higher amongst females (64.9%) than males (47.6%). Although PPE availability was good (&gt; 80% of participants reported adequate availability), there was significant anxiety with respect to PPE availability, with respect to the risk of being infected with COVID-19, and with respect to the risk of transmitting COVID-19 to others. In multivariable regression analysis, Anxiety with respect to being infected with COVID-19 (OR 1.53, CI 1.31-1.81) was the strongest positive predictor of clinically-relevant psychosocial distress while the Number of shifts with COVID-19 exposure (OR 0.86, CI 0.75-0.95) was the strongest negative predictor. In summary, clinically-relevant psychosocial distress was identified amongst a majority of ICU HCW during the acceleration phase of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those with minimal or no exposure to COVID-19. Strategies to support mental health amongst ICU HCW are required across the entire healthcare system.","Binnie, Moura, Moura, D'Aragon, Tsang","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254708","20210812","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-13","",17050,""
"Determinants of psychological well-being during the Covid-19 pandemic among ""people living with HIV/AIDS"" in India","<b>ABSTRACT</b>Using survey data on 647 ""people living with HIV/AIDS"" (PLHIV) respondents from India, we examine the association between human, economic, and social capital and psychological well-being during the Covid-19 pandemic, and whether pandemic-induced job and financial insecurity are significant stressors. We find that among human capital indicators, family health status results in a more positive mental state and fewer personal conflicts among PLHIV while having more working-age adults in the household results in more conflict. With regards to economic capital, PLHIV in salaried jobs and self-employment have a less positive mental state compared to those in daily wage work. Compared to daily wage workers, those in salaried jobs and self-employment exhibit lower addictive behavior. Self-employed PLHIV respondents also engage in fewer conflicts with their significant other. We do not find any correlation between social capital and psychological well-being. Job and financial insecurity are negatively associated with psychological well-being. While job insecurity is associated with an increase in addictive behavior, financial insecurity increases the likelihood of more frequent personal conflicts. We conclude that there is a need for greater economic and psychological support from institutions, community, and family to assuage the pandemic-induced psychological distress among PLHIV.<b>ABBREVIATIONS:</b> ART: antiretroviral treatment; GSNP+: Gujarat State Network of Positive People; MHI: mental health inventory; OBC: other backward castes; PLHIV: people living with HIV/AIDS; SC: scheduled castes; SD: standard deviation; ST: scheduled tribes.","Chindarkar, Kulkarni, Chandwani","https://doi.org/10.1080/09540121.2021.1966696","20210812","Covid-19; Human capital; economic capital; economic insecurity; psychological well-being; social capital","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-13","",17051,""
"Characteristics of peer respites in the United States: Expanding the continuum of care for psychiatric crisis","Peer respites are recovery-oriented services where people who identify as having lived experience of extreme mental health states (peers) support individuals experiencing, or at risk of, crises in a homelike environment. This brief report describes data from the Peer Respite Essential Features survey, conducted biannually from 2014 to 2020, which explores the peer respite model and program challenges. Peer respites nationwide were invited to participate if they met specific guidelines, resulting in 32 programs across 14 states in 2020. Results focus on the data collected in 2020 and compare past reports where applicable. Characteristics including funding, guest accommodations and policies, and how the programs were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed. More research is needed to understand the relationship between program characteristics and effectiveness of peer respites compared to other crisis diversion services and how to better support these growing programs.

"Self-isolation during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and adolescents' health outcomes: The moderating effect of perceived teacher support","With the nationwide closures of educational institutions in the United States due to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many schools transitioned from face-to-face instruction to eLearning formats at the beginning of the pandemic, while many students and their families self-isolated at home. The literature has revealed that self-isolation has a negative effect on adolescents' psychological outcomes, and high social support buffers against these outcomes. The purpose of the present research was to examine the moderating effect of perceived teacher support in the relationships between self-isolation during the beginning of the pandemic and negative health outcomes. Teacher support, self-isolation during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and health outcomes (i.e., suicidal ideation, nonsuicidal self-harm, subjective health complaints, depression) were measured in mid-April 2020 and health outcomes were measured again in late-May 2020. Participants were 467 7th and 8th graders (51% female; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 13.47; ages range from 12 to 15 years old) from the suburbs of a large Midwestern city in the United States. The findings revealed that greater perceived teacher support buffered against the negative outcomes associated with self-isolation during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower perceived teacher support strengthened these relationships. The results might inform policy development regarding strategies to improve health outcomes for adolescents during the COVID-19 crisis and future pandemics.

"Outcomes of COVID-19 on Latinx youth: Considering the role of adverse childhood events and resilience","Early research on the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated differential impact on the Latinx community. There has been limited research exploring the mental health outcomes of the pandemic on Latinx youth. This study explores the severity of pandemic-related stress on Latinx youth considering their resilience factors and previous adverse childhood events (ACEs). Adolescents (<i>n</i> = 142) ages 13-18 completed measures related to exposure to the pandemic, pandemic stress, number of ACEs, resilience factors, and general demographic information. Results of multiple regression analysis found that exposure to the pandemic, ACEs, gender, and resilience factors predicted the levels of stress that youth experienced. No differences in pandemic-related stress were found between Latinx youth and their non-Latinx counterparts.

"The practices of psychologists working in schools during COVID-19: A multi-country investigation","This exploratory study aimed to identify the ways psychologists working in schools supported students' mental health during school closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was developed to determine (a) how psychologists working in schools across the United States, Canada, Germany, and Australia supported students' mental health during COVID-19, (b) how their services changed during COVID-19, and (c) potential differences between countries concerning difficulties supporting students' mental health during this time. The survey was based on previous research and was subsequently piloted. Using convenience and snowball sampling, 938 participants (U.S. <i>n</i> = 665; Canada <i>n</i> = 48; Germany <i>n</i> = 140; Australia <i>n</i> = 85) completed the online survey. Overall, school psychology services across these four countries pivoted from psychoeducational assessments to virtual counseling, consultation, and the development/posting of online support directly to children or parents to use with their children. There was some variation between countries; during the pandemic, significantly more psychologists in Germany and Australia provided telehealth/telecounseling than those in the United States and Canada, and psychologists in Germany provided significantly more hardcopy material to support children than psychologists in other countries. There is a need to ensure psychologists have the appropriate technological skills to support school communities during periods of school closure, including, but not limited to, virtual counseling and the administration of psychoeducational assessments.

"Examining the associations between food worry and mental health during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada","Little is known about the association between mental health and diminished food worry during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper examines worry about having enough food to meet household needs and its association with mental health during the early months of the pandemic in Canada. Data are drawn from the first round of a multi-round mental health monitoring survey. Online surveys were administered between May 14 and 29, 2020, to a nationally representative sample of Canadian adults (n = 3000). Logistic regression models were used to examine associations between food worry and mental health indicators (anxious/worried, depressed, worse mental health compared with pre-pandemic, and suicidal thoughts/feelings), after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and pre-existing mental health conditions. Fully adjusted models explored the impact of controlling for financial worry due to the pandemic in the previous 2 weeks. Overall, 17.3% of the sample reported food worry due to the pandemic in the previous 2 weeks, with the highest prevalence found among those with a reported disability (29.3%), Indigenous identity (27.1%), or pre-existing mental health condition (25.3%). Compared with participants who did not report food worry, those who did had higher odds of reporting feeling anxious/worried (OR=1.36, 95% CI: 1.08-1.71) and suicidal thoughts/feelings (OR=1.87, 95% CI: 1.24-2.80) when controlling for socio-demographics, pre-existing mental health conditions, and financial worry. This paper provides insights about the associations between food worry and mental health in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic and indicates the need for improved policies and social supports to mitigate food worry and associated mental health outcomes.

This study, for the first time, examined the mediating role of optimism and pessimism in the association between parental coronavirus anxiety and depression among Turkish healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants included 429 healthcare professionals whose age ranged between 22 and 61Ã‚Â years (50.3% female; <i>M</i> =Ã‚Â 36.65, <i>SDÃ‚Â </i>=Ã‚Â 7.0). Results from mediation analysis revealed that parental coronavirus anxiety had a significant predictive effect on optimism, pessimism, and depression. Optimism and pessimism also had significant predictive effects on depression. Most importantly, optimism and pessimism mitigated the adverse impact of parental coronavirus anxiety on healthcare professionals' depression. The findings suggest that optimism is an essential source in reducing depression symptoms in the face of parental coronavirus experiences.

The first aim of the study was to examine the distribution of pandemic-related stressors across multiple dimensions - employment, personal and family finances, personal relationships, and quality of social life - among individuals with and without disabilities. The second aim of the study was to examine the association between a composite COVID-19 stressor score and two mental health outcomes - depressive and anxiety symptoms - among the two sub-samples. The study used quota-based online survey data (N = 2,043) collected in the summer of 2020 from adults (18 and older) residing in the Intermountain West, half of whom had a self-reported disability. Study results demonstrated that individuals with disabilities experienced pandemic-related stressors at significantly higher rates relative to their non-disabled counterparts. Further, pandemic stressor exposure was associated with greater negative effects on their psychological well-being. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic is generating a secondary mental illness pandemic, and that individuals with disabilities are affected by it at significantly higher proportions.

"Application of <b>""</b>family member<b>-</b>like<b>""</b> care strategies among COVID<b>-</b>19 patients in an isolation ward","To control the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) effectively, strict isolation measures have been taken in China. Suspected patients must be isolated, and the confirmed patients specifically are isolated in negative-pressure isolation rooms. During the isolation, patients face difficulty in adapting to their surrounding environment, worry about the prognosis of the disease, lack confidence in treatment, separate from their families, and have a sense of distance from medical staff. Isolated patients may possess the feelings of negativity, including loneliness, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and despair. Hence, to reduce the risk of adverse psychological outcomes, ""family member-like"" care strategies were developed and implemented to solve problems associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to examine whether using ""family member-like"" care strategies can improve psychological resilience and reduce depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among patients with COVID-19 in an isolation ward. A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the ""family member-like"" care strategies for adult patients with COVID-19 in an isolation ward. COVID-19 patients in the Xiangya ward of the West District of the Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, Hubei province, were included in this study from February 9 to March 20, 2020. Healthcare providers who volunteered as family members were assigned to patients. They practiced one-to-one care and provided continuous and whole care for the patients who were from admission to discharge. Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were used to evaluate the resilience and psychological status of COVID-19 inpatients upon hospital admission, 2 weeks after admission, and at their discharge from the hospital. The questionnaire response rate of the ""family member-like"" strategies was 100%. Of the 60 patients, 39 (65.0%) were male, and 21 (35%) were female. The hospital stay was (27.5Ã‚Â±3.5) days. All the 60 patients were cured and discharged without any death and serious complications. The total scores for CD-RISC were 8.83Ã‚Â±6.86 at admission, 29.13Ã‚Â±5.42 at 2 weeks after admission, and 33.87Ã‚Â±6.14 at discharge, which were significantly improved at the 2 follow-ups (<i>F</i>=404.564, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis and repeated measurements also indicated that patients experienced significant improvements in tenacity (<i>F</i>=360.839, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), strength (<i>F</i>=368.217, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), and optimism (<i>F</i>=328.456, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) at the 2 follow-ups. The total scores of DASS-21 were 49.27Ã‚Â±11.30 at admission, 30.77Ã‚Â±16.71 at 2 weeks after admission, and 4.17Ã‚Â±11.03 at discharge, and the scores were significantly decreased at the 2 follow-ups (<i>F</i>=270.536, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis and repeated measurements also indicated that patients experienced significant decreases in depression (<i>F</i>=211.938, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), anxiety (<i>F</i>=285.592, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), and stress (<i>F</i>=287.478, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) at the 2 follow-ups. ""Family member-like"" strategies had positive effects on improving psychological resilience and reducing the symptoms of anxiety and depression of COVID-19 patients. It might be an effective care method for COVID-19 patients. It should be incorporated into emergency care management to improve care quality during public health emergencies of infectious diseases. <b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž</b>:

"Risk factors for excess deaths during lockdown amng older users of secondary care mental health services without confirmed COVID-19: A retrospective cohort study","To investigate factors contributing to excess deaths of older patients during the initial 2020 lockdown beyond those attributable to confirmed COVID-19. Retrospective cohort study comparing patients treated between 23 March 2020 and 14 June 2020, deemed exposed to the pandemic/lockdown, to patients treated between 18 December 2019 and 10 March 2020, deemed to be unexposed. Data came from electronic clinical records from secondary care mental health services in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), UK (catchment area population Ã¢Ë†Â¼0.86 million). Eligible patients were aged 65 years or over at baseline with at least 14 days' follow-up, excluding patients diagnosed with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. In the two cohorts, 3,073 subjects were exposed to lockdown and 4,372 subjects were unexposed; the cohorts were followed up for an average of 74 days and 78 days, respectively. After controlling for confounding by sociodemographic factors, smoking status, mental comorbidities, and physical comorbidities, patients with dementia suffered an additional 53% risk of death (HR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.02-2.31), and patients with severe mental illness suffered an additional 123% risk of death (HR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.42-3.49). No significant additional mortality risks were identified from physical comorbidities, potentially due to low statistical power in that respect. During lockdown people with dementia or severe mental illness had a higher risk of death without confirmed COVID-19. These data could inform future health service responses and policymaking to help prevent avoidable excess death during future outbreaks of this or a similar infectious disease.

"Subtle differences in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern B117 and B1351 in rhesus macaques","The emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 variants has caused global concerns about increased transmissibility, increased pathogenicity, and decreased efficacy of medical countermeasures. Animal models can be used to assess phenotypical changes in the absence of confounding factors that affect observed pathogenicity and transmissibility data in the human population. Here, we studied the pathogenicity of variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 in rhesus macaques and compared it to a recent clade B.1 SARS-CoV-2 isolate containing the D614G substitution in the spike protein. The B.1.1.7 VOC behaved similarly to the D614G with respect to clinical disease, virus shedding and virus replication in the respiratory tract. Inoculation with the B.1.351 isolate resulted in lower clinical scores in rhesus macaques that correlated with lower virus titers in the lungs, less severe histologic lung lesions and less viral antigen detected in the lungs. We observed differences in the local innate immune response to infection. In bronchoalveolar lavages, cytokines and chemokines were upregulated on day 4 in animals inoculated with D614G and B.1.1.7 but not in those inoculated with B.1.351. In nasal samples, we did not detect upregulation of cytokines and chemokines in D614G or B.1.351-inoculated animals. However, cytokines and chemokines were upregulated in the noses of B.1.1.7-inoculated animals. Taken together, our comparative pathogenicity study suggests that ongoing circulation under diverse evolutionary pressure favors transmissibility and immune evasion rather than an increase in intrinsic pathogenicity.","Munster, Flagg, Singh, Williamson, Feldmann, PÃƒÂ©rez-PÃƒÂ©rez, Brumbaugh, Holbrook, Adney, Okumura, Hanley, Smith, Lovaglio, Anzick, Martens, van Doremalen, Saturday, de Wit","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.07.443115","20210812","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-13","",17063,""
"COVID-19, Inter-household Contact and Mental Well-Being Among Older Adults in the US and the UK","Interacting with family members and friends from other households is a key part of everyday life and is crucial to people's mental well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic severely curtailed face-to-face contact between households, particularly for older adults (aged 60 and above), due to their high risk of developing severe illness if infected by COVID-19. In-person contact, where possible, was largely replaced by virtual interaction during the pandemic. This article examines how inter-household contact in face-to-face and virtual forms, as well as combinations of the two forms of contact, related to older adults' mental well-being during the pandemic. Data from two national longitudinal surveys, collected from the same respondents before (2018-2019) and during (June 2020) the pandemic, were comparatively analysed: the Health and Retirement Study in the US and Understanding Society in the UK. The findings showed a notable increase in loneliness in the US and a decline in general mental well-being in the UK following the outbreak of COVID-19. In both countries, more frequent inter-household face-to-face contact during the pandemic was associated with better general mental well-being, but inter-household virtual contact, via means such as telephone and digital media, was not associated with general mental well-being in either the US or the UK. In the US, older adults who engaged more frequently in virtual contact were more likely to feel lonely during the pandemic, particularly if their face-to-face contact was limited. In both countries, the increase in loneliness following the outbreak of the pandemic was greater for older adults who reported more virtual contact. The findings suggest that household-centred crisis management during the COVID-19 pandemic had unintended mental health implications in both the US and the UK, despite contextual differences between the two countries. Although face-to-face contact between households helped to sustain older adults' mental well-being, virtual contact was not a qualitatively equivalent alternative. The findings also provide an important evidence base for informing policy developments and for supporting the mental health of older people during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the longer term.","Hu, Qian","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.714626","20210812","COVID-19; inter-household contact; mental health; older adults; virtual interaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-13","",17064,""
"Predictors for Fear of Cancer Recurrence in Breast Cancer Patients Referred to Radiation Therapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multi-Center Cross-Section Survey","The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted on radiotherapy (RT) strategy for breast cancer patients, which might lead to increased distressing psychological symptoms. We performed a multi-center cross-section survey to investigate prevalence of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) and predictors for FCR in patients referred to RT during pandemic. 542 patients were consecutively enrolled from three regions in China including Yangtze Delta River Region, Guangdong and Shanxi province. Patients' characteristics were collected using an information sheet, Fear of progression questionnaire-short form, Hospital Anxiety/Depression Scale and EORTC QLQ-C30. The hierarchical multiple regression models were performed. 488 patients with complete data were eligible. The RT strategy was affected in 265 (54.3%) patients, including 143 with delayed RT initiation, 66 believing to have delayed RT initiation but actually not, 24 with RT interruptions, 19 shifting to local hospitals for RT and the remaining 13 influenced on both RT schedule and hospital level. The model explained 59.7% of observed variances in FCR (p&lt;0.001) and showed that influence of RT strategy had significantly impacted on FCR (Ã¢â€“Â³R2 = 0.01, Ã¢â€“Â³F=2.966, p=0.019). Hospitals in Shanxi province (ÃŽÂ²=-0.117, p=0.001), emotional function (ÃŽÂ²=-0.19, p&lt;0.001), social function (ÃŽÂ²=-0.111, p=0.006), anxiety (ÃŽÂ²=0.434, p&lt;0.001) and RT interruption (ÃŽÂ²=0.071, p=0.035) were independent predictors. RT strategy for breast cancer patients was greatly influenced during pandemic. RT interruption is an independent predictor for high FCR. Our findings emphasize the necessity to ensure continuum of RT, and efforts should be taken to alleviate FCR through psychological interventions.","Xie, Qi, Cao, Tan, Huang, Gu, Chen, Shen, Zhao, Zhang, Zhao, Huang, Wang, Fang, Jin, Li, Zhao, Qian, Xu, Ou, Wang, Xu, Li, Jiang, Wang, Huang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.650766","20210812","COVID-19; breast cancer; cross-section study; delayed radiotherapy initiation; fear of cancer recurrence (FCR); quality of life; radiotherapy interruption","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-13","",17065,""
"Vital Signs During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Retrospective Analysis of 19,960 Participants in Wuhan and Four Nearby Capital Cities in China","The implications of city lockdown on vital signs during the COVID-19 outbreak are unknown. We longitudinally tracked vital signs using data from wearable sensors and determined associations with anxiety and depression. We selected all participants in the HUAWEI Heart Study from Wuhan and four nearby large provincial capital cities (Guangzhou, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Zhengzhou) and extracted all data from 26 December 2019 (one month before city lockdown) to 21 February 2020. Sleep duration and quality, daily steps, oxygen saturation and heart rate were collected on a daily basis. We compared the vital signs before and after the lockdown using segmented regression analysis of the interrupted time series. The depression and anxiety cases were defined as scores Ã¢â€°Â¥8 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression and anxiety subscales [HADS-D and HADS-A] in 727 participants who finished the survey. We included 19,960 participants (mean age 36 yrs, 90% men). Compared with pre-lockdown, resting heart rate dropped immediately by 1.1 bpm after city lockdown (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.8, -0.4). Sleep duration increased by 0.5 hour (95% CI: 0.3, 0.8) but deep sleep ratio decreased by 0.9% (95% CI: -1.2, -0.6). Daily steps decreased by 3352 steps (95% CI: -4333, -2370). Anxiety and depression existed in 26% and 17% among 727 available participants, respectively, and associated with longer sleep duration (0.2 and 0.1 hour, both p &lt; 0.001). Lockdown of Wuhan in China was associated with an adverse vital signs profile (reduced physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality, but increased sleep duration). Wearable devices in combination with mobile-based apps may be useful to monitor both physical and mental health.

"Children's Mental Health in Southwestern Ontario during Summer 2020 of the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 presents an unprecedented global crisis. Research is critically needed to identify the impact of the pandemic on children's mental health including psychosocial factors that predict resilience, recovery, and persistent distress. The present study collected data in June-July 2020 to describe children's mental health during the initial phase of the pandemic, including the magnitude and nature of psychiatric and psychological distress in children, and to evaluate social support as a putative psychosocial moderator of children's increased distress. Children and parents from 190 families of children aged 8 to 13 from the Windsor-Essex region of Southwestern Ontario reported (i) retrospectively on children's well-being (e.g., worry, happiness) immediately prior to the pandemic and (ii) on children's current well-being; irritability; social support; and anxiety, depressive, and posttraumatic stress symptoms at the baseline assessment of an ongoing longitudinal study of the COVID-19 pandemic. Children and parents reported worsened well-being and psychological distress during the pandemic compared to retrospective report of pre-pandemic well-being. Child-perceived social support from family and friends was associated with lower symptom severity and attenuated increase in psychological distress. Study findings suggest possible broad psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and are consistent with prior research that indicates a protective role of social support to mitigate the negative psychological impact of the pandemic. These findings may inform clinical assessments and highlight the need for public resources to safeguard children's mental health. La COVID-19 prÃƒÂ©sente une crise mondiale sans prÃƒÂ©cÃƒÂ©dent.

"Immediate Pre-Partum SARS-CoV-2 Status and Immune Profiling of Breastmilk: A Case-Control Study","To address the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the evolutionary profile of immune compounds in breastmilk of positive mothers according to time and disease state. Forty-five women with term pregnancies with confirmed non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (case group), and 96 SARS-CoV-2 negative women in identical conditions (control group) were approached, using consecutive sample. Weekly (1st to 5th week postpartum) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in nasopharyngeal swabs (cases) and breastmilk (cases and controls) were obtained. Concentration of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in breastmilk (cases and controls) were determined at 1st and 5th week post-partum. Thirty-seven (study group) and 45 (control group) women were enrolled. Symptomatic infection occurred in 56.8% of women in the study group (48% fever, 48% anosmia, 43% cough). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not found in breastmilk samples. Concentrations of cytokines (IFN-ÃŽÂ³, IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, and TNF-ÃŽÂ±) chemokines (eotaxin, IP-10, MIP-1ÃŽÂ±, and RANTES) and growth factors (FGF, GM-CSF, IL7, and PDGF-BB) were higher in breastmilk of the study compared with the control group at 1st week postpartum. Immune compounds concentrations decreased on time, particularly in the control group milk samples. Time of nasopharyngeal swab to become negative influenced the immune compound concentration pattern. Severity of disease (symptomatic or asymptomatic infection) did not affect the immunological profile in breast milk. This study confirms no viral RNA and a distinct immunological profile in breastmilk according to mother's SARS-CoV-2 status.

"Gambling-Like Day Trading During the COVID-19 Pandemic - Need for Research on a Pandemic-Related Risk of Indebtedness and Mental Health Impact","Stock exchange trading increasingly has been highlighted as a possible cause of gambling disorder, typically in rapid and excessive ""day trading"" which may cause over-indebtedness and mental health problems. The COVID-19 pandemic has been suspected to increase online gambling and gambling problems. In a number of recent media reports, day trading has been reported to increase during COVID-19, possibly in relation to changes in everyday life, financial problems and job insecurity during the pandemic. Increasing day trading has thereby been suspected to cause addictive behavior, financial difficulties, and poor mental health. However, there is hitherto a lack of research in the area. The present paper addresses the potential for day trading to cause problem gambling, debts and mental health problems, and calls for research and clinical guidelines in problem gambling related to stock market behavior as a problematic gambling behavior. Screening tools, awareness among clinicians, and longitudinal research studies may be warranted, both during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","HÃƒÂ¥kansson, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Aranda, JimÃƒÂ©nez-Murcia","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.715946","20210812","COVID-19; day trading; gambling; problem gambling; stock exchange","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-13","",17069,""
"Postinfectious COVID-19 Catatonia: A Report of Two Cases","Neuropsychiatric symptoms are a common complication of COVID-19, with symptoms documented both during acute COVID-19 infection (parainfectious) and persisting or developing after the resolution of respiratory symptoms (postinfectious). Patients have presented with a variety of symptoms such as anosmia, thrombotic events, seizures, cognitive and attention deficits, new-onset anxiety, depression, psychosis, and rarely catatonia. Etiology appears to be related to disruption of regular neurotransmission and hypoxic injury secondary to systemic inflammation and cytokine storm. Although rare, catatonia and each of its subtypes have now been reported as complications of COVID-19 and therefore should be considered known to occur in both the parainfectious and postinfectious states. Diagnosis of catatonia in the context of COVID-19 should be considered when work-up for more common medical causes of encephalopathy are negative, there is no identifiable psychiatric etiology for catatonia, and there is a positive response to benzodiazepines.","Torrico, Kiong, D'Assumpcao, Aisueni, Jaber, Sabetian, Molla, Kuran, Heidari","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.696347","20210812","COVID-19 outbreak; SARS-CoV-2; infectious disease; neurobehavioral; neuropsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-13","",17070,""

She enrolled in tinnitus retraining therapy and began receiving treatment aiming to facilitate habituation of bothersome environmental sounds. This case was complicated by the advent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and a telemedicine hybrid approach was employed to increase access to audiologic care. Using this structure, some appointments occurred in person in the clinic and others occurred via a telemedicine video visit format. Telemedicine video visits facilitated in-depth discussions, afforded the opportunity to answer questions, and provided the option of cloud-based remote programming of on-ear devices.

"Decreased inhibition of exosomal miRNAs on SARS-CoV-2 replication underlies poor outcomes in elderly people and diabetic patients","Elderly people and patients with comorbidities are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection, resulting in severe complications and high mortality. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we investigate whether miRNAs in serum exosomes can exert antiviral functions and affect the response to COVID-19 in the elderly and people with diabetes. First, we identified four miRNAs (miR-7-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-145-5p and miR-223-3p) through high-throughput sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR analysis, that are remarkably decreased in the elderly and diabetic groups. We further demonstrated that these miRNAs, either in the exosome or in the free form, can directly inhibit S protein expression and SARS-CoV-2 replication. Serum exosomes from young people can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and S protein expression, while the inhibitory effect is markedly decreased in the elderly and diabetic patients. Moreover, three out of the four circulating miRNAs are significantly increased in the serum of healthy volunteers after 8-weeks' continuous physical exercise. Serum exosomes isolated from these volunteers also showed stronger inhibitory effects on S protein expression and SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our study demonstrates for the first time that circulating exosomal miRNAs can directly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and may provide a possible explanation for the difference in response to COVID-19 between young people and the elderly or people with comorbidities.","Wang, Zhu, Jiang, Guo, Fu, Zhou, Yang, Guo, Guo, Liang, Zeng, Xiao, Ma, Yin, Zhang, Yan, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00716-y","20210812","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-13","",17072,""
"Psychological Consequences Among Residents and Fellows During the COVID-19 Pandemic in New York City: Implications for Targeted Interventions","To examine the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical trainees (residents and fellows) working at Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) in New York City (NYC), the initial epicenter of the United States pandemic. The authors administered a survey to 991 trainees in frontline specialties working at MSH in NYC between April and May 2020. The instrument assessed symptoms of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, COVID-19-related posttraumatic stress disorder, and burnout. Psychiatric screens were aggregated into one composite measure, and meeting criteria on any of the 3 scales was considered a positive screen for psychiatric symptoms. The survey also assessed COVID-19 related exposures, worries, coping strategies, and desired interventions. Multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to identify factors associated with psychiatric symptoms and burnout. Of the 560 respondents (56.6% response rate), 29.7% screened positive for psychiatric symptoms and 35.8% screened positive for burnout. History of a mental illness, COVID-19-related duties and personal/career worries, and coping by substance use were associated with increased likelihood of screening positive for psychiatric symptoms. Positive emotion-focused coping and feeling valued by supervisors were associated with decreased likelihood. Internal medicine and surgical specialties, a history of mental illness, increased work hours, duty-related worries, personal/career worries, coping via self-blame and venting, and coping via substance use were associated with higher odds of burnout. Feeling valued by supervisors was associated with decreased burnout odds. The most common crisis-related needs included access to personal protective equipment, food provisions, and financial support. Psychological distress and burnout affected approximately one-third of trainees sampled during the height of the pandemic in NYC. As the pandemic surged beyond NYC, these findings suggest that interventions should include addressing basic needs, promoting leadership affirmation, moderating work hours, supporting trainees financially, and enhancing mental health support.","Kaplan, Chan, Feingold, Kaye-Kauderer, Pietrzak, Peccoralo, Feder, Southwick, Charney, Burka, Basist, Ripp, Akhtar","https://doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000004362","20210812","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-13","",17073,""

A cross-sectional study performed using an anonymous online questionnaire distributed through social media, email and the Department of Social Welfare. Malaysian families were invited to answer the questionnaires. The sampling was performed between 12 May 2020 and 9 June 2020. The psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES). The mental health status was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) 21. (1) Psychological impact on Malaysian families. (2) Prevalence of mental health status of Malaysian families during COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 409 Malaysian families have responded (409 parents and 348 children), 154 respondents (38%) reported high psychological impact (score 14) for psychological construct and 189 respondents (46%) reported high psychological impact (score 6) for behavioural construct. A significantly higher proportion of respondents with not permanent employment status of the family lead reported high psychological impact. The prevalence of anxiety reported from family respondents was 23%. Forty-five children answered the DASS-21 questionnaire; 28.5% reported anxiety, 31.4% reported depression and 13.3% reported stress. The job security status of the family lead was found to be the predictive factor for the mean total IES-R score (psychological construct) and ethnicity for mean total CRIES-8 and CRIES-13.

"Mental health and well-being for aging adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic remains a significant mental health crisis. Although empirical research works to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of the general population, some groups remain at greater risk for adverse mental health consequences. The purpose of this study is to better understand how COVID-19 experiences, food insecurities, and social support are associated with mental health and well-being for aging populations. Data collection began April 1, 2020 and continued through May 22, 2020. Study participants were recruited via website and media promotion and completed an anonymous survey. A sample of adults age 50Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and older (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°136) were selected for the current analysis. Measures included scales of anxiety, depression, resilience, quality of life, COVID-19 experiences, interdependence, and insecurities. Three stepwise linear regression models were conducted using forward selection were estimated. The first model found food insecurity, community closeness, and COVID-19 experiences predicted 23% of the variance in mental health. The second model found having enough money to meet needs, COVID-19 interdependence, and age predicted 20% of the variance in resilience. The final model found having enough money to meet needs, COVID-19 experiences, community closeness, and information access predicted 45% of the variance in quality of life. Our discussion highlights the role of COVID-19 experiences, tangible resource losses, and community connection in mental health outcomes for aging populations during COVID-19.

"Analyses of posts written in online eating disorder and depression/anxiety moderated communities: Emotional and informational communication before and during the COVID-19 outbreak","Introduction Moderated online health communities (OHCs) are digital platforms that provide a means for patients with similar medical conditions to communicate with each other under the supervision of healthcare professionals. Aims To examine the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on content and type of posts published in two moderated OHCs â€“ eating disorders and depression/anxiety â€“ by comparing categorizations of posts written before vs. after the lockdown, and about vs. not about the pandemic. Methods Posts were retrieved from Camoni, the first Israeli medical social network (January-June 2017, March-May 2020). A total of 1475 posts were analyzed. Of them, 802 posts were written before and 680 were written during the first lockdown. Posts were divided into two main categories: informational and emotional, and into fourteen subcategories. Results Before the pandemic, the eating disorders OHC was characterized as primarily emotional (emotional: 66.7%, informational: 45.4%) and the depression/anxiety OHC as primarily informational (emotional: 49.8%, informational: 65.8%) (<U+03C7>2 = 31.6, p < 0.001). During the lockdown, there was a transition in the eating disorders community, from primarily emotional to primarily informational communication (emotional: 46.1%, informational: 71.7%) (<U+03C7>2 = 30.3, p < 0.001). In both OHCs, only about one in six posts written during the lockdown was related to the pandemic. There were only minimal differences in subcategorization of posts written before vs. after the outbreak (e.g., searching for medical information was more common during the pandemic: <U+03C7>2 = 40.9, p < 0.001), as well as about vs. not about the pandemic (e.g., sharing negative emotions was more common when writing about the pandemic: <U+03C7>2 = 4.1, p = 0.43). Conclusion During the first lockdown, people with eating disorders have increased their use of OHCs as sources of informational (as opposed to emotional) support, but the overall impact of the pandemic on the content of posts written in the examined OHCs was minimal, suggesting that OHCs have not changed their function as a valuable means of providing emotional and informational support for people with mental difficulties.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100438","20211201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-13","",17076,""
"Evaluation of sleep quality, psychological states and subsequent self-medication practice among the Bangladeshi population during Covid-19 pandemic","Introduction Due to the extended lockdown imposed for SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many people have experienced problematic sleep patterns and associated health issues worldwide. This study was conducted to assess the sleep quality and psychological states of the Bangladeshi population during the COVID-19 pandemic, respondent's behavioral traits as well as psychological or sleep-related problems induced self-medication practice among the respondents, along with the probability of development of drug dependency. Methods The survey was conducted among 2941 respondents from 25th November 2020 to 4th December 2020 where the responses were analyzed by SPSS V22. Results 10â€“29.5% experienced a significant degree of sleep problems whereas some experienced severe anxiety and depression. The associations between the behavioral traits and parameters concerning sleep quality, anxiety and depression showed 5% level of significance in all cases. Self-medication practice of sleep aids during this pandemic was reported by 7.14% of the respondents, with a greater percentage belonging to the female or senior age group. Tendency to repeatedly self-medication was observed in 18.86% of this self-medicating populace, and a greater number of male (10.26%) respondents displayed such tendency as opposed to their female (8.6%) equivalents. However, 48.10% of the respondents reported perceptions of improved physical and/or psychological health following self-medication, and this trait was predominant in men (52.14%). Conclusion Results showed a significant number of Bangladeshi populaces were suffering from psychological issues during this COVID-19 which also influenced a certain number of people towards self-medication practice where signs of drug dependency were observed in a significant number of respondents.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2021.100836","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-13","",17077,""

"Effect of the haptic 3D virtual reality dental training simulator on assessment of tooth preparation","Background/purpose The haptic 3D virtual reality dental training simulator has been drawn attention as a educational strategy in Covid-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study is to investigate the feature of the haptics simulator in comparison with a conventional mannequin simulator by analyzing the assessment of products prepared by dental students using these two kinds of simulator. Materials and methods The subjects were 30 students in the sixth-year classes of the faculty of dentistry. Abutments for a full cast crown were prepared by each subject using two kinds of simulator; one is the haptics simulator and the other is a mannequin simulator. For the resulted products, occlusal surface form, margin design, surface smoothness, taper angle, total cut volume and overall impression were rated by 3 evaluators. Score differences between two simulators were statistically analyzed. Results The kinds of simulator affected subject performance for margin design and total cut volume. The differences in cutting feeling between the simulators as well as variation of stereoscopic ability in subjects were considerable reasons. Evaluatorsâ€™ rating was affected by difference in simulators for occlusal surface form, total cut volume, and overall impression. This may have been due to variation of stereoscopic ability in evaluators. Conclusion The unique characteristics of virtual reality, such as the simulated cutting sensation and the simulated three-dimensional images created by stereo viewers, affect operatorsâ€™ performance and evaluatorsâ€™ rating. It was suggested that educational programs need to be constructed taking account of the characteristics of virtual reality to make the best use of the haptics simulator.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jds.2021.06.022","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-13","",17079,""
