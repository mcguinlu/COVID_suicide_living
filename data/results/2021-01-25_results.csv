"Tracking the mental health of home-carers during the first COVID-19 national lockdown: evidence from a nationally representative UK survey","Background: Unpaid carers who look after another member of their household (home-carers) have poorer mental health than the general population. The first COVID-19 national lockdown led to an increasing reliance on home-carers and we investigate the short and longer-term impact of lockdown on their mental health. Methods: Data from 9,737 adult participants (aged 16+) from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (Understanding Society) were used to explore changes in 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) score between (a) pre-pandemic (2019) and early lockdown (April 2020) and (b) early and later (July 2020) lockdown. Results: GHQ-12 scores among home-carers were higher pre-lockdown and increased more than for non-carers from 2019 to April 2020 with further increases for home-carers compared with non-carers between April and July. Compared with respondents caring for a spouse/partner, those caring for a child under 18 had a particularly marked increase in GHQ-12 score between 2019 and April, as did those caring for someone with learning difficulties. Home-carers of children under 18 improved from April to July while those caring for adult children saw a marked worsening of their mental health. Home-carers with greater care burden saw larger increases in GHQ-12 score from 2019 to April and from April to July, and increases through both periods were greater for home-carers who had formal help prior to lockdown but then lost it. Conclusions: The mental health of home-carers deteriorated more during lockdown than non-carers. Policies that reinstate support for them and their care-recipients will benefit the health of both vulnerable groups.","Elise Whitley; Kelly Reeve; Michaela Benzeval","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250437","20210125","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9773,""

"Depressive Symptoms, Fatigue and Social Relationships Influenced Physical Activity in Frail Older Community-Dwellers during the Spanish Lockdown due to the COVID-19 Pandemic","Due to the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Spain underwent a strict lockdown (March-May 2020). How the lockdown modified older adults' physical activity (PA) has been poorly described. This research assesses the effect of the lockdown on PA levels and identifies predictors of sufficient/insufficient PA in frail older community-dwellers. Community-dwelling participants from the +Ã€GIL Barcelona frailty intervention program, suspended during the pandemic, underwent a phone-assessment during the lockdown. PA was measured before and after the lockdown using the Brief Physical Activity Assessment Tool (BPAAT). We included 98 frail older adults free of COVID-19 (mean age = 82.7 years, 66.3% women, mean Short Physical Performance Battery = 8.1 points). About one third of participants (32.2%) were not meeting sufficient PA levels at the end of the lockdown. Depressive symptoms (OR = 0.12, CI95% = 0.02-0.55) and fatigue (OR = 0.11, CI95% = 0.03-0.44) decreased the odds of maintaining sufficient PA, whereas maintaining social networks (OR = 5.07, CI95% = 1.60-16.08) and reading (OR = 6.29, CI95% = 1.66-23.90) increased it. Living alone was associated with the reduction of PA levels (b = -1.30, CI95% = -2.14--0.46). In our sample, pre-lockdown mental health, frailty-related symptoms and social relationships were consistently associated with both PA levels during-lockdown and pre-post change. These data suggest considering specific plans to maintain PA levels in frail older community-dwellers.","PÃ©rez, Laura M; Castellano-Tejedor, Carmina; Cesari, Matteo; Soto-Bagaria, Luis; Ars, Joan; Zambom-Ferraresi, Fabricio; BarÃ³, Sonia; DÃ­az-Gallego, Francisco; VilarÃ³, Jordi; Enfedaque, MarÃ­a B; EspÃ­-ValbÃ©, Paula; Inzitari, Marco","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020808","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(2)2021 Jan 19.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;18(2)2021 Jan 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9785,""
"Temperament and character of patients with alcohol toxicity during COVID - 19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: Corona virus epidemic may be acts as a stressor or trauma that affects both physical health and mental health. People exhibited various reactive behaviors to confront with this stressful situation. In Iran, one of the common motives for alcohol consumption is to scape problems and cope with stresses. It has been shown that personality factors influence alcohol consumption, since they are associated with drinking motives. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between temperament and character and alcohol abuse. METHODS: This cross-section study was conducted on 135 alcohol intoxicated patients admitted to emergency room in March 2020 and 255 participants who were randomly selected from public in Shiraz. A questionnaire consisted of TCI (Temperament and character inventory) and several questions about COVID-19 pandemic. It was completed by a trained interviewer using the matched answer technique. Demographic factors were self-reported. RESULTS: Among the alcohol intoxicated group, 117 (86.7%) were males and 18(13.3%) were females. The mean age of the participants was 32.43 Â± 10.81 years. Among control group, 99 (38.8%) were males and 156 (61.2%) were females. The mean age of control group was 33.12 Â± 14.77 years. Alcohol toxicity was mostly observed among the young males (male/female ratio was 6.45). According to temperament and character index, mean scores of novelty seeking, harm avoidant, and self-transcendence were higher in the alcohol toxicity group than normal population (P < 0.01). Mean scores of reward dependent, cooperativeness, and self-directedness were higher in normal population than the alcohol toxicity group (P < 0.001). The mean score of persistence was not significantly different between methanol intoxicated and normal population groups (P = 0.718). CONCLUSION: Alcohol intoxicated patients had higher scores of novelty-seeking and self-transcendence and lower scores of reward-dependency scores, cooperativeness and self-directedness. These scores are associated with higher likelihood of personality disorders.","Estedlal, Ali Reza; Mani, Arash; Vardanjani, Hossein Molavi; Kamali, Mahsa; Zarei, Leila; Heydari, Seyed Taghi; Lankarani, Kamran Bagheri","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03052-1","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Psychiatry;21(1): 49, 2021 01 20.; Publication details: BMC Psychiatry;21(1): 49, 2021 01 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9786,""
"Inter-proteomic posttranslational modifications of the SARS-CoV-2 and the host proteins Ã¢<U+0080><U+0092> A new frontier","Posttranslational modification of proteins, which include both the enzymatic alterations of protein side chains and main-chain peptide bond connectivity, is a fundamental regulatory process that is crucial for almost every aspects of cell biology, including the virus-host cell interaction and the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The posttranslational modification of proteins has primarily been studied in cells and tissues in an intra-proteomic context (where both substrates and enzymes are part of the same species). However, the inter-proteomic posttranslational modifications of most of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins by the host enzymes and vice versa are largely unexplored in virus pathogenesis and in the host immune response. It is now known that the structural spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 undergoes proteolytic priming by the host serine proteases for entry into the host cells, and N- and O-glycosylation by the host cell enzymes during virion packaging, which enable the virus to spread. New evidence suggests that both SARS-CoV-2 and the host proteins undergo inter-proteomic posttranslational modifications, which play roles in virus pathogenesis and infection-induced immune response by hijacking the host cell signaling. The purpose of this minireview is to bring attention of the scientific community to recent cutting-edge discoveries in this understudied area. It is likely that a better insight into the molecular mechanisms involved may open new research directions, and thereby contribute to novel therapeutic modality development against the SARS-CoV-2. Here we briefly discuss the rationale and touch upon some unanswered questions in this context, especially those that require attention from the scientific community.","Mishra, Suresh; Bassi, Geetika; Nyomba, Bl GrÃ©goire","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1535370220986785","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Exp Biol Med (Maywood);: 1535370220986785, 2021 Jan 19.; Publication details: Exp Biol Med (Maywood);: 1535370220986785, 2021 Jan 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9787,""

This study investigated the emergence of new psychiatric symptoms and the worsening of pre-existing mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, identified factors associated with psychological worsening, and assessed changes in mental health service use. METHODS: An online survey was circulated between April 3 and June 23, 2020. Respondents were asked to complete mental health questionnaires based on 2 time referents: currently (i.e., during the outbreak) and in the month preceding the outbreak. A total of 4,294 Canadians between 16 and 99 years of age were subdivided based on the presence of self-reported psychiatric diagnoses. RESULTS: The proportion of respondents without prior psychiatric history who screened positive for generalized anxiety disorder and depression increased by 12% and 29%, respectively, during the outbreak. Occurrences of clinically important worsening in anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation symptoms relative to pre-outbreak estimates were significantly higher in those with psychiatric diagnoses. Furthermore, 15% to 19% of respondents reported increased alcohol or cannabis use. Worse psychological changes relative to pre-outbreak estimate were associated with female sex, younger age, lower income, poorer coping skills, multiple psychiatric comorbidities, previous trauma exposure, deteriorating physical health, poorer family relationships, and lower exercising. Reductions in mental health care were associated with increased suicidal ideation. CONCLUSION: The worsening in mental health symptoms and the decline in access to care call for the urgent development of adapted interventions targeting both new mental disorders and pre-existing psychiatric conditions affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Robillard, Rebecca; Daros, Alexander R; Phillips, Jennifer L; Porteous, Meggan; Saad, Mysa; Pennestri, Marie-Helene; Kendzerska, Tetyana; Edwards, Jodi D; Solomonova, Elizaveta; Bhatla, Rajiv; Godbout, Roger; Kaminsky, Zachary; Boafo, Addo; Quilty, Lena C","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0706743720986786","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Can J Psychiatry;: 706743720986786, 2021 Jan 19.; Publication details: Can J Psychiatry;: 706743720986786, 2021 Jan 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9789,""

With a limited understanding of the novel, emerging infectious disease, pregnant women have sought ways to access timely and trusted health care information. The mental health status of pregnant women during this public health emergency, as well as how they responded to the situation and where and how they obtained antenatal care information, remain to be understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the mental health status of pregnant women during the COVID-19 epidemic in China by measuring their perceived stress, anxiety, and depression levels; explore the approaches used by them to access antenatal health care information; and determine their associations with maternal mental health status. METHODS: We conducted a web-based, cross-sectional survey to assess the mental health status of Chinese pregnant women by using the validated, Chinese version of Perceived Stress Scale, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, and Edinburgh Depression Scale. We also collected information on the various approaches these women used to access antenatal care information during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, from February 5 to 28, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1873 pregnant women from 22 provinces or regions of China participated in the survey. The prevalence of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression among these participants was 89.1% (1668/1873; 95% CI 87.6%, 90.4%), 18.1% (339/1873; 95% CI 16.4%, 19.9%), and 45.9% (859/1873; 95% CI 43.6%, 48.1%), respectively. Hospitals' official accounts on the Chinese social media platforms WeChat and Weibo were the most popular channels among these pregnant women to obtain antenatal care information during the COVID-19 outbreak. Access to antenatal care information via the hospitals' official social media accounts was found to be associated with a significantly lower risk of perceived stress (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.46, 95% CI 0.30-0.72; P=.001), anxiety (aOR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41-0.68; P<.001), and depression (aOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59-0.91; P=.005). Access to health care information via hospital hotlines or SMS was found to be significantly associated with a lower risk of anxiety only (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60-0.98; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak in China, pregnant women experienced high levels of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression. During such public health emergencies, mental health care services should be strengthened to reassure and support pregnant women. Specific information targeted at pregnant women, including information on how to cope in an emergency or major disease outbreak, developed and disseminated by health care institutions via social media platforms could be an effective way to mitigate mental health challenges and ensure epidemic preparedness and response in the future.","Jiang, Hong; Jin, Longmei; Qian, Xu; Xiong, Xu; La, Xuena; Chen, Weiyi; Yang, Xiaoguang; Yang, Fengyun; Zhang, Xinwen; Abudukelimu, Nazhakaiti; Li, Xingying; Xie, Zhenyu; Zhu, Xiaoling; Zhang, Xiaohua; Zhang, Lifeng; Wang, Li; Li, Lingling; Li, Mu","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/18722","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(1): e18722, 2021 01 18.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(1): e18722, 2021 01 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9790,""
"Mental Health Among Medical Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Eight European Countries: Cross-sectional Survey Study","BACKGROUND: The death toll of COVID-19 topped 170,000 in Europe by the end of May 2020. COVID-19 has caused an immense psychological burden on the population, especially among doctors and nurses who are faced with high infection risks and increased workload. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the mental health of medical professionals with nonmedical professionals in different European countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that medical professionals, particularly those exposed to COVID-19 at work, would have higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. We also aimed to determine their main stressors and most frequently used coping strategies during the crisis. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted during peak COVID-19 months in 8 European countries. The questionnaire included demographic data and inquired whether the participants were exposed to COVID-19 at work or not. Mental health was assessed via the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales32 (23.53)-21 (DASS-21). A 12-item checklist on preferred coping strategies and another 23-item questionnaire on major stressors were completed by medical professionals. RESULTS: The sample (N=609) consisted of 189 doctors, 165 nurses, and 255 nonmedical professionals. Participants from France and the United Kingdom reported experiencing severe/extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress more often compared to those from the other countries. Nonmedical professionals had significantly higher scores for depression and anxiety. Among medical professionals, no significant link was reported between direct contact with patients with COVID-19 at work and anxiety, depression, or stress. ""Uncertainty about when the epidemic will be under control"" caused the most amount of stress for health care professionals while ""taking protective measures"" was the most frequently used coping strategy among all participants. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 poses a major challenge to the mental health of working professionals as a considerable proportion of our participants showed high values for depression, anxiety, and stress. Even though medical professionals exhibited less mental stress than nonmedical professionals, sufficient help should be offered to all occupational groups with an emphasis on effective coping strategies.","Hummel, Svenja; Oetjen, Neele; Du, Junfeng; Posenato, Elisabetta; Resende de Almeida, Rosa Maria; Losada, Raquel; Ribeiro, Oscar; Frisardi, Vincenza; Hopper, Louise; Rashid, Asarnusch; Nasser, Habib; KÃ¶nig, Alexandra; Rudofsky, Gottfried; Weidt, Steffi; Zafar, Ali; Gronewold, Nadine; Mayer, Gwendolyn; Schultz, Jobst-Hendrik","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24983","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(1): e24983, 2021 01 18.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(1): e24983, 2021 01 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9791,""

"Associations of COVID-19 risk perception with vaccine hesitancy over time for Italian residents","Many countries were and are still struggling with the COVID-19 emergency. Despite efforts to limit the viral transmission, the vaccine is the only solution to ending the pandemic. However, vaccine hesitancy could reduce coverage and hinder herd immunity. People's intention to get vaccinated can be shaped by several factors, including risk perception which, in turn, is influenced by affect. The present work aimed at investigating how risk perception and some factors associated with the decision to comply with vaccination modulated vaccine acceptance for COVID-19 as compared to seasonal influenza, and how these have varied during the lockdown phases. The study followed the main phases of the emergency in Italy, investigating the intention to get vaccinated against flu and against SARS-CoV-2 (if a vaccine was available) before, during and after the first national lockdown, covering the period from the end of February to the end of June 2020. We investigated the effect of risk perception and other predictors on the decision of getting vaccinated. Compared to the pre-lockdown phase, during the lockdown more people were willing to get vaccinated for COVID-19, regardless of their beliefs about vaccines, and as risk perception increased, so did the intention to accept the vaccine. The acceptance of the flu vaccine increased after the re-opening phase. In addition, the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and against flu increased if there was previous flu vaccination behavior but decreased with increasing doubts about the vaccines in general. The observation of vaccination intentions across the three main phases of the emergency allows important considerations regarding psychological, affect, and demographic determinants useful to tailor public health communication to improve public response to future epidemics.","Caserotti, Girardi, Rubaltelli, Tasso, Lotto, Gavaruzzi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113688","20210123","COVID-19; Flu vaccine; Risk perception; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Vaccine acceptance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9796,""
"Psychological distress and the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK dentists during a national lockdown","Introduction Dentists are known to function under stressful conditions. It is important to monitor, examine and understand the psychological effects the unprecedented challenge of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had.Aims To compare levels of psychological distress in UK dentists, before and during the pandemic, to determine if this was affected.Materials and methods An online survey collected demographic data, levels of psychological distress (GP-CORE) and experiences from UK dentists during the 'national lockdown' period of the pandemic. Statistical and thematic analyses were performed and data compared with previous research.Results Psychological distress was lower in UK dentists during the national lockdown period when compared to previous research using the same measure. GDPs, those in England and those with mixed commitment reported the highest levels of psychological distress. Most dentists had been affected by the pandemic. Some who were remotely working during this time valued the time away from the profession, relishing the absence of regulatory and contractual stressors, and used lockdown as an opportunity to re-evaluate their lives and careers. Others found the conditions stressful with some previously acknowledged stressors remaining and novel stressors introduced.Conclusions We argue that the altered balance of stressors and the resulting reduced psychological distress is further evidence of the need for reform of the profession to improve working lives. Given the importance of mental health and wellbeing, it is vital that monitoring continues.","Collin, O Selmo, Whitehead","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41415-020-2592-5","20210123","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9797,""
"The impact of quarantine on mental health status among general population in China during the COVID-19 pandemic","Quarantine and isolation measures urgently adopted to control the COVID-19 pandemic might potentially have negative psychological and social effects. We conducted this cross-sectional, nationwide study to ascertain the psychological effect of quarantine and identify factors associated with mental health outcomes among population quarantined to further inform interventions of mitigating mental health risk especially for vulnerable groups under pandemic conditions. Sociodemographic data, attitudes toward the COVID-19, and mental health measurements of 56,679 participants from 34 provinces in China were collected by an online survey from February 28 to March 11, 2020. Of the 56,679 participants included in the study (mean [SD] age, 36.0 [8.2] years), 27,149 (47.9%) were male and 16,454 (29.0%) ever experienced home confinement or centralized quarantine during COVID-19 outbreak. Compared those without quarantine and adjusted for potential confounders, quarantine measures were associated with increased risk of total psychological outcomes (prevalence, 34.1% vs 27.3%; odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.28-1.39; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that vulnerable groups of the quarantined population included those with pre-existing mental disorders or chronic physical diseases, frontline workers, those in the most severely affected areas during outbreak, infected or suspected patients, and those who are less financially well-off. Complying with quarantine, being able to take part in usual work, and having adequate understanding of information related to the outbreak were associated with less mental health issues. These results suggest that quarantine measures during COVID-19 pandemic are associated with increased risk of experiencing mental health burden, especially for vulnerable groups. Further study is needed to establish interventions to reduce mental health consequences of quarantine and empower wellbeing especially in vulnerable groups under pandemic conditions.","Wang, Shi, Que, Lu, Liu, Lu, Xu, Liu, Sun, Meng, Yuan, Ran, Lu, Bao, Shi","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01019-y","20210123","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9798,""
"Decoding the temporal nature of brain GR activity in the NFÃŽÂºB signal transition leading to depressive-like behavior","The fine-tuning of neuroinflammation is crucial for brain homeostasis as well as its immune response. The transcription factor, nuclear factor-ÃŽÂº-B (NFÃŽÂºB) is a key inflammatory player that is antagonized via anti-inflammatory actions exerted by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). However, technical limitations have restricted our understanding of how GR is involved in the dynamics of NFÃŽÂºB in vivo. In this study, we used an improved lentiviral-based reporter to elucidate the time course of NFÃŽÂºB and GR activities during behavioral changes from sickness to depression induced by a systemic lipopolysaccharide challenge. The trajectory of NFÃŽÂºB activity established a behavioral basis for the NFÃŽÂºB signal transition involved in three phases, sickness-early-phase, normal-middle-phase, and depressive-like-late-phase. The temporal shift in brain GR activity was differentially involved in the transition of NFÃŽÂºB signals during the normal and depressive-like phases. The middle-phase GR effectively inhibited NFÃŽÂºB in a glucocorticoid-dependent manner, but the late-phase GR had no inhibitory action. Furthermore, we revealed the cryptic role of basal GR activity in the early NFÃŽÂºB signal transition, as evidenced by the fact that blocking GR activity with RU486 led to early depressive-like episodes through the emergence of the brain NFÃŽÂºB activity. These results highlight the inhibitory action of GR on NFÃŽÂºB by the basal and activated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis during body-to-brain inflammatory spread, providing clues about molecular mechanisms underlying systemic inflammation caused by such as COVID-19 infection, leading to depression.","Han, Kim, Jo, Shin, Kwon, Seo, Kang, Lee, Ryu, Hwang, Kim, Patel, Lyons, Schatzberg, Her","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01016-1","20210123","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9799,""
"Does thinking make it so? Differential associations between adversity worries and experiences and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","There is evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic is having adverse effects on mental health. It is vital to understand what is causing this: worries over potential adversities due to the pandemic, or the toll of experiencing adverse events. We used panel data from 41Ã¢â‚¬â€°909 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study assessed weekly from 1 April 2020 to 12 May 2020 to study the association between adversities and anxiety and depressive symptoms. We studied six categories of adversity including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety. Anxiety and depression were measured using the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. We used fixed-effect regression models to account for time-invariant confounders. Cumulative number of worries and experience of adversities were both related to higher levels of anxiety and depression. A number of worries were associated more with anxiety than depression, but number of experiences were equally related to anxiety and depression. There were clear associations between specific worries and poorer mental health. There was weak evidence that individuals of lower socio-economic position were more negatively affected psychologically by the adverse experiences. Measures over the first few weeks of lockdown in the UK appear to have been insufficient at reassuring people given that we see clear associations with mental health and cumulative worries. Interventions are required that seek to prevent adverse events (eg, redundancies) and reassure individuals and support adaptive coping strategies.","Wright, Steptoe, Fancourt","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-215598","20210123","depression; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9800,""
"A hidden side of the COVID-19 pandemic in children: the double burden of undernutrition and overnutrition","The COVID-19 pandemic has deteriorated key determinants of health and caused major upheavals around the world. Children, although less directly affected by the virus, are paying a heavy price through the indirect effects of the crisis, including poor diet, mental health impact, social isolation, addiction to screens and lack of schoolingÃ‚Â and health care, particularly among vulnerable groups. This paper is aimed at discussing the potential impact of this pandemic on children's nutrition and lifestyle. Preliminary data from the literature and from our survey show significant disruptions in nutrition and lifestyle habits of children. While undernutrition is expected to worsen in poor countries, obesity rates could increase in middle- and high-income countries especially among precarious groups widening the gap in health and social inequalities.The real impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children extends well beyond that of a viral infection. This crisis has public health implications that could have life-long consequences on children. It requires effective and targeted measures mainly for vulnerable children and households to guarantee children's basic rights for optimal nutrition, health and development.","Zemrani, Gehri, Masserey, Knob, Pellaton","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01390-w","20210123","COVID-19; Children; Impact; Inequality; Obesity; Undernutrition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9801,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Sexual Health: A Preliminary Framework Based on a Qualitative Study With Clinical Sexologists","In recent months, some attempts were made to understand the impact of COVID-19 on sexual health. Despite recent research that suggests COVID-19 and lockdown measures may eventually impact sexual response and sexually related behaviors, we are missing clinical sexologists' perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 in sexual health. Such perspectives could inform a preliminary framework aimed at guiding future research and clinical approaches in the context of COVID-19. To explore the perspectives of clinical sexologists about the impact of COVID-19 on their patients' sexual health, as well as the professional challenges they have faced during the current pandemic. Findings are expected to inform a preliminary framework aimed at understanding the impact of COVID-19 on sexual health. We conducted an online qualitative exploratory survey with 4 open-ended questions with 39 clinical sexologists aged between 32 and 73Ã‚Â years old. The survey was advertised among professional associations' newsletters. We performed a Thematic Analysis using an inductive, semantic, and (critical) realist approach, leading to a final thematic map. The outcome is the thematic map and the corresponding table that aggregates the main themes, subthemes, and codes derived from participants' answers and that can serve as a preliminary framework to understand the impact of COVID-19 on sexual health. The final thematic map, expected to serve as a preliminary framework on the impact of COVID-19 in sexual health, revealed 3 main themes: Clinical Focus, Remapping Relationships, and Reframing Technology Use. These themes aggregate important interrelated issues, such as worsening of sexual problems and dysfunctions, mental health, relationship management, the rise of conservatism, and the use of new technology that influences sexuality and sexual health-related services. The current study allowed us to develop a preliminary framework to understand the impact of COVID-19 on sexual health. This framework highlights the role of mental health, as well as the contextual nature of sexual problems, and subsequently, their relational nature. Also, it demonstrates that the current pandemic has brought into light the debate of e-Health delivery within clinical sexology. PM Pascoal, J Carvalho, CF Raposo, etÃ‚Â al.

"Increased mood disorder symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption during the spring of 2020. Many college students were told to leave campus at spring break and to complete the semester remotely. This study evaluates effects of this disruption on student well-being. Measures of psychological symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use during the pandemic were completed by 148 students in spring 2020 and 352 students in fall 2020 at a university in the southeastern U.S. Results from both cohorts were compared to 240 students who completed the same measures in the fall 2019 semester. Participants in spring 2020 reported more mood disorder symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use than did pre-pandemic participants and worry about COVID-19 was negatively associated with well-being. By fall 2020 symptoms had largely returned to pre-pandemic levels. In general, White students reported a greater effect of the pandemic on well-being than did African American students. Young adults appear to be less vulnerable to the most serious medical complications associated with COVID-19, but nonetheless experience psychological effects from the pandemic. Universities and practitioners who work with college students can help young adults manage their symptoms and avoid behaviors like risky alcohol use when confronted with stressors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Charles, Strong, Burns, Bullerjahn, Serafine","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113706","20210124","Alcohol; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Stress; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9804,""
"&quot;We have become prisoners of our own age&quot;: From a continuing care retirement community to a total institution in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak","During the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, people residing in continuing care retirement communities (CCRC) found themselves under strict instructions to self-isolate, imposed by the CCRC managements before, during, and after the nationwide lockdown. The present study explored the personal experiences of CCRC residents during the lockdown. In-depth interviews were conducted with 24 CCRC residents from 13 different CCRCs. Authors performed a thematic analysis of interview transcripts, using constant comparisons and contrasts. Three major themes were identified: a). Older residents engaged in constant attempts to compare their situation to that of others. The overall message behind these downward comparisons was that the situation is not so bad, as others are in a worse predicament; b).

Interviewees described strong emotions of despair, depression and anger, which were intensified when the rest of society returned back to a new routine, while they were still under lockdown. The measures imposed on residents by managements of CCRCs during the lockdown, and the emotional responses of distress among some of the residents, revealed that CCRCs have components of total institutions, not normally evident. This underscores the hidden emotional costs of the lockdown among those whose autonomy was compromised.","Ayalon, Avidor","https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab013","20210122","Covid-19; Long term care; autonomy; loneliness; older people; paternalism; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9805,""
"Risk factors for neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease during COVID-19 pandemic in Japan","The worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) has been a concern during the COVID-19 pandemic, because most people worked in self-isolation for fear of infection. We aimed to clarify the impact of social restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic on neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD patients and to identify risk factors associated with these symptoms. A cross-sectional, hospital-based survey was conducted from April 22, 2020 to May 15, 2020. PD patients and their family members were asked to complete paper-based questionnaires about neuropsychiatric symptoms by mail. PD patients were evaluated for motor symptoms using MDS-UPDRS part 2 by telephone interview. A total of 71 responders (39 PD patients and 32 controls) completed the study. Although there was no difference in the age distribution, the rate of females was significantly lower in PD patients (35%) than controls (84%) (P &lt; 0.001). Participants with clinical depression (PHQ-9 score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10) were more common in PD patients (39%) than controls (6%) (P = 0.002). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that an MDS-UPDRS part 2 score was correlated with the presence of clinical depression (PHQ-9 score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10) and clinical anxiety (GAD-7 score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 7) (clinical depression: OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.04-1.66; P = 0.025; clinical anxiety: OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.07-1.72; P = 0.013). In the presence of social restrictions, more attention needs to be paid to the neuropsychiatric complications of PD patients, especially those with more severe motor symptoms.","Kitani-Morii, Kasai, Horiguchi, Teramukai, Ohmichi, Shinomoto, Fujino, Mizuno","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245864","20210122","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9806,""
"A systematic review for the efficiency and quality of data collection in the public mental health surveys during the COVID-19 pandemic","The World Health Organization has recognized the importance of considering population-level mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a global crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, a timely surveillance method is urgently needed to track the impact on public mental health. This brief review focuses on the efficiency and quality of data collection in the existing literature. The following search strings were used: ((COVID-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2)) AND ((Mental health) OR (psychological) OR (psychiatry)). We screened the titles, abstracts, and texts to exclude irrelevant articles. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to evaluate the quality of each research. There were 37 relevant mental health surveys of the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic found by searching the database PubMed on July 10, 2020. All the public mental health surveys examined were cross-sectional in design, and the journals efficiently made these available online in an average of 18.7 (range: 1-64) days from the date the article was received. The average duration of recruitment periods was 9.2 (range: 2-35) days, and the average sample size was 5137 (range: 100-56679). However, 73.0% (27/37) of the studies on the general public had scores on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale of &lt; 3 points, which suggests these studies are of too low quality for inclusion in a meta-analysis. This review found that the data collection was efficient but generally had a high risk of bias among existing public mental health surveys. Following a recommendation to avoid selection bias, or to apply novel methodologies considering both longitudinal design and high temporal resolution, would help provide a strong basis for the formation of national mental health policies.","Lin, Chen, Wu","https://doi.org/10.2196/25118","20210122","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9807,""
"COVID-19 and the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities: A complex relationship without just cause","Emerging evidence illustrates a negative and disproportionate impact of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities. This is surprising because previously reported studies have already identified that biological and social risk factors increase disease susceptibility, particularly for the BAME communities. Despite ethnic minorities standing on the frontline to quell the impact of the pandemic within the United Kingdom's (UK) National Health Service (NHS), disproportionate numbers of BAME doctors and other healthcare workers have died from COVID-19. This unprecedented situation raises ethical and moral implications that could increase further the impact on mental health. Whilst the government attempts to mitigate the rate of virus transmission, key measures inadvertently increase the negative impact on mental health and general wellbeing. This analysis considers available literature to explore the association between, and the wider impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic on BAME communities.

"The efficacy of WeChat-based parenting training on the psychological well-being of mothers with autistic children during the COVID-19 pandemic: A quasi-experimental study","During the COVID-19 pandemic, special education schools for children in most areas of China were closed between the end of January and the beginning of June in 2020. The sudden interruptions of schooling and the pandemic itself caused parents to be anxious and to even panic. Mobile parenting skills education has been proved to be an effective method in improving the psychological well-being of mothers with autistic children. However, whether it can improve the psychological states of mothers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent subject to be investigated. To evaluate the efficacy of WeChat-based parenting training (WBPT) on anxiety, depression, parenting stress, and hope for mothers with autistic children as well as the feasibility of the program during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a quasi-experimental trial. A total of 125 mothers with preschool autistic children were recruited in January 2020. The participants were assigned into the control group (n=60), receiving routine care, or the intervention group (n=65), receiving the 12-week WBPT plus routine care according to their preferences. Anxiety, depression, parenting stress, hope, satisfaction, and adherence to the intervention were measured at three timepoints: the baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 20 weeks follow-up (T2). One hundred and nine mothers completed the T1 assessment and 104 mothers completed the T2 assessment. The results of the linear mixed model analysis showed statistically significant group*time interaction effects for the intervention on anxiety (F=14.219, P&lt;.001), depression (F=26.563, P&lt;.001), parenting stress (F=68.572, P&lt;.001), and hope (F=197.608, P&lt;.001). Of all mothers in the intervention group, 90.4% reported that they were extremely satisfied with the WBPT. In total, 40.0% kept the logging recordings for home training each week and 61.5% kept more than 80% for all 20 weeks. The WBPT is acceptable and appears to be an effective approach for reducing anxiety, depression, and parenting stress and increasing hope in mothers with autistic children during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies with rigorous designs and longer follow-up periods are needed to further detect the effectiveness of the WBPT.

"COVID-19 Awareness, Adoption of COVID-19 Preventive Measures, and Effects of COVID-19 Lockdown Among Adolescent Boys and Young Men in Kampala, Uganda","There is growing evidence of the challenges with adherence to COVID-19 prevention measures and the effect of the prevention measures on the health of populations in various parts of the world but with limited documentation in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed COVID-19 awareness, adoption of COVID-19 prevention measures, and the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on the mental health status, socio-economic disruptions and engagement in unhealthy behaviours among 2500 in- and out-of-school adolescent boys and young men (ABYM) aged 10-24Ã‚Â years in Kampala, Uganda. 74.8% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1869) were in-school; nearly half (47.3%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1182) were aged 15-19Ã‚Â years. AlthoughÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°80% were aware of at least two COVID-19 prevention measures, only 22.2% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°555) reported that they always wore a face mask while in a public place; 40.9% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1023) always washed their hands with soap and running water while 17.6% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°440) always avoided gatherings of more than five people. COVID-19 lockdown led to: (a) increased mental health challenges (e.g. 1.2% [nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°31] contemplated committing suicide); (b) limited ability to meet basic needs (e.g. 62.0% [nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1549] found it difficult to afford a diverse/balanced diet); (c) socio-economic disruptions (e.g. 30.3% [nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°756] experienced a reduction in income) and (d) engagement in unhealthy behaviours (e.g. 62% [nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1554] reported a sedentary life style such as excessive watching of TV). These effects were more pronounced among older adolescent boys (15-19Ã‚Â years) and young men (20-24Ã‚Â years) and out-of-school compared to in-school ABYM.

"[Change in psychological burden during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany: fears, individual behavior, and the relevance of information and trust in governmental institutions]","The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health was evident early on. The extent of the effects, especially cumulative over the long period of the pandemic, has not yet been fully investigated for Germany. The aim of the study was to determine psychological burden as well as COVID-19-related experience and behavior patterns and to show how they changed during the different phases of the pandemic in Germany. The Germany-wide online-based cross-sectional study (03/10-07/27/2020) included 22,961 people (convenience sample). Generalized anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-2), and psychological distress (DT) were collected, as well as COVID-19-related experiences and behavior patterns: COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions, subjective level of information, adherent safety behavior, and personal risk assessment for infection/severe course of illness. The pandemic was retrospectively divided into fiveÃ‚Â phases (initial, crisis, lockdown, reorientation, and new normality). Compared to pre-COVID-19 reference values, GADÃ¢â‚¬â€˜7, PHQÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2, and DT levels were significantly elevated and persistent throughout the different phases of the pandemic. COVID-19-related fear, information level, trust, safety behavior, and the risk assessment for infection/severe course of illness showed, after initial strong increase, aÃ‚Â strong decrease to partly below the initial value. Exceptions were constant risk assessments of having aÃ‚Â severe course of illness or dying of it. The increased levels of psychological burden, which have persisted throughout all phases of the pandemic, illustrate the need for sustainable support services. Declining values over the duration of the pandemic in terms of trust in governmental actions and the feeling of being well informed underline the need for more targeted education.

"Availability of Outpatient Telemental Health Services in the United States at the Outset of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Since COVID-19 has caused dramatic changes in everyday life, a major concern is whether patients have adequate access to mental health care despite shelter-in-place ordinances, school closures, and social distancing practices. The aim was to examine the availability of telehealth services at outpatient mental health treatment facilities in the United States at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify facility-level characteristics and state-level policies associated with the availability. Observational cross-sectional study. All outpatient mental health treatment facilities (N=8860) listed in the Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration on April 16, 2020. Primary outcome is whether an outpatient mental health treatment facility reported offering telehealth services. Approximately 43% of outpatient mental health facilities in the United States reported telehealth availability at the outset of the pandemic. Facilities located in the United States South and nonmetropolitan counties were more likely to offer services, as were facilities with public sector ownership, those providing care for both children and adults, and those accepting Medicaid as a form of payment. Outpatient mental health treatment facilities located in states with state-wide shelter-in-place laws were less likely to offer telehealth, as well as facilities in counties with more COVID-19 cases per 10,000 population. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer than half of outpatient mental health treatment facilities were providing telehealth services. Our results suggest that additional policies to promote telehealth may be warranted to increase availability over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cantor, McBain, Kofner, Stein, Yu","https://doi.org/10.1097/MLR.0000000000001512","20210122","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9814,""

When evaluated specifically for pain, the data so far have shown that myalgia, headache, and chest pain can be seen in patients at varying rates; myalgia and headache, especially, are among the initial symptoms. This retrospective chart review followed by a descriptive survey design study was carried out by examining patients afflicted with COVID-19. After discharge, patients were asked about the severity and the body region of their pain, their use of analgesics, their mood and mental health, and their overall quality of life. A total of 206 patients with a mean age of 56.24 Ã‚Â± 16.99 were included in the study. Pain during COVID-19 was found to be higher compared to the pre- and postinfectious states. The most frequent painful areas were reported to be the neck and back before the infection, whereas the head and extremities during the infection. The most frequently used analgesic during infection was paracetamol. There was no relationship between the patients' pain and anxiety and depression; the quality of life was found to be worse in patients with persistent pain. This study showed that the head and extremities were the most common painful body regions during COVID-19. It was also found that pain can continue in the post-infection period.","ErÃƒÂ§alÃ„Â±k, AyyÃ„Â±ldÃ„Â±z, Gencer-Atalay, AkgÃƒÂ¼n, Ãƒâ€“zdemir, Kuran","https://doi.org/10.1097/PHM.0000000000001699","20210122","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9815,""

"Anxiety, depression, and cognitive emotion regulation strategies in Chinese nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak","To explore the association between cognitive emotion regulation strategies and anxiety and depression among nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak. Nurses play a vital role in responding to the COVID-19 outbreak, but many of them suffer from psychological problems due to the excessive workload and stress. Understanding the correlation between cognitive emotion regulation strategies and anxiety and depression will promote targeted psychosocial interventions for these affected nurses. This cross-sectional study of 586 nurses was conducted in Eastern China. Participants completed online questionnaires that investigated anxiety, depression, and cognitive emotion regulation strategies. The prevalence of nurses' anxiety and depression was 27.6% and 32.8%, respectively. Lower self-blame, rumination, and catastrophizing, as well as greater acceptance and positive refocusing, were related to fewer symptoms of anxiety or depression. The cognitive emotion regulation strategies of acceptance and positive refocusing contribute to reducing anxiety or depression. These strategies should be considered when implementing psychotherapeutic interventions to improve nurses' adverse emotional symptoms. This study highlights the need to assess cognitive emotion regulation strategies use in screening for anxiety and depression. Nurse managers should develop psychosocial interventions including appropriate strategies to help nurses with adverse emotions during a pandemic.","Wang, Fang, Huang, Lv, Wang, Yang, Yuan, Gao, Qian, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13265","20210122","COVID-19; anxiety; cognitive emotion regulation; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9818,""

To better understand the emotional and behavioral consequences of the public health policies implemented to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in PwPD, and to explore the factors contributing to accessing alternative health care mechanisms, such as telehealth, we administered an anonymous knowledge, attitude, and practice survey to PwPD and care partners, via the mailing lists of the Parkinson's Foundation and Columbia University Parkinson's Disease Center of Excellence with an average response rate of 19.3%. Sufficient information was provided by 1,342 PwPD to be included in the final analysis. Approximately half of respondents reported a negative change in PD symptoms, with 45-66% reporting mood disturbances. Telehealth use increased from 9.7% prior to the pandemic to 63.5% during the pandemic. Higher income and higher education were associated with telehealth use. Services were more often used for doctor's appointment than physical, occupational, speech, or mental health therapies. Almost half (46%) of PwPD preferred to continue using telehealth always or sometimes after the coronavirus outbreak had ended. Having received support/instruction for telehealth and having a care partner, friend, or family member to help them with the telehealth visit increased the likelihood of continuous use of telehealth after the pandemic ended. Taken together, PD symptoms and management practices were markedly affected by COVID-19. Given the observed demographic limitations of telehealth, expanding its implementation to include additional physical, occupational, psychological, and speech therapies, increasing support for telehealth, as well as reaching underserved (low income) populations is urgently required.","Feeney, Xu, Surface, Shah, Vanegas-Arroyave, Chan, Delaney, Przedborski, Beck, Alcalay","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-020-00153-8","20210122","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9819,""
"Psycho-social factors associated with mental resilience in the Corona lockdown","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is not only a threat to physical health but is also having severe impacts on mental health. Although increases in stress-related symptomatology and other adverse psycho-social outcomes, as well as their most important risk factors have been described, hardly anything is known about potential protective factors. Resilience refers to the maintenance of mental health despite adversity. To gain mechanistic insights about the relationship between described psycho-social resilience factors and resilience specifically in the current crisis, we assessed resilience factors, exposure to Corona crisis-specific and general stressors, as well as internalizing symptoms in a cross-sectional online survey conducted in 24 languages during the most intense phase of the lockdown in Europe (22 March to 19 April) in a convenience sample of NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15,970 adults. Resilience, as an outcome, was conceptualized as good mental health despite stressor exposure and measured as the inverse residual between actual and predicted symptom total score. Preregistered hypotheses (osf.io/r6btn) were tested with multiple regression models and mediation analyses. Results confirmed our primary hypothesis that positive appraisal style (PAS) is positively associated with resilience (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). The resilience factor PAS also partly mediated the positive association between perceived social support and resilience, and its association with resilience was in turn partly mediated by the ability to easily recover from stress (both pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). In comparison with other resilience factors, good stress response recovery and positive appraisal specifically of the consequences of the Corona crisis were the strongest factors. Preregistered exploratory subgroup analyses (osf.io/thka9) showed that all tested resilience factors generalize across major socio-demographic categories. This research identifies modifiable protective factors that can be targeted by public mental health efforts in this and in future pandemics.","Veer, Riepenhausen, Zerban, Wackerhagen, Puhlmann, Engen, KÃƒÂ¶ber, BÃƒÂ¶gemann, Weermeijer, UÃ…â€ºciÃ…â€ško, Mor, Marciniak, Askelund, Al-Kamel, Ayash, Barsuola, Bartkute-Norkuniene, Battaglia, Bobko, BÃƒÂ¶lte, Cardone, ChvojkovÃƒÂ¡, DamnjanoviÃ„â€¡, De Calheiros Velozo, de Thurah, Deza-Araujo, Dimitrov, Farkas, Feller, Gazea, Gilan, GnjidiÃ„â€¡, Hajduk, Hiekkaranta, Hofgaard, Ilen, Kasanova, Khanpour, Lau, Lenferink, Lindhardt, Magas, Mituniewicz, Moreno-LÃƒÂ³pez, Muzychka, Ntafouli, O'Leary, Paparella, PÃƒÂµldver, Rintala, Robak, RosickÃƒÂ¡, RÃƒÂ¸ysamb, Sadeghi, Schneider, Siugzdaite, StantiÃ„â€¡, Teixeira, Todorovic, Wan, van Dick, Lieb, Kleim, Hermans, KobyliÃ…â€žska, Hendler, Binder, Myin-Germeys, van Leeuwen, TÃƒÂ¼scher, Yuen, Walter, Kalisch","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-01150-4","20210124","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9820,""
"COVID-19: Causes of anxiety and wellbeing support needs of healthcare professionals in the UK: A cross-sectional survey","COVID-19 has caused acute changes in healthcare delivery; this may impact mental health and wellbeing needs of healthcare professionals (HCPs). We aimed to identify the causes of anxiety in HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic, to assess whether HCPs felt they had adequate mental health and wellbeing support and to identify their unmet support needs. We used a web-based survey utilising an online tool circulated to UK HCPs over 5 weeks. Self-perceived anxiety levels prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic were measured on a 10-point Likert-type rating scale. The survey was completed by 558 HCPs. During the pandemic, self-perceived anxiety scores significantly increased from a median of 2 to 7 (paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test; p&lt;0.001). The main reasons were concerns about exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and lack of personal protective equipment. Other wide-ranging reasons were identified. Only 41% of respondents felt there was adequate support. Thematic analysis of what support HCPs wanted identified 13 wide-ranging themes; including effective leadership and peer support. Anxiety levels in HCPs significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and the main causes were identified. Many HCPs felt there was inadequate support and identified what support they needed. Implementing effective strategies to support HCPs' unmet wellbeing needs are required as a matter of urgency.","Siddiqui, Aurelio, Gupta, Blythe, Khanji","https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0502","20210122","COVID-19; anxiety; healthcare professionals; mental health; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9821,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient preferences and decision-making for symptomatic urolithiasis","Pandemic restrictions have changed how patients approach symptomatic kidney stones. We used a mixed-methods, digital ethnographic approach to evaluate social media discussions about patient concerns and preferences for urolithiasis care during the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrospectively analyzed kidney stone-related discussions on a large social media platform using qualitative analysis and natural language processing-based sentiment analysis. Posts were mined for demographic details, treatments pursued, and health care encounters. Pre-COVID (1/1/2020-2/29/2020) and COVID (3/1/2020-6/1/2020) posts were extracted from the popular online Reddit discussion board, &quot;r/KidneyStones,&quot; which is dedicated to discussions related to urolithiasis. We extracted n=649 posts (250 pre-COVID, 399 COVID); 150 from each cohort underwent thematic analysis and data extraction. Quantitative sentiment analysis was performed on 418 posts (179 pre-COVID, 239 COVID) that described stone-related decision-making prior to intervention. Notable discussion themes during COVID focused on barriers to care and concerns about stone management. Discussants exhibited more negative and anxious tones during COVID, based on sentiment analysis (P&lt;0.01). Patient preferences shifted away from in-person visits and procedures (P&lt;0.001). Mean reported stone size among those visiting ER increased from 5.1 mm to 10.5 mm (P&lt;0.001). The proportion of discussants preferring conservative management with stones Ã¢â€°Â¥10 mm increased (12.5% pre-COVID versus 26% during COVID, P=0.002). Opioid mentions increased from 9% to 27% of posts (P&lt;0.001) and were most associated with conservative management discussions. Online discussion forums provide contemporaneous insight into patients' experiences during a time when traditional patient-centered research methodologies are limited due to social distancing. During the pandemic, patients with symptomatic kidney stones expressed anxiety regarding outpatient encounters and reluctance toward procedural intervention. Patients opted instead for at-home conservative treatment beyond clinical guidelines and reserved ER visits for larger stones, potentially causing self-harm. Opioid discussions proliferated, an alarming consequence of the pandemic.","Jiang, Osadchiy, Weinberger, Zheng, Owen, Leonard, Mills, Kachroo, Eleswarapu","https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2020.1141","20210122","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9822,""

"COVID-19 Anxiety-A Longitudinal Survey Study of Psychological and Situational Risks among Finnish Workers","<i>Background</i>: The COVID-19 crisis has changed the conditions of many all over the globe. One negative consequence of the ongoing pandemic is anxiety brought about by uncertainty and the COVID-19 disease. Increased anxiety is a potential risk factor for wellbeing at work. This study investigated psychological, situational, and socio-demographic predictors of COVID-19 anxiety using longitudinal data. <i>Methods</i>: A nationally representative sample of Finnish workers (<i>N</i> = 1308) was collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis. Eighty percent of the participants responded to the follow-up study (<i>N</i> = 1044). COVID-19 anxiety was measured with a modified Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Psychological and situational predictors included perceived loneliness, psychological distress, technostress, personality, social support received from the work community, and remote working. A number of socio-demographic factors were also investigated. <i>Results</i>: Perceived loneliness, psychological distress, technostress, and neuroticism were identified as robust psychological predictors of COVID-19 anxiety. Increase in psychological distress and technostress during the COVID-19 crisis predicted higher COVID-19 anxiety. A recent change in their field of work and decreased social support from work communities predicted COVID-19 anxiety. Women and young people experienced higher anxiety. <i>Conclusions</i>: Different factors explain workers' COVID-19 anxiety. Increased anxiety can disrupt wellbeing at work, emphasizing the organizations' role in maintaining an inclusive and caring work culture and providing technical and psychological support to workers during crisis.","Savolainen, Oksa, Savela, Celuch, Oksanen","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020794","20210122","COVID-19; anxiety; loneliness; mental health; personality; stress; work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9824,""
"A qualitative analysis of nursing students' tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 outbreak has profoundly changed daily life and the ways in which students learn and interact. This study explores the nature and content of tweets posted by students enrolled in nursing programs (hereafter nursing students) in the United Kingdom, the United States, and South Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic between March 4 and April 7, 2020. A total of 8856 tweets from the Twitter accounts of 95 self-identified nursing students were included in our qualitative analysis. The findings revealed five categories of tweet content: (i) reactions to COVID-19; (ii) everyday life; (iii) role as a student; (iv) social connections; and (v) sociopolitical issues. Students shared concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their education, discussed their experiences as nursing students, tweeted details of their daily lives, and sought social connections for support as well as for information sharing. The findings of this study can inform nurse educators to better understand their students' responses to and sentiments about the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurse educators should incorporate this understanding into curricula for pandemic preparedness and response efforts.","De Gagne, Cho, Park, Nam, Jung","https://doi.org/10.1111/nhs.12809","20210122","COVID-19; Twitter; mental health; nursing students; pandemics; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9825,""
"The Effect of a Name-Based Mask Rationing Plan in Taiwan on Public Anxiety Regarding a Mask Shortage During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Study","The COVID-19 pandemic is a severe global health crisis. Wearing a mask is a straightforward action that can be taken, but shortage of stock and equity of allocation were important issues in Taiwan. Furthermore, increased anxiety leading to the stockpiling of masks has been common during the pandemic. We aim to summarize the name-based mask rationing plan implemented in Taiwan and explore the public's perceived anxiety about mask shortages. The government of Taiwan took action to control the supply and allocation of face masks. We summarize the timeline and important components of the mask rationing plan. A survey that aimed to investigate the overall response to the mask rationing plan was answered by 44 participants. The mask rationing plan was implemented in late January 2020. Daily production capacity was increased from 2 million masks to 16 million masks in April 2020. People could buy 9 masks in 14 days by verification via their National Health Insurance card. Digital face mask availability maps were created. Moreover, the mask plan safeguarded the purchase of masks and resulted in decreased anxiety about a mask shortage (4.05 [SD 1.15] points; 72.7% [n=32] of participants answered &quot;agree&quot; or &quot;strongly agree&quot;). The majority of people felt that the mask plan was satisfactory (4.2 [SD 0.92] points; 79.5% [n=35] of participants answered &quot;agree&quot; or &quot;strongly agree&quot;). We found that the unique name-based mask rationing plan allowed for control of the production and supply of masks, and contributed to the appropriate allocation of masks. The mask rationing plan not only provided the public with physical protection, but also resulted in reduced anxiety about mask shortages during the pandemic.","Tai, Chi, Chiu, Tseng, Huang, Lin","https://doi.org/10.2196/21409","20210122","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Taiwan; anxiety; coronavirus; crisis; mask; mental health; novel coronavirus; observational; plan; rationing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9826,""

"Is rurality, area deprivation, access to outside space and green space associated with mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic? A cross sectional study from the Covid-19 Health and Adherence Research in Scotland (CHARIS) project","Objectives To determine if rurality, area deprivation, access to outside space (Study 1) and frequency of visiting and duration in green space (Study 2) are associated with mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic. Design Serial, weekly, nationally representative, cross-sectional, observational study of randomly selected adults in Scotland during June and July 2020. Methods If available, validated instruments were used to measure psychological distress, individual demographics and illness beliefs and the following environments: rurality, area deprivation, access to residential outside space, frequency of visiting, and duration in green space. Simple linear regressions followed by examination of moderation effect. Results 2969 participants in Study 1, of which, 1765 (59.6%) female, 349 (11.9%) in the shielding category, median age 54 years. 502 participants in Study 2, of which, 295 (58.60%) female, 58 (11.6%) in shielding category, median age 53 years. Direct effects show that psychological distress was worse if: younger, female, in shielding category (demographics), worse illness (Covid-19) representations and greater threat perception (illness beliefs), if urban, in a deprived area, no access to or sharing residential outside space, and fewer visits to green space (environment). Moderation analyses show that environment amplify the direct effects of the individual factors on psychological distress. Conclusions Environment is important for mental health during pandemics and this study offers pointers for public health and for environmental planning, design and management, including housing design and public open space provision and regulation.","Gill Hubbard et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46110-0F2-B7D","20210125","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology|Natural Environments; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9828,""
"A systematic review on sex- and gender-sensitive research in public mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis","Background Sex and gender are important modifiers of mental health and behavior in normal times and during crises. We investigated whether they were addressed by empirical, international research which explored the mental health and health behavior ramifications after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We systematically searched the databases PsyArXiv, PubMed, PsycInfo, Psyndex, PubPsych, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies assessing mental health outcomes (main outcomes) as well as potential risk and protective health behavior (additional outcomes) up to July 2, 2020. Findings Most of the 80 publications fulfilling the selection criteria reflected the static difference perspective treating sex and gender as dichotomous variables. The focus was on internalizing disorders (esp. anxiety and depression) burdening women in particular, while externalizing disorders were neglected. Sex- and gender-specific evaluation of mental health care use has also been lacking. With respect to unfavorable health behavior in terms of adherence to prescribed protective measures, men constitute a risk group. Interpretations Women remain a vulnerable group burdened by multiple stresses and mental health symptoms. The neglect of sex and gender-specific evaluation of aggression-related disorders, substance addiction, and mental health care use in the early stage represents a potentially dangerous oversight.","Ana Nanette Tibubos et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46119-B62-858","20210124","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; public mental health; sex; covid-19; mental health; health behavior; gender","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-25","",9829,""
