"Eating disorders in times of the COVID-19 pandemic-Results from an online survey of patients with anorexia nervosa","The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting public restrictions pose a psychological burden for humans worldwide and may be particularly detrimental for individuals with mental disorders. Therefore, the current study explored effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating disorder (ED) symptoms and other psychological aspects in former inpatients with anorexia nervosa (AN). One-hundred and fifty-nine patients with AN-discharged from inpatient treatment in 2019-completed an online survey on contact history with COVID-19, changes in ED symptoms and other psychological aspects, health care utilization, and strategies patients employed to cope during the pandemic. Approximately 70% of patients reported that eating, shape and weight concerns, drive for physical activity, loneliness, sadness, and inner restlessness increased during the pandemic. Access to in-person psychotherapies and visits at the general practitioner (including weight checks) decreased by 37% and 46%, respectively. Videoconference therapy was used by 26% and telephone contacts by 35% of patients. Patients experienced daily routines, day planning and enjoyable activities as the most helpful among the most used coping strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic poses great challenges to patients with AN. ED-related thoughts and behaviors may be used as dysfunctional coping mechanisms to regain control over the current circumstances. E-mental health interventions appear to be promising for supporting AN patients during these hard times. Furthermore, interventions addressing symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as intolerance of uncertainty might help them manage their ED symptoms.","Schlegl, Maier, Meule, Voderholzer","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23374","20200825","COVID-19 pandemic; anorexia nervosa; coping strategies; health care utilization; symptoms worsening","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-26","",4126,""

"COVID-19 Is Straining Mental Health-Could Technology Be the Answer?","One of the most pernicious side effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is a steep rise in stress and mental health problems. According to a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, nearly half of American adults say that worry and stress about the pandemic is hurting their mental health [1]. There are plenty of factors feeding into this phenomenon. People are anxious about getting sick, grieving lost loved ones, and experiencing financial stress, parental stress, and loneliness. The pandemic places additional burdens on essential workers and people of color, both of whom are at greater risk of dying from the disease. COVID-19 itself has been linked to neurological problems as well as anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders [2].","Allen","https://doi.org/10.1109/MPULS.2020.3008355","20200825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-26","",4128,""
"Pain Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Chronic pain management during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenging process, especially with growing evidence that COVID-19 infection is associated with myalgias, referred pain, and widespread hyperalgesia. In light of the limited data available for COVID-19-related impact on chronic pain patients, this review explores the changes in the healthcare delivery system due to social distancing and safety precautions to provide the appropriate management of chronic pain patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding both the general problems facing chronic pain patients as well as specific problems in the COVID-19 era including deconditioning, increased mental health concerns, financial burdens, and potential for medication-induced immune-suppression is vital in the appropriate management of patients. Telemedicine, the practice of caring for patients remotely when the provider and patient are not physically present with each other, is becoming increasingly used and recognized as a valuable tool to both health care providers and patients. This paper concentrates on the proper utilization of the available resources to help patients with the most severe conditions as well as the most vulnerable group. COVID-19 may be associated with a profound effect on both the health care system and patients with chronic pain. As a result, delaying, or stopping, treatment for chronic pain patients will have negative consequences, and strong pain evaluations must be administered to triage patients appropriately. Recent recommendations for the safe use of non-opioid analgesics, opioid analgesics, and interventional pain management procedures are vital to know and understand specifically during the pandemic era. Further researches are needed to identify the advance planning and rapid responses to reduce the impact of the pandemic.","El-Tallawy, Nalamasu, Pergolizzi, Gharibo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40122-020-00190-4","20200825","COVID-19 pandemic; Interventional pain management; Pain management; Personal protective equipment (PPE); Systemic analgesics; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-26","",4129,""
"Rehabilitation of patients post-COVID-19 infection: a literature review","Rehabilitation is important for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Given the lack of guidelines in English on the rehabilitation of these patients, we conducted a review of the most recent reports. We performed this literature review using the principal research databases and included randomized trials, recommendations, quasi-randomized or prospective controlled clinical trials, reports, guidelines, field updates, and letters to the editor. We identified 107 studies in the database search, among which 85 were excluded after screening the full text or abstract. In total, 22 studies were finally included. The complexity of the clinical setting and the speed of spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which leads to rapid occupation of beds in the intensive care unit, make it necessary to discharge patients with COVID-19 who have mild symptoms as soon as possible. For these reasons, it is necessary to formulate rehabilitation programs for these patients, to help them restore physical and respiratory function and to reduce anxiety and depression, particularly patients with comorbidities and those who live alone or in rural settings, to restore a good quality of life.","Demeco, Marotta, Barletta, Pino, Marinaro, Petraroli, Moggio, Ammendolia","https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060520948382","20200825","Rehabilitation; coronavirus disease 2019; intensive care; physical function; respiratory function; review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-26","",4130,""
"Neurological manifestations of COVID-19: available evidences and a new paradigm","The recent pandemic outbreak of coronavirus is pathogenic and a highly transmittable viral infection caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). In this time of ongoing pandemic, many emerging reports suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 has inimical effects on neurological functions, and even causes serious neurological damage. The neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19 include headache, dizziness, depression, anosmia, encephalitis, stroke, epileptic seizures, and Guillain-Barre syndrome along with many others. The involvement of the CNS may be related with poor prognosis and disease worsening. Here, we review the evidence of nervous system involvement and currently known neurological manifestations in COVID-19 infections caused by SARS-CoV-2. We prioritize the 332 human targets of SARS-CoV-2 according to their association with brain-related disease and identified 73 candidate genes. We prioritize these 73 genes according to their spatio-temporal expression in the different regions of brain and also through evolutionary intolerance analysis. The prioritized genes could be considered potential indicators of COVID-19-associated neurological symptoms and thus act as a possible therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of CNS manifestations associated with COVID-19 patients.","Khatoon, Prasad, Kumar","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13365-020-00895-4","20200825","COVID-19; Gene enrichment; Gene prioritization; Neurological damage; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-26","",4131,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Psychiatric Emergency Department Visits - A Descriptive Study","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (COVID-19) has an important direct and indirect impact on both physical and mental health. We aim to describe the impact of an emergency state period due to COVID-19 on psychiatric emergency department (ED) visits. We conducted a retrospective observational study analysing all emergency visits occurring at a metropolitan psychiatric ED between March 19th and May 2nd 2019 and 2020 (the beginning/end date of the emergency state which Portugal was under due to COVID-19). Data regarding age, sex, diagnoses, admission date, discharge destiny and status were collected. Diagnoses were classified using the International Classification of Diseases version 9, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). There was a 52Ã‚Â·2% decrease on the number of psychiatric emergency visits during the emergency state period (n<sub>2020</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°780 vs n<sub>2019</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1633 episodes). The decrease on psychiatric ED visits was greater in the female sex and in the younger age groups. Episodes with a primary diagnosis of Mood disorders lead the decrease on psychiatric ED visits with 68Ã‚Â·3% less episodes. Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders was the diagnosis group with the smaller decline (9Ã‚Â·8% decrease). COVID-19 emergency state period had an important impact on the number and characteristics of psychiatric ED visits, reinforcing the great indirect effects of COVID-19 on mental health.","GonÃƒÂ§alves-Pinho, Mota, Ribeiro, Macedo, Freitas","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09837-z","20200825","Administrative database; Emergency service; Mental health; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-26","",4132,""
"SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Responses Correlate with Resolution of RNAemia But Are Short-Lived in Patients with Mild Illness","SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, particularly those preventing viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) interaction with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, could offer protective immunity, and may affect clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. We analyzed 625 serial plasma samples from 40 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 170 SARS-CoV-2-infected outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. Severely ill patients developed significantly higher SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses than outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. The development of plasma antibodies was correlated with decreases in viral RNAemia, consistent with potential humoral immune clearance of virus. Using a novel competition ELISA, we detected antibodies blocking RBD-ACE2 interactions in 68% of inpatients and 40% of outpatients tested. Cross-reactive antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV RBD were found almost exclusively in hospitalized patients. Outpatient and asymptomatic individuals' serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 decreased within 2 months, suggesting that humoral protection may be short-lived.","RÃƒÂ¶ltgen, Wirz, Stevens, Powell, Hogan, Najeeb, Hunter, Sahoo, Huang, Yamamoto, Manalac, Otrelo-Cardoso, Pham, Rustagi, Rogers, Shah, Blish, Cochran, Nadeau, Jardetzky, Zehnder, Wang, Kim, Gombar, Tibshirani, Pinsky, Boyd","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175794","20200825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-26","",4133,""
"How <i>ÃŽÂ¼</i> -Opioid Receptor Recognizes Fentanyl","The opioid crisis has escalated during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than half of the overdose-related deaths are related to synthetic opioids represented by fentanyl which is a potent agonist of mu-opioid receptor (mOR). In recent years, crystal structures of mOR complexed with morphine derivatives have been determined; however, structural basis of mOR activation by fentanyl-like synthetic opioids remains lacking. Exploiting the X-ray structure of mOR bound to a morphinan ligand and several state-of-the-art simulation techniques, including weighted ensemble and continuous constant pH molecular dynamics, we elucidated the detailed binding mechanism of fentanyl with mOR. Surprisingly, in addition to the orthosteric site common to morphinan opiates, fentanyl can move deeper and bind mOR through hydrogen bonding with a conserved histidine H297, which has been shown to modulate mOR's ligand affinity and pH dependence in mutagenesis experiments, but its precise role remains unclear. Intriguingly, the secondary binding mode is only accessible when H297 adopts a neutral HID tautomer. Alternative binding modes and involvement of tautomer states may represent general mechanisms in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-ligand recognition. Our work provides a starting point for understanding mOR activation by fentanyl analogs that are emerging at a rapid pace and assisting the design of safer analgesics to combat the opioid crisis. Current protein simulation studies employ standard protonation and tautomer states; our work demonstrates the need to move beyond the practice to advance our understanding of protein-ligand recognition.","Vo, Mahinthichaichan, Shen, Ellis","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.16.253013","20200825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-26","",4134,""
"Snapshot Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Wellness in Nonphysician Otolaryngology Health Care Workers: A National Study","Nonphysician health care workers are involved in high-risk patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic, placing them at high risk of mental health burden. The mental health impact of COVID-19 in this crucial population has not been studied thus far. Thus, the objective of this study is to assess the psychosocial well-being of these providers. National cross-sectional online survey (no control group). Academic otolaryngology programs in the United States. We distributed a survey to nonphysician health care workers in otolaryngology departments across the United States. The survey incorporated a variety of validated mental health assessment tools to measure participant burnout (Mini-Z assessment), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), distress (Impact of Event Scale), and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictive factors associated with these mental health outcomes. We received 347 survey responses: 248 (71.5%) nurses, 63 (18.2%) administrative staff, and 36 (10.4%) advanced practice providers. A total of 104 (30.0%) respondents reported symptoms of burnout; 241 (69.5%), symptoms of anxiety; 292 (84.1%), symptoms of at least mild distress; and 79 (22.8%), symptoms of depression. Upon further analysis, development of these symptoms was associated with factors such as occupation, practice setting, and case load. Frontline otolaryngology health care providers exhibit high rates of mental health complications, particularly anxiety and distress, in the wake of COVID-19. Adequate support systems must be put into place to address these issues.","Prasad, Civantos, Byrnes, Chorath, Poonia, Chang, Graboyes, Bur, Thakkar, Deng, Seth, Trosman, Wong, Laitman, Shah, Stubbs, Long, Choby, Rassekh, Thaler, Rajasekaran","https://doi.org/10.1177/2473974X20948835","20200825","COVID-19; aerosolization; health care workers; mental health; psychiatric distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-26","",4135,""

"Immediate and delayed psychological effects of province-wide lockdown and personal quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak in China","The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected public health and wellbeing. In response to the pandemic threat of the coronavirus epidemic, several countries, including China, adopted lockdown and quarantine policies, which may cause psychological distress. This study aimed to explore the psychological impact of province-wide lockdown and personal quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak in China as well as the corresponding risk factors and protective factors. We examined the immediate (2-week) and delayed (2-month) impact of province-wide lockdown and personal quarantine on psychological distress in a national sample of 1390 Chinese residents. No immediate impact of province-wide lockdown on psychological distress was observed, whereas personal quarantine increased individuals' anxiety, fear, and anger. Despite the lack of initial association, psychological distress increased among those in province-wide lockdown. Self-stigma and personal control both significantly moderated the association between lockdown and psychological distress, but in different directions. Those with higher self-stigma and lower personal control were more impacted by the lockdown. Government support moderated the impact of quarantine on psychological distress, but not that of lockdown. The delayed effects of lockdown and quarantine on psychological distress were observed, and self-stigma, social support, and perceived control moderate the relationships. This study is the first to demonstrate the psychological costs of province-wide lockdowns on individuals' mental health, providing evidence of the need for mitigation strategies and timely public mental health preparedness in countries with recent outbreaks of COVID-19.","Gan, Ma, Wu, Chen, Zhu, Hall","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720003116","20200825","COVID-19 outbreak; personal quarantine; province-wide lockdown; psychological distress; self-stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-26","",4137,""
