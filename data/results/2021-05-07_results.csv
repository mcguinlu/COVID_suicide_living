"Describing the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in people with psoriasis: findings from a global cross-sectional study","Background Indirect excess morbidity has emerged as a major concern in the COVID-19 pandemic. People with psoriasis may be particularly vulnerable to this because of prevalent anxiety and depression, multimorbidity and therapeutic use of immunosuppression. Objective Characterise the factors associated with worsening psoriasis in the COVID-19 pandemic, using mental health status (anxiety and depression) as the main exposure of interest. Methods Global cross-sectional study using a primary outcome of self-reported worsening of psoriasis. Individuals with psoriasis completed an online self-report questionnaire (PsoProtectMe; Psoriasis Patient Registry for Outcomes, Therapy and Epidemiology of COVID-19 Infection Me) between May 2020 and January 2021. Each individual completed a validated screen for anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression. Results 4,043 people with psoriasis (without COVID-19) from 86 countries self-reported to PsoProtectMe (mean age 47.2 years [SD 15.1]; mean BMI 27.6kg/m2 [SD 6.0], 2,684 [66.4%] female and 3,016 [74.6%] of white European ethnicity). 1,728 (42.7%) participants (1322 [77%] female) reported worsening of their psoriasis in the pandemic. A positive screen for anxiety or depression associated with worsening psoriasis in age and gender adjusted (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.77-2.36), and fully adjusted (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.72-2.34) logistic regression models. Female sex, obesity, shielding behaviour and systemic immunosuppressant non-adherence also associated with worsening psoriasis. The commonest reason for non-adherence was concern regarding complications related to COVID-19. Conclusions These data indicate an association between poor mental health and worsening psoriasis in the pandemic. Access to holistic care including psychological support may mitigate potentially long-lasting effects of the pandemic on health outcomes in psoriasis. The study also highlights an urgent need to address patient concerns about immunosuppressant-related risks, which may be contributing to non-adherence.","Satveer K Mahil; Mark Yates; Zenas Z Yiu; Sinead M Langan; Teresa Tsakok; Nick Dand; Kayleigh J Mason; Helen McAteer; Freya Meynall; Bolaji Coker; Alexandra Vincent; Dominic Urmston; Amber Vesty; Jade Kelly; Camille Lancelot; Lucy Moorhead; Herve Bachelez; Francesca Capon; Claudia R Contreras; Claudia De La Cruz; Paola Di Meglio; Paolo Gisondi; Denis Jullien; Jo Lambert; Luigi Naldi; Sam Norton; Luis Puig; Phyllis Spuls; Tiago Torres; Richard B Warren; Hoseah Waweru; John Weinman; Matt A Brown; James B Galloway; Christopher M Griffiths; Jonathan N Barker; Catherine H Smith","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.04.21256507","20210506","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13520,""
"Disordered eating and self-harm as risk factors for poorer mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A population-based cohort study","BackgroundYoung adults and especially those with pre-existing mental health conditions, such as disordered eating and self-harm, appear to be at greater risk of developing metal health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear whether this increased risk is affected by any changes in lockdown restrictions, and whether any lifestyle changes could moderate this increased risk.

MethodsIn a longitudinal UK population-based cohort (The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, ALSPAC) we assessed the relationship between pre-pandemic measures of disordered eating and self-harm and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2,657 young adults. Regression models examined the relationship between self-reported disordered eating, self-harm, and both disordered eating and self-harm at age 25 years and depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and mental wellbeing during a period of eased restrictions in the COVID-19 pandemic (May-July 2020) when participants were aged 27-29 years. Analyses were adjusted for sex, questionnaire completion date, pre-pandemic socioeconomic disadvantage and pre-pandemic mental health and wellbeing. We also examined whether lifestyle changes (sleep, exercise, alcohol, visiting green space, eating, talking with family/friends, hobbies, relaxation) in the initial UK lockdown (April-May 2020) moderated these associations.

ResultsPre-existing disordered eating, self-harm and comorbid disordered eating and self-harm were all associated with the reporting of a higher frequency of depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms, and poorer mental wellbeing during the pandemic compared to individuals without disordered eating and self-harm. Associations remained when adjusting for pre-pandemic mental health measures. There was little evidence that interactions between disordered eating and self-harm exposures and lifestyle change moderators affected pandemic mental health and wellbeing.

ConclusionsYoung adults with pre-pandemic disordered eating, self-harm and comorbid disordered eating and self-harm are at increased risk for developing symptoms of depression, anxiety and poor mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic, even when accounting for pre-pandemic mental health. Lifestyle changes during the pandemic do not appear to alter this risk. A greater focus on rapid and responsive service provision is essential to reduce the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of these already vulnerable individuals.

Plain English summaryThe aim of this project was to explore the mental health of young adults with disordered eating behaviours (such as fasting, vomiting/taking laxatives, binge-eating and excessive exercise) and self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed data from an established study that has followed children from birth (in 1991 and 1992) up to present day, including during the pandemic when participants were 28 years old. We looked at the relationship between disordered eating and/or self-harm behaviours from before the pandemic and mental health problems (symptoms of depression and anxiety) and mental wellbeing during the pandemic. We also explored whether there were any lifestyle changes (such as changes in sleep, exercise, visiting green space) that might be linked to better mental health and wellbeing in young adults with disordered eating and self-harm. We found that young adults with prior disordered eating and/or self-harm had more symptoms of depression and anxiety, and worse mental wellbeing than individuals without prior disordered eating or self-harm. However, lifestyle changes did not appear to affect mental health and wellbeing in these young adults. Our findings suggest that people with a history of disordered eating and/or self-harm are at high risk for developing mental health problems during the pandemic, and they will need help from mental health services.","Naomi Warne; Jon Heron; Becky Mars; Alex Siu Fung Kwong; Francesca Solmi; Rebecca Pearson; Paul Moran; Helen Bould","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.30.21256377","20210504","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13521,""
"Withanone Ameliorates Stress Symptoms in Caenorhabditis Elegans by Acting through Serotonin Receptors","Depression is responsible for 800Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 deaths worldwide, a number that will rise significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Affordable novel drugs with less severe side effects are urgently required. We investigated the effect of withanone (WN) from Withania somnifera on the serotonin system of wild-type and knockout Caenorhabditis elegans strains using in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods. WN or fluoxetine (as positive control drug) was administered to wild-type (N2) and knockout C. elegans strains (AQ866, DA1814, DA2100, DA2109, and MT9772) to determine their effect on oxidative stress (Trolox, H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA, and juglone assays) on osmotic stress and heat stress and lifespan. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was applied to investigate the effect of WN or fluoxetine on the expression of serotonin receptors (<i>ser-1, ser-4, ser-7</i>) and serotonin transporter (<i>mod-5</i>). The binding affinity of WN to serotonin receptors and transporter was analyzed in silico using AutoDock 4.2.6. WN scavenged ROS in wild-type and knockout C. elegans and prolonged their lifespan. WN upregulated the expression of serotonin receptor and transporter genes. In silico analyses revealed high binding affinities of WN to Ser-1, Ser-4, Ser-7, and Mod-5. Further studies are needed to prove whether the results from C. elegans are transferrable to mammals and human beings. WN ameliorated depressive-associated stress symptoms by activating the serotonin system. WN may serve as potential candidate in developing new drugs to treat depression.","NaÃƒÅ¸, Efferth","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1349-3870","20210506","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13522,""
"Mindfulness Effects in Obstetric and Gynecology Patients During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Randomized Controlled Trial","To assess the effect of a consumer-based mobile meditation application (app) on wellness in outpatient obstetric and gynecology patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We conducted a randomized controlled trial at a university outpatient clinic of obstetric and gynecology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women were randomly assigned to the intervention group, who was prescribed a mobile meditation app for 30 days, or the control group, which received standard care. The primary outcome was self-reported perceived stress. Secondary outcomes included self-reported depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and satisfaction with the meditation app. A sample size of 80 participants (40 per group) was calculated to achieve 84% power to detect a 3-point difference in the primary outcome. From April to May 2020, 101 women were randomized in the study-50 in the meditation app group and 51 in the control group. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Most characteristics were similar between groups. Perceived stress was significantly less in the intervention group at days 14 and 30 (mean difference 4.27, 95% CI 1.30-7.24, P=.005, d=0.69 and mean difference 4.28, 95% CI 1.68-6.88, P=.002, d=0.69, respectively). Self-reported depression and anxiety were significantly less in the intervention group at days 14 and 30 (depression: P=.002 and P=.04; anxiety: P=.01, and P=.04, respectively). Sleep disturbance was significantly less in the intervention group at days 14 and 30 (P=.001 and P=.02, respectively). More than 80% of those in the intervention group reported high satisfaction with the meditation app, and 93% reported that mindfulness meditation improved their stress. Outpatient obstetric and gynecology patients who used the prescribed consumer-based mobile meditation app during the COVID-19 pandemic had significant reductions in perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance compared with standard care.

"The Covid 19 outbreak: Maternal Mental Health and Associated Factors","Evaluation of the mental health of pregnant women during the early and peak stages of the Covid-19 outbreak DESIGN: Online survey PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women over the age of 18 years with no mental disorder during the pre-pregnancy period (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 729). Mental disorders were assessed using the &quot;Depression Anxiety Stress Scale&quot; and social support was determined using the &quot;Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale.&quot; Pregnant women had moderate levels of anxiety and depression and mild levels of stress. Anxiety, depression, and stress of moderate or high severity was reported in 62.2%, 44.6%, and 32.2% of the women, respectively. Pregnant women who lost their jobs during the pandemic period showed a 3-fold increase in the risk of anxiety, a 6-fold increase in the risk of depression, and a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of stress. An increase in the perception of social support has protective effects against all three mental disorders during pregnancy. In pregnant women with at least one obstetric risk, the risk of antenatal anxiety is 2 times higher than that in women with no risk. Similarly, women with a chronic physical illness before pregnancy have a higher risk of anxiety during pregnancy than healthy women. Financial strain has predictive value for anxiety and depression, and advanced age is a predictor for depression. The incidence of mental disorders in pregnant women during the pandemic period was much higher than that during the pre-pandemic period. The high frequency of antenatal mental disorders can lead to an increase in the frequency of obstetric and maternal complications in the short and long term. Early detection of inadequate social support and economic difficulties of pregnant women during the pandemic period is recommended for protecting their mental health. Pregnant women should have easy access to psychosocial support, and they should be provided obstetric counseling during the pandemic conditions.","Koyucu, Karaca","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2021.103013","20210506","Anxiety; Coronavirus; Depression; Pandemics; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13524,""
"Risk Factors For Infection And Health Impacts Of The Covid-19 Pandemic In People With Autoimmune Diseases","People with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions taking immunomodulatory/suppressive medications may have higher risk of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chronic disease care has also changed for many patients, with uncertain downstream consequences. We included participants with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions followed by specialists at Johns Hopkins. Participants completed periodic surveys querying comorbidities, disease-modifying medications, exposures, COVID-19 testing and outcomes, social behaviors, and disruptions to healthcare. We assessed whether COVID-19 risk is higher among those on immunomodulating or suppressive agents and characterized pandemic-associated changes to care and mental health. 265 (5.6%) developed COVID-19 over 9 months of follow-up (April-December 2020). Patient characteristics (age, race, comorbidity, medications) were associated with differences in social distancing behaviors during the pandemic. Glucocorticoid exposure was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 in models incorporating behavior and other potential confounders (OR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.08, 1.89). Other medication classes were not associated with COVID-19 risk. Diabetes (OR: 1.72; 95%CI: 1.08, 2.73), cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.24, 2.28), and kidney disease (OR: 1.76; 95%CI: 1.04, 2.97) were associated with higher odds of COVID-19. Of the 2156 reporting pre-pandemic utilization of infusion, mental health or rehabilitative services, 975 (45.2%) reported disruptions therein, which disproportionately affected individuals experiencing changes to employment or income. Glucocorticoid exposure may increase risk of COVID-19 in people with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Disruption to healthcare and related services was common. Those with pandemic-related reduced income may be most vulnerable to care disruptions.","Fitzgerald, Mecoli, Douglas, Harris, Aravidis, Albayda, Sotirchos, Hoke, Orbai, Petri, Christopher-Stine, Baer, Paik, Adler, Tiniakou, Timlin, Bhargava, Newsome, Venkatesan, Chaudhry, Lloyd, Pardo, Stern, Lazarev, Truta, Saidha, Chen, Sharp, Gilotra, Kasper, Gelber, Bingham, Shah, Mowry","https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab407","20210506","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13525,""

"COVID-19 impact on employee flourishing: Parental stress as mediator","<i>Objectives:</i> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has adversely affected the global community's economic, social, emotional, and physical well-being. Although prior research works have rigorously explored the adverse effects of COVID-19 on mental health, investigations linking the impact of COVID-19 with parental stress and flourishing are very scarce. Rooted in boundary theory, the authors examined the influence of COVID-19 on flourishing and parental stress, respectively. Furthermore, predicated on spillover theory, the study explored the mediating effect of parental stress. <i>Method:</i> In this research, 259 IT employees in India were prospectively followed from the second week until the twentieth week of lockdown as part of a longitudinal population. A three-stage data collection method was employed. The employee completed the COVID-19 impact scale in the 2nd and 10th week of lockdown in India. Subsequently, the authors administered parental stress and flourishing surveys online in the 20th week. <i>Results:</i> Findings revealed that COVID-19 negatively impacted employee flourishing, via parental stress that had a partial mediating effect. <i>Conclusion:</i> This study is the first of its kind to theoretically and empirically investigate the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on employees' flourishing via parental stress. Based on the findings, the organizations can enhance their employees' flourishing by providing the autonomy to control their work time, and adequate training to better handle COVID-19 impact and parental stress to have better and sustainable human resources.

"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare providers: save the frontline fighters","The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare providers (HCPs) at personal and professional levels. This was a cross-sectional descriptive study. It was conducted using an electronic format survey through Qualtrics Survey Software in English. The target participants were HCPs working in any healthcare setting across Iraq. The survey was distributed via two professional Facebook groups between 7 April and 7 May 2020. The survey items were adopted with modifications from three previous studies of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Avian Influenza Outbreak. Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to determine the difference in the pandemic impact according to the dealing with COVID-19 cases. The authors received 430 surveys from HCPs representing 14 provinces. Approximately 60% of the participants were dealing with diagnosis or treatment of COVID-19 cases. More than 80% perceived high risk of infection and stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, 85.9% of the HCPs had concerns of putting family and close friends at risk due to their job during the COVID-19 crisis. HCPs working in a setting dealing with diagnosis/treatment of COVID-19 cases experienced significantly higher concerns about personal and family safety compared with other HCPs. Working during COVID-19 pandemic has several negative impacts on HCPs including mental and physical health and an overwhelming work environment. Thus, social and emotional support is needed to help HCPs to cope with such stressful conditions. Finally, providing adequate PPE can help to minimise concerns of getting infected in the workplace.","Al-Jumaili, Al-Fatlawi, Al-Jalehawi, Al-Hamadani, Alsawad","https://doi.org/10.1093/ijpp/riab018","20210506","COVID-19; healthcare providers; impact; mental Health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13528,""
"Changes in Emergency Medical Services before and during COVID-19 in the United States, January 2018-December 2020","As a result of the continuing surge of COVID-19, many patients have delayed or missed routine screening and preventive services. Medical conditions, such as coronary heart disease, mental health issues, and substance use disorder, may be identified later, leading to increases in patient morbidity and mortality. The National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) data were used to assess 911 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) activations during 2018-2020. For specific activation types, the percentage of total activations was calculated per week and joinpoint analysis was used to identify changes over time. Since March 2020, the number of 911 emergency medical services (EMS) activations has decreased, while the percentages of on-scene death, cardiac arrest, and opioid use/overdose EMS activations were higher than pre-pandemic levels. During the early pandemic period, percentages of total EMS activations increased for on-scene death (from 1.3% to 2.4% during weeks 11-15), cardiac arrest (from 1.3% to 2.2% during weeks 11-15), and opioid use/overdose (from 0.6% to 1.1% during weeks 8-18); the percentages then declined, but remained above pre-pandemic levels through calendar week 52. The COVID-19 pandemic has indirect consequences, such as relative increases in EMS activations for cardiac events and opioid use/overdose, possibly linked to disruptions is healthcare access and health-seeking behaviors. Increasing telehealth visits or other opportunities for patient-provider touch points for chronic disease and substance use disorders that emphasize counseling, preventive care, and expanded access to medications can disrupt delayed care-seeking during the pandemic and potentially prevent premature death.","Handberry, Bull-Otterson, Dai, Mann, Chaney, Ratto, Horiuchi, Siza, Kulkarni, Gundlapalli, Boehmer","https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab373","20210506","COVID-19; Cardiac Events; Emergency Medical Service; Opioid Use Disorder; Risk Perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13529,""
"Description and analysis of primary care-based COVID-19 interventions in Colombia","The COVID-19 pandemic was declared in early 2020, requiring different prevention and intervention measures on a large scale. In the case of Colombia, a series of measures focused on isolation and remote services provision were introduced in a context marked by health inequities. This article reviews the theoretical and normative references on primary care interventions in the Colombian response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A literature review was conducted in PubMed, LILACS, MEDLINE, and official documents and regulations issued in Colombia, the World Health Organization, and the Pan American Health Organization. A narrative synthesis was done of 33 documents based on their contribution to the implementation of primary care in Colombia and their role in the pandemic. The information was organized into two categories: Actions taken in Colombia in response to COVID-19 and Opportunities in primary care in response to COVID-19. Colombias actions were contrasted with world experience. Better pandemic control was found in countries that adopted primary care as a response. Primary care has strengthened the handling of the pandemic through community action, the provision of coordinated services, mental health inclusion, and the adoption of telemedicine processes. In Colombia, primary care is presented as an opportunity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and the problems and needs derived from this situation. However, despite the above, there is resistance in the country to adopt this type of approach and complement the hospital-centric model to face the pandemic.

"Multiplexed Centrifugal Microfluidic System for Dynamic Solid-Phase Purification of Polynucleic Acids Direct from Buccal Swabs","This report describes the development of a centrifugally controlled microfluidic dynamic solid-phase extraction (dSPE) platform to reliably obtain amplification-ready nucleic acids (NAs) directly from buccal swab cuttings. To our knowledge, this work represents the first centrifugal microdevice for comprehensive preparation of high-purity NAs from raw buccal swab samples. Direct-from-swab cellular lysis was integrated upstream of NA extraction, and automatable laser-controlled on-board microvalving strategies provided the strict spatiotemporal fluidic control required for practical point-of-need use. Solid-phase manipulation during extraction leveraged the application of a bidirectional rotating magnetic field to promote thorough interaction with the sample (e.g., NA capture). We illustrate the broad utility of this technology by establishing downstream compatibility of extracted nucleic acids with three noteworthy assays, namely, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The PCR-readiness of the extracted DNA was confirmed by generating short tandem repeat (STR) profiles following multiplexed amplification. With no changes to assay workflow, viral RNA was successfully extracted from contrived (spiked) SARS-CoV-2 swab samples, confirmed by RT-qPCR. Finally, we demonstrate the compatibility of the extracted DNA with LAMP-a technique well suited for point-of-need genetic analysis due to minimal hardware requirements and compatibility with colorimetric readout. We describe an automatable, portable microfluidic platform for the nucleic acid preparation device that could permit practical, in situ use by nontechnical personnel.","Dignan, Woolf, Tomley, Nauman, Landers","https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c00842","20210506","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13531,""
"Eating behaviour and symptom trajectories in patients with a history of binge eating disorder during COVID-19 pandemic","A history of an eating disorder (ED) might constitute a risk for symptom deterioration and relapse during COVID-19 pandemic. This longitudinal study investigates ED symptom trajectories until the first COVID-19 lockdown in Spring 2020 in patients with a history of binge eating disorder (BED). Participants of the randomised-controlled BED treatment trial IMPULS participated in a re-assessment directly after the first COVID-19 lockdown in Germany. We used expert-rated clinical interviews and self-report to investigate binge eating (BE) frequency, ED and general psychopathology, distress, emotion regulation and sense of coherence. Symptom trajectories were analysed for baseline when entering the trial, end of trial participation and the time point directly after lockdown. BE frequency was assessed on a recall basis for 4 weeks directly before lockdown and 4 weeks during lockdown. BE frequency, general ED pathology and depressive symptoms markedly increased after as compared to before the COVID-19 outbreak. Individuals scoring high on reappraisal as emotion regulation strategy and sense of coherence scored lower on general ED pathology. Individuals with a history of an ED are at risk for symptom deterioration and relapse during the pandemic. Intervention and service dissemination strategies are needed to support vulnerable groups throughout the pandemic.","Giel, Schurr, Zipfel, Junne, Schag","https://doi.org/10.1002/erv.2837","20210506","COVID-19; binge eating; eating disorder; pandemic; psychopathology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13532,""
"Triangle of COVID, anxiety and menstrual cycle","This study aimed to examine whether the menstrual cycles of women with regular cycles have been affected by the COVID 19 pandemic. This cross-sectional online survey study evaluated the menstrual cycle characteristics of women in the reproductive phase of their lives during the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. Changes before and after COVID-19 were evaluated with a paired sample <i>t</i>-test and chi-square test. A Pearson correlation test was used to show the relationships between variables. The study was completed with 263 participants in total. The average age of the participants was 26.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.9 (18-45). Participants' duration of period (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.003) and pads used per day (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.002) decreased compared to their experience before the COVID-19 outbreak. The mean total MSQ score was 3.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.8 (0-4), mean STAI-1 score was 45.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9 (20-78) and mean STAI-II score was 43.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.9 (30-69). It was found that STAI-I and STAI-II scores showed a positive correlation with MSQ-Somatic subgroup scores(<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.153, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.013; 0.190, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.002) and MSQ-Total scores (0.144, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.020; 0.175, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.004). With the COVID-19 pandemic, increased anxiety scores increased women's menstrual symptoms while the length of periods and the number of pads used decreased.Impact statement<b>What is already known on this subject?</b> The COVID 19 pandemic, has caused enormous psychological distress potentially resulting in the development of posttraumatic stress disorder. The menstrual cycle is a process that can be affected by psychological stress.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> This is the first study to examine the relationship between stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the menstrual cycle. The increases in the degree of anxiety and stress as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak was found to be high enough to affect the characteristics of the menstrual cycle in the women surveyed.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research</b>? In a prospective study intended to be carried out after the outbreak ends in the future, it will be possible to evaluate whether the menstrual cycle parameters return to their former order and consequently this hypothesis will be able to be more definitively confirmed.","Demir, Sal, Comba","https://doi.org/10.1080/01443615.2021.1907562","20210506","Anxiety; COVID-19; menstrual cycle; outbreak; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13533,""
"Adolescents and opioid-related outcomes amidst the COVID-19 pandemic","Morbidity and mortality attributable to opioid use and misuse among adolescents and young adults are evident. Although recent trend data suggest a decrease in both opioid misuse and opioid use disorder among adolescents and young adults in the last few years, overdose cases continue to rise. The opioid epidemic among this population is complex and has a different profile compared to adults, with family facilitating exposure to opioids more often than other sources. Additionally, despite recommendations by experts to initiate medications for opioid use disorder, few initiate treatment. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many facets of daily life and its effects on the opioid crisis are largely unknown. Stay-at-home mandates resulting in online schooling and limited social interaction has had deleterious consequences for adolescents, especially their mental health. This viewpoint attempts to explore the effects of the pandemic on the opioid crisis in this vulnerable population.","Romero, Young","https://doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2021.1916420","20210506","Adolescents; COVID-19; opioids","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13534,""
"Cutting edge selection: learning from high reliability organisations for virtual recruitment in surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic","National selection for higher surgical training (ST3+) recruitment in the UK is competitive. The process must prioritise patient safety while being credible, impartial and fair. During the COVID-19 pandemic, all face-to-face interviews were cancelled. Selection was based on a controversial isolated self-assessment score with no evidence checking taking place. From 2021, selection will take place entirely online. Although this has cost and time advantages, new challenges emerge. We review surgical selection as it transitions to an online format and suggest validated methods that could be adapted from High Reliability Organisations (HRO). Virtual selection methods include video interviewing, online examinations and aptitude testing. These tools have been used in business for many years, but their predictive value in surgery is largely unknown. In healthcare, the established online Multi-Specialty Recruitment Assessment (MSRA) examines generic professional capabilities. Its scope, however, is too limited to be used in isolation. Candidates and interviewers alike may have concerns about the technical aspects of virtual recruitment. The significance of human factors must not be overlooked in the online environment. Surgery can learn from HROs, such as aviation. Pilot and air traffic control selection is integral to ensuring safety. These organisations have already established digital selection methods for psychological aptitude, professional capabilities and manual dexterity. National selection for higher surgical training (ST3+) can learn from HROs, using validated methods to prioritise patient safety while being acceptable to candidates, trainers and health service recruiters.","Hardie, Green, Bor, Brennan","https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2021.0034","20210506","COVID-19; Human factors; Online; Selection; Training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13535,""
"Psychological Distress, Relationship Quality, and Well-Being Among Malaysian Couples During the COVID-19 Pandemic","With the imposition of the Movement Control Order (MCO) or lockdown due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there are drastic changes in the movement and activity among Malaysians: increased psychological distress due to perception of COVID-19 as a health threat, increased time spent with families, and decreased time away from home could either intensify relationship problems or draw families closer to each other. This study aimed to examine the perceived psychological distress and relationship quality among couples before and during MCO in Malaysia and factors predictive of participants' well-being. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Perceived Relationship Quality Component Inventory, and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale were disseminated through the snowball sampling technique. The study found that the participants (N = 124) perceived significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress during MCO compared with before MCO. However, no significant differences between the couples were found before and during MCO in relationship quality, except in the trust subscale. Trust on the couple was higher during MCO. Multiple regression results showed that depression and stress predicted participants' well-being negatively during MCO. In contrast, total relationship quality, sexual relationship quality, satisfaction, and trust predicted participants' well-being positively.","Chua, Siau, Fitriana, Low, Abdul Wahab Khan","https://doi.org/10.1177/10105395211014322","20210506","COVID-19 pandemic; movement control order; psychological distress; relationship quality; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13536,""
"Mental health status of Italian elderly subjects during and after quarantine for the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional and longitudinal study","The elderly are more vulnerable to COVID-19 and therefore need to adopt long-term social distancing measures. The duration of quarantine impacts the psychological status of the general population. However, until now no study has explored the psychological impact of the pandemic and quarantine together with longitudinal changes in the mental health status of Italian elderly. An online questionnaire including an assessment of depression, anxiety, anger, post-traumatic stress, subjective cognitive failures, resilience, coping style, and other dimensions related to the pandemic was completed by participants during (T0) and two months after the end (T1) of the quarantine. The sample recruited at T0 included 334 elderly participants. About 45% of the participants experienced depression, anxiety, or anger. Moreover, more fear of getting infected was related to more severe depression, anxiety, and anger, but resilience was found to mediate these relationships. More severe depressive and anger symptoms were related to more severe cognitive failures. No significant difference was observed in mental health scores between T0 and T1. Finally, more severe depression at T0 was associated with the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms at T1. The fear of getting infected, probably due to perceived vulnerability to disease, seems to play a crucial role in the development of psychological symptoms in the elderly, but resilience seems to mediate the impact of fear. The presence of long-term psychological consequences and the possible risk of developing PTS symptoms in the elderly suggest the need for targeted interventions to reduce possible long-term psychological and cognitive consequences.","Maggi, Baldassarre, Barbaro, Cavallo, Cropano, Nappo, Santangelo","https://doi.org/10.1111/psyg.12703","20210506","COVID-19; cognitive failures; elderly; longitudinal changes; mental health; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13537,""
"COVID-19 lockdown and poor sleep quality: Not the whole story","A growing body of evidence consistently describes the side-effects of coronavirus disease 2019 lockdown on mental health and sleep quality. We conducted a longitudinal web-based survey of 217 Italian participants at two time points: lockdown and subsequent follow-up. To thoroughly investigate lockdown-related changes in sleep quality, we first evaluated variations in overall sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. We then examined sleep changes in specific components of sleep quality. Results revealed a clear dissociation of sleep effects, as a function of the specific domain considered, with longer sleep latency, worse sleep efficiency, and massive sleep medication use during forced confinement. On the other hand, we simultaneously observed an increased sleep duration and better daytime functioning. Our present findings highlight the importance of an accurate examination of sleep quality during lockdown, as the effects were not uniform across populations and different sleep domains.","Alfonsi, Gorgoni, Scarpelli, Zivi, Sdoia, Mari, Fraschetti, Ferlazzo, Giannini, De Gennaro","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13368","20210506","COVID-19 lockdown; gender bias; sleep components; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13538,""
"Phases of psychological response in COVID-19: A preliminary heuristic","To explore the putative phases of the psychological response to disaster: preimpact, impact, heroic, honeymoon, disillusionment, and recovery, and make recommendations for corresponding interventions. Disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic are often characterized by chaos and uncertainty. As a result, public health disaster planning and response represent formidable challenges. Although disasters can result from a wide array of hazards, regardless of the agent at work, they may follow a rather predictable trajectory of psychological phases. A heuristic of those phases can provide an opportunity for a more organized disaster mental health response and more efficient utilization of scarce resources.","Everly, Wu, Potash","https://doi.org/10.5055/ajdm.2021.0381","20210506","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13539,""
"Attitudes towards vaccines and intention to vaccinate against COVID-19: Implications for public health communications","Negative attitudes towards vaccines and an uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations are major barriers to managing the COVID-19 pandemic in the long-term. We estimate predictors of four domains of negative attitudes towards vaccines and identify groups most at risk of uncertainty and unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in a large sample of UK adults. Data were cross-sectional and from 32,361 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. Ordinary least squares regression analyses examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors on four types of negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial regression examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors, negative vaccine attitudes, and prior vaccine behaviour on uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for COVID-19. 16% of respondents displayed high levels of mistrust about vaccines across one or more domains. Distrustful attitudes towards vaccination were higher amongst individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, with lower levels of education, lower annual income, poor knowledge of COVID-19, and poor compliance with government COVID-19 guidelines. Overall, 14% of respondents reported unwillingness to receive a vaccine for COVID-19, whilst 23% were unsure. The largest predictors of both COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal were low-income groups (&lt; Ã‚Â£16,000, a year), having not received a flu vaccine last year, poor adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines, female gender, and living with children. Amongst vaccine attitudes, intermediate to high levels of mistrust of vaccine benefit and concerns about future unforeseen side effects were the most important determinants of both uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19. Negative attitudes towards vaccines are a major public health concern in the UK. General mistrust in vaccines and concerns about future side effects in particular will be barriers to achieving population immunity to COVID-19 through vaccination. Public health messaging should be tailored to address these concerns and specifically to women, ethnic minorities, and people with lower levels of education and incomes.

"The prevalence of fatigue among Chinese nursing students in post-COVID-19 era","Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, all teaching activities in nursing schools were suspended in China, and many nursing students were summoned to work in hospitals to compensate for the shortage of manpower. This study examined the prevalence of fatigue and its association with quality of life (QOL) among nursing students during the post-COVID-19 era in China. This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study. Nursing students in five Chinese universities were invited to participate. Fatigue, depressive and anxiety symptoms, pain and QOL were measured using standardized instruments. A total of 1,070 nursing students participated. The prevalence of fatigue was 67.3% (95% CI [64.4-70.0]). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that male gender (<i>P</i> = 0.003, OR = 1.73, 95% CI [1.20-2.49]), and being a senior nursing student (second year: OR = 2.20, 95% CI [1.46-3.33], <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; third year: OR = 3.53, 95% CI [2.31-5.41], <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; and fourth year OR = 3.59, 95% CI [2.39-5.40], <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with more severe fatigue. In addition, moderate economic loss during the COVID-19 pandemic (OR = 1.48, 95% CI [1.08-3.33], <i>P</i> &lt; 0.015; compared to low loss), participants with more severe depressive (OR = 1.48, 95% CI [1.22-1.78], <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.12, 95% CI [1.05-1.20], <i>P</i> = 0.001), and more severe pain (OR = 1.67, 95%CI [1.46-1.91], <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with reported more severe fatigue. After controlling for covariates, nursing students with fatigue had a lower overall QOL score compared to those without (<i>F</i><sub>(1, 1070)</sub> = 31.4, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Fatigue was common among nursing students in the post-COVID-19 era. Considering the negative impact of fatigue on QOL and daily functioning, routine physical and mental health screening should be conducted for nursing students. Effective stress-reduction measures should be enforced to assist this subpopulation to combat fatigue and restore optimal health.","Liu, Xi, Zhu, Ji, Zhang, Yang, Bai, Cai, Zhao, Chen, Ge, Wang, Han, Chen, Liu, Cheung, Hall, An, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11154","20210506","COVID-19 pandemic; Fatigue; Nursing students; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13542,""
"Leveraging Virtual Experiences for International Professional Development Opportunities during the Pandemic and Beyond","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all spheres of life, including the world of education. Within no time, once-bustling university classrooms were compelled to move online, leaving educators to rely on virtual engagement tools. This in turn heightened the impact of virtual professional development in higher education, not just nationally but also internationally. As we look toward finding means to engage students in effective classroom instruction, there remain parts of the globe that are making this transition to online instruction without cutting-edge technologies. This article highlights the importance of engaging educators in virtual professional development activities as part of international outreach and details one author's experience using the Avida-ED platform for a novel international teaching partnership. Traditionally, international outreach activities have been pursued through distinct platforms, like Fulbright programs, sabbaticals, and other international collaborations. The ongoing pandemic presents a unique opportunity to propagate professional development activities on a virtual platform by emphasizing scientific teaching practices as they relate to the STEM fields. If undertaken, these endeavors ultimately benefit educators across the globe by not only equipping them with various pedagogical tools and resources for their online instruction but also by establishing international partnerships and collaborations.","Morra, Adkins-Jablonsky, Raut","https://doi.org/10.1128/jmbe.v22i1.2511","20210506","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13543,""
"Recommendations for youth engagement in Canadian mental health research in the context of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in reduced access to in-person mental health services, and a shift to virtual platforms. Youth may be uniquely impacted by physical distancing requirements during the pandemic, including limited socialization opportunities, closures of educational institutions, a lack of meaningful extracurricular activities and adverse implications on key developmental milestones. Due to the potential impact of COVID-19 on youth well-being, the need to rapidly transform services to be accessible, and the potential risks associated with this rapid transformation, it is imperative that youth continue to be engaged in research and service development. Young people's perspectives, strengths and skills need to be considered to effectively adapt the delivery of mental health services. Continuing to center youth engagement in mental health research throughout the pandemic can ensure research questions, programs, and services align with the needs and preferences of youth. In this commentary, we pose three recommendations for conducting youth-engaged mental health research during the pandemic, including adapting youth engagement strategies when rapid decisions must be made, the use of tools for virtual engagement, and suggestions for evaluating youth engagement practices. These strategies and principles may be applicable to other scenarios where rapid research or system transformation would benefit from youth engagement, such as time-limited child research by trainees (e.g., dissertations) or natural disasters.

"Cohort Profile: Multimorbidity in Children and Youth Across the Life-course (MY LIFE) Study","This manuscript serves to provide an overview of the methods of the Multimorbidity in Children and Youth across the Life-course (MY LIFE) study, profile sample characteristics of the cohort, and provide baseline estimates of multimorbidity to foster collaboration with clinical and research colleagues across Canada. MY LIFE is comprised of 263 children (2-16 years) with a physical illness recruited from McMaster Children's Hospital, their primary caregiving parent, and their closest-aged sibling. Participants are followed with data collection at recruitment, 6, 12, and 24 months which includes structured interviews, self-reported measures, and biological samples and occur in a private research office or at participants' homes. Post-COVID-19, data collection transitioned to mail and telephone surveys. At recruitment, children were 9.4 (4.2) years of age and 52.7% were male. The mean duration of their physical illness was 4.5 (4.1) years; 25% represent incident cases (duration &lt;1 year). Most (69.7%) had healthy body weight and intelligence in the average range (73.5%). Overall, 38.2% of children screened positive for Ã¢â€°Â¥1 mental illness according to parent report (24.8% screened positive based on child self-report). Compared to 2016 Census data, the MY LIFE cohort overrepresents families of higher socioeconomic status. Multimorbidity is common among children and these baseline data will serve to measure relative changes in the mental health of children with physical illness over time. MY LIFE will provide new information for understanding multimorbidity among children, though underrepresentation of lower socioeconomic families may have implications for the generalizability of findings.

"Hydroxychloroquine Increased Anxiety-Like Behaviors and Disrupted the Expression of Some Related Genes in the Mouse Brain","Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which has been proposed as a therapeutic or prophylactic drug for COVID-19, has been administered to thousands of individuals with varying efficacy; however, our understanding of its adverse effects is insufficient. It was reported that HCQ induced psychiatric symptoms in a few patients with autoimmune diseases, but it is still uncertain whether HCQ poses a risk to mental health. Therefore, in this study, we treated healthy mice with two different doses of HCQ that are comparable to clinically administered doses for 7Ã‚Â days. Psychiatric-like behaviors and the expression of related molecules in the brain were evaluated at two time points, i.e., 24Ã‚Â h andÃ‚Â 10 days after drug administration. We found that HCQ increased anxiety behavior at both 24Ã‚Â h and 10Ã‚Â days. Furthermore, HCQ decreased the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta, corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh), a serotonin transporter (Slc6a4), and a microglia maker (Aif1) in the hippocampus and decreased the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) in both the hippocampus and amygdala. Lots of these behavioral and molecular changes were sustained beyond 10Ã‚Â days after drug administration, and some of them were dose-dependent. Although this animal study does not prove that HCQ has a similar effect in humans, it indicates that HCQ poses a significant risk to mental health and suggests that further clinical investigation is essential. According to our data, we recommend that HCQ be carefully used as a prophylactic drug in people who are susceptible to mental disorders.","Xu, Zhang, Wang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.633112","20210506","AIF1; BDNF; CRH; IL-1ÃŽÂ²; SLC6a4; anxiety; hydroxychloroquine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13546,""
"Proceedings of the Eighth Annual Deep Brain Stimulation Think Tank: Advances in Optogenetics, Ethical Issues Affecting DBS Research, Neuromodulatory Approaches for Depression, Adaptive Neurostimulation, and Emerging DBS Technologies","We estimate that 208,000 deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices have been implanted to address neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders worldwide. DBS Think Tank presenters pooled data and determined that DBS expanded in its scope and has been applied to multiple brain disorders in an effort to modulate neural circuitry. The DBS Think Tank was founded in 2012 providing a space where clinicians, engineers, researchers from industry and academia discuss current and emerging DBS technologies and logistical and ethical issues facing the field. The emphasis is on cutting edge research and collaboration aimed to advance the DBS field. The Eighth Annual DBS Think Tank was held virtually on September 1 and 2, 2020 (Zoom Video Communications) due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting focused on advances in: (1) optogenetics as a tool for comprehending neurobiology of diseases and on optogenetically-inspired DBS, (2) cutting edge of emerging DBS technologies, (3) ethical issues affecting DBS research and access to care, (4) neuromodulatory approaches for depression, (5) advancing novel hardware, software and imaging methodologies, (6) use of neurophysiological signals in adaptive neurostimulation, and (7) use of more advanced technologies to improve DBS clinical outcomes. There were 178 attendees who participated in a DBS Think Tank survey, which revealed the expansion of DBS into several indications such as obesity, post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction and Alzheimer's disease. This proceedings summarizes the advances discussed at the Eighth Annual DBS Think Tank.","Vedam-Mai, Deisseroth, Giordano, Lazaro-Munoz, Chiong, Suthana, Langevin, Gill, Goodman, Provenza, Halpern, Shivacharan, Cunningham, Sheth, Pouratian, Scangos, Mayberg, Horn, Johnson, Butson, Gilron, de Hemptinne, Wilt, Yaroshinsky, Little, Starr, Worrell, Shirvalkar, Chang, Volkmann, Muthuraman, Groppa, KÃƒÂ¼hn, Li, Johnson, Otto, Raike, Goetz, Wu, Silburn, Cheeran, Pathak, Malekmohammadi, Gunduz, Wong, Cernera, Wagle Shukla, Ramirez-Zamora, Deeb, Patterson, Foote, Okun","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2021.644593","20210506","DBS (deep brain stimulation); adaptive DBS; neuroethics; neuroimaging; novel hardware; optogenetics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13547,""
"COVID-19-Related Anxiety and Its Association with Dietary Diversity Score Among Health Care Professionals in Ethiopia: A Web-Based Survey","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a stressful and overwhelming situation for health care professionals (HCP), especially, who are caring for patients in the resource-limited health care settings of low-income countries. Due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Ethiopia, HCPs are at risk for COVID-19-related anxiety and associated inadequate nutrition. However, the magnitude of COVID-19-related anxiety and its association with dietary diversity among HCPs is not well studied. To assess the magnitude of COVID-19-related anxiety and its association with dietary diversity score among health care professionals in Ethiopia. A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among HCPs working in university hospitals, primary hospitals, and health centers in south and southwest Ethiopia. A structured online survey questionnaire was designed on Google forms and carried out from May 15 to June 14, 2020. COVID-19-related anxiety was assessed using the coronavirus anxiety scale. Dietary diversity was measured using 9 items individual dietary diversity score. Data analysis was done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 24. Multiple logistic regression was computed to identify independent factors associated with COVID-19-related anxiety. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. The prevalence of COVID-19-related anxiety among health care professionals was found to be 20.2%. COVID-19-related anxiety is significantly associated with a low dietary diversity score [AOR=5.93 (1.67, 21.07)]. The other factors which are independently associated with COVID-19-related anxiety are the presence of depression [AOR=6.98 (2.91-16.73)] and diploma educational status [AOR=0.16 (0.04-0.55)]. One-fifth of the study participants were found to have probable COVID-19-related anxiety. Designing a screening and intervention strategy for COVID-19-related anxiety among HCPs, particularly to those with low dietary diversity scores and depression, is recommended.","Alenko, Agenagnew, Beressa, Tesfaye, Woldesenbet, Girma","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S305164","20210506","COVID-19; anxiety; dietary diversity score; health care professionals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13548,""
"LIVES for families psychological first aid training programme to address COVID-19 psychological distress: a mixed methods acceptability and feasibility protocol","Best practice approaches for addressing COVID-19-related psychological distress among young people (&lt;25 years) and their families remain unclear. Psychological first aid (PFA) is promoted by public health authorities to provide psychological support in the context of extreme events; however, there is limited evidence for its effectiveness. As a prerequisite to conducting a randomised controlled trial to examine programme effectiveness, this project is evaluating the acceptability and feasibility of implementing and evaluating a PFA training programme ('LIVES for Families') for mental health (MH) practitioners to improve their ability to recognise and respond to COVID-19-related psychological distress among their clients. We are using a triangulation mixed methods research design; complementary strands of quantitative and qualitative data are being collected in parallel and will be merged at the interpretation phase of the project. The quantitative strand uses a repeated measures design; a consecutive sample of MH practitioners (n=80) providing MH support to young people or their families are being recruited to participate in the LIVES for Families PFA training programme and complete quantitative measures at baseline (pretraining), 2-week and 6-month follow-up time points. The qualitative strand uses fundamental description and semistructured interviews with a subset of practitioners (n=30), as well as managers of MH agencies (n=20). A mixed methods joint display and associated narrative will generate a comprehensive understanding regarding acceptability and feasibility. The Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board approved the study (project number: 11295). Results will be shared broadly with the policy and practice community through publications, presentations and public webinars. As a brief, evidence-informed intervention, the LIVES for Families PFA training programme is suitable in its mode of delivery across care settings. The outcomes of this study could have international implications for mitigating the MH impacts of viral pandemics.","Kimber, Harms, Soreni, Inrig, Acai, Lipman, Sassi, Streiner, MacMillan","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049995","20210506","COVID-19; education &amp; training (see medical education &amp; training); mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13549,""
"Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Probiotics To Eliminate COVID-19 Transmission in Exposed Household Contacts (PROTECT-EHC): a clinical trial protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be an unprecedented challenge to worldwide health, and strategies to mitigate the spread and severity of COVID-19 infection are urgently needed. Emerging evidence suggests that the composition of the gut microbiome and modification of microbial ecology via probiotics can affect susceptibility to a wide range of infections, including respiratory tract infections. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effects of the probiotic <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG</i> (LGG) versus placebo on COVID-19 infection status and the gut microbiome in subjects with a household contact who has tested positive for COVID-19. In this double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we will randomise 1132 subjects having a household contact who has recently (Ã¢â€°Â¤7Ã¢â‚¬â€°days) tested positive for COVID-19 to daily oral LGG or placebo for 28 days. We hypothesise that taking LGG as a probiotic will protect against COVID-19 infection and reduce the severity of disease in those who become infected (primary endpoint: decreased symptoms), and will be associated with beneficial changes in the composition of the gut microbiome. Stool samples and nasal swabs will be collected to evaluate the microbiome by 16S rRNA sequencing and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, respectively. We will also conduct multivariate analysis of demographic, behavioural, temporal, and other variables that may predict development of symptoms and other outcomes. This trial is conducted under a Food and Drug Administration Investigational New Drug for LGG, has received ethics approval by the institutional review board of Duke University and enrolment has begun. We plan to disseminate the results in peer-reviewed journals and at national and international conferences.

"Effect of intensive care unit-specific virtual reality (ICU-VR) to improve psychological well-being and quality of life in COVID-19 ICU survivors: a study protocol for a multicentre, randomized controlled trial","The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has resulted in a tremendous increase in hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions all over the world. Patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) warranting ICU treatment usually have prolonged mechanical ventilation and are expected to be prone to develop psychological impairments, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression, which negatively impact quality of life. To date, no effective treatment strategy is available. In the current trial, we aim to assess the effect of an ICU-specific virtual reality (ICU-VR) intervention on psychological well-being and quality of life after COVID-19 ICU treatment. In this multicentre, randomized controlled trial, we aim to examine whether COVID-19-specific ICU-VR, offered 3Ã‚Â months after hospital discharge, improves psychological well-being and quality of life. Secondary objectives are, firstly, to examine the intra-group changes in psychological well-being and quality of life and the inter-group differences in psychological well-being and quality of life during follow-up, up to 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after hospital discharge, and secondly, to examine patients' satisfaction with and rating of ICU care and aftercare and patients' perspectives on ICU-VR. Eighty adult patients treated for COVID-19 in the mixed-surgical ICUs of four hospitals in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, will be included and randomized (1:1) to either early or late ICU-VR between June 29 and December 31, 2020. Patients randomized to early ICU-VR will receive the ICU-VR intervention during an outpatient clinic visit 3Ã‚Â months after hospital discharge, whereas patients randomized to late ICU-VR will receive ICU-VR 6Ã‚Â months after hospital discharge. Primary outcomes of this study are psychological well-being, assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and quality of life, assessed using the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and RAND-36 questionnaires, up to 6Ã‚Â months after hospital discharge. Currently, an effective treatment for psychological sequelae after ICU treatment for specific illnesses is unavailable. Results from this study will provide insight whether virtual reality is a modality that can be used in ICU aftercare to improve psychological well-being and quality of life, or satisfaction, after ICU treatment for specific illnesses such as COVID-19.

"LOVE in the time of Covid-19: a brief mental health intervention to overcome loneliness","The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak and its containment through public health strategies has resulted in a parallel pandemic of psychological distress. Increased loneliness and social isolation are associated with adverse health outcomes, yet there is a gap in brief interventions that specifically target loneliness. This article introduces a brief intervention to strengthen connectedness, LOVE. In a systematic way, this solution-focused approach encourages openness and sharing of current struggles with the existing circle of support. There are four steps in LOVE: <b>L</b>ist people in one's life, <b>O</b>rganise them on the helpfulness-availability matrix, <b>V</b>erify what they know to map them onto circles of trust and <b>E</b>ngage them through self-disclosure. The article details each concept, its importance, the pragmatics involved and top tips to guide practice. The memorable acronym provides logical sequence and structure. It is time efficient in training and delivery, with no former mental health knowledge required so there is potential for wide application. It facilitates collaboration between health professionals and people in distress and promotes empowerment and self-resilience. Adapted from the safety planning component of PROTECT, a pre-existing suicide prevention framework, LOVE has to be fine-tuned as a brief intervention in the wider context of the pandemic.","Ray, Chow, Theodoros, Wyder, Steginga, Sorrensen, Hickey, Lau, Kinsella, Lombardo","https://doi.org/10.1177/10398562211010806","20210506","Covid-19; brief mental health intervention; family and friends; overcome loneliness; social connections","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13552,""
"Influence of the COVID-19 lockdown on remote workersâ€™ physical and psychosocial wellbeing and work productivity","Introduction: Imposed lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the living and working habits of millions, with potentially important implications for physical, mental, and social wellbeing. Objectives: The primary objective was to investigate the impact of the pandemic on remote workers not directly affected by the virus. Methods: This was a correlational cross-sectional study (with an additional qualitative component) of 184 remote workers surveyed during the first COVID-19 lockdown in the UK. Standard measures of mental health (Kessler-6), productivity (IAPT) and physical activity (IPAQ) were used, with respondents further surveyed on changes to their dietary, exercise, smoking, drinking and socialisation habits to produce a â€˜well-being change indexâ€™. Results: Results revealed associations between sedentary behaviour and poorer mental health (tb=.14) and between poorer mental health and low work productivity (tb=-.39). However, both positive and negative lifestyle changes were reported; a self-reported increase in wellbeing (with respect to diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption, and socialisation) since the start of the pandemic was associated with both better mental health (tb=-.14) and better work productivity (tb=.14). Of note, we observed rates of moderate (55%) and severe (12%) psychological distress markedly higher than those reported in large pre-pandemic studies, and 70% of our respondents reported more sedentary behaviour, 41% increased their alcohol consumption and 39% their overall food intake. However, 46%, 45% and 52% reported spending more time walking, engaging in more moderate and vigorous exercise, respectively. Qualitative analysis revealed many positive adaptations to lockdowns (e.g., decreased commuting expenses, flexibility) but also a number of structural obstacles to remote working (e.g., lack of support and high expectations from employers, childcare duties). Conclusion: These findings may be of practical importance for policy makers and employers in a world of work involving long-term remote or hybrid employment arrangements; strategies to promote more sustainable remote working are discussed.","Yessica Abigail Tronco HernÃ¡ndez et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D6-01C-2D4","20210507","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; diet; remote working; exercise; physical and mental wellbeing; covid-19; work productivity","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13553,""

"Yoga in school-aged children: Impact on children's mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic â€“ A protocol","The rapid spread of COVID-19 and the increasing burden on mental health and well- being require new ways of supporting families that have to maintain the new norms of social distancing. Many families may be under enormous amounts of stress and anxiety caused by losing their loved ones. Therefore, there is a great need to search for ways to minimize the effects of COVID-19 on mental health and well-being. The purpose of the research is to evaluate a yoga intervention offered online to school-aged children in the U.K. by Patanjali Yog Peeth Trust U.K. (PYPT) and evaluate its effectiveness by interviewing the parents of participating children. The project will seek to promote an additional tool in managing mental health and well-being in school-aged children. The research will use a mixed-methods approach. Parents will be approached by a PYPT yoga teacher and invited to complete an online survey and quantitative interview. Parents (over 18 years) of school-aged children (5-16 years) who live in the U.K. are eligible to take part. Upon gaining consent, participates will be asked to complete a parent and child characteristic questionnaire. An SDQ survey for parents via online Opinio and a subsample will be interviewed using a structured interview schedule. All analyses will be carried out in SPSS. It is intended that the research will provide an evidence base that will aid future studies and inform in developing yoga interventions that may aid in promoting child mental health and well-being. The study results will be published in peer-reviewed international journals; the researchers will also present the results at governmental conferences.","Kirti Khunti et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CA-BD6-CDC","20210507","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology|Intervention","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13555,""
"Psychological Intervention Measures for Mental Health During COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health problem affecting around 213 countries and territories worldwide, with more than 6,474,200 cases reported and 382,914 deaths documented so far. The World Health Organization announced COVID-19 is a pandemic outbreak on 11 March, 2020. We are facing a medical emergency because of COVID-19 pandemic. These large incidents have negative and detrimental effects on mental health and well-being of individuals worldwide. Widespread infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 are linked to mental illness symptoms and psychological distress. Preliminary studies indicate that depression (28%) and anxiety (16%) symptoms and self-reported stress (8 %) are typical psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be correlated with sleep disturbance. The physical and psychological wellbeing of general people, particularly health care practitioners, has been profoundly affected by illness. The main objective of this review-based study is to focus mental health and psychological interventions which can be provided during this pandemic. Stress, fear, anxiety, panic, frustration is very common during COVID-19 pandemic and these can be reduced by some psychological intervention measures.","Ancha Rani et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46075-E49-AA3","20210507","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Treatment; psychological intervention.; mental health; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-07","",13556,""
