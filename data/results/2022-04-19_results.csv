"Association of Covid-19 Vaccine Hesitancy with Demographics, Mental Health, and Disability","Background The world is witnessing a pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus named Covid-19 by the WHO that has claimed millions of lives since its advent in December 2019. Several vaccine candidates and treatments have emerged to mitigate the virus's effect, increased confusion and mistrust of their development, emergency authorization, and approval process. Increased job losses, a jump in the divorce rate, and the generic nature of staying home have also led to various mental health issues. Methods We analyzed two publicly available datasets to understand vaccine hesitancy better. The first dataset was extracted from the ICPSR Covid-19 database (https://doi.org/10.3886/E130422V1).[1].This cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in the US, India, and China. The second dataset was obtained from the United States Census Bureaus Household Pulse Survey (HPS) Phase 3.2. For the ICPSR dataset, proportions and summary statistics are reported to give an overview of the global picture of vaccine hesitancy. The HPS dataset was analyzed using multinomial and binary logistic regression. Chi-square test of independence and exploratory data analysis supplemented provided insight into the causal factors involved in vaccine hesitancy. Results ICPSR Global Data For India, 1761 participants completed the survey as of November 2020, of which 90.2% indicated acceptance of a Covid-19 vaccine. 66.4% are parents of 18 years old or younger, and 79.0% of respondents have a parent 50 years or older. The vaccine acceptance rate was 99.8% among 928 out of 1761 participants who had a child. 1392 participants either had a parent or child, of which 83.4% will encourage their parents, and 90.5% will encourage their children to get the covid-19 vaccine. In this Indian survey, 16.2% identified as belonging to the rural population, of which 51.2% showed vaccine hesitancy. A binary logistic regression model with vaccine hesitancy as a dichotomous variable showed that the rural population had an odds ratio (OR) of 3.45 (p-value<0.05). Income seems to influence vaccine hesitancy, with an income level of (7501-15,000 Indian Rupees (INR)/month) having an OR of 1.41 compared to other income groups. In the US, 1768 individuals participated in the survey from August-November 2020. 67.3% of respondents indicated they would accept the vaccine. 1129 of them either had a parent or a child, of which 67.6% will take the vaccine; 66% will encourage their parents, and 83% will encourage their children for taking the vaccination. 40.3% responded as vaccine-hesitant, 31% identified as staying in rural areas, of which 52.5% are vaccine-hesitant. In the binary logistic regression analysis, race, past flu shot history, rural living, and income were significant. The white race had OR >1 as compared to other races; the low-income group (US dollar $2000-4999/month) had an OR of 1.03. In China, there were 1727 participants, of which 1551(90.0%) indicated that they would accept a vaccine. 90.1% of them who had either a parent or child will receive the vaccine, 80.4% will influence parents, and 83.4% will encourage children to get a vaccination needle in the arm. 30% had vaccine hesitancy. 262 belonged to the rural population, of which 34.8% were vaccine-hesitant. Income and Northern region (OR = 3.17) were significant in saying yes to a vaccine. High-income groups were least resistant (OR=0.96) as compared to other groups. HPS USA data Data used in this study was collected from United States Census Bureaus Household Pulse Survey (HPS) Phase 3.2 Weeks 34-39, which covers data collected from July 21, 2021, to October 11, 2021. The HPS data helped to understand the effect of several demographic, psychological, and health-related factors upon which responses were provided, thus helping to understand the social and economic impacts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion Among the three countries, it appears based on this survey that the US has the highest rate of vaccine hesitancy may contribute to this result in gender, education, religious beliefs, disbelief in science, and government which remains unexplored due to data limitations. keywords: vaccine hesitancy; COVID-19, pandemic, vaccine, coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, mental health, political view, multinomial logistic regression, Lasso; elastic-net; stress; anxiety; depression; worry; psychology","Arinjita Bhattacharyya; Shikshita Singh; Swarna Sakshi; Anand Seth; Shesh Rai","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.13.22273843","20220418","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30222,""
"A comparative analysis of pediatric mental health-related emergency department utilization in Montreal, Canada before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Reports on longitudinal trends in mental health-related (MHR) emergency department (ED) utilization spanning the pre- and post-pandemic periods are lacking, along with evidence comparing healthcare services utilization by sociodemographic subgroups. The aim of this study was to evaluate COVID-19 associated changes in MHR ED utilization among youth overall and by age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed MHR ED utilization before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large urban pediatric tertiary care hospital in Montreal, Canada. All ED visits for children (5-11 years) and adolescents (12-17 years) between April 1, 2016 and November 30, 2021 were included. The main outcome was the monthly count of MHR ED visits. Pre-pandemic and pandemic periods were compared using an interrupted time series design. The effect of seasonality (in months), age (in years), sex (male or female), and SES (low, average, high) were compared using a generalized additive model. Results: There were a total of 437,147 ED visits (204,215 unique patients) during the five-year study period of which 9,748 (5.8%) were MHR visits (7,686 unique patients). We observed an increase of 69% (95% CI, +53% to +85%; p = .001) in the mean monthly count of MHR ED visits during the pandemic period, which remained significant after adjusting for seasonality (44% increase, 95% CI, +38% to +51%; p = .001). The chance of presenting for a MHR ED visit increased non-linearly with age. There were increased odds of presenting for a MHR ED visit among girls between the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.29-1.56). No difference by SES group during and before the COVID-19 pandemic was found (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.89-1.15 [low]; OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96-1.25 [high]). Conclusions: Our study shows important increases in MHR ED utilization among youth, and especially among girls, during the first 20 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for sustained, targeted and scalable mental health resources to support youth mental health during the current and future crises.","Gabrielle Beaudry; Olivier Drouin; Jocelyn Gravel; Anna Smyrnova; Andreas Bender; Massimiliano Orri; Marie-Claude Geoffroy; Nicholas Chadi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.18.22273970","20220418","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30223,""
"Hidradenitis Suppurativa Reddit Support Group: Finding New Meaning in Social Media during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammation of sweat glands that can result in abscesses and scarring, significantly impacting quality of life. Online support groups provide a platform to connect with other HS patients â€“ increasingly important with pandemic-related social isolation. The popular social media site Reddit allows users with common interests, like HS, to form a community and share information. This study characterizes HS patientsâ€™ use of Reddit and social media more broadly before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This study consisted of a cross-sectional survey of HS patients treated at our institution between May 2021 and July 2021, collecting data on patient demographics, HS status, and social media support group usage/interest. A longitudinal analysis of use of a popular HS support page on Reddit from January 2019 to August 2021 was also conducted, analyzing the number of subscribers over time. Results The number of subscribers to the subreddit r/Hidradenitis increased exponentially from January 2019 to August 2021 (R2= 0.9978 for exponential model fit to data);this suggests that the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a greater increase in the number of subreddit subscribers. Further, 20 patients (90% female, mean age of 32.4 years) completed the survey that was administered. Participants were stratified into two groups: online support group users (n=8) and non-users (n=12). There were no significant differences in sex, age, education level, HS activity, antidepressant usage, and overall social media usage between these groups. However, there was a significant difference in Hurley staging between the two groups;75% (n=6) of online support group users reported a Hurley III staging, while only 16.7% (n=2) of non-users self-reported as Hurley III (p=0.003). In terms of features patients desired to see in online support groups, non-users ranked the following categories of advice/information as important more frequently than current users: bandaging/dressing boils, living with HS, medical advice from professionals, causes of HS, and diet (p=0.047, p=0.043, p=0.043, p=0.047, and p=0.013, respectively). Conclusions This study demonstrates that online support group use is associated with patients with HS of higher clinical severity. Since virtual support groups have an unprecedented importance due to increased social isolation and limited access to in-person support groups and health resources, healthcare providers may encourage non-users to partake in these online support communities during these trying times. Based on the needs and expectations of these patients as identified in this study, recommendations can be made to moderators of online communities to help fill any existing lacunae.","Yesantharao, Lekha, Suresh, Rachana, Cox, Carrie A.; Lerman, Sheera F.; Caffrey, Julie","https://www.google.com/search?q=Hidradenitis+Suppurativa+Reddit+Support+Group:+Finding+New+Meaning+in+Social+Media+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association; 43(Suppl 1):S87-S88, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30224,""

Objective Our study investigated depression, anxiety and PTG and their correlates among COVID-19 survivors. Method A cross-sectional telephone survey recruited 199 COVID-19 patients (Mean age = 42.7;53.3% females) at six-month follow-up after hospital discharge in five Chinese cities (i.e. Wuhan, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Dongguan and Nanning). Their demographic information, clinical records and experiences during (e.g. severity of covid-19 symptoms, treatment and exposure to other patientsâ€™ suffering) and after hospitalisation (e.g. perceived impact of covid-19, somatic symptoms after hospitalisation), and psychosocial factors (e.g. perceived discrimination, self-stigma, affiliate stigma, resilience and social support) were investigated. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD-7) scale, respectively. PTG was examined by the Post-traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) instrument. Results The proportion of depressive symptoms &lt;5, =5 and &lt;10, =10 were 76.9%, 12.0% and 11.1%, respectively. The proportion of anxiety symptoms &lt;5, =5 and &lt;10, =10 were 77.4%, 15.1% and 7.5%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression showed that receiving mental health care services during hospitalisation, somatic symptoms after discharge, perceived affiliate stigma and perceived impact of being infected with COVID-19 were significantly and positively associated with probable depression. Significant correlates of probable anxiety also included permanent residents of the city, somatic symptoms after discharge, perceived impact of being infected with COVID-19 and self-stigma. Social support, self-stigma and receiving mental health care services during hospitalisation were positively associated with PTG. Conclusions: The results suggest that post-hospitalisation and psychosocial factors had relatively stronger associations with depression, anxiety and PTG than pre-hospitalisation and hospitalisation factors. Promoting social support and social inclusion may be useful strategies to improve the mental health of COVID-19 survivors. HIGHLIGHTS â€¢ Post-hospitalisation and psychosocial factors had relatively stronger associations with depression, anxiety and PTG than pre-hospitalisation and hospitalisation factors, promoting social support and social inclusion may be useful strategies to improve mental health of COVID-19 survivors.","Xiao, Xin, Yang, Xue, Zheng, Weiran, Wang, Bingyi, Fu, Leiwen, Luo, Dan, Hu, Yuqing, Ju, Niu, Xu, Hui, Fang, Yuan, Fong Chan, Paul Shing, Xu, Zhijie, Chen, Ping, He, Jiaoling, Zhu, Hongqiong, Tang, Huiwen, Huang, Dixi, Hong, Zhongsi, Hao, Yanrong, Cai, Lianying, Ye, Shupei, Yuan, Jianhui, Xiao, Fei, Yang, Jianrong, Wang, Zixin, Zou, Huachun","https://www.google.com/search?q=Depression,+anxiety+and+post-traumatic+growth+among+COVID-19+survivors+six-month+after+discharge+DepresiÃ³n,+ansiedad+y+crecimiento+postraumÃ¡tico+entre+sobrevivientes+de+COVID-19+seis+meses+despuÃ©s+del+alta+COVID-19+<U+5E78><U+5B58><U+8005><U+51FA><U+9662><U+516D><U+4E2A><U+6708><U+540E><U+7684><U+6291><U+90C1><U+3001><U+7126><U+8651><U+548C><U+521B><U+4F24><U+540E><U+6210><U+957F>","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Psychotraumatology; 13(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30225,""
"Group Telehealth Interventions Fostering Social Connection Among Older Veterans and Their Families","During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual and telephone visits rapidly replaced most in-person care within the Veterans Health Administration (VA) to reduce virus spread. To address the emerging mental health needs of older Veterans (e.g., isolation, loneliness), we developed an 8-week group treatment manual, deliverable over telephone or videoconference, to foster social connection and address pandemic anxieties. The manual was disseminated in March 2020 as a rapid response to emergent COVID-19 pandemic realities, during which many locations in the United States called for immediate self-quarantine measures for unknown durations.

"Long COVID-19 in Heart Transplant Recipients","Purpose The goal of this study was to assess the frequency and common symptoms of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (Long COVID-19) in heart transplant recipients (HTR). Methods After obtaining IRB approval, we conducted telephone surveys of HTR (n=30) who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 to evaluate their experience with acute COVID-19 illness and assess symptoms of Long COVID-19. Symptoms at onset and also beyond 6, 12, and 24 weeks of the initial diagnosis were recorded. Additionally, medical charts were reviewed for detailed information regarding transplant history, immunosuppression, COVID-19 management and hospitalization, and COVID-19 vaccination status. Results As noted in Table 1, among the 30 participants, 10 (33%) had symptoms consistent with Long COVID-19. Those with Long COVID-19 were more symptomatic during acute illness, with 40% of patients reporting cough, fevers or chills, and headaches, compared with 15%, 25%, and 20% respectively in those without Long COVID-19. Emergency department visits at initial illness (80% vs. 20%) and admission to the intensive care unit were more frequent (60% vs. 5%) in the Long COVID-19. Symptoms of Long COVID-19 lasted for a median of 9 weeks with 30% reporting ongoing symptoms at week 24. The most common persistent symptoms were depression, confusion, and difficulty concentrating. Conclusion This study is an early investigation of a complex syndrome of Long COVID-19 in transplant patients. Long COVID-19 is not well described in the transplant setting. HTR at our center with Long COVID-19 were sicker at their initial COVID-19 diagnosis and had more emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and longer hospital stays than those without subsequent Long COVID-19. Although, recall bias could affect participantsâ€™ ability to remember details and symptoms, this would have impacted both groups similarly as the time since COVID-19 diagnosis to study enrollment was similar between the two groups. These are preliminary findings and the study is currently ongoing.","Sigler, R.; Chen, B.; Bharti, A.; Aslam, S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Long+COVID-19+in+Heart+Transplant+Recipients","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation; 41(4):S278-S278, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30228,""
"Acute Circulatory Collapse and Advanced Therapies in Patients with COVID-19 Infection","Introduction In the current COVID era, ICU-level patients typically develop respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). While less frequent, the management of concomitant acute circulatory collapse has its own challenges and nuances. Early identification of acute circulatory collapse requires appropriate imaging and precise diagnosis of cardiogenic shock. Escalation to mechanical circulatory support such as intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), Impella and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have been useful in patients with circulatory collapse from COVID. Case Report 42-year-old obese female presented with COVID bronchopneumonia 6 days after a positive outpatient COVID swab. In the ED, she was given 3L of fluid bolus for severe sepsis and developed flash pulmonary edema requiring emergent intubation. She also developed hemodynamic collapse, requiring inotrope and pressor support and a TTE demonstrated severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of &lt; 10%. Peripheral VA ECMO was placed, and the patient was transferred to our tertiary care center for further management of fulminant COVID-myocarditis with cardiogenic shock. Patient did not have any significant obstructive coronary artery disease on catheterization. An Impella CP was placed for hemodynamic support. She was started on a high-dose steroid, one dose of tocilizumab for severe LV dysfunction, two rounds of IVIG, and CRRT for volume removal. On Day 11 she had improved hemodynamics and there were signs of LV recovery, after which she was decannulated. Impella support was continued until there was complete recovery. Patient was extubated on Day 17 and continues to recover at a long-term acute care facility. Summary Acute circulatory collapse in COVID-19 infection is a serious complication with high morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of depressed LV function and cardiogenic shock by echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and/or Swan-Ganz catheter assessment is critical. ICU management of hemodynamic function, fluid status, and blood pressure management remains standardized, but prompt medical management with inotropes and mechanical support maximizes patient outcomes. IABP, Impella, and ECMO all play a key role in managing acute circulatory collapse.","Shah, A.; Thaker, R.; Kassi, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Acute+Circulatory+Collapse+and+Advanced+Therapies+in+Patients+with+COVID-19+Infection","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation; 41(4):S284-S284, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30229,""

"A STUDY EXPLORING THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF OLDER ADULTS IN A SMALL RURAL COMMUNITY: WHAT WE LEARNED","Keywords: older adults, COVID-19, loneliness, isolation, grief, mental health, physical health The Impact of COVID-19 on Older Adult's Mental and Physical Health People aged 65 years and older account for 1 8% of the Canadian population (Statistics Canada, 2020) and although the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting many Canadians, the social isolation resulting from physical distancing has potentially devastating health outcomes on this vulnerable group (Fakoya et al., 2020). Older adults are vulnerable to social isolation and experiencing loneliness because they are more likely to have risk factors such as death of loved ones, chronic health issues, sensory impairments, and changes in income (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, & Medicine, 2020). The World Health Organization (2020) has warned that older adults, especially persons living with underlying mental health issues, may become more anxious, stressed, and withdrawn during times of crisis. Social isolation is also a significant risk factor for loneliness, which contributes to a higher risk for hypertension, heart disease, obesity, anxiety as well as depression (National Institute on Aging, 201 9).","Rawkins, Kimberly BScN M.

"THE IMPACT OF OLDER ADULTS' LIVING ENVIRONMENT ON THEIR HEALTHY AGING IN PLACE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Keywords: older adults, private home, cohousing, assisted living, healthy aging, COVID-19 pandemic THE IMPACT OF OLDER ADULTS' LIVING ENVIRONMENT ON THEIR HEALTHY AGING IN PLACE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel Coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2], which causes COVID-19, a respiratory disease, a public health emergency on March 11, 2020 (Government of Canada, 2021;Nascimento, 2020). The research question was, ""how does older adults' living environment promote their healthy aging in place during the COVID-19 pandemic?"" LITERATURE REVIEW Multiple factors, including an individual's composition, physical environment, social interaction, independence, cognitive/mental health, mobility, transportation, services such as recreational opportunities, healthcare and information work together to impact older adults' healthy aging (Bigonnesse, 201 7;Puplampu, Matthews, et al., 2020). Healthy aging is a multidimensional construct that indicates the older adult is doing well;it can be defined as promoting and optimizing the health of an older adult by managing chronic diseases, ensuring cognitive, physical, and mental health, facilitating social engagement and resilience, independence, safety, support and services from the community (Batsis et al., 2021;Government of Canada, 201 6;Lock & Belza, 201 6;Pac et al., 2019). Housing for older adults plays a key role in their healthy aging, which became apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic as long-term care facilities in Canada became high-risk settings and sources of outbreaks and deaths (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2020).","Puplampu, Vivian A.

As a result, the purpose of this session is to reflect upon the notion of trust and examine how trust moves science and social justice forward. Trust must be seen as sustained or broken over multiple generations. Moreover, trust between older adults and medical and social support institutions has profound implications for this historical moment. In the COVID-19 pandemic, trust can be viewed as a facilitator of emergency responses in the State of Washington as noted in Dr. Berridgeâ€™s paper. On the other hand, distrust and a related sense of abandonment contributes to Black Americans' limited uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations, as noted in Dr. Johnsonâ€™s work. On a related note, Dr. Perryâ€™s work shows that lack of trust over time has led those aging with hemophilia to withdraw from care at different points in their own trajectories. Finally, on a positive note, Dr. Kotwalâ€™s work illustrates the role of a peer outreach intervention in facilitating trusting relationships among diverse, low-income older adults which led to sustained reductions, over a 2-year period, in loneliness, barriers to socializing, and depression. This symposium on trust highlights how researchers work, either consciously or unconsciously, within a continuum of trust in their participants' communities. At a broader level, systemic attention to building trust from academia, government, and national advocacy organizations holds the potential to foster meaningful scientific engagement and empowerment of historically marginalized communities.","Portacolone, Elena","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+Exploration+on+Trust","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):6-6, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30233,""
"Insurance Coverage Does Not Increase Risk of Depression and Anxiety in Burn Patients","Introduction A burn injury can have long-term mental and physical effects on individual patients. When burn injuries occur at work, there is an additional unfamiliar stress of income loss and dependence on a third-party payer. Patients with claims through the Bureau of Workerâ€™s Compensation (BWC) report frustration and overall dissatisfaction in working with the BWC to achieve claim coverage. Of workers who are off of work more than 5 days due to a work-related injury, 10% are diagnosed with depression in the 12 months following the injury (Carnide, 2016). In our clinic, screening for depression and anxiety is done through the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), a valid four-item assessment tool that utilizes a Likert style measurement to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety (Kroenke et al., 2009). This is a health questionnaire that determines a patientâ€™s risk for depression and anxiety as mild, moderate, or severe. Objective To determine if there is a correlation between insurance type and PHQ-4 scores in burn patients. We hypothesized that risk of depression and anxiety could differ based on payer, which can affect a patientâ€™s access to care, referral approval, and financial burden of treatment. Additional focus was placed on BWC patients due to their reported frustrations and dissatisfaction in working with BWC and the established correlation between depression and missed work. Methods A quality improvement project was initiated based on increased rates of referrals for psychological evaluation and treatment in BWC patients. A retrospective review was conducted of outpatient burn clinic visits where a PHQ-4 questionnaire was completed in the past 3 fiscal years: 7/1/2019-6/30/2021. Results Total of 1932 visits with PHQ-4 collection were reviewed within the above specified time frame. The rates of moderate and high-risk scores for anxiety and depression were highest with BWC and Medicaid patients. Patients with private insurance showed a lower risk of moderate and severe depression. However, there was no significant difference when comparing BWC verses all other insurance. Table 1 Conclusions Overall there was no significant difference in risk of anxiety and depression with BWC versus other insurance coverage based on PHQ-4 scores. Limitations of the study include no distinction of extent of burn injury/burn depth, burn care/treatments, length of hospital stay if any;no distinction was made amongst BWC patients and their length of time off of work. A portion of the timeframe reviewed was during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pezzopane, Laura, Gray, Anthea, Cordova, Alfredo C.; Bergus, Katherine, Bernal, Nicole O.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Insurance+Coverage+Does+Not+Increase+Risk+of+Depression+and+Anxiety+in+Burn+Patients","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association; 43(Suppl 1):S193-S194, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30234,""
"Caring for a Family Member Living With Dementia When Adult Day Services Close","Adult Day Service (ADS) centers play an important role in community services that help families keep a person living with dementia (PLWD) at home. We interviewed 33 family caregivers about their experience during the COVID-19 Pandemic and the shutdown of the ADS centers where the PLWD attends. All 33 (100%) reported that the ADS center was shut for a period of time (range: 2 weeks â€“ remain closed). Caregivers reported a decline in their physical health (33%,n=11) and mental health (52%,n=17) and an increase in feelings of loneliness (48%,n=16). For the PLWD, the caregivers noted, a decline in physical (48%,n=16) and mental (55%,n=18) health and an increase in behaviors (39%,n=13). The shutdown of most ADS centers across the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic has had implications not only for the ADS sites but for the families that entrust them with the care for a family member.","Marx, Katherine, Parker, Lauren, Gaugler, Joseph, Dabelko-Schoeny, Holly, Gitlin, Laura","https://www.google.com/search?q=Caring+for+a+Family+Member+Living+With+Dementia+When+Adult+Day+Services+Close","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):110-110, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30235,""
"Awareness And Readiness of Stakeholders on ICT Implementation in Rural Schools","Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is designed to solve challenges that affect humanity. However, the rapid advancement in ICT calls for cutting edge ICT knowledge and upskilling of users. As a result, it is mandatory that jobseekers become computer literate. University students are expected to be computer literate. Therefore, integrating ICT into teaching and learning (T&L) has positive benefits. This study analyses the state of ICT integration at rural schools in the Rekopantswe Area office (5 selected schools) in Ngaka Modiri Molema district in North West province which were selected using a random sampling method. A questionnaire was used to gather data. The results show that the attitudes, awareness, and readiness of educators could be improved through ICT integration as prior knowledge is harnessed. A quantitative research approach was adopted. Research shows that ICT can improve T&L and help them become innovative when appropriate ICT tools are made available. ICT integration requires not only the modernisation of the ICT tools, but significant shifts in the mind-sets of stakeholders' attitudes, roles, and belief systems to construct new knowledge. This awareness and readiness of the stakeholders is also fundamental for the successful integration of ICT projects. The results show that learners and educators are aware of initiative of the South African government to integrate ICT in T&L. The stakeholders exhibited positive attitudes and belief systems though some were not aware of the government's ICT integration initiative. It is unfortunate that schools have not embraced fully ICT integration. With more emphasis on online education in the face of the pandemic, there is need to fund and speed up such ICT integration projects at all the secondary schools, in rural, urban and peri-urban areas.","Maruping, Thabang Edwin, Velempini, Mthulisi","https://www.google.com/search?q=Awareness+And+Readiness+of+Stakeholders+on+ICT+Implementation+in+Rural+Schools","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: African Perspectives of Research in Teaching and Learning; 6(1):199-215, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30236,""
"Mental Health Effects of COVID-19 in Older Adults Are Moderated by Existing Mental Health Needs and Emotional Support","Mitigating mental health consequences is one of the priorities for the society to advance, and the aim of this study is to investigate the mental health effects of COVID-19 in older adults and to explore risk and protective factors. Social workers recruited 722 older adults living in the community (mean age 73.6Â±8.4) from January 2020 to February 2021 in Hong Kong, and interviewed them for basic demographics (age, gender, education, and living status), mental health service use in recent three months (proxy for existing needs), number of people to talk to when feeling down (proxy for emotional support network), and assessed their depression using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Impacts of COVID-19 were indicated by local daily effective reproductive number (Rt) and Nth wave since the start of the pandemic. Generalized linear models (GLM) were applied. Basic demographics were not associated with depression, existing mental health needs (ÃŸ=2.99, p&lt;.001), Rt (ÃŸ=1.08, p&lt;.05) and Nth wave (ÃŸ=0.49, p&lt;.05) were positively associated with depression, while emotional support network was negatively associated with depression (ÃŸ=-2.47, p&lt;.001). There was also a significant interaction between Rt and Nth wave on depression (ÃŸ=0.69, p&lt;.05), suggesting ongoing COVID-19 took a toll on older adultsâ€™ mental health. Three-way interactions between COVID-19 Rt, Nth wave and existing mental health needs (ÃŸ=0.25, p&lt;.05) and emotional support network (ÃŸ=-0.12, p=.07) on depression further indicated that older adults with existing mental health needs warrant more attention, and wider emotional support network may buffer the impact of the pandemic on mental health.","Liu, Tianyin, Lu, Shiyu, Lum, Terry Y.

"Estimation of Prevalence and Comparing the Levels of Stress, Anxiety, Depression, and Psychological Impact Before and After COVID-19 Lockdown Among Front Line Health Care Workers","The main objective of the study is to estimate the prevalence and compare the levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress experienced by the frontline health care workers (HCWs) during the lockdown and post lockdown periods at Apollo Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Hyderabad, India. All participants involved in the study were evaluated by using depression, anxiety and stress scale 21, the impact of event scale revised scale for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a standardized questionnaire. During the lockdown period, the score for depression was observed mean scores to be more in front desk people (2.70) followed by pharmacists and technicians (2.60) and security (2.28) in the lockdown period. During the lockdown, the highest levels of anxiety were seen in security staff (4.72) and housekeeping (4.8), with a considerable increase after the lockdown situation. During the lockdown period, the mean score of pharmacists and technicians (10.33) were more stressed than other HCWs, and the second-highest levels of stress were observed in security (10.11) and front desk workers (10.09), respectively. Our results show that there was a worsening of the psychological impact of the pandemic and an increase in PTSD, stress, anxiety, and depression among HCWs.

"Predictors of Mental Health During the COVID Pandemic","Health professionals have been concerned about mental health of older adults during the COVID pandemic. To explore their experiences, we conducted an online survey of community-dwelling older people to examine their mental health related to stress, based on Pearlinâ€™s Stress Process Model. A snowball approach was used;we sent recruitment e-mails through senior organizations and contacts with e-mail lists of potential participants;there were 504 respondents. We used regression analysis to explore predictors of mental health based on Pearlinâ€™s model. Background characteristics included age (m = 75.7, SD 4.95), gender (77.4% female) and race (White = 93.4%). The CESD-10 provided a measure of mental health. Scores indicated 62.3% of the sample scored in the low range for depressive symptoms and 37.7% in the moderate to high range. Stressors were measured using the Perceived Stress Scale that includes subscales of perceived helplessness and perceived self-efficacy. We also measured perceived social Isolation, and current life space as predictor variables. Results of regressing the CESD-10 onto the set of theoretical predictors revealed that the inclusion both subscales of the Perceived Stress Scale, social isolation, and current life space jointly accounted for approximately 63.0% of the variability in the outcome beyond the baseline model (FChange[4, 449] = 211.15, p &lt; .01), which included age, race, and gender. The model overall, accounted for approximately 66.5% (R2adjusted = 66.0%) of the variability in CESD-10 scores, (F[7, 449] = 127.473, p &lt; .01).

"Loneliness and Depression in College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: the Role of Boredom and Repetitive Negative Thinking","The COVID-19 pandemic triggered increased rates of depression, especially among college students. Due to social distancing guidelines, loneliness has been suspected as a prominent factor in depression during the pandemic. Research is needed to identify possible mechanisms through which loneliness conveys risk for pandemic-era depression. Two potential mechanisms are boredom and repetitive negative thinking (RNT). This study examined cross-sectional associations between depression, loneliness, boredom, and RNT in a sample of college students (N = 199) in April 2020 immediately following campus closure. Results showed a serial indirect effect of loneliness on depression through boredom then RNT. Moreover, specific indirect effects of loneliness on depression were found through boredom and RNT, individually. Though limited by the cross-sectional design, these data align with cognitive-behavioral theory and identify boredom and RNT as possible mechanisms of the association between loneliness and depression in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hager, Nathan M.; Judah, Matt R.; Milam, Alicia L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Loneliness+and+Depression+in+College+Students+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic:+the+Role+of+Boredom+and+Repetitive+Negative+Thinking","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: International journal of cognitive therapy;: 1-19, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30240,""
"The Disruption of Trust in the Digital Transformation Leading to Health 40","The specification and application of policies and guidelines for public health, medical education and training, and screening programmes for preventative medicine are all predicated on trust relationships between medical authorities, health practitioners and patients. These relationships are in turn predicated on a verbal contract that is over two thousand years old. The impact of information and communication technology (ICT), underpinning Health 4.0, has the potential to disrupt this analog relationship in several dimensions;but it also presents an opportunity to strengthen it, and so to increase the take-up and effectiveness of new policies. This paper develops an analytic framework for the trust relationships in Health 4.0, and through three use cases, assesses a medical policy, the introduction of a new technology, and the implications of that technology for the trust relationships. We integrate this assessment in a set of actionable recommendations, in particular that the trust framework should be part of the design methodology for developing and deploying medical applications. In a concluding discussion, we advocate that, in a post-pandemic world, IT to support policies and programmes to address widespread socio-medical problems with mental health, long Covid, physical inactivity and vaccine misinformation will be essential, and for that, strong trust relationships between all the stakeholders are absolutely critical.","Guckert, Michael, Milanovic, Kristina, Hannig, Jennifer, Simon, David, Wettengl, Tamara, Evers, Daniel, Kleyer, Arnd, Keller, Till, Pitt, Jeremy","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Disruption+of+Trust+in+the+Digital+Transformation+Leading+to+Health+4.0","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in digital health; 4, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30241,""

Methods A representative sample of 4918 Chinese college students were surveyed during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic for the first wave and after the new cases steadily declined for the second wave. Mental health was measured by the ten-question Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10). Logistic regression model was fitted to compare changes in psychological distress before and after the peak of the pandemic. Results Of the respondents of both waves, 45.04% reported psychological distress during the initial outbreak of the pandemic and 26.49% reported it when new COVID-19 cases steadily declined. Psychological distress significantly reduced after the peak of the pandemic but persisted in some students. Limitations The study measured psychological distress once after the initial control of the COVID-19. More psychiatric disorders need to be traced as the pandemic continues to evolve. Conclusions Although effective control of COVID-19 benefited young people's mental health, psychiatric disorders continued to be prevalent.

Due to these psychological changes resulting from the stress produced by the disease, we sought to investigate the psychological impact of the pandemic on the university student community. Material and methods 1,283 students were surveyed, of which 1,149 students were selected. The majority of the subjects were female, and the overall average age was of 20 years. They were provided with an 82-question online questionnaire divided into four sections;looking for the prevalence of significant symptomatology of major depression and generalised anxiety using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales;and factors that potentially affect the mental health of our university population. Results We found a high prevalence of significant depression (47.08%) and anxiety (27.06%) symptomatology, considering a score of 10 or more as cut-off point. There was no significant difference in depression and anxiety symptomatology between the health-care students and non-health-care students. Conclusions Our results, together with what is observed in the literature, allow us to conclude that the college student population has a high risk of mental illness, and these should be taken into consideration for the search of effective strategies for detection and control of mental health illnesses.

"Family Caregiving for Persons With Emotional, Developmental, and Behavioral Disorders During COVID-19","COVID-19 has the potential to exacerbate stresses of family caregiving. While studies during COVID-19 have focused on caregivers of those with memory / cognitive issues like Alzheimerâ€™s Disease, less attention has been paid to those caring for persons with emotional / developmental / behavioral disorders. This paper compares family caregivers of persons with emotional / developmental / behavioral disorders (EDB);physical conditions (PH);and memory / cognitive problems (MC) during the early phase of the pandemic. We focus on demographics, caregiving context, COVID-related caregiver stressors, and validated physical, psychosocial, and financial well-being outcomes. We conducted a cross-sectional national online survey during April-May, 2020 (n = 556). The sample included 274 PH (50%), 141 MC (25%), and 141 EDB (25%) caregivers. EDB caregivers were younger, with younger care recipients who were more likely to be their child. EDB caregivers reported more COVID-related caregiver stressors than MC or PH caregivers, including increased caregiving duties (p&lt;.01);more family disagreements about care provision (p=.05);and worsened mental health of the care recipient (p&lt;.01). In multivariate regression models, EDB caregivers had significantly higher anxiety;depression;and fatigue (all p&lt;.01);more sleep disturbance (p=.05);less social participation (p&lt;.05);and poorer overall financial well-being (p&lt;.05). MC caregivers also reported more negative outcomes, but effects were consistently strongest for EDB caregivers. This study shows that EDB caregivers are at significantly elevated risk for negative impacts due to COVID-19 and should receive increased support and attention during this public health crisis.","Beach, Scott, Schulz, Richard, Donovan, Heidi, Rosland, Ann-Marie, Klinedinst, Tara, Kim, Hansol","https://www.google.com/search?q=Family+Caregiving+for+Persons+With+Emotional,+Developmental,+and+Behavioral+Disorders+During+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):450-450, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30246,""
"Age Differences in Anticipated Use of Virtual Healthcare Services After the Pandemic","Healthcare has undergone a significant transformation during the pandemic, with virtual services being rapidly developed and implemented to keep pace with societal needs. This study documented this change in healthcare by examining access and use of video-based, virtual service use before and during the pandemic. Participants for the study (n = 685) included three groups, including retirement-aged persons, middle-aged adults, and traditional college-aged students. Measures for the study included access to and utilization of physical and mental health services, satisfaction with services accessed, and anticipated access and use of virtual services following the pandemic. Results showed that most participants (94.2%) believed that virtual healthcare would persist after the pandemic;three-quarters of adults (75.2%) but only half of college-aged (52.8%) and retirement-aged (57.6%) participants anticipated using virtual healthcare in the future. Prior use and satisfaction with virtual healthcare services mediated anticipated future use for retirement-aged participants (p &lt; .001), but only satisfaction with virtual healthcare was a marginal predictor for college-aged participants (p = .051), and neither were predictors for adult-aged participants. These results support that people believe virtual healthcare will persist after the end of the pandemic, but that there are age-related differences in who anticipates using these services in the future, and which factors will make the most difference in attracting clients. These differences can impact how healthcare providers market and develop further tele-health services to increase the likelihood of use by retirement-aged participants, and suggests that client satisfaction is a key mediator for different age groups.","Murphy, Matthew, Hills, William, Hills, Karen","https://www.google.com/search?q=Age+Differences+in+Anticipated+Use+of+Virtual+Healthcare+Services+After+the+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):990-991, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30247,""
"Teletherapy and hospitalizations in patients with serious mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective multicenter study","Interventions with patients with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) had to adapt rapidly to the COVID-19 safety restrictive measures, leading to the widespread use of teletherapy as an alternative. The aims of this study were to compare the use of different intervention modalities with patients with SMI during the first wave of the pandemic and examine their association with emergency hospital visits and hospitalization rates six months later. Records of 270 service users of fifteen outpatient mental health services across Spain, were retrospectively assessed. We retrieved clinical data and data on the modality of intervention received (in-person, over the phone, videoconferencing) in three time points (before, during and after the first COVID-19 wave). Also, data were retrieved regarding the frequency of their emergency hospital visits and hospitalization rates, two, four and six months later. During the first wave of the pandemic, teletherapy (over the phone and videoconferencing) was the modality most widely used, whilst in-person therapy sessions were significantly reduced, though they seemed to return to pre-COVID levels after the first wave had passed. Importantly, patients receiving teletherapy during the first wave seemed to have significantly fewer emergency visits and hospitalization rates four and six months later (Ãâ€¡2 = 13.064; p &lt; .001). Multilevel analyses revealed that patients receiving videoconferencing interventions had fewer hospitalizations six months after the first wave (OR = 0.25; p = .012). Under challenging circumstances as those created by the COVID pandemic, teletherapy is a useful tool for protection against hospitalizations and can be used as an alternative to in-person therapy, to ensure continuity of care for patients with SMI.","SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Guarnido, Urquiza, SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Masferrer, Perles, Petkari","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267209","20220418","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30248,""

"The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Breathing and Music Therapy Practice on Nurses' Stress, Work-Related Strain, and Psychological Well-being During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Infectious diseases cause psychological problems for health care workers and especially nurses. Nurses who provided coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients with care experience negative feelings such as stress, work-related strain, discomfort, and helplessness related to their high-intensity work. The aims of this study are to investigate the effect of the mindfulness-based breathing and music therapy practice on stress, work-related strain, and psychological well-being levels of nurses who provided COVID-19 patients with care. This randomized controlled trial was conducted in a COVID-19 department at a university hospital in Turkey. Nurses who care for patients infected with COVID-19 were randomly divided into an intervention group (n = 52) and a no-treatment control group (n = 52). The intervention group received mindfulness-based breathing and music therapy. In data collection, the Personal Information Form, State Anxiety Inventory, Work-Related Strain Scale, and Psychological Well-Being Scale were used. The data from the study showed that mindfulness-based breathing and music therapy decreased stress and work-related strain (P &lt; .05) and increased psychological well-being (P &lt; .05). The control group showed no statistically significant changes on these measures (P &gt; .05).

"Factors influencing increased use of technology to communicate with others during the COVID-19 pandemic?: A quantitative analysis","Communication via technology is regarded as an effective way of maintaining social connection and helping individuals to cope with the psychological impact of social distancing measures during a pandemic. However, there is little information about which factors that have influenced increased use of technology to communicate with others during lockdown and whether this has changed over time. To explore which psychosocial factors (e.g., mental health and employment) and pandemic-related factors (e.g., shielding and time) influenced an increase in communication via technology during the first lockdown in the United Kingdom (UK). A cross-sectional, online survey was conducted between April and July 2020, examining thoughts, feelings and behaviours associated with the pandemic, including communicating more using technology (e.g., by messaging, phone, or video). We collected sociodemographic information, employment status, mental health service user status, and depression symptoms. We used hierarchical logistic regression to test which factors influenced communicating more using technology during lockdown. Participants (n1464) were on average 41.27 (SD = 14.51) years old, mostly women (78%), White (86%), employed (70%), reported a mild level of depression (9.42, SD = 7.03), and were communicating more using technology (79.5%, n1164). The hierarchical regression indicated that people who were employed and experiencing lower levels of depression were more likely to report increased communication using technology during a lockdown period within the COVID-19 pandemic and over time, men communicated more using technology. Increased use of technology to communicate was related to greater communication and the inability to see others due to the social distancing measures during lockdown. It was not related to a general increase in technology use during lockdown. Although most participants reported increased use of technology to communicate during a lockdown period with the COVID-19 pandemic, this was more apparent in the employed and those experiencing low levels of depression. Moving forward, we should continue to monitor groups who may have been excluded from the benefits of support and communication using technology.","Dawe-Lane, Mutepua, Morris, Odoi, Wilson, Evans, Pinfold, Wykes, Jilka, Simblett","https://doi.org/10.2196/31251","20220418","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30251,""
"A medical student-led model for telephone-based opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution during the COVID-19 pandemic","<i>Background:</i> The co-occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic and opioid epidemic has increased the risk of overdose and death for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). COVID-19 has also exacerbated already limited access to opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND). In this context, we aim to increase access to OEND for patients at risk for opioid overdose. <i>Methods:</i> Medical student volunteers were trained to conduct telephone-based OEND, and subsequently contacted all patients at a NYC primary care clinic for people who use drugs as well as those presenting to the hospital with OUD or a history of opioid overdose. Interested patients who completed the training received naloxone kits via mail or at hospital discharge. <i>Results:</i> OEND provision was converted to a remote-only model from May to June 2020. During this time, eight pre-clinical medical students called a total of 503 high-risk patients. Of these patients, 165 were reached, with 90 (55%) accepting telephone-based OEND. Comparing across populations, 51% of primary care patients versus 76% of ED/hospitalized patients accepted opioid overdose education. Eighty-four total patients received naloxone. <i>Conclusions:</i> We have outlined a scalable, adaptable model by which clinics and hospitals with affiliated medical schools can provide OEND by telephone. Medical student-driven, telephone-based OEND efforts can effectively reach at-risk patients and increase naloxone access.","Hughes, Kalicki, Huxley-Reicher, Toribio, Samuels, Weiss, Herscher, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2022.2060426","20220418","COVID-19 response; medical student education; naloxone; opioid overdose; patient education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30252,""
"Psychotropic medication prescribing trends in a developmental-behavioural clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic","Psychotropic medication prescribing among children with developmental-behavioural and mental health problems appears to be rising globally. We aim to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and rapid introduction of telehealth consultations on the prescribing trends and medication change in a large paediatric public hospital developmental-behavioural outpatient service. Data for developmental-behavioural outpatient encounters from 23 March 2019 to 22 March 2021 were extracted from the electronic medical record; representing the 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months following the conversion to telehealth consultations during the onset of COVID-19 pandemic and the 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months prior to this change. Excel and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences were used to calculate percentages and logistic regression to compare psychotropic prescribing trends during both periods. During the pandemic, there were a total of 3201 encounters (92.0% telehealth), compared with 2759 encounters (1.6% telehealth) during the previous year. Despite the higher number of encounters during the pandemic, the rates of encounters with psychotropic medication prescriptions reduced compared to the previous 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months (19.8% vs. 29.3%). Prescriptions made during COVID-19 were more likely to be provided at review visits, patients Ã¢â€°Â¥12Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and during consultant led encounters. The reduction in prescriptions involved both new and follow-up psychotropic medications. The majority of follow-up medication dosages were left unchanged. Psychotropic prescribing rates were lower during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"One Year of COVID-19 in Spain, Longitudinal Study on Mental and Physical Health","The objective of this longitudinal study carried out with the same participants, with two repeated measurements, the first taken in March 2020 (M1) and the second measurement in March 2021 (M2), is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout one year on the levels of Affect, Psychological Well-being, Depression and Mental and Physical Health, as well as to learn about the evolution of those levels from M1 to M2. Comparison of the mean scores of the variables analyzed between the two measurements (M1 and M2) show significant differences in the following scales: Positive Affect (PANAS), with lower scores at M2; Total Depression (BDI-II) and the two Cognitive-Affective and Somatic-Motivational factors, with higher scores at M2; the physical and mental health scales (SF-36) of Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, and Mental Health, and the two Physical and Mental Health components, with lower scores at M2 in all of them; and the Purpose in Life (PWB) scale, with a lower score at M2. We can conclude that the one-year pandemic situation has affected all the variables analyzed in this work, showing a decrease in positive affect, an increase in the score of the depression inventory, worse physical and mental health, and less psychological well-being. Throughout the pandemic year, the results show that age has a moderation effect on the Somatic-Motivational factor and on the Total Depression, Physical Functioning, Vitality, and Role Emotional scales.

"The relationship between frontline nurses' skin lesions and their anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic: exploring the mediating role of fear and resilience","To explore the mediating roles of fear and resilience on the relationship between clinical nurses' reporting of skin lesions and their anxiety and depression during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Prolonged personal protective equipment wearing may cause severe skin lesions among clinical nurses. The possible relationship between clinical nurses' reporting of skin lesions and their anxiety and depression remains unknown. Moreover, little is known about what factors could mediate such a relationship. A cross-sectional online survey. CHERRIES was used to report results. Of 2014 participants, 94.8% (n=1910) reported skin lesions. Skin lesions were positively related to anxiety (p&lt;.001, ÃŽÂ²=.228, SE=.099) and depression (p&lt;.001, ÃŽÂ²=.187, SE=.093). Fear activated while resilience buffered the relationship between clinical nurses' reporting of skin lesions and anxiety, and between skin lesions and depression. Reduced fear and enhanced resilience level were related to decreased levels of anxiety and depression among clinical nurses. Nurse managers should evaluate the occurrence and severity of clinical nurses' skin lesions, arrange reasonable working duration to relieve skin lesions, provide appropriate psychological support to reduce clinical nurses' fear, and implement various strategies to enhance their resilience, thereby decreasing their anxiety and depression.","Yang, Ke, Chan, Liu, Lin, Li, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13638","20220418","COVID-19; anxiety; clinical nurses; depression; fear; resilience; skin lesions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30258,""
"Moral Distress Experienced by US Nurses on the Frontlines During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for Nursing Policy and Practice","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic represents the largest contemporary challenge to the nursing workforce in the 21<sup>st</sup> century given the high stress and prolonged strain it has created for both human and healthcare supply resources. Nurses on the frontlines providing patient care during COVID-19 have faced unrivaled psychological and physical demands. However, no known large-scale qualitative study has described the emotions experienced by nurses providing patient care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Objective: Therefore, the purpose of this study was to qualitatively describe the emotions experienced by US nurses during the initial COVID-19 pandemic response. One hundred individual interviews were conducted with nurses across the United States from May to September of 2020 asking participants to describe how they felt taking care of COVID-19 patients. All interviews followed a semi-structured interview guide, were audio recorded, transcribed, verified, and coded by the research team. Participants narratives of the emotions they experienced providing patient care during COVID-19 unequivocally described (1) moral distress, and moral distress related (1.1) fear, (1.2) frustration, (1.3) powerlessness, and (1.4) guilt. In sum, the major emotional response of nurses across the US providing patient care during the pandemic was that of moral distress. Investments in healthcare infrastructures that address moral distress in nurses may improve retention and reduce burnout in the US nursing workforce.","Simonovich, Webber-Ritchey, Spurlark, Florczak, Mueller Wiesemann, Ponder, Reid, Shino, Stevens, Aquino, Badowski, Lattner, Soco, Krawczyk, Amer","https://doi.org/10.1177/23779608221091059","20220418","COVID-19; mental health; public health; qualitative research; research; workforce","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30259,""

"Does COVID-19 increase the risk of neuropsychiatric sequelae? Evidence from a mendelian randomization approach","Observational studies based on electronic health records (EHR) report an increased risk of neurological/neuropsychiatric sequelae for patients who have had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, these studies may suffer from biases such as unmeasured confounding, residual reverse causality, or lack of precision in EHR-based diagnoses. To rule out these biases, we tested causal links between COVID-19 and different potential neurological/neuropsychiatric sequelae through a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis of summary statistics from large Genome-Wide Association Scans of susceptibility to COVID-19 and different neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, stroke, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. We found robust evidence suggesting that COVID-19 - notably the hospitalized and most severe forms - carries an increased risk of neuropsychiatric sequelae, particularly Alzheimer's disease, and to a lesser extent anxiety disorder. In line with a large longitudinal EHR-based study, this evidence was stronger for more severe COVID-19 forms. These results call for a targeted screening strategy to tackle the post-COVID neuropsychiatric pandemic.","Tirozzi, Santonastaso, de Gaetano, Iacoviello, Gialluisi","https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v12.i3.536","20220418","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; Anxiety; COVID-19; Mendelian randomization; Neurological disorders; Neuropsychiatric disorders; Sars-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30262,""

"Experiences and views of frontline healthcare workers' family members in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a well-documented negative impact on the mental health and wellbeing of frontline healthcare workers (HCWs). Whilst no research has to date been carried out to explore the challenges experienced by the families of HCWs, some previous research has been conducted with military families, demonstrating that family members of deployed military personnel may also be affected seriously and negatively. This study aimed to explore the experiences, views, and mental health impact on frontline HCWs' families during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and what support the families of frontline HCWs may need. Close family members and friends of HCWs were interviewed. Transcripts were analysed in line with the principles of reflexive thematic analysis. We completed fourteen interviews with three siblings, one mother, one friend, and nine spouses of HCWs. Family members were highly motivated to support healthcare workers and felt an intense sense of pride in their work. However, they also experienced increased domestic responsibilities and emotional burden due to anxiety about their loved ones' work. The fact that sacrifices made by family members were not noticed by society, the anxiety they felt about their family's physical health, the impact of hearing about traumatic experiences, and the failure of healthcare organisations to meet the needs of the HCWs all negatively affected the family members. We have an ethical responsibility to attend to the experiences and needs of the families of healthcare professionals. This study emphasises the experiences and needs of family members of healthcare professionals, which have hitherto been missing from the literature. Further research is needed to hear from more parents, siblings and friends, partners in same sex relationships, as well as children of HCWs, to explore the variety of family members and supporters' experiences more fully. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ COVID19 has impacted families of HCWs as well as workers themselves. They have experienced more anxiety, increased practical burden, significant physical health risks and been exposed vicariously to workers' traumatic experiences. We must ensure HCW families are better supported. <b>Antecedentes:</b> La pandemia de COVID-19 ha tenido un impacto negativo bien documentado en la salud mental y bienestar de los trabajadores de la salud de la primera lÃƒÂ­nea (HCWs por sus siglas en ingles). Mientras que hasta la fecha no se han llevado a cabo investigaciones que exploren los desafÃƒÂ­os experimentados por las familias de los HCWs, algunas investigaciones previas fueron realizadas con familias de militares, demostrando que los miembros de la familia del personal militar desplegado tambiÃƒÂ©n pueden ser afectados seria y negativamente.<b>Objetivos:</b> Este estudio apuntÃƒÂ³ a explorar las experiencias, puntos de vista, y el impacto en la salud mental de las familias de los HCWs de la primera lÃƒÂ­nea durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en el Reino Unido y quÃƒÂ© apoyo estas familias podrÃƒÂ­an necesitar.<b>MÃƒÂ©todo:</b> Completamos catorce entrevistas con tres hermanos, una madre, un amigo y nueve esposas de HCWs. Los familiares estaban altamente motivados en apoyar a los trabajadores de la salud y sintieron un intenso sentido de orgullo por su trabajo. Sin embargo, tambiÃƒÂ©n experimentaron un aumento en las responsabilidades domÃƒÂ©sticas y en la carga emocional debido a la ansiedad sobre el trabajo de sus seres queridos. El hecho de que el sacrificio hecho por los familiares no fuera notado por la sociedad, la ansiedad que sintieron sobre la salud fÃƒÂ­sica de su familia, el impacto de escuchar sobre experiencias traumÃƒÂ¡ticas y la falla de las organizaciones de salud en conocer las necesidades de los HCWs, todo ello afectÃƒÂ³ negativamente a los familiares.<b>Conclusiones:</b> Tenemos una responsabilidad ÃƒÂ©tica de abordar las experiencias y necesidades de los familiares de los profesionales de la salud. Este estudio enfatiza las experiencias y necesidades de los familiares de los profesionales de la salud, que hasta ahora no han aparecido en la literatura. Se necesita mayor investigaciÃƒÂ³n para escuchar a mÃƒÂ¡s padres, hermanos y amigos, parejas en relaciones del mismo sexo, asÃƒÂ­ como de hijos de HCWs, para explorar de forma mÃƒÂ¡s completa la variedad de las experiencias de las familias y personas de apoyo. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b> COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜Ëœ (HCW) Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¸Ã§Â¦ÂÃ¤ÂºÂ§Ã§â€Å¸Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦ÂÂ®Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â´Å¸Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¨â„¢Â½Ã§â€žÂ¶Ã¨â€¡Â³Ã¤Â»Å Ã¥Â°Å¡Ã¦Å“ÂªÃ¥Â¼â‚¬Ã¥Â±â€¢Ã¤Â»Â»Ã¤Â½â€¢Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã¦Å½Â¢Ã¨Â®Â¨ HCW Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¦â€°â‚¬Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¤Â¸Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Å’â€˜Ã¦Ë†ËœÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥â€¦Ë†Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥â€ â€ºÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã¦ËœÅ½Ã¦Å“ÂÃ¥Â½Â¹Ã¥â€ â€ºÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¤Â¹Å¸Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¥Ââ€”Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã¤Â¸Â¥Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¨Â´Å¸Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¦â€”Â¨Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦Å½Â¢Ã¨Â®Â¨Ã¨â€¹Â±Ã¥â€ºÂ½ COVID-19 Ã§â€“Â«Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§Â»ÂÃ¥Å½â€ Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¨Â§â€šÃ§â€šÂ¹Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã©â€¡â€¡Ã¨Â®Â¿Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¤ÂºÂ²Ã¥Â¯â€ Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¦Å“â€¹Ã¥Ââ€¹Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦â€“â€¡Ã¥Â­â€”Ã§Â¨Â¿Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ§Â¬Â¦Ã¥ÂË†Ã¥ÂÂÃ¨ÂºÂ«Ã¤Â¸Â»Ã©Â¢ËœÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å½Å¸Ã¥Ë†â„¢Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¥Â®Å’Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¤Âºâ€ Ã¥Â¯Â¹ HCW Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸â€°Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¥â€¦â€žÃ¥Â¼Å¸Ã¥Â§ÂÃ¥Â¦Â¹Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¤Â½ÂÃ¦Â¯ÂÃ¤ÂºÂ²Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¤Â½ÂÃ¦Å“â€¹Ã¥Ââ€¹Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â¹ÂÃ¤Â½ÂÃ©â€¦ÂÃ¥ÂÂ¶Ã§Å¡â€ž 14 Ã¦Â¬Â¡Ã¨Â®Â¿Ã¨Â°Ë†Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ©ÂÅ¾Ã¥Â¸Â¸Ã§Â§Â¯Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¥Å“Â°Ã¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ§Æ’Ë†Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨â€¡ÂªÃ¨Â±ÂªÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ§â€žÂ¶Ã¨â‚¬Å’Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã§â€Â±Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤ÂºÂ²Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥Â·Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¤Â¹Å¸Ã§Â»ÂÃ¥Å½â€ Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¨Â´Â£Ã¤Â»Â»Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¨Â´Å¸Ã¦â€¹â€¦Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥ÂÅ¡Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§â€°ÂºÃ§â€°Â²Ã¦Â²Â¡Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¨Â¢Â«Ã§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¦Â³Â¨Ã¦â€žÂÃ¥Ë†Â°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¨ÂºÂ«Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥ÂÂ¬Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã§Â»ÂÃ¥Å½â€ Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¦Å¾â€žÃ¦Å“ÂªÃ¨Æ’Â½Ã¦Â»Â¡Ã¨Â¶Â³Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ©Å“â‚¬Ã¦Â±â€šÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ©Æ’Â½Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¤ÂºÂ§Ã§â€Å¸Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨Â´Å¸Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦Â³Â¨Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤Â¸â€œÃ¤Â¸Å¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§Â»ÂÃ¥Å½â€ Ã¥â€™Å’Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¦Â±â€šÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¼Â¦Ã§Ââ€ Ã¨Â´Â£Ã¤Â»Â»Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Å“Â¬Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ¨Â°Æ’Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨â€¡Â³Ã¤Â»Å Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§â€ºÂ´Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦â€“â€¡Ã§Å’Â®Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã§Â¼ÂºÃ¥Â¤Â±Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤Â¸â€œÃ¤Â¸Å¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§Â»ÂÃ¥Å½â€ Ã¥â€™Å’Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¦Â±â€šÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ©Å“â‚¬Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¨Â¿â€ºÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¦Â­Â¥Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÂ¬Ã¥Ââ€“Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã§Ë†Â¶Ã¦Â¯ÂÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¥â€¦â€žÃ¥Â¼Å¸Ã¥Â§ÂÃ¥Â¦Â¹Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦Å“â€¹Ã¥Ââ€¹Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â³Â»Ã¤Â¼Â´Ã¤Â¾Â£Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥Å’Â»Ã¦Å Â¤Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â­ÂÃ¥Â¥Â³Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€žÂÃ¨Â§ÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥â€¦Â¨Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã¥Å“Â°Ã¦Å½Â¢Ã¨Â®Â¨Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥â€™Å’Ã¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ¨â‚¬â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Ââ€žÃ§Â§ÂÃ§Â»ÂÃ¥Å½â€ Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Tekin, Glover, Greene, Lamb, Murphy, Billings","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2022.2057166","20220418","Secondary trauma; family members; healthcare workers; occupational trauma; qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30264,""
"Humoral and Cellular Immune Responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccination in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis: An Israeli Multi-Center Experience Following 3 Vaccine Doses","Immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive activity of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease modifying therapies (DMTs) might affect immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 exposure or vaccination in patients with MS (PwMS). We evaluated the effect of DMTs on humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to 2 and 3 vaccinations and the longevity of SARS-Cov-2 IgG levels in PwMS. 522 PwMS and 68 healthy controls vaccinated with BNT162b2-Pfizer mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, or recovering from COVID-19, were recruited in a nation-wide multi-center study. Blood was collected at 3 time-points: 2-16 weeks and ~6 months post 2<sup>nd</sup> vaccination and 1-16 weeks following 3<sup>rd</sup> vaccination. Serological responses were measured by quantifying IgG levels against the spike-receptor-binding-domain of SARS-CoV-2, and cellular responses (in a subgroup analysis) by quantifying IFNÃŽÂ³ secretion in blood incubated with COVID-19 spike-antigen. 75% PwMS were seropositive post 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> vaccination. IgG levels decreased by 82% within 6 months from vaccination (p&lt;0.0001), but were boosted 10.3 fold by the 3<sup>rd</sup> vaccination (p&lt;0.0001), and 1.8 fold compared to Ã¢â€°Â¤3m post 2<sup>nd</sup> vaccination (p=0.025). Patients treated with most DMTs were seropositive post 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> vaccinations, however only 38% and 44% of ocrelizumab-treated patients and 54% and 46% of fingolimod-treated patients, respectively, were seropositive. Similarly, in COVID-19-recovered patients only 54% of ocrelizumab-treated, 75% of fingolimod-treated and 67% of cladribine-treated patients were seropositive. A time interval of Ã¢â€°Â¥5 months between ocrelizumab infusion and vaccination was associated with higher IgG levels (p=0.039 post-2<sup>nd</sup> vaccination; p=0.036 post-3<sup>rd</sup> vaccination), and with higher proportions of seropositive patients. Most fingolimod- and ocrelizumab-treated patients responded similarly to 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> vaccination. IFNÃŽÂ³-T-cell responses were detected in 89% and 63% of PwMS post 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> vaccination, however in only 25% and 0% of fingolimod-treated patients, while in 100% and 86% of ocrelizumab-treated patients, respectively. PwMS treated with most DMTs developed humoral and T-cell responses following 2 and 3 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. Fingolimod- or ocrelizumab-treated patients had diminished humoral responses, and fingolimod compromised the cellular responses, with no improvement after a 3<sup>rd</sup> booster. Vaccination following &gt;5 months since ocrelizumab infusion was associated with better sero-positivity. These findings may contribute to the development of treatment-stratified vaccination guidelines for PwMS.","Milo, Staun-Ram, Karussis, Karni, Hellmann, Bar-Haim, Miller, Glass-Marmor, Volkovitz, Dishon, Dishon, Kugelman, Nitsan, Alkrenawi, Hovel, Michal, Loew-Shavit, Mizrahi, Zafrani, Petrou, Eddine-Yaghmour, Ginzberg, Kassis, Halimi, Regev, Kolb, Vigiser, Piora, Komarov, Hindi, Wilf-Yarkoni, Lotan, Uri, Rotem, Cohen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.868915","20220418","COVID-19; IgG; SARS-CoV-2; T-cell immune response; autoimmunity; disease modifying therapies (DMTs); humoral response; multiple sclerosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30265,""
"Female Reproductive Health Disturbance Experienced During the COVID-19 Pandemic Correlates With Mental Health Disturbance and Sleep Quality","The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected population mental health. Periods of psychological distress can induce menstrual dysfunction. We previously demonstrated a significant disruption in women's reproductive health during the first 6 months of the pandemic. The present study investigates longer-term reproductive and mental health disturbances. A cross-sectional online survey was completed by 1335 women of reproductive age in April 2021. It included validated standardized measures of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7) and sleep quality (PSQI). 581 (56%) of women reported an overall change in their menstrual cycle since the beginning of the pandemic. There was no change in median cycle length [28 days (28-30)] or days of menses [5 (4-5)], but there was a wider variability in minimum (p&lt;0.0001) and maximum (p&lt;0.0001) cycle length. There was a significant increase in heavy menstrual bleeding, painful periods and missed periods compared to pre-pandemic (all p&lt;0.0001). 64% of women reported worsening pre-menstrual symptoms. Rates of severe depression, anxiety and poor sleep were more than double those from large scale representative community samples. Poor sleep quality was an independent predictor of overall change in menstrual cycle (OR=1.11, 95%CI 1.05-1.18), and missed periods (OR=1.11, 95%CI 1.03-1.19) during the pandemic. Increased anxiety was independently associated with a change from non-painful to painful periods (OR=1.06, 95%CI 1.01-1.11) and worsening of pre-menstrual symptoms (OR=1.06, 95%CI 1.01-1.07) during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to bear a significant impact on female reproductive health. Increased levels of psychological distress and poor sleep are associated with menstrual cycle disruption.","Maher, O' Keeffe, Phelan, Behan, Collier, Hevey, Owens","https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2022.838886","20220418","COVID-19; dysmenorrhea; heavy menstrual bleeding; libido; menstrual abnormalities; oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea; psychological distress; reproductive health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30266,""
"Gender Difference in Psychological, Cognitive, and Behavioral Patterns Among University Students During COVID-19: A Machine Learning Approach","The COVID-19 pandemic affects all population segments and is especially detrimental to university students because social interaction is critical for a rewarding campus life and valuable learning experiences. In particular, with the suspension of in-person activities and the adoption of virtual teaching modalities, university students face drastic changes in their physical activities, academic careers, and mental health. Our study applies a machine learning approach to explore the gender differences among U.S. university students in response to the global pandemic. Leveraging a proprietary survey dataset collected from 322 U.S. university students, we employ association rule mining (ARM) techniques to identify and compare psychological, cognitive, and behavioral patterns among male and female participants. To formulate our task under the conventional ARM framework, we model each unique question-answer pair of the survey questionnaire as a market basket item. Consequently, each participant's survey report is analogous to a customer's transaction on a collection of items. Our findings suggest that significant differences exist between the two gender groups in psychological distress and coping strategies. In addition, the two groups exhibit minor differences in cognitive patterns and consistent preventive behaviors. The identified gender differences could help professional institutions to facilitate customized advising or counseling for males and females in periods of unprecedented challenges.","Zhao, Ding, Shen, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.772870","20220418","COVID-19; association rule mining; gender difference; mental health; university student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30267,""
"The Effect of Risk Perception on Anxiety in Emerging Adulthood Under the Local Outbreak of COVID-19: A Conditional Process Analysis","This study aims to explore the influence mechanism of COVID-19 risk perception on anxiety in emerging adulthood in the context of public health events of the second round of COVID-19 outbreaks and provide support for exploring the path of mental health after the normalization of the epidemic situation. An online questionnaire, combined with community social work, was used in this study, and data of 522 emerging adults were collected in February 2021. The Perceived Risk of COVID-19 pandemic scale (PRCPS), the generalized anxiety disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, the scale of affect balance, and the connor-davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) were used to investigate. The results showed that: first, the risk perception of COVID-19 in early adulthood was positively predictive of anxiety symptoms [<i>B</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.110, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05, 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°(0.042, 0.176)]. Second, the affective quality of life plays a mediating role between the risk perception of COVID-19 and anxiety [<i>B</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.108, 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°(0.060, 0.161)]. Thirdly, resilience plays a moderating role between the risk perception of COVID-19 and anxiety, the higher the resilience of emerging adulthood, the weaker effects of the risk perception of COVID-19 negative prediction of anxiety [<i>B</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.110, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001, 95%CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°(-0.170, -0.049)]. Therefore, to control the anxiety of emerging adulthood in public health events, we should pay attention to the propaganda and management of epidemic information, improve the quality of life, and attention should be paid to the emerging adulthood with low resilience.","Fu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.759510","20220418","COVID-19; anxiety; emerging adults; resilience; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30268,""
"Mindfulness as a Protective Factor Against Depression, Anxiety and Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Emotion Regulation and Insomnia Symptoms as Mediators","Research has linked mindfulness to improved mental health, yet the mechanisms underlying this relationship are not well understood. This study explored the mediating role of emotion regulation strategies and sleep in the relationship between mindfulness and symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. As detailed in this study's pre-registration (osf.io/k9qtw), a cross-sectional research design was used to investigate the impact of mindfulness on mental health and the mediating role of emotion regulation strategies (i.e., cognitive reappraisal, rumination and suppression) and insomnia. A total of 493 participants from the general population answered an online survey and were included in the final analysis. The online survey consisted of the short form of the Five-Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-SF), the Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R), the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), the short form of the Rumination Response Scale (RSS-SF), and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Structural equation modelling revealed that mindfulness was related to lower symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological distress, both directly and indirectly. Mindfulness was negatively associated with rumination and insomnia. As hypothesised, models revealed that the associations between mindfulness and depression, anxiety and psychological distress were significantly mediated by its negative associations with rumination and insomnia. Our findings also demonstrated that rumination was related to increased insomnia symptoms, which in turn was associated with increased mental health problems, indicating a mediated mediation. Mindfulness was also positively associated with cognitive reappraisal and negatively associated with suppression, which were, respectively, negatively and positively associated with depressive symptoms, and thus functioned as specific mediators of the association between mindfulness and depression. Our findings suggest that rumination and insomnia operate transdiagnostically as interrelated mediators of the effects of mindfulness on mental health, whereas cognitive reappraisal and suppression function as specific mediators for depression. These insights emphasise the importance of targeting emotion regulation and sleep in mindfulness interventions for improving mental health. Limitations and implications for practice are discussed.","Mamede, Merkelbach, Noordzij, Denktas","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.820959","20220418","anxiety; depression; emotion regulation; insomnia; mindfulness; rumination; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30269,""
"The Prevalence of and Factors Associated With Anxiety and Depression Among Working-Age Adults in Mainland China at the Early Remission Stage of the Coronavirus 2019 Pandemic","The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has led to a considerable proportion of adverse psychological symptoms in different subpopulations. This study aimed to investigate the status of anxiety and depression and their associated factors in the adult, working-age population in Mainland China at the early remission stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. An online study was conducted among 1,863 participants in 29 provinces in Mainland China from March 23 to 31, 2020. Their mental health was evaluated by the generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) and the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9). Descriptive analysis, Chi-square, and multiple logistic regressions were applied. About 44.5% of the participants had anxiety, 49.2% had depression, and 37.9% showed a combination of depression and anxiety. Around 83.7% of the participants claimed that the pandemic had a negative impact on their medical needs, which was the primary predictor of mental health, the degree of impact being positively related to the prevalence of anxiety and depression. More chronic diseases, moderate to bad self-rated health, severe perceived infection risk, and younger age group were the common risk factors for anxiety and depression. Having no children, unemployment, and a college-level educational background were associated with higher anxiety prevalence, whereas unmarried participants were correlated with higher depression prevalence. The working-age population showed a relatively high risk of anxiety and depression in Mainland China at the early remission stage of the pandemic.

This study intended to invest whether perceived threat avoidability of COVID-19 relates to psychic anxiety among college students during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the mediating roles of COVID-19-specific wishful thinking and COVID-19-specific protective behaviors in this relationship. A cross-sectional study was conducted in China, using a random sampling method (February 6-25, 2020). Self-reported questionnaires were conducted online included the Perceived Threat Avoidability of COVID-19 Scale, COVID-19-specific Wishful Thinking Scale, COVID-19-specific Protective Behaviors Scale, and the Hamilton Psychogenic Anxiety Scale. The data were analyzed using Structural equation modeling and Bootstrapping procedure. A total of 2922 samples were collected in this study. Perceived threat avoidability of COVID-19 is negatively related to psychic anxiety (ÃŽÂ² = -0.158, <i>p</i>&lt; 0.001), and both COVID-19-specific wishful thinking (ÃŽÂ² = -0.006, <i>p</i> = 0.029, 95% CI: [-0.012, -0.001]) and protective behaviors (ÃŽÂ² = -0.029, <i>p</i>&lt; 0.001, 95% CI: [-0.043, -0.018]) mediate this relationship. Also, COVID-19-specific wishful thinking is found to correlate with COVID-19-specific protective behaviors negatively (ÃŽÂ² = -0.112, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Perceived threat avoidability of COVID-19 contributes to psychic anxiety among college students. COVID-19-specific wishful thinking strategy plays a negative mediating role and increases the level of anxiety; COVID-19-specific protective behaviors strategy plays a positive mediating role and reduces the level of anxiety; meanwhile, wishful thinking also suppresses college students from adopting protective behaviors.","Wu, Zheng, Xiong, Zhang, Guo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.854698","20220418","COVID-19; anxiety; cognition; coping strategy; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30271,""
"The Psychometric Properties of the French-Canadian Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 Scale for Measuring the Viral Anxiety of the General Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study examined the psychometric properties of the French-Canadian version of the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 items (SAVE-6) scale for assessing the anxiety response to the viral epidemic among the general population in Quebec, Canada. A total of 590 participants responded to a confidential online survey between September 28 and October 18, 2020. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to explore the factor structure of the scale. Psychometric properties were assessed using the Item Response Theory (IRT) approach. To explore the convergent validity, a Pearson correlation analysis between the SAVE-6 scale and the depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2, PHQ-2) or anxiety subscale (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2, GAD-2) of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 items scale was conducted. The French-Canadian version of the SAVE-6 scale was clustered into a single factor. The CFA of the SAVE-6 scale showed a good model fit (CFI = 0.985, TLI = 0.976, RMSEA = 0.051, RSM<i>R</i> = 0.048), and the multi-group CFA revealed that the SAVE-6 scale can measure anxiety response in the same way across gender or the presence of elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms. It showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.76, McDonald's Omega = 0.77) and significant correlation with the PHQ-2 score and GAD-2 score. The IRT model suggested the efficiency in discrimination among individuals in this latent trait. The French-Canadian version of the SAVE-6 scale is a valid and reliable rating scale, which can measure the general population's anxiety response to the viral epidemic.","Park, Ahmed, Lee, Suh, Chung, Gouin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.807312","20220418","COVID-19; SAVE-6; anxiety; health personnel; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30272,""
"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Toward Coronavirus and Associated Anxiety Symptoms Among University Students: A Cross-Sectional Study During the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh","University students' knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) toward COVID-19 are vital to prevent the spread of the virus, especially in the context of developing countries. Consequently, the present study aimed to determine the KAP levels of university students and associated anxiety during the earlier stage of the pandemic in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional, online study with 544 university students was conducted during April 17-May 1, 2020. The questionnaire incorporated several KAP-related test items aligned with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Anxiety was measured with the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between KAP levels and anxiety adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Subgroup analyses included rerunning models stratified by gender and quarantine status. Approximately 50% of students showed high levels of knowledge about COVID-19 guidelines, 59% reported behavioral practices that aligned with COVID-19 guidelines, and 39% had negative attitudes toward COVID-19 guidelines. Attitudes differed by anxiety (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 23.55, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); specifically, negative attitudes were associated with higher anxiety (OR: 2.40, 95% CI = 1.66-3.46, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).

Stratified analyses found non-quarantined students with negative attitudes had three times the chance of experiencing anxiety (OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.98-4.98, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Non-quarantined students with low levels of knowledge had half the chance of developing anxiety (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.31-0.78, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Based on these findings, it is recommended that university authorities continue to prioritize proactive and effective measures to develop higher levels of knowledge, more positive attitudes and better behavioral practices regarding COVID-19 for the mental health of their students.","Patwary, Disha, Bardhan, Haque, Kabir, Billah, Hossain, Alam, Browning, Shuvo, Piracha, Zhao, Swed, Shah, Shoib","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.856202","20220418","Bangladesh; COVID-19; KAP; anxiety; cross-sectional; knowledge; university student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30273,""
"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Emotional Impact on Healthcare Professions","The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in March 2020, has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people around the world in just a few months, putting at great risk the commitment of healthcare workers unprepared to manage a worldwide phenomenon at great risk. In the early stages especially, medical staff had to deal with the pandemic at the expense of their physical and mental health, putting them particularly at risk for experiencing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study aims to analyze the psychopathological aspects associated with PTSD, focusing on the emotional impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare professionals compared with a control group. The sample analyzed over 2 months, from March to May 2021, included 214 participants into two groups, i.e., healthcare professionals (<i>N</i> = 107) and a control group (<i>N</i> = 107). The online assessment instrument used consisted of an anonymous questionnaire, assembled <i>ad hoc</i> with demographic information and different standardized assessment scales (e.g., Fear of COVID-19 scale, Profile of Mood States, and Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey), while a further section of the survey used the DSM-5 criteria to investigate Posttraumatic stress disorder (e.g., COVID-19-PTSD). The results reported that healthcare professionals had a consistent perception of stress (mean = 26.18, <i>SD</i> = 14.60), but not at a level significantly higher than other categories of workers (mean = 25.75, <i>SD</i> = 14.65; <i>t</i> = 0.20, <i>p</i> = 0.84). However, they showed less emotional disturbance than the control sample, better anxiety management skills, and lower levels of depressive disorder and mental confusion. Specifically, the healthcare professionals showed a condition of emotional exhaustion (T = 0.64, D = 0.74, A = 0.62, S = 0.75, C = 0.64) and depersonalization (T = 0.41, D = 0.52, A = 0.49, S = 0.60, C = 0.40), which is common in the burnout syndrome. In conclusion, the results obtained are useful in understanding the determinants of the emotional involvement of healthcare professions and the risk of burnout syndrome and, therefore, for planning activities and support paths for these workers who are particularly at risk during prolonged and pervasive crises, such as the pandemic.","De Pasquale, Conti, Dinaro, D'Antoni, La Delfa, Di Nuovo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.832843","20220418","COVID-19 pandemic; Fear of COVID-19 scale; burnout syndrome (BS); emotional disorders; healthcare workers; posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30274,""

"A novel multi-modal depression detection approach based on mobile crowd sensing and task-based mechanisms","Depression has become a global concern, and COVID-19 also has caused a big surge in its incidence. Broadly, there are two primary methods of detecting depression: Task-based and Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) based methods. These two approaches, when integrated, can complement each other. This paper proposes a novel approach for depression detection that combines real-time MCS and task-based mechanisms. We aim to design an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, which involves multimodal data collection, feature extraction, feature selection, fusion, and classification to distinguish between depressed and non-depressed subjects. For this purpose, we created a real-world dataset of depressed and non-depressed subjects. We experimented with: various features from multi-modalities, feature selection techniques, fused features, and machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc. for classification. Our findings suggest that combining features from multiple modalities perform better than any single data modality, and the best classification accuracy is achieved when features from all three data modalities are fused. Feature selection method based on Pearson's correlation coefficients improved the accuracy in comparison with other methods. Also, SVM yielded the best accuracy of 86%. Our proposed approach was also applied on benchmarking dataset, and results demonstrated that the multimodal approach is advantageous in performance with state-of-the-art depression recognition techniques.","Thati, Dhadwal, Kumar, P","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-12315-2","20220418","Depression detection; Emotion elicitation; Machine learning; Mobile crowd sensing; Multi-modal; Speech elicitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30276,""

Healthcare students and workers are expected to develop significant levels of stress as compared to the general population. The significance of this study is to assess the depression, anxiety and stress faced by the healthcare students that may lead to unfavourable effects on learning and their overall psychological health. This assessment was done by means of an anonymous, online, closed-ended questionnaire. DASS-21 scale was the primary instrument used for this purpose. The responses were recorded on a 4-point Likert scale. The study had more male students, majority were between 21 and 23 years of age, asymptomatic and almost equal proportion of students from the fraternity of dentistry, medicine, pharmacy and nursing. Dental and pharmacy students were associated with lower stress than medical students whereas nursing students experienced higher anxiety as compared to medical students. Close contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases experienced higher stress and anxiety. Daily patient exposure was associated with significantly higher stress anxiety and depression.

"Persistence of mental health deterioration among people living alone during the COVID-19 pandemic: a periodically-repeated longitudinal study","BackgroundThis longitudinal study aimed to investigate how psychological distress levels changed from early to middle phases of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic depending on the living arrangements of individuals.MethodAn internet-based, longitudinal survey of 2,400 Japanese people was conducted every 5-6 weeks between February 2020 and January 2021. The presence of severe psychological distress (SPD) was measured using the Kessler's psychological distress scale. Living arrangements were classified into two groups, i.e. living alone or living with others. Mixed-effects logistic regression analysis was performed to assess whether changes in SPD status were different depending on living arrangements.ResultsOf 2400 respondents, 446 (18.5%) lived alone. Although the proportion of SPD in both individuals living alone and those living with others increased to the same extent in the early phase of the pandemic, however, after early phase of pandemic, the distress levels decreased in the group living with others, compared with the group living alone, which remained high. The odds ratio (OR) of developing SPD in interaction term with survey phases tended to be higher among those who lived alone than those who lived with others in Phase 6 (OR: 1.89, CI: 0.99-3.64) and Phase 7 (OR:1.88, CI: 0.97-3.63)ConclusionsDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, those living alone are persistently at a higher risk of SPD compared to those living with others.

To identify the predictive factors of anxiety, fears, and psychological distress among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey method was used on a sample of 153 of HCWs; (110) frontline and (43) non-frontline HCWs. They answered on the Hamilton anxiety rating scale, the Kessler psychological distress scale (K10), and the COVID-19 Concerns Questionnaire. The results demonstrated that 47.05% of HCWs have a severe level of fear related to COVID-19, 43.13% have very severe anxiety, and 30.71% experience severe psychological distress. The differences between frontline and non-frontline HCWs, female and male HCWs, and HCWs working in medical clinics, on quarantine, or in another place were significant in the three scales. Predictive factors of anxiety, fear, and psychological distress include working on the front lines, being female, and being over 50 years old. Meanwhile, working in a workplace with COVID-19 patients predicted anxiety and psychological distress, but not fears associated with COVID-19.

However, more studies are needed to understand the association between asthma and severe COVID-19. A cohort of 150,430 adult asthma patients were identified in the Swedish National Airway Register (SNAR) from 2013 to December 2020. Data on body mass index, smoking habits, lung function, and asthma control test (ACT) were obtained from SNAR, and uncontrolled asthma was defined as ACT Ã¢Â©Â½19. Patients with severe COVID-19 were identified following hospitalization or in death certificates based on ICD-10 codes U07.1 and U07.2. The Swedish Prescribed Drug register was used to identify comorbidities and data from Statistics Sweden for educational level. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to estimate associations with severe COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 was identified in 1067 patients (0.7%). Older age (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.04, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.03-1.04), male sex (1.42, 1.25-1.61), overweight (1.56, 1.27-1.91), obesity (2.12, 1.73-2.60), high-dose inhaled corticosteroids in combination with long-acting ÃŽÂ²-agonists (1.40, 1.22-1.60), dispensed oral corticosteroids Ã¢Â©Â¾2 (1.48, 1.25-1.75), uncontrolled asthma (1.64, 1.35-2.00), cardiovascular disease (1.20, 1.03-1.40), depression (1.47, 1.28-1.68), and diabetes (1.52, 1.29-1.78) were associated with severe COVID-19, while current smoking was inversely associated (0.63, 0.47-0.85).

"An overview of the neurological aspects in COVID-19 infection","The Crown-shaped, severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) triggered the globally fatal illness of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). This infection is known to be initially reported in bats and has been causing major respiratory challenges. The primary symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, fatigue and dry cough. As progressed the complications may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS), arrhythmia and shock. This review illustrates the neurological and neuropsychiatric impairments due to COVID-19 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters via the hematogenous or neural route, spreads to the Central Nervous System (CNS), causing a blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. Recent scientific articles have reported that SARS-CoV-2 causes several neurological issues such as encephalitis, seizures, acute stroke, delirium, meningoencephalitis and Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© Syndrome (GBS). As a long-term effect of this disease certain neuropsychiatric conditions are witnessed such as depression and anxiety. Invasion into followed by degeneration takes place causing an uncontrolled immune response. Transcription factors like NF-ÃŽÂºB (nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells), which modulate genes responsible for inflammatory response gets over expressed. Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2- related factor 2) counterpoises the inflammation by antioxidant response towards COVID-19 infection. Like every other infection, the severity of this infection leads to deterioration of major organ systems and even leads to death. By the columns of this review, we elaborate on the neurological aspects of this life-threatening infection.","Singh, Singh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchemneu.2022.102101","20220417","ACE2; COVID-19; Central Nervous System; Neurological disorders; Neuropsychiatric disorders; SARS-CoV-2; TMPRESS2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30283,""
"Follow-up after post-partum psychiatric emergency department visits: an equity-focused population-based study in Canada","Emergency department visits for a psychiatric reason in the post-partum period represent an acute need for mental health care at a crucial time, but little is known about the extent of timely outpatient follow-up after these visits or how individual and intersecting social determinants of health influence this outcome. This study aimed to examine outpatient mental health care follow-up by a physician in the 30 days after an individual attended the emergency department for a psychiatric reason in the post-partum period and understand how social determinants of health affect who receives follow-up care. In this population-based cohort study, routinely collected health data from Ontario, Canada were accessed through ICES to identify all post-partum individuals whose sex was listed as female on their health card and who had attended an emergency department in Ontario before the COVID-19 pandemic for a psychiatric reason. Individuals admitted to hospital at the time of the emergency department visit, who died during the visit, or who left without being seen were excluded from the study. Ethnicity data for individuals were not collected. The primary outcome was the proportion of individuals with any outpatient physician (psychiatrist or family physician) visit for a mental health reason within 30 days of the index emergency department visit. Family physician mental health visits were identified using a validated algorithm for Ontario Health Insurance Plan-billed visits and mental health diagnostic codes for community health centre visits. We examined the associations between social determinants of health (age, neighbourhood income, community size, immigration, neighbourhood ethnic diversity) and who received an outpatient mental health visit. We used modified Poisson regression adjusting for the other social determinants of health, clinical, and health services characteristics to examine independent associations with follow-up, and conditional inference trees to explore how social determinants of health intersect with each other and with clinical and health services characteristics in relation to follow-up. We analysed data collected between April 1, 2008, and March 10, 2020, after exclusions we identified 12Ã¢â‚¬Ë†158 people who had attended the emergency department for a psychiatric reason in the post-partum period (mean age 26Ã‚Â·9 years [SD 6Ã‚Â·2]; range 13-47); 9848 individuals lived in an urban area, among these 1518 (15Ã‚Â·5%) were immigrants and 2587 (26Ã‚Â·3%) lived in areas with high ethnic diversity. 5442 (44Ã‚Â·8%) of 12Ã¢â‚¬Ë†158 individuals received 30-day follow-up. In modified Poisson regression models, younger age, lower neighbourhood income, smaller community size, and being an immigrant were associated with a lower likelihood of follow-up. In the CTREE, similar variables were important, with several intersections between social determinants of health and between social determinants of health and other variables. Fewer than half of emergency department visits for a psychiatric reason in the post-partum period were followed by timely outpatient care, with social-determinants-of-health-based disparities in access to care. Improvements in equitable access to post-emergency department mental health care are urgently needed in this high-risk post-partum population.

"COVID-19 risk perceptions and depressive symptoms in South Africa: Causal evidence in a longitudinal and nationally representative sample","Studies worldwide have highlighted the acute and long-term depressive impacts of psychosocial stressors due to the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Among the wide range of risk factors for depression that transpired during pandemic, greater perceptions of individual vulnerability to the COVID-19 have emerged as a major predictor of increased depressive risk and severity in adults. We estimated the extent to which COVID-19 risk perceptions affected adult depressive symptoms in a longitudinal, nationally representative sample in South Africa. We used covariate balanced propensity scores to minimize the bias from treatment assignment to estimate average causal effects of COVID-19 risk perceptions. The point prevalence of perceived COVID-19 infection risk increased between the third and fifth months of the pandemic, which corresponded with elevations in national COVID-19 infection rates. Approximately 33% of adults met or surpassed the PHQ-2 cut-off score of 2. An increase in perceived risk of COVID-19 infection predicted worse depressive symptoms in adults four months later. Our findings highlight the widespread mental health burdens of the COVID-19 pandemic and emphasize the importance of greater psychological resources and structural changes to promote equitable access to COVID-19 risk mitigation policies.","Oyenubi, Kim, Kollamparambil","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.072","20220416","COVID-19; Causal inference; Depression; Risk perceptions; South Africa","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30285,""
"Impact of the loss of smell on the sleep quality and fatigue level in COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 survivors","Patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are reported to have symptoms such as shortness of breath, dry cough, headache, fatigue, and diarrhea. Loss of smell is a symptom that some patients have suffered from due to inflammation of olfactory epithelium and neuroinvasion of COVID-19 resulting in damage to the olfactory nerves and olfactory bulb. Losing an important sense such as smell might have unfavorable consequences on the lives of COVID-19 survivors; however, these unfavorable consequences have not been sufficiently investigated. This was a cross-sectional descriptive study, 81 COVID-19 survivors (51.85% male) answered the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Fatigue Severity Scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire. COVID-19 survivors who lost their smell were more likely to have poor sleep quality, high fatigue severity, and depression symptoms compared to others who did not lose their smell. Most COVID-19 survivors who lost their smell were women and had breathing difficulties. Our knowledge of this relationship will assist in establishing more efficient treatment regimens that consider both psychological and physiological factors. Future research is needed to investigate the causality relationship between poor sleep quality, increased fatigue, and depression symptoms in COVID-19 survivors who experienced loss of the sense of smell.","Alqahtani, Aldhahi, Alqahtani, Altamimi, Alshehri","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-022-07381-z","20220416","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Fatigue; Loss of smell; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30286,""
"A Bibliometric Analysis of COVID-19 Publications in Nursing By Visual Mapping Method","This study conducted a bibliometric analysis of nursing publications on the COVID-19 between January 1, 2020, and October 24, 2021. COVID-19 has been a hot research topic that has attracted many researchers from various disciplines. One of the ways to combat the COVID-19 pandemic is to produce knowledge and present it with a holistic approach. Therefore, it is crucial to make bibliometric and content analyses of scientific publications. Scientific data should be evaluated to keep up with the developments in the nursing profession and practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from the Web of Science database. The sample consisted of 1280 publications that met the inclusion criteria. The data were analyzed using descriptive content and bibliometric analysis. The VOSviewer, a mapping and visualization software program, was used for bibliometric analysis. The USA is one of the countries with the highest number of publications, citations, and international cooperation during the pandemic. Of all these publications, 1183 (92.42%) are original articles. The Journal of Nursing Management has the highest number of publications and citations. The publications focus primarily on the topics of COVID-19, pandemic, nursing, coronavirus, and nurses. The current topics that the publications address are online education, online learning, practice, nursing student, perceived stress, stress, fear, quality of life, and experience to determine the impacts of the pandemic on mental health nursing education. The COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on nursing, and the number of publications is increasing worldwide. In the early days of the pandemic, researchers focused on the topics of coronavirus infections, infection control, global health, health policy, and nursing policy. Afterward, they addressed current topics, such as education and the psychological effects of the pandemic. Our results will help nurse managers identify issues related to COVID-19 that have not been researched yet and have not been adequately explained in their own institutions. They will also help them choose appropriate journals to get their studies published, appropriate countries to cooperate with, and access information about the studies on the subject matter. Our results will also help them make evidence-based decisions about mental health and nursing education.","Ãƒâ€¡iÃƒÂ§ek Korkmaz, AltuntaÃ…Å¸","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13636","20220416","COVID-19; VOSviewer; Web of Science; bibliometric analysis; content analysis; nursing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30287,""
"A qualitative evaluation of weekly reflective practice sessions for the intensive care unit pharmacy team during the COVID-19 pandemic","Despite well-being initially being high on the agenda for UK health organisations, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted significant gaps around provision for well-being of pharmacists in the UK. The COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) environment exposed pharmacists to mental, physical and emotional challenges, including high levels of patient mortality. To provide an account of the experience of pharmacists working within an ICU at a large National Health Service hospital who attended reflective practice sessions throughout the first wave of the pandemic. A retrospective, cross-sectional design was used to gather information from eight participants who had attended nine, 30-minute weekly reflective practice sessions. Participants were invited to complete a 10-item online self-report questionnaire. The responses from the questionnaire were analysed using theoretical thematic analysis. Seven participants completed the self-report questionnaire. Thematic analysis of responses identified four themes: (1) <i>permission</i>: both professional and personal 'permission' was necessary for participants to be present for the reflective practice sessions and to attend to their own well-being; (2) <i>containing safe space</i>: reflective practice sessions offered a consistently secure environment from which to explore topics which created challenge, personally and/or professionally; (3) <i>connectedness</i>: the impact of these sessions on participants' relationships with other attendees, as individuals and the group as a whole; and (4) <i>emotional experience</i>: increased awareness of developments around their expression, processing and management of emotion as a result of attending the sessions. This study provides new and important insights into the use of reflective practice for pharmacists working in an ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings demonstrate heterogeneity in the experience of distress, the need to support the pharmacy profession, and the need to provide opportunities for staff to connect safely with colleagues during such crises. The impact of organisation-led support for the pharmacy profession is discussed as a future direction of research.","Fowlis, Barnett, Banks, Jubraj","https://doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2021-003164","20220416","COVID-19; MENTAL HEALTH; PHARMACY SERVICE, HOSPITAL; Quality of Health Care; Workforce","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30288,""

It was reported that healthcare workers providing palliative care could present elevated levels of compassion fatigue. We herein report a case if the attending doctor of severe COVID-19 cases who felt extreme psychological difficulty and suffered from compassion fatigue. A 29-year-old female doctor presented with anxiety and insomnia. Her stress from overwork was exacerbated during the treatment of two related COVID-19 patients, a 47-year-old man with COVID-19 and his 76-year-old mother, who suffered acute stress disorder after the death of her son. The mother first refused treatment, but with psychiatric intervention she was able to recover and be discharged. In the course of these cases of COVID-19, their attending physician felt psychological distress and presented with insomnia and anticipatory anxiety due to the poor prognosis of the mother. After being presented with a systematic approach to improve her work situation by the hospital executive staff and undergoing psychotherapy for compassion fatigue, she recovered and was able to return to work. We report a physician in charge of severe cases of COVID-19, who suffered an adverse impact on her mental health. Excessively empathic engagement in the care of patients who do not survive and their relatives provides high risk for compassion fatigue.

"Psychedelics and Mental Health: An Alternative Strategy to Treat Mental Impairments Triggered or Aggravated by COVID-19","Despite the discovery of vaccines for COVID-19, one of the best security measures to contain the spread of the virus is social distancing and isolation. However, isolation might trigger negative mental outcomes, such as onset of a depressive and anxious condition, increased consumption of alcohol and drugs, relapse to substances of abuse, and even induce post-traumatic stress disorder.

Three profiles emerged according to their contact with COVID-19: (1) little/no contact, (2) knowing someone close (outside home) who was infected, hospitalized, or died, and (3) being or someone at home being infected and/or hospitalized. Compared to little/no contact, both contact profiles predicted dispositional mindfulness and anxiety; and profile 2 predicted stress. Dispositional mindfulness mediated the association between both contact profiles and depression and stress.

"Association Between Virtual Care Use and Same-Day Primary Care Access in VA Primary Care-Mental Health Integration","Same-day referrals from primary care to mental health increase subsequent mental health treatment engagement. VA Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) clinics offer integrated mental health services embedded in primary care clinics, providing a key entry point to mental health care. Although telehealth use expanded rapidly after the onset of COVID-19, the impact of telehealth on same-day primary care access among new PC-MHI mental health patients is unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we examined associations between telehealth use and same-day primary care access in VA PC-MHI. We examined electronic health record data to identify same-day primary care appointments among PC-MHI patients who initiated care during 3/1/2018 to 10/29/2021. We used logistic regression analyses to evaluate the effect of telehealth on same-day primary care access. Time, demographic characteristics, mental health diagnoses (PTSD and depression), and substance use disorder diagnosis were evaluated as covariates. New PC-MHI patients who were seen via telehealth were less likely to receive same-day primary care access than patients seen in person (OR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.41-0.71; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Despite the potential advantages of using telehealth to increase access, VA patients with an initial PC-MHI visit via telehealth were less likely than patients seen in person to be referred from primary care. Telehealth may adversely affect primary care referrals to mental health services, an outcome that could ultimately reduce specialty mental health care continuity.

"[Pros and cons of teleworking in relation to the physical and mental health of the working general population: a narrative exploratory review]","Teleworking has been growing over the decades, arising many challenges to overcome. The COVID-19 pandemic situation accelerated this process. The forms of presentation are varied, homework perhaps is the most frequent. The objective of this study was to carry out a review on teleworking in the positive and negative aspects in relation to the physical and mental health of the teleworker. So, from the literature consulted, risk factors for health are identified, most of them correspond to damages derived from exposure to psychosocial and ergonomic risks. Sleep disturbances, anxiety and distress, and depression stand out as damage to mental health. With regard to damage to physical health, musculoskeletal disorders, alterations resulting from the decrease in physical activity due to sedentary lifestyle and stress, in particular non-communicable diseases, and alterations in vision are also identified.Ã‚ From a preventive perspective, actions aimed at policies linked to the organization of teleworking should be encouraged. In particular, those related with working and resting times, ensuring, among other aspects, the so-called right to disconnection. The ergonomic design of the workstation and taking active breaks are an element that also contributes to the well-being of the worker. The active participation of social actors, workers, employers and the state is strategic for teleworking, contributing to decent work and not to its precariousness.

"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinically diagnosed psychiatric disorders in persons with type 2 diabetes","To examine whether the incidence rates of diagnosed depression, anxiety disorders, and stress reactions, as well as prescription rates of antidepressants and anxiolytics were higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than before in persons with type 2 diabetes in Germany. Contrary to earlier studies, clinical diagnoses of psychiatric disorders (ICD classification) were used. The German Disease Analyzer (DA) database is an outpatient database containing routine data on patientsÃ‚Â´ diseases and treatments provided by a representative panel of physician practices selected from across Germany. We assessed incidence rates of depressive disorders (ICD-10: F32, F33), anxiety disorders (F41) and stress reactions (F43) in quarters from January 2019 to March 2021 in 95,765 people with type 2 diabetes included in the DA in 2019 (mean age 68.9 years, 58% men). Prescription rates of antidepressants and anxiolytics in quarters from January 2020 to March 2021 were compared to prescription rates from one year earlier. During the study period, the incidence rate of newly diagnosed depressive disorders in persons with type 2 diabetes declined slightly, while the incidence rates of anxiety and stress disorders remained largely constant.

"Predictors of Mental Health Help-Seeking During COVID-19: Social Support, Emotion Regulation, and Mental Health Symptoms","Little is known about factors that contribute to mental health help-seeking during disasters beyond attitudes toward counseling. The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic dramatically impacted individuals, families, and communities worldwide. The pandemic led to significant disruptions to family routines, and evidence suggests an increase in instances of mental health symptoms, like depression and anxiety, and poor utilization of mental health services. To better understand psychological factors associated with help-seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers surveyed respondents (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1,533 at time 1) about their mental health and help-seeking using Amazon's MTurk platform. The results indicated that individuals with higher levels of anxiety rate their likelihood of help-seeking as higher and those who do seek psychological help report higher levels of depression. Further, those who began new treatment for behavioral health difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic reported lower social support and less clarity about how they felt (specifically, emotional clarity when upset). Implications for clinical researchers and public health are discussed.","Tambling, Russell, Fendrich, Park","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11414-022-09796-2","20220415","Behavioral health; Emotion regulation; Help-seeking; Mental health; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30300,""

"Estimating the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic Related Lockdown on Utilization of Maternal and Perinatal Health Services in an Urban Neighborhood in Delhi, India","To estimate utilization of maternal, perinatal healthcare services after the lockdown was implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the period before. This study conducted in Dakshinpuri, an urban neighborhood in Delhi, reports data over a 13-month period which includes the period ""before lockdown"" i.e., October 1, 2019 to March 21, 2020 and ""after lockdown"" i.e., March 22 to November 5, 2020. The period ""after lockdown"" included the lockdown phase (March 22 to May 31, 2020) and unlock phase (June 1 to November 5, 2020). Mothers delivered during this period in the study area were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. In-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted in a subsample to understand the experiences, challenges, and factors for underutilization of healthcare services. The survey covered a total population of 21,025 in 4,762 households; 199 eligible mothers (mean age 27.4 years) were interviewed. In women who delivered after lockdown against before lockdown, adjusted odds of having &gt;2 antenatal care visits in the third trimester was 80% lower (aOR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.5); proportion of institutional deliveries was lower (93 vs. 97%); exclusive breastfeeding during first 6 months of birth (64.5 vs. 75.7%) and health worker home visitation within 6 weeks of birth (median, 1 vs. 3 visits) were substantially lower. Fear of contracting COVID-19, poor quality of services, lack of transportation and financial constraints were key issues faced by mothers in accessing health care. More than three-fourth (81%) of the mothers reported feeling down, depressed or hopeless after lockdown. The major factors for stress during lockdown was financial reasons (70%), followed by health-related concerns. COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdown substantially affected maternal and perinatal healthcare utilization and service delivery.","Sinha, Dudeja, Mazumder, Kumar, Adhikary, Roy, Rongsen Chandola, Mehta, Raina, Bhandari","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2022.816969","20220416","COVID-19; antenatalÃ¢â‚¬â€postnatal; maternal health care utilization; perinatal care; primary care (MeSH)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30302,""
"Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant on the Psychological States and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients With Crohn's Disease","Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic first reported in Wuhan, China, several research on the psychological impact of the pandemic on patients with Crohn's disease (CD) have been conducted. However, with the progression of the global pandemic and the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, follow-up studies need to be performed to monitor the alterations of psychological status and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among CD patients. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant on the mental health and life quality among the CD population and tried to explore potent risk factors. This observational study included 153 CD patients who responded to our pre-designed self-reported questionnaire. Demographic, clinical, and psychological information were collected and analyzed. Quite a number of CD patients were confronted with different levels of anxiety and depression, with incidence of 28.10 and 31.37% for anxiety and depression, respectively. Compared with non-pandemic circumstances, the life quality of CD patients due to the present situation was more often compromised. Isolation [odds ratio (OR): 4.71, <i>P</i> = 0.007] was verified as a risk factor for anxiety while use of telemedicine could help relieve anxiety (OR: 0.22, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Worsening of symptoms (OR: 4.92, <i>P</i> = 0.006), isolation (OR: 5.75, <i>P</i> = 0.005), and drug withdrawn (OR: 2.66, <i>P</i> = 0.026) were identified to be independent factors for developing depression. Likewise, use of telemedicine (OR: 0.13, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) was negatively related to depression. Considering life quality, vaccination (OR: 3.07, <i>P</i> = 0.021) together with no medication (OR: 7.73, <i>P</i> = 0.010) was relevant to better life quality while worsening of symptoms (OR: 0.09, <i>P</i> = 0.034) were an independent risk factor for impaired life quality. Many CD patients suffered from symptoms of anxiety and depression and impaired life quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those in isolation or with worsening of symptoms and drug withdrawn were more prone to experience psychological stress. Individualized management such as drug delivery and telemedicine should be promoted to maintain control of mental health and life quality during the pandemic.","Li, Sun, Hu, Zhao, Yao, Xiao, Ding, Hou, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.795889","20220416","COVID-19; CrohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant; health-related quality of life; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30303,""
"Profiles of Stress and Coping Associated With Mental, Behavioral, and Internet Use Problems Among Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Stratified Random Sampling and Cluster Analysis","Adolescents are vulnerable to behavioral and mental health problems, which might be further exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study explored how participants with different profiles of stressful life events, coping resources (i.e., self-esteem and perceived social support) and coping strategies (i.e., maladaptive and adaptive coping) varied in the prevalence of mental, behavioral, and Internet use problems. Data were collected from a large and representative sample of Chinese secondary school students in Hong Kong (<i>n</i> = 3,136) from September to November 2020 (48.1% males; mean age = 13.6 years old). Cluster analysis and logistic regression models were used for analysis. The prevalence of suicidal ideation and sleep disturbance was 29.8 and 55.4%, respectively. Behavioral problems were most frequently reported in excessive social media use (53.5%), followed by excessive Internet gaming (43.6%), obesity (34.1%), damaging properties (14.6%), and alcohol or substance abuse (5.1%). The results of cluster analysis yielded three distinctive stress and coping profiles: severe profile (High Risk/Low Protective; 17.0%), moderate profile (Moderate Risk/Moderate Protective; 35.8%), and mild profile (Low Risk/High Protective; 47.2%). Participants with severe and moderate profiles displayed significantly higher levels of mental (range for AOR: 2.08-15.06; all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and behavioral health problems (range for AOR: 1.22-11.22; all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) compared to the mild profile cluster. Adolescents' mental and behavioral health may be shaped by a combination of stressful life events and variations in coping resources as well as strategies. Transdiagnostic and multimodal interventions on these factors are warranted to reduce mental, behavioral, and Internet use problems among adolescents.","She, Wong, Lin, Zhang, Leung, Yang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.826911","20220418","Internet use; behavioral problems; cluster analysis; mental health; stress-coping theory; youth; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; COVID-19; Cluster Analysis; Female; Humans; Internet Use; Male; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30304,""
"The Right to Health: COVID-19 Pandemic and the Opportunity to Transform Mental Health Inequalities in Indonesia","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major catastrophes worldwide. In Indonesia, the pandemic has caused greater barriers for individuals to access mental health services. This article aims to capture the state of public mental health in Indonesia using data from various national surveys. Four main problems were identified: the increase in depression, loneliness, and distress in the general population, disruption in accessing mental health services, mental health problems among vulnerable populations, and the limited scope of available mental health services and facilities in the community. This article provided practical recommendations for the Indonesian government that focuses on preparing a resilient mental healthcare system for future crises, reducing barriers to access mental health services, and expanding the available resources and programs to ensure equal and sustainable access to mental health services in the community.","Anindyajati, Mardiasmo, Sekarasih, Susilaradeya, Takwin, Pelupessy, Diatri","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.844656","20220418","COVID-19; Indonesia; mental health service; pandemic; psychosocial support; COVID-19; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Indonesia; Mental Health; Pandemics; Right to Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30305,""
"Use of Urban Residential Community Parks for Stress Management During the COVID-19 Lockdown Period in China","During the pandemic lockdown period, residents had to stay at home and increased stress and other mental health problems have been associated with the lockdown period. Since most public parks were closed, community parks within gated residential areas became the most important green space in Chinese cities, and the use of such space might help to reduce the residents' stress levels. This study aimed to investigate to what extent urban residents in China used community parks, engaged in outdoor activity during the lockdown period (23 January-8 April 2020) and if the use of such spaces helped to reduce their stress levels. An online questionnaire survey (<i>n</i> = 1342) was carried out from 23 March to 23 April 2020. Ordinary Least Squares regression was used to analyse the association between community park use, outdoor activity, willingness to engage in outdoor activity, and stress level. All results have been further analysed by two-sampled <i>t</i>-test to explore the difference between young and old age groups. We found that the overall self-reported stress level of the respondents was relatively moderate during the lockdown period. Respondents had generally reduced their use of community parks and engagement in outdoor activity. There was no significant association between stress level and the use of community parks or the engagement in outdoor activities. However, we found that older people showed much lower stress levels, used community parks more frequently, and engaged in more outdoor activities than younger adults. The findings suggest that outdoor activities and spatial characteristics in urban China differ from Western studies and advance the need to integrate the stress management role of community parks with urban green space policy to optimise the use of community parks blended in with everyday life, particularly during the lockdown period.","Kang, Bell, Ward Thompson, Zheng, Xu, Sun","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.816417","20220416","community park; green space; living condition; lockdown; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30306,""
"Stress Experience of COVID-19 Patients as Reported by Psychological Supporters in South Korea: A Qualitative Study","COVID-19 patients experience various stressors during the quarantine period and after release from quarantine. However, stressors experienced during each period remain unclear. A total of 15 mental health experts from the integrated psychological support group for COVID-19participated in this study. Psychological support was provided for the total 932 confirmed COVID-19 patients and their families. Qualitative data were collected using Focus Group Interview (FGI). The participants were divided into two groups and semi-structured questions were used to allow participants to speak their minds. During the quarantine period, difficulties of being diagnosed with COVID-19, concerns about recovery from COVID-19, stress related to quarantine, issues related to the treatment environment, and limited information about COVID-19 and communication were frequently reported. After release from quarantine, the reported main stressors include reinfection or reactivation, concerns about complications, and financial difficulties. Confusion as vectors and victims, stigma and discrimination, and conflicts within a family were observed during both periods. COVID-19 patients suffered various stressors during the quarantine period and after release from quarantine. Moreover, returning to their daily life required timely psychosocial support, intervention, and treatment for COVID-19 infection.","Park, Lee, Lee, Lee, Kim, Kim, Oh, Ha, Hyun, Lee, Kim, Jeon, Kim, Sim","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.834965","20220416","COVID-19; psychological support; quarantine; stigma; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30307,""
"Relationships Between Mental Health, Emotion Regulation, and Meaning in Life of Frontline Nurses During the COVID-19 Outbreak","The sporadic outbreak of COVID-19 and the constant mutation of the virus have put the public in panic. Frontline nurses' appropriate emotional regulation and mental health are the key to win the victory of fighting against the epidemic. The relationships between these variables directly influence the availability of human resources to combat COVID-19. To investigate the relationship between meaning in life, emotional regulation, and mental health of frontline nurses during the Delta virus epidemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in August 2021 among 105 nurses from the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China, who were deployed at the COVID-19 units in Zhangjiajie People's Hospital. The Chinese Meaning in Life Questionnaire, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and Psychological Questionnaire for Emergent Events of Public Health were used to evaluate their meaning in life, emotion regulation, and mental health. Their correlation and the moderating effect of emotion regulation were conducted. In total, 105 (100%) nurses responded. There were 14 men and 91 women and the mean age was (30.295 Ã‚Â± 4.653) years. The average score of meaning in life and mental health of frontline nurses was 49.971 Ã‚Â± 6.386 and 2.755 Ã‚Â± 2.580, respectively. The meaning in life of frontline nurses was positively correlated with cognitive reappraisal and negatively correlated with expressive suppression and mental health. Mental health was negatively correlated with cognitive reappraisal and positively correlated with expressive suppression. The emotional regulation of frontline nurses has a moderating effect between meaning in life and mental health. Meaning in life and emotion regulation of frontline nurses were significantly correlated with mental health under the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Changing the emotion regulation of frontline nurses, strengthening cognitive reappraisal, and weakening expressive suppression could reduce the predictive effect of meaning in life on mental health.","Chen, Zhou, Luo, Huang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.798406","20220416","Delta virus; cardiovascular disease nursing; childhood autism Delta virus; emotional regulation; meaning in life; mental health; nurse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30308,""
"The Magnitude of Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms Among Tuberculosis Patients in Community Health Centers Setting During the Peak of COVID-19 Pandemic","Mental health problems can occur in patients with chronic diseases such as tuberculosis, and the stress of a pandemic exacerbates the condition. The study aims to explore the magnitude of anxiety and depressive symptoms in tuberculosis (TB) patients in community health centers (CHCs) settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study design was quantitative and cross-sectional. Subjects were TB patients who were recruited from TB services by doctors in CHCs. TB patients (n=74) were screened for anxiety and depressive symptoms over 4 months. Screening results are uploaded on a cloud-based digital platform and analyzed. Non-TB patients, as a comparison, were recruited and screened from the same cloud-based digital platform (n=245) during the same period. Analysis was carried out using Rasch modeling for data transformation. Data was analyzed then for frequency distribution for both groups and the logistic binaries to measure the burden of the mixed anxiety and depressive symptoms among the TB patient age's sub-group. In both groups, there were 48.9% of mild, moderate, and severe categories of anxiety and 63.9% of depressive symptoms. In the TB-patients group, anxiety occurred at 48.7%, of which 23% were in the moderate and severe categories, compared to 13.4% for non-TB patients. Depressive symptoms were present in 71.6% of the TB patient group, of which 28.4% were in the moderate and severe categories, compared to 15.5% of non-TB patients. TB patients aged less than 20 years experienced moderate-severe anxiety with depressive symptoms simultaneously (mixed) as much as 16.3% or 4.6 times more than those aged over 20 years (p&lt;0.05). Moderate and severe anxiety and depressive symptoms were shown higher in the TB patients' group. Adolescents with TB are more susceptible to mental and emotional disorders.","Sunjaya, Paskaria, Pramayanti, Herawati, Parwati","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S359530","20220416","mental health screening; pandemic COVID-19; patient-centered; primary health care; tuberculosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-19","",30309,""
