"Symbolic coping: Young peopleâ€™s perspectives during the Covid-19 pandemic in three Central European countries: Postdisciplinary Humanities & Social Sciences Quarterly","The aim of this study was to find out what interpretive repertoires young people use in the symbolic management of the pandemic. Qualitative research using several methods on a sample of 172 young people in three countries, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Austria, and the subsequent discursive analysis showed that young people symbolically coped during the Covid-19 pandemic with the help of widespread concepts such as cutting off, closing sci-fi and panic. The interpretations used by young people to symbolically deal with the pandemic are close to those present in the public discourseâ€”the discourses of threat, loss, emotionâ€”but there was also a search for the concepts and language for use by experts and the general public in communicating about the pandemic. There were no significant differences in the interpretations of life during the Covid-19 pandemic in the three Central European countries.","PuhrovÃ¡, Barbora petru, LukÅ¡Ã­k, Ivan, Scheitel, Regina","https://doi.org/10.1515/humaff-2022-0018","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Human Affairs; 32(2):241-254, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-05","",30951,""
"Coronavirus anxiety in Slovakia during the second wave of the pandemic â€“ Associations with depression, Insomnia and generalized anxiety disorder: Postdisciplinary Humanities & Social Sciences Quarterly","The study had two main goals: Firstly, the authors aimed to verify the validity and reliability of the Slovak adaptation of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS). Secondly, the authors examined the associations between the CAS and mental health indicators â€“ depression, insomnia and generalized anxiety disorder. The representative sample consisted of 1625 Slovak participants from the general population (793 men and 832 women, Mage = 42.77 Â±12.84). The data were collected in October 2020. The data were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis and multiple hierarchical regression analysis. The authors confirmed that the psychometric properties of the CAS were adequate. Furthermore, they identified predictors of depression (gender, income, change in economic situation, subjective poverty, CAS), generalized anxiety disorder (gender, age, change in economic situation, subjective poverty, CAS) and insomnia (change in economic situation, subjective poverty, CAS). The results may contribute to our understanding of the pandemicâ€™s impact on mental health.","BabincÃ¡k, Peter, BabjÃ¡kovÃ¡, Jaroslava","https://doi.org/10.1515/humaff-2022-0017","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Human Affairs; 32(2):228-240, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-05","",30952,""
"Mental health responses in countries hosting refugees from Ukraine","The Ukrainian refugee crisis highlights the many issues associated with trauma, distress, mental and physical health, culturally competent assessments, and meaningful support and interventions. This crisis requires international support and a global response, as hosting countries have specific competencies and capacities. The authors hope that the groundswell of international concern over the crisis in Ukraine will lead not only to a comprehensive response to the needs of refugees from that country but also to a recognition of the needs of other asylum seekers and refugees and to our collective moral obligation to address those needs equitably.","Kaufman, Kenneth R.; Bhui, Kamaldeep, Katona, Cornelius","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.55","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-05","",30953,""

"Facilitating stress prevention in micro and small-sized enterprises: protocol for a mixed method study to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation process of targeted web-based interventions","Background Workplace-related stress is a major risk factor for mental and physical health problems and related sickness absence and productivity loss. Despite evidence regarding the effectiveness of different workplace-based interventions, the implementation of stress prevention interventions is rare, especially in micro and small-sized enterprises (MSE) with fewer than 50 employees. The joint research project â€œPragmatiKKâ€+ aims to identify and address the specific barriers to the implementation of stress prevention interventions in MSE. This study protocol describes a mixed method study design to evaluate the effectiveness of adapted stress prevention interventions and the implementation process via an integrated web-based platform (â€œSystem Pâ€) specifically targeted at MSE. Methods First, we develop a web-based intervention, which accounts for the specific working conditions in MSE and addresses stress prevention at a structural and behavioral level. Second, we use common methods of implementation research to perform an effect and process evaluation. We analyze the effectiveness of the web-based stress prevention interventions by comparing depressive symptoms at baseline and follow-up (after 6 months and 12 months). Indicators for a successful implementation process include acceptability, adoption, feasibility, reach, dose, and fidelity, which we will measure with quantitative web-based questionnaires and qualitative interviews. We will also analyze the accumulated usage data from the web-based platform. Discussion Collecting data on the implementation process and the effectiveness of a web-based intervention will help to identify and overcome common barriers to stress prevention in MSE. This can improve the mental health of employees in MSE, which constitute more than 90% of all enterprises in Germany. + Full Project Name: â€žPragmatiKK - Pragmatische LÃ¶sungen fÃ¼r die Implementation von MaÃŸnahmen zur StressprÃ¤vention in Kleinst- und Kleinbetrieben â€œ(= Pragmatic solutions for the implementation of stress prevention interventions in micro and small-sized enterprises).

"COVID 19 and the Opioid Epidemic: An Analysis of Clinical Outcomes During COVID 19","Background and Objectives: Here we aimed to characterize clinical outcomes in those receiving treatment at a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) methadone maintenance treatment program (MMT) during the COVID 19 pandemic in which SAMSHA regulations for MMTs were changed to provide a greater number of methadone allotments and decreased clinic-visit frequency. Methods: We report results of a single-site, pre-post cohort study of urine drug screen data 3 months before and after an increase in allotments of take-home medication from the methadone clinic. One hundred twenty-nine patients met inclusion criteria for this study. The study was reviewed by the NYHHS IRB committee and granted final approval by the Research and Development Committee. Results: The sample was predominately male, average age 66years and average years in most recent treatment is 4.1 years. No statistical significance was found between period 1 and period 2 in the positive test detection for nonprescribed opiates, methadone and illicit substances (P &gt;.05), number of new medical illnesses or overdoses. We controlled for participant age, substance use disorder diagnosis, psychiatric disorder diagnosis, and number of years in treatment. Discussion/Conclusions: The results of the study illustrate the relative safety of the changes made at this particular MMT during the pandemic. Additionally, there was continued adherence to methadone treatment with minimal change in illicit substance use during period 1 and period 2. Scientific Significance: To these authors' knowledge this paper is one of the first to examine clinical outcomes in those with opioid addiction prescribed methadone from MMTs during the COVID 19 pandemic.","Ezie, Chiemeka, Badolato, Ryan, Rockas, Mary, Nafiz, Rayek, Sands, Brian, Wolkin, Adam, Farahmand, Pantea","https://doi.org/10.1177/11782218221085590","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Substance Abuse: Research & Treatment;: 1-8, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-05","",30956,""
"Feasibility of Self-Guided Online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for University Students During COVID-19","Objective: This study aimed to test the feasibility and efficacy of a self-guided online cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT) for university students in Hong Kong during COVID-19. Method: One group pre-post-test design with convenient sampling was adopted in this study, involving 84 university students who received a newly developed iCBT within an 8 week intervention period. The iCBT offered eight online modules for students to learn the skills of CBT at home through an online platform which was accessible any time anywhere anonymously with technical support only. Standardized assessment tools were used for outcomes assessment at the pre- and post-intervention periods. Results: Three quarters of participants completed all iCBT modules. The results of paired t-tests showed that, after completing the iCBT, participants showed reduction in anxiety, depression, and perceived stress. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidences to support the feasibility and efficacy of the self-guided iCBT for university students during COVID-19.

"Prepandemic relationship satisfaction is related to postpandemic COVID-19 anxiety: A four-wave study in China","The COVID-19 pandemic has had lasting impacts on peopleâ€™s interpersonal relationship and mental health. Using four-wave data in China (N = 222, 54.50% female, M age = 31.53, SD = 8.17), the current study examined whether prepandemic relationship satisfaction was related to postpandemic COVID-19 anxiety through midpandemic perceived social support and/or gratitude. The results showed that peopleâ€™s COVID-19 anxiety decreased from the peak to the trough stage of the pandemic;perceived social support increased markedly from prepandemic to the peak and remained stable subsequently, while relationship satisfaction remained unchanged throughout. Further, it was midpandemic perceived social support, not gratitude, that mediated the association between prepandemic relationship satisfaction and postpandemic COVID-19 anxiety, indicating that perceived social support played a crucial role in this process. Finally, it is suggested that perceived social support should be distinguished from gratitude as two different components of social interactions.

"When Perceptions of Public Service Harms the Public Servant: Predictors of Burnout and Compassion Fatigue in Government","Public servants? mental health can impact how, how well, and to whom services are delivered. In this article, we extend the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) framework to consider whether employees? perceptions of themselves, their co-workers, and beneficiaries predict higher psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a survey of state and local public servants (n?=?3,341), we report alarming rates of psychological distress: one in three employees are burnt out and one in five are experiencing compassion fatigue. Those who view government as the place to make a difference, and those who perceive co-workers as competent, are less likely to report distress. Those who attribute poverty to systemic factors, and not to individual flaws of beneficiaries, experience higher distress. These findings suggest an urgent need to prioritize public servant mental health, and show that individual perceptions of self and others can predict variation in psychological distress, even in periods of widespread crisis.","Sciepura, Brenda, Linos, Elizabeth","https://doi.org/10.1177/0734371X221081508","","Database: sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Review of Public Personnel Administration;: 0734371X221081508, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-05","",30959,""
"Internet of things platform technology used in undergraduate nursing student education: a scoping review protocol","IntroductionFuture nursing education needs to build a cutting-edge technology-based educational environment to provide a variety of consumer-oriented education. Thus, the sharing of information in nursing education needs to be considered, especially given the advancement of internet of things (IoT) technology. Before developing a horizontal platform, understanding previously developed IoT platforms is necessary to establish services and devices compatible with each other in different service areas. This scoping review aims to explore the technology used in the IoT platform for the education of nursing students in the undergraduate nursing curriculum.Methods and analysisA preliminary search was completed to find initial search terms, on which a full-search strategy was developed. Search results yielded from PubMed (NCBI) were screened to ensure articles were peer-reviewed, published in English from January 1999 to August 2021, and relevant to developing, applying and evaluating IoT platforms at educational institutions for students in undergraduate nursing programmes. A full-text review of relevant articles will be conducted, and data will be extracted using the developed extraction tool. The extracted qualitative data will be analysed using a modified grounded theory approach, informing a working definition of the IoT platform and related terms.Ethics and disseminationThe study was exempted from ethical review by the Institutional Review Board of Nambu University, South Korea. Study results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals.","Jang, A.; Song, C.

"COVID-19 contamination through food: A study with Brazilian consumers of different socioeconomic and demographic characteristics","This study aimed to investigate through free word association the perception of Brazilian consumers regarding the possibility of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus through food. One thousand individuals answered the questionnaire via an online platform. Most cited terms (hygiene?8%, fear?8%, caution?5%) and categories (negative attitudes and feeling?72% and sanitization?60%) were related to overall COVID-19 infection rather than their specific infection through the food. The perception of the possibility of risk of this type of cross-contamination was greater for male participants, within the food field, with high income (&gt;10 minimum wages), and from the midwest region. Nonetheless, there are still doubts regarding this possibility, especially for participants with low income (=10 minimum wages), females, higher education (=secondary school), who exercise professional activity outside the food sector and from most regions of Brazil. Practical applications Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was discovered 2?years ago, the emergence of new variants such as Omicron has increased infection and mortality rates worldwide. A possible way of COVID-19 infection is cross-contamination through food handling and contact surfaces if preventive measures are not applied. In this context, understanding the consumer perception from a continental-size country such as Brazil, with a wide variety of socioeconomic profiles, is crucial to minimize the severe impacts of the pandemic. Our study demonstrates the need to disseminate scientific information in different media to reduce misinformation, especially social media because most Brazilian consumers had doubts and uncertainties about the possibility of COVID-19 infection from cross-contamination through food.","Torres Neto, Luiz, Monteiro, Maria LÃºcia Guerra, Viana, Fernanda Medeiros, Conte-Junior, Carlos Adam","https://doi.org/10.1111/joss.12748","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Sensory Studies; n/a(n/a):e12748, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-05","",30961,""
