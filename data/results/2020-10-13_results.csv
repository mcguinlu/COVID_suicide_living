"Mental health service activity during COVID-19 lockdown among individuals with learning disabilities: South London and Maudsley data on services and mortality from January to July 2020","The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have had a widespread impact on mental healthcare service provision and use. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in South London) highlighted a shift to virtual contacts among those accessing community mental health and home treatment teams and an increase in deaths over the pandemic first wave. However, there is a need to quantify this for individuals with particular vulnerabilities, including those with learning disabilities. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for individuals with learning disabilities across community, specialist, crisis and inpatient services. The report focussed on the period 1st January to 31st July 2020. We also report on daily accepted and discharged trust referrals, total trust caseloads and daily inpatient admissions and discharges for individuals with learning disabilities. In addition, daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users with learning disabilities over this period. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 there was a shift from face-to-face contacts to virtual contacts across all teams. The largest declines in caseloads and total contacts were seen in Home Treatment Team, Liaison/A&E and Older Adult teams. Reduced accepted referrals and inpatient admissions were observed and there was an 103% increase in average daily deaths in the period after 16th March, compared to the period 1st January to 15th March (or a 282% increase if the 2-month period from 16th March to 15th May was considered alone).","Evangelia Martin; Eleanor Nuzum; Matthew Broadbent; Robert Stewart","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210625","20201013","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-13","",5948,""

"Social Distancing and Lockdown - An Introvert's Paradise? An Empirical Investigation on the Association Between Introversion and the Psychological Impact of COVID19-Related Circumstantial Changes","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic has effected the implementation of social distancing and lockdown measures across the globe, and the psychological impact of associated life changes is experienced more severely by some individuals than others  Anecdotal evidence points to a common belief among the general public that introverts are faring better than their extraverted counterparts to this end  However, the claim lacks empirical research, and seems counterintuitive when the broader literature on the association between introversion and mental health is considered  The current study investigated whether the psychological impact of COVID19-related circumstantial changes was moderated by introversion, based on outcome measures across psychosocial, cognitive, and affective domains  The role of several demographic factors in determining COVID19-related mental health symptoms was also examined  One hundred and fourteen individuals (64 USA residents) completed measures of introversion, and reported on the extent to which they experienced loneliness, anxiety, depression and cognitive impairments as a function of COVID19-related circumstantial changes  Results showed that introversion predicted more severe loneliness, anxiety, and depression experienced as a function of COVID19-related circumstantial changes, but not cognitive impairments  Among the range of demographic factors examined (age, gender, living condition, recent unemployment), living with others (vs  living alone) predicted more severe COVID19-related mental health symptoms  However, these effects were only observed on outcome measures pertaining to anxiety and cognitive impairments, but not loneliness and depression  Current findings have implications for both consumers and disseminators of information on popular internet hubs  Current findings also highlight the possibility that living with others (close human affiliation) may have protective and detrimental effects on different domains of mental health during the COVID19 pandemic","Wei, M.","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.561609","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Front Psychol;11:561609, 2020.; Publication details: Front Psychol;11:561609, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-13","",5953,""

"COVID-19 pandemic and mental distress in Multiple Sclerosis: implications for clinical management","BACKGROUND: in multiple sclerosis (MS), disease-related factors and dysfunctional coping might favour the development of mental distress induced by COVID-19 containment measures  METHODS: we explored the relationship between mental distress, disability and coping strategies in the Italian MS population under lockdown  Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to information collected via web-survey to identify modifiable factors that could account for mental distress  RESULTS: 845 subjects (497 MS and 348 controls) were included in the study  MS patients showed higher scores than controls for depression (p=0 005), but not for anxiety, emotional dyscontrol or sleep disturbances  The SEM explained 74% of the variance observed in depression score  Within the model, three latent factors were characterized from measured variables: motor disability and cognitive dysfunction contributed to disability (ÃŸ=0 509 and ÃŸ=0 836, p&lt;0 001);positive attitude and exercise contributed to active attitude (ÃŸ=0 386 and ÃŸ=0 297, p&lt;0 001);avoidance, social support and watching TV contributed to passive attitude (ÃŸ=0 301, ÃŸ=0 243 and ÃŸ=0 212, p&lt;0 001)  As per the relationship between latent factors and their influence on depression, disability contributed to passive attitude (ÃŸ=0 855, p&lt;0 001) while both passive and active attitude significantly influenced depression (ÃŸ=0 729 and ÃŸ=-0 456, p&lt;0 001)  CONCLUSION: as practical implication of our model, favoring exercise would enhance active attitude and its positive impact on mental well-being while, at the same time, reducing the negative impact of disability on depression, representing a valuable tool to face COVID-19 related mental distress","Costabile, T.; Carotenuto, A.; Lavorgna, L.; Borriello, G.; Moiola, L.; Inglese, M.; Petruzzo, M.; Trojsi, F.; Ianniello, A.; Nozzolillo, A.; Cellerino, M.; Boffa, G.; Rosa, L.; Servillo, G.; Moccia, M.; Bonavita, S.; Filippi, M.; Lanzillo, R.; Brescia Morra, V.; Petracca, M.","https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14580","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Eur J Neurol;2020.; Publication details: Eur J Neurol;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-13","",5982,""
"What Is the Impact of the Coronavirus-19 Pandemic on Quality of Life and Other Patient-reported Outcomes? An Analysis of the Hand-Wrist Study Cohort","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and its associated lockdowns in many parts of the world, have changed daily life and may have a psychological impact on people  However, it is unknown how this influences the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of patients involved in ongoing clinical research and medical care  For both the current and potential future lockdowns, it is important to determine if PROMs collected during such a period can be interpreted with confidence  QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Is there a difference in quality of life between patients in the COVID-19 period group (March 23, 2020 to May 4, 2020) and patients in a reference period group (from the same period in 2018 or 2019)? (2) Is there a difference in pain, hand function, anxiety, depression, and illness perception between patients in the COVID-19 period group and patients in the reference period group? METHODS: This study was part of a large cohort study with routine outcome measures of patients with hand and wrist conditions  To answer our research questions, we analyzed two samples, because not all PROMs were sent to participants at the same time points after treatment  The first sample consisted of all participants who completed PROMs on quality of life, pain, and hand function at their final follow-up time point, which was either 3, 6, or 12 months post-treatment  The second sample consisted of participants who completed PROMs 3 months post-treatment on anxiety, depression, and illness perception  Each sample consisted of two groups: a COVID-19 period group and a reference period group  We included 1613 participants in the first sample (COVID-19 period group: n = 616;reference period group: n = 997) and 535 participants in the second sample (COVID-19 period group: n = 313;reference period group: n = 222)  The primary outcome was quality of life, expressed in the EuroQol 5-Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) index score  Secondary outcomes were the other domains on the EQ-5D, as well as pain, hand function, anxiety, depression, and illness perception  RESULTS: We found no between-group differences in the EQ-5D index score (standardized mean difference 0 035;p = 0 98)  Furthermore, there were no between-group differences in PROM scores for hand function, anxiety, or depression  There were, however, a few small differences in subdomain items regarding pain and illness perception, but we believe in aggregate that these are unlikely to make a clinically important difference in our main finding  CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown had no influence on quality of life and had little influence on secondary outcomes in participants who were part of the Hand-Wrist Study Cohort  This finding implies that PROMs data collected during this period can be used with confidence in clinical research  Our findings indicate that when a pandemic like this occurs again, we can continue to use PROMs for analysis in clinical research or routine outcome measures  LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study","Cohen, A.; Selles, R.

"COVID-19, HIV and key populations: Cross-cutting issues and the need for population-specific responses","Abstract Introduction Key populations at elevated risk to contract or transmit HIV may also be at higher risk of COVID-19 complications and adverse outcomes associated with public health prevention measures  However, the conditions faced by specific populations vary according to social, structural and environmental factors, including stigma and discrimination, criminalization, social and economic safety nets, and the local epidemiology of HIV and COVID-19, which determine risk of exposure and vulnerability to adverse health outcomes, as well as the ability to comply with measures such as physical distancing  This commentary identifies common vulnerabilities and cross-cutting themes in terms of the impacts of COVID-19 on key populations before addressing issues and concerns specific to particular populations  Discussion Cross-cutting themes include direct impacts such as disrupted access to essential medicines, commodities and services such as anti-retroviral treatment, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, opioid agonist treatment, viral load monitoring, HIV and sexually transmitted infections testing, condoms, and syringes  Indirect impacts include significant collateral damage arising from prevention measures which restrict human rights, increase or impose criminal penalties, and expand police powers to target vulnerable and criminalized populations  Significant heterogeneity in the COVID-19 pandemic, the underlying HIV epidemic, and the ability of key populations to protect themselves means that people who inject drugs and sex workers face particular challenges, including indirect impacts as a result of police targeting, loss of income, and sometimes both  Geographical variations mean that transgender people and men who have sex with men in regions like Africa and the middle east remain criminalized, as well as stigmatized and discriminated against, increasing their vulnerability to adverse outcomes in relation to COVID-19  Conclusions Disruptions to both licit and illicit supply chains, loss of income and livelihoods, and changes in behaviour as a result of lockdowns and physical distancing have the potential to exacerbate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on key populations  While these impacts will vary significantly, human-rights approaches to COVID-19 emergency laws and public health prevention measures that are population-specific and sensitive, will be key to reducing adverse health outcomes and ensuring that no-one is left behind","Iversen, Jennifer; Sabin, Keith; Chang, Judy; Morgan Thomas, Ruth; Prestage, Garrett; Strathdee, Steffanie A.; Maher, Lisa","https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25632","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of the International AIDS Society;n/a(n/a):e25632, 2020.; Publication details: Journal of the International AIDS Society;n/a(n/a):e25632, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-13","",5994,""

"Equity and elderly health in India: reflections from 75th round National Sample Survey, 2017-18, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, called coronavirus disease - 2019 (COVID-19), has affected more than 200 countries across the globe with a higher fatality rate among the elderly population. Aim of the study is to highlight the vulnerability of the aged amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic, and in the light of the recent international evidence, suggests what government could do to mitigate their vulnerability. METHODS: Data from the recently released (November 2019) 75th Round National Sample Survey (NSS), which was conducted from July 2017 to June 2018, across 8077 rural villages and 6181 urban wards was used for this study. Data collected from 555,115 individuals (rural: 325,232; urban: 229,232) included 42,762 elderly individuals (60 years or above). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used for the calculation. RESULTS: Of the total sample of elderly individuals, 27.7% reported suffering from an ailment in the last 15 days, whereas 8.5% had been hospitalized during the last 365 days. Among the elderly, hospitalization rate was higher in the urban areas (OR: 1.23), general social category (OR: 1.18), richest economic quintile (OR: 1.69), and among those living alone (OR: 2.40). Also, among the elderly, 64% of those in the scheduled tribe (social group) and 51% in the poorest economic quintile utilized public facilities for hospitalization. Cardiovascular ailments were the major cause for hospitalization (18.1%) and outpatient visit (32%) among the elderly. Ailments related to diabetes and hypertension constituted 55% of outpatient visit for the elderly. Only 18.9% of the elderly had health insurance though chances of facing catastrophic health expenditures were high among the elderly. 6.6% of elderly female and 1.6% male live alone, and 27.5% of age 80 years and above are immobile. 50% of male and 90% of female are financially dependent on others and more so in poorer economic quintiles. CONCLUSIONS: The vulnerability of India's elderly increases across economic levels, and other dimensions such as the place of residence, gender, social group (caste), marital status, living arrangements, surviving children, and economic dependence. The current COVID-19 pandemic poses a greater risk of social isolation among the elderly, which may cause detrimental health impact. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable since the study is based on secondary data.","Ranjan, Alok; Muraleedharan, V R","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00619-7","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Global Health;16(1): 93, 2020 Oct 08.; Publication details: Global Health;16(1): 93, 2020 Oct 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-13","",5998,""
"Recommendations for the care of patients with bipolar disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic","In recent months, there has been a rapid spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), being now regarded as a global pandemic. In this context, the governments of different countries have established strict containment measures, and subsequent deconfinement measures, with consequential alterations in the rhythms and living habits of the population, including patients with bipolar disorder (BD), who are in an extremely vulnerable situation. The present paper aims to propose a number of recommendations, based on scientific evidence, for mental health professionals who may be in charge of BD patients during this health crisis in the coming months. Among these recommendations, careful monitoring of pharmacological treatment, reinforcing medication adherence, and surveillance of drug-drug interaction risk in cases where the patient is being treated for COVID-19 are of utmost importance.","HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-GÃƒÂ³mez, Andrade-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Lahera, Vieta","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.105","20201012","Bipolar disorder; Covid-19; Recommendations for clinicians","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-13","",5999,""
"Psychosocial Safety Climate of Employees during COVID-19 in Iran: A Policy Analysis","Iran is among the top fifteen countries in the world in terms of COVID-19 infection rates. The numbers of infections and deaths are still increasing in September 2020. This study aims to investigate the impact of the policies on terminating the quarantine period on the perception of psychosocial safety by employees and workers in Iran. The study collected policy announcements and regulations, media reports and the results from two previously published population surveys which collected employees' views of the government approach to quarantine. The information thus collected was then analyzed using the &quot;what is Problem Represented (WPR)&quot; approach for data analysis introduced by Carol Bacchi, and focusses on the question &quot;what effects are produced by the representation of the problem?&quot; The Iranian Government decided to quarantine people and close most sectors during the New Year holidays in Iran in March 2020. The duration of quarantine was only two weeks, and the government then ordered government organizations and industrial companies to reopen. The advantage of a short quarantine period is assumed to be reinstatement of productivity while the disadvantage is the likely risk of further transmission of the virus. The government approach to and communication about the quarantine period has neglected to consider the psychosocial safety climate of employees, who have to go to their workplaces using buses, subways or other vehicles, and who are under pressure mentally because of fear of infection, dismissal for non-attendance, and the consequent economic problems. The government approach necessarily impacts on the perceived psychosocial safety climate of employees, and hence influences the causes of work stress. If the psychosocial safety climate is not considered and improved, it may reduce the quality of services and products, and increase accidents.","Seddighi, Dollard, Salmani","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.370","20201012","COVID-19; Human Resources Management; Iran; Mental Health; Occupational Health; Policy Analysis; Psychosocial Safety Climate","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-13","",6000,""
