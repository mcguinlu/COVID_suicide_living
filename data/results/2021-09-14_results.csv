"COVID-19 and Risk Factors of Anxiety and Depression in South Korea","The aims of this study were to explore the prevalence of and identify predictors of anxiety and depression related to coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) in South Korea. The analysis is based on a quota survey design and a sampling frame that permitted recruitment of a national sample of 1,014 individuals between March 17-31, 2020. Several standardized measurements were used, including GAD-7, PHQ-9, COVID-19 related fear, restrictions in deaily life, as well as sociodemographic information and physical and psychosocial needs during the pandemic. Multiple logistic regression was conducted to analyze the influence of sociodemographic factors, fear, and physical/psychosocial needs on anxiety and depression. Significant numbers of the respondents were identifiable anxiety (19.0%) and depression group (17.5%), respectively. This indicates that the depression and anxiety prevalence rate after the COVID-19 is substantially high compared to the depression rate of 2.6% in 2020 and 2.8% in 2018 both reported in the Korea Community Health Survey and the anxiety rate of 5.7% reported in 2016 Survey of Mental Disorders in Korea. Multiple logistic regression results showed age, COVID-19 related fear, and the level of restrictions in daily as significant factors in understanding and predicting the anxiety group. Likfewise, the COVID-19 related fear, restrictions in daily life, and need for economic support were important predictors in predicting the depression group. Findings on predictors for greater vulnerability to anxiety and depression has important implications for public mental health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hyun, Kim, Kim, Choi, Choi, Lee, Paik, Lee, Kim, Jun, Lee, Sohn","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2021.0125","20210913","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17899,""
"Acute Impact of the Coronavirus Disease Outbreak on Behavioral Patterns and Emotional States of Pediatric Psychiatric Patients and Caregivers in Daegu, South Korea","This study aimed to investigate the changes in interpersonal relationships, behavioral patterns, and emotional states of children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders and their caregivers immediately after the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Daegu, South Korea. A total of 147 patients and 147 caregivers participated in the Survey for Outing and Time Usage for Child, Adolescent, and Parents and the COVID-19 Visual Analog Scale for Emotion. We classified the patients and their caregivers into the internalizing disorder (ID) and externalizing disorder (ED) groups and compared the changes. Parent-child relationships for adolescent patients and caregivers were interrupted, and friend relationships in all participants were disrupted, while sibling relationships improved in adolescent patients. They experienced negative emotional changes. Time spent outdoor decreased and digital screen time increased for all participants. Friend and parent-child relationships were interrupted in the ED group compared to those in the ID group. ED patients experienced negative changes in emotional states, while ID patients showed no significant changes. Results are meaningful as a reference for predicting changes in interpersonal relationships and mental status of pediatric psychiatric patients and for determining healthcare system adaptations to allow mental health support during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Seo, Jung, Jung, Choi, Jo","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2021.0127","20210913","Behavioral and emotional change; COVID-19; Caregivers; Children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders; Relationships","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17900,""
"Smartphone Screen Time Among University Students in Lebanon and Its Association With Insomnia, Bedtime Procrastination, and Body Mass Index During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","We aimed to investigate the association of increased smartphone screen time with insomnia, bedtime procrastination, depression, anxiety, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. An online survey was performed for university students from all regions of Lebanon during the lockdown. The survey included questionnaires about smartphone screen time, diet, physical activity, psychological symptoms, and bedtime procrastination. We defined 6 hours of smartphone use as critical based on a survey done in United States. Among female students, smartphone use duration, physical activity levels, BMI, depression, anxiety, and insomnia severity were significantly higher than in male. When we stratified participants based on 6 hours of smartphone use, females, unhealthy food consumption, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and bedtime procrastination were significantly higher in the group with Ã¢â€°Â¥6 hours of smartphone use. When we divided based on 7 hours, physical activity and body weight also differed between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis revealed that female, overweight, insomnia, and bedtime procrastination were significant predictors of a phone screen time of 7 hours. Our findings suggest that adults should be more cautious and responsible when using smartphones and be more concerned about the health-related risks.","Hammoudi, Mreydem, Ali, Saleh, Chung, Hallit, Salameh","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2021.0120","20210913","BMI; Bedtime procrastination; COVID-19; Insomnia; Screen time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17901,""
"Tracking self-reported symptoms and medical conditions on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic","Harnessing health-related data posted on social media in real-time has the potential to offer insights into how the pandemic impacts the mental health and general well-being of individuals and populations over time. The aim of this study was to obtain information on symptoms and medical conditions self-reported by non-Twitter social media users during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; to determine how discussion of these symptoms and medical conditions changed over time; and to identify correlations between frequency of the top 5 commonly mentioned symptoms post and daily COVID-19 statistics (new cases, new deaths, new active cases, new recovered cases) in U.S. We used natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to identify symptom and medical condition topics being discussed on social media between June 14 and December 13, 2020. The sample posts were geotagged by NetBase, a third-party data provider. We calculated the positive predictive value and sensitivity to validate the classification of posts. We also assessed the frequency of health-related discussions on social media over time during the study period, and used Pearson's correlation coefficients to identify statistically significant correlations between the frequency of the 5 most commonly mentioned symptoms and fluctuation of U.S. daily COVID-19 statistics. Within a total of 9,807,813 posts (nearly 70% were sourced from the U.S.), we identified discussion of 120 symptom topics and 1,542 medical condition topics. Our classification of the health-related posts had a positive predictive value of over 80% and an average classification rate of 92% sensitivity. The 5 most commonly mentioned symptoms on social media during the study period were: anxiety (in 201,303 posts or 12.2% of the total posts mentioning symptoms), generalized pain (189,673, 11.5%), weight loss (95,793, 5.8%), fatigue (91,252, 5.5%), and coughing (86,235, 5.2%). The 5 most discussed medical conditions were: COVID-19 (in 5,420,276 posts or 66.4% of the total posts mentioning medical conditions), unspecified infectious disease (469,356, 5.8%), influenza (270,166, 3.3%), unspecified disorders of the central nervous system (253,407, 3.1%), and depression (151,752, 1.9%). Changes in posts of frequency of anxiety, generalized pain, and weight loss were statistically significant but negatively correlated with daily new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. (r=-0.49, r=-0.46, r=-0.39, respectively; P&lt;.05). Posts of frequency of anxiety, generalized pain, weight loss, fatigue, and the changes in fatigue positively and statistically significantly correlated with U.S. daily changes of both new deaths and new active cases (r ranged: 0.39 to 0.48, P&lt;0.05). COVID-19 and symptoms of anxiety were the two most commonly discussed health-related topics on social media from June 14 to December 13, 2020. Real-time monitoring of social media posts on symptoms and medical conditions may help assess the population's mental health status and enhance public health surveillance for infectious disease.","Ding, Massey, Huang, Grady, Lu, Cohen, Matzner, Mahajan, Caraballo, Kumar, Xue, Dreyer, Roy, Krumholz","https://doi.org/10.2196/29413","20210913","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17902,""
"The role of cognitive biases and emotion regulation strategies when facing major stressors: ecological evidence during the COVID-19 lockdown of 2020 using a novel online cognitive bias assessment","Extant research supports a causal role of cognitive biases on stress regulation under experimental conditions. However, their contribution to psychological adjustment in the face of ecological major stressors has been largely unstudied. We developed a novel online method to provide an ecological examination of attention and interpretation biases during major stress (ie, the COVID-19 lockdown suffered in March/April 2020) and tested their relations with the use of emotion regulation strategies (ie, reappraisal and rumination), to account for individual differences in psychological adjustment to major COVID-related stressors (ie, low depression and anxiety, high well-being and resilience). Participants completed an online protocol evaluating the psychological impact of COVID-related stressors and the use of emotion regulation strategies in response to them, during the initial weeks of the lockdown of March/April 2020. They also completed a new online cognitive task, designed to remotely assess attention and interpretation biases for negative information. The psychometric properties of the online cognitive bias assessments were very good, supporting their feasibility for ecological evaluation. Structural equation models showed that negative interpretation bias was a direct predictor of worst psychological adjustment (higher depression and anxiety, lower well-being and resilience) (Ãâ€¡2 9 = 7.57; RMSEA = 0.000). Further, rumination mediated the influence of interpretation bias in anxiety (P = .045; 95% CI 0.03 to 3.25) and resilience (P = .001; 95% CI -6.34 to -1.65), whereas reappraisal acted as a mediator of the influence of both attention (P = .047; 95% CI -38.71 to -0.16) and interpretation biases (P=.04; 95% CI -5.25 to -0.12) in well-being. This research highlights the relevance of individual processes of attention and interpretation during periods of adversity and identifies modifiable protective factors that can be targeted through online interventions.","Blanco, Boemo, Sanchez-Lopez","https://doi.org/10.2196/30961","20210913","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17903,""
"Tracking the Irish adult population during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: A methodological report of the COVID-19 psychological research consortium (C19PRC) study in Ireland","The COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) study was established to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population of multiple countries. Here, we provide a methodological overview, cohort profile, data access, and summary of key findings from the Republic of Ireland arm of the C19PRC study. A longitudinal internet panel survey was designed to collect data from a nationally representative sample of Irish adults (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1041) who were tracked from March/April 2020 to March/April 2021. Quota sampling methods were used to produce a sample that was representative of the population with respect to sex, age, and regional distribution. Data were collected in five waves, and new participants were recruited at follow-up waves to cover sample attrition and produce nationally representative samples at various points during the first year of the pandemic. A comprehensive battery of measures was used throughout the project to assess an array of sociodemographic, political, social, psychological, physical health, COVID-19, and mental health variables. Analyses were conducted to compare sample characteristic to known population parameters from available census data. These analyses showed that the sample was representative of the general adult population of Ireland on the three quota variables and was reasonable representative of the population across a diverse range of sociodemographic variables. These data representative the first and only nationally representative, longitudinal survey of the mental health of the Irish population.

"Sociodemographic and lifestyle predictors of mental health adaptability during COVID-19 compulsory confinement: A longitudinal study in the Portuguese population","The outbreak of COVID-19 and the physical isolation measures taken by the governments to reduce its propagation might have negative psychological consequences on the population. In this study, we aimed to explore, for the first time, how mental health status fluctuated along the weeks of the emergency state in Portugal, and to identify which factors may shape these changes in mental health outcomes. To this end, we conducted an online survey to evaluate demographic, lifestyle and mental health variables (DASS-21 and quality of life) in the Portuguese population at three different time-points. 748 participants (mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 39.52, % femalesÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 79.95) provided data at all time-points. We observed that depression, anxiety and stress symptoms seemed to improve as the weeks passed during the state of emergency, while the perception of quality of life and sleep got worse. In particular, being female, younger, actively working, and extroverted appear to be protective factors of mental health adaptability during this particular period. On the contrary, having a psychiatric diagnosis or physical illness, and higher neuroticism seem to be risk factors for mental health worsening. The lack of a more diverse sample could limit the generalizability of our results, and other factors that were not considered in our analysis might also have a significant impact on mental health. Our results provide relevant and novel insights about the course of mental health changes and its predictors during the outbreak of COVID-19, which may help identify potential vulnerability groups.","PicÃƒÂ³-PÃƒÂ©rez, Ferreira, Couto, Raposo-Lima, Machado-Sousa, Morgado","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.150","20210913","COVID-19; Isolation; Longitudinal; Mental health; Quality of life; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17905,""
"Resilience and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from Minnesota and Hong Kong","Previous COVID-19 pandemic research has focused on assessing the severity of psychological responses to pandemic-related stressors. Little is understood about (a) resilience as a mental health protective factor during these stressors, and (b) whether families from Eastern and Western cultures cope differently. This study examines how individual resilience and family resilience moderate the associations between pandemic-related stressors and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in two culturally distinct regions. A total of 1,039 adults (442 from Minnesota, United States, and 597 from Hong Kong) living with at least one family member completed an online survey about COVID-19-related experiences, mental health, individual resilience and family resilience from May 20 to June 30, 2020. Predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were examined separately using hierarchical regression analyses. In both regions, pandemic-related stressors predicted higher symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Individual resilience and two domains of family resilience were associated with positive mental health. In Minnesota, higher levels of individual resilience buffered the negative relationship between pandemic-related stressors and depressive symptoms; higher levels of family communication and problem solving also buffered the negative relationship between pandemic-related stressors and stress symptoms. In Hong Kong, higher family-level positive outlook magnified the negative relationship between pandemic-related stressors and anxiety symptoms. Individual and family resilience is protective against the adverse psychological effects of pandemic stressors, but they vary across cultures and as exposure to pandemic-related stressors increases.","Chan, Piehler, Ho","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.144","20210913","COVID-19; Family resilience; Individual resilience; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17906,""
"Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for people with bipolar disorders: A scoping review","The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019)-related pandemic represents a global source of societal and health burden. Yet, the impact of the pandemic on people with severe mental illness, including bipolar disorder (BD), remains unclear, warranting scoping review on the matter. The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were systematically searched from inception up to April 24, 2021, adopting broad inclusion criteria to assess a variety of clinical and public health themes related to people with a primary diagnosis of BD during the COVID-19 pandemics. The present work complying with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) registered in the Open Science Framework (OSF) repository (https://osf.io/7evpx/). Fourteen papers informed the present scoping review. Four major themes were identified: (i) impact of COVID-19-related stressors on BD; (ii) impact of COVID-19 on mental health service utilization among people with BD; (iii) impact of BD on the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection; (iv) engagement in preventative behaviors among people with BD. Additional themes warranting further research were nonetheless detected. Further original studies are needed. The present study confirmed the high-vulnerability hypothesis concerning people with BD versus the general population, reinforcing the need for further research related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional information is warranted to compare the impact of the pandemic period among BD people against pre-pandemic records, the general population, and other severe mental illnesses, namely people with schizophrenia or major depressive disorder, to inform the public health and the delivery of patient-tailored interventions.","Fornaro, De Prisco, Billeci, Ermini, Young, Lafer, Soares, Vieta, Quevedo, de Bartolomeis, Sim, Yatham, Bauer, Stein, Solmi, Berk, Carvalho","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.091","20210913","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17907,""
"Severity of self-reported symptoms and psychological burden 6-months after hospital admission for COVID-19: a prospective cohort study","Few studies have reported clinical COVID-19 sequelae six months (M6) after hospital discharge, but none has studied symptom severity. Prevalence and severity of 7 symptoms were estimated until M6 using the self-administered influenza severity scale in COVID-19 hospitalized patients enrolled in the French COVID cohort. Factors associated with severity were assessed by logistic regression. Anxiety, depression and health-related quality of life (HRQL) were also assessed. At M6, among the 324 patients (median age 61 years, 63% men, 19% admitted to intensive care during the acute phase), 187/324 (58%) reported at least one symptom mostly fatigue (47%) and myalgia (23%).

"Mind the Gaps: Ethical and Epistemic Issues in the Digital Mental Health Response to Covid-19","Well before the Covid-19 pandemic, proponents of digital psychiatry were touting the promise of various digital tools and techniques to revolutionize mental health care. As social distancing and its knock-on effects have strained existing mental health infrastructures, calls have grown louder for implementing various digital mental health solutions at scale. Decisions made today will shape the future of mental health care for the foreseeable future. Here, in hopes of countering this hype, we examine four ethical and epistemic gaps surrounding the growth of digital mental health: the evidence gap, the inequality gap, the prediction-intervention gap, and the safety gap. We argue that these gaps ought to be considered by policy-makers before society commits to a digital psychiatric future.","Skorburg, Friesen","https://doi.org/10.1002/hast.1292","20210913","digital mental health; ethics of Big Data; philosophy of science","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17910,""
"Clinical, financial and social impacts of COVID-19 and their associations with mental health for mothers and children experiencing adversity in Australia","Australia has maintained low rates of SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) infection, due to geographic location and strict public health restrictions. However, the financial and social impacts of these restrictions can negatively affect parents' and children's mental health. In an existing cohort of mothers recruited for their experience of adversity, this study examined: 1) families' experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health restrictions in terms of clinical exposure, financial hardship family stress, and family resilience (termed 'COVID-19 impacts'); and 2) associations between COVID-19 impacts and maternal and child mental health. Participants were mothers recruited during pregnancy (2013-14) across two Australian states (Victoria and Tasmania) for the 'right@home' trial. A COVID-19 survey was conducted from May-December 2020, when children were 5.9-7.2 years old. Mothers reported COVID-19 impacts, their own mental health (Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales short-form) and their child's mental health (CoRonavIruS Health and Impact Survey subscale). Associations between COVID-19 impacts and mental health were examined using regression models controlling for pre-COVID-19 characteristics. 319/406 (79%) mothers completed the COVID-19 survey. Only one reported having had COVID-19. Rates of self-quarantine (20%), job or income loss (27%) and family stress (e.g., difficulty managing children's at-home learning (40%)) were high. Many mothers also reported family resilience (e.g., family found good ways of coping (49%)). COVID-19 impacts associated with poorer mental health (standardised coefficients) included self-quarantine (mother: ÃŽÂ² = 0.46, child: ÃŽÂ² = 0.46), financial hardship (mother: ÃŽÂ² = 0.27, child: ÃŽÂ² = 0.37) and family stress (mother: ÃŽÂ² = 0.49, child: ÃŽÂ² = 0.74). Family resilience was associated with better mental health (mother: ÃŽÂ² = -0.40, child: ÃŽÂ² = -0.46).

"Student Pandemic Experience: Protocol and baseline characteristics for a mobile prospective cohort study of university student mental health","The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency that poses challenges for the mental health of approximately 1.4 million university students in Canada. Preliminary evidence has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic had a detrimental impact on undergraduate student mental health and well-being, however existing data are predominantly limited to cross-sectional survey-based studies. Due to the evolving nature of the pandemic, longer-term prospective surveillance efforts are needed to better anticipate risk and protective factors during a pandemic. The overarching aim of this research is to use a mobile (primarily smartphone-based) surveillance system to identify risk and protective factors for undergraduate mental health. Factors will be identified from weekly self-report data (e.g., affect, living accommodation) and device sensor data (e.g., physical activity, device usage) to prospectively predict self-reported mental health and service utilization. Undergraduate students at Western University, Canada, will be recruited via e-mail to complete an internet baseline questionnaire with the option to participate in the study on a weekly basis using the Student Pandemic Experience (SPE) mobile application (app) for Android/iOS. The app collects sensor samples (e.g., GPS coordinates, steps) and self-reported weekly mental health and wellness surveys. Student participants can opt-in to link their mobile data with campus-based administrative data capturing health service utilization. Risk and protective factors that predict mental health outcomes are expected to be estimated by 1) cross-sectional associations between student characteristics (e.g., demographics) and key psychosocial factors (e.g., affect, stress, social connection) and behaviors (e.g., physical activity, device usage) and 2) longitudinal associations between psychosocial and behavioral factors and campus-based health service utilization. Data collection began November 9th, 2020 and will be ongoing through to at least October 31st, 2021. Retention from the baseline survey (N=427) to app sign-up was 315/427 (74%), with approximately 175-215 (55-68%) of app participants actively responding to weekly surveys. From November 9th, 2020 to August 8th, 2021, 4851 responses to the app surveys and 25985 sensor samples (consisting of up to 68 individual data items each, e.g., GPS coordinates, steps) were collected from the 315 participants that signed up for the app. The results of this real-world longitudinal cohort study of undergraduate mental health based on questionnaires and mobile sensor metrics is expected to show psychosocial and behavioral patterns associated with both positive and negative mental health-related states during pandemic conditions at a relatively large, public, residential Canadian university campus. The results can be used to support decision-makers and students during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and similar future events. For comparable settings, new interventions (digital or otherwise) might be designed using these findings as an evidence base.

"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and social determinants among the Portuguese population: study protocol","The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and all physical distance measures implemented across the world have caused significant stress, anxiety and mental health implications in the general population. Unemployment, working from home and day-to-day changes may lead to a greater risk of poor mental health outcomes. To describe the protocol for a cross-sectional online study that aim to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. Individuals from the general population with 18 or more years of age living in Portugal were included. Data was collected between 10 November 2020 and 10 February 2021. An exponential non-discriminative snowball sampling method was applied to recruit participants. An online survey was prepared and shared on social network applications (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin, and WhatsApp groups) and through e-mail mailing lists for the recruitment of the ""seeds"". Analysis will be performed in accordance with the different variables and outcomes of interest based on quantitative methods, qualitative methods or mixed-methods, accordingly. As of 10 February 2021, 929 individuals had completed the survey, making the final sample of the study. Results of the survey will be disseminated in national and international scientific journals during 2021-2022. Our findings will have broad implications for understanding the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Portuguese residents as well as aspects related to informal economy. We also hope to be able to provide insights and guidelines for action to the Portuguese Government. In the end, we expect this protocol to provide a roadmap for other countries and researchers that would like to implement a similar questionnaire considering the related conclusions. <AbstractText Label=""INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">DERR1-10.2196/28071.","Aguiar, Pinto, Duarte","https://doi.org/10.2196/28071","20210913","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17913,""
"""If I die, they do not care"": UK National Health Service staff experiences of betrayal-based moral injury during COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic brought unparalleled pressure, stress, and a dramatic change in practice to health care systems across the world. National Health Service (NHS) staff have reported higher levels of burnout, stress, and other mental health issues that they relate directly to the impact of the pandemic. Burnout is often used as a ""catch-all"" term for psychological distress in the workplace, and it has been suggested that, during the pandemic, experience of ""burnout"" may be influenced by ""moral injury"": the distress that can arise from actions, or lack of action, that are seen to violate one's ethical code. This study investigates NHS staff experiences of burnout and betrayal-based moral injury, in which a trusted authority betrays ""what is right."" Sixteen NHS staff members were interviewed in relation to their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, and data were thematically analyzed. Three themes were identified: abandonment as betrayal; dishonesty and lack of accountability; and fractured relationship to management or the NHS. This analysis concludes that self-identified ""burnout"" in NHS staff may include a significant moral component, and that failure to engage in moral repair following betrayal-based moral injury may relate to a long-term loss of trust or fractured relationship with the organization. In addition to traditional trauma-informed psychological support, leadership at all levels should be trained to be aware of betrayal-based moral injury and to engage in moral repair to reduce staff intent to leave and encourage mutual trust.

"Daily dyadic coping during COVID-19 among Israeli couples","Declared a global pandemic in March 2020, COVID-19 is unequivocally changing individuals' daily lives. Research suggests that for many people, the current pandemic is stressogenic, propelling myriads of disturbing affective experiences resulting in greater symptoms of depression and anxiety. Little is known, however, about how this ecologically grounded stress is experienced and managed within people's romantic relationships. Guided by the systemic transactional model of dyadic coping, the current study tested 4 preregistered hypotheses examining the effects of dyadic coping processes on partners' daily mood and relational outcomes near to the outbreak of COVID-19 (During May 2020). Using daily diary data collected from 72 Israeli couples over 21 days, the results showed COVID-related stress to be associated with lower daily positive, and higher daily negative, mood. <i>Stress communication</i> (i.e., disclosing stress to one's partner) was not associated with mood or relational outcomes; however, perceived <i>positive and negative forms of dyadic coping</i> (perceived partner's constructive and destructive behaviors in response to one's stress) were associated with poorer daily relational outcomes. Negative dyadic coping also exacerbated the effect of stress on one's negative mood. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effects of daily dyadic coping and COVID-related stress on people's affective and relational outcomes. The findings may shed light on the ways in which partners can help each other to adaptively cope with global health crises.

"Medical care disruptions during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic: the experience of older breast cancer survivors","Older cancer survivors required medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic, but there are limited data on medical care in this age group. We evaluated care disruptions in a longitudinal cohort of non-metastatic breast cancer survivors aged 60-98 from five US regions (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°321). Survivors completed a web-based or telephone survey from May 27, 2020 to September 11, 2020. Care disruptions included interruptions in seeing or speaking to doctors, receiving medical treatment or supportive therapies, or filling prescriptions since the pandemic began. Logistic regression models evaluated associations between care disruptions and education, medical, psychosocial, and COVID-19-related factors. Multivariate models included age, county COVID-19 death rates, comorbidity, and post-diagnosis time. There was a high response rate (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°262, 81.6%). Survivors were 32.2Ã‚Â months post-diagnosis (SD 17.5, range 4-73). Nearly half (48%) reported a medical disruption. The unadjusted odds of care disruptions were higher with each year of education (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.08-1.37, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and increased depression by CES-D score (OR 1.04, CI 1.003-1.08, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.033) while increased tangible support decreased the odds of disruptions (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.012). There was a trend between disruptions and comorbidities (unadjusted OR 1.13 per comorbidity, 95% CI 0.99-1.29, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.07). Adjusting for covariates, higher education years (OR1.23, 95% CI 1.09-1.39, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and tangible social support (OR 0.98 95% CI 0.97-1.00, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006) remained significantly associated with having care disruptions. Older breast cancer survivors reported high rates of medical care disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic and psychosocial factors were associated with care disruptions. CLINICALTRIALS.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Alcohol Consumption throughout the First COVID-19 Lockdown: Contribution of Age and Pre-Pandemic Drinking Patterns","The COVID-19 outbreak and the related lockdown measures have raised concerns regarding mental health, including alcohol misuse. Preliminary studies investigated alcohol consumption at the early stages of lockdown, but no longitudinal data regarding its evolution during and after the first lockdown are currently available. We investigated changes in alcohol consumption among a convenience sample of 1,693 French-speaking Belgian adults using a 3-stage longitudinal online survey. All participants reported their consumption at different stages of lockdown: before lockdown onset (retrospectively, T0), at 2 different times during lockdown (T1 and T2), and after lockdown offset (T3). We also measured socio-demographic variables and the harmfulness of drinking patterns before lockdown. A mixed model with negative binomial distribution indicated that participants decreased their alcohol consumption after lockdown onset and returned to their initial alcohol consumption after lockdown offset. Younger individuals (18-30 years old) were more likely to decrease their consumption during the lockdown period (T1 and T2) than the periods preceding or following lockdown (T0 and T3), especially if they presented hazardous or problematic drinking patterns before lockdown. We only observed a rebound effect after lockdown offset among young moderate drinkers. All participants kept stable their alcohol consumption during lockdown (T1 and T2). Lockdown onset and offset constitute key periods for alcohol consumption changes during the COVID-19 crisis, particularly in youth and in individuals with hazardous or problematic drinking patterns.","Bollen, Pabst, Creupelandt, Fontesse, Laniepce, Maurage","https://doi.org/10.1159/000518218","20210913","Alcohol; COVID-19; Drinking patterns; Lockdown; Longitudinal study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17920,""
"How Dialysis Patients Cope with a Curfew? A Comparison of Psychological Status between Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic","There are many differences between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatments, including their impact on the psychological status of the patients. In this study, our aim was to compare the psychological statuses of HD and PD patients during the social isolation period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted this cross-sectional study on adult HD and PD patients when the curfew measures were in effect. We used an electronic form composed of 3 sections to collect data. In the first section, we collected data on the demographics and clinical and laboratory parameters of the patients. The second and third sections consisted of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaires, respectively. The HD (n = 116) and PD (n = 130) groups were similar regarding age and sex, and they had similar HADS anxiety scores. HADS depression scores were higher in PD patients (p = 0.052). IES-R scores were significantly higher in PD patients in comparison to HD patients (p = 0.001). Frequencies of abnormal HADS-anxiety (p = 0.035) and severe psychological impact (p = 0.001) were significantly higher in PD patients. During the social isolation period due to the COVID-19 pandemic, HD patients had better mood profiles than PD patients. A more stable daily routine, an uninterrupted face-to-face contact with health-care workers, and social support among patients in the in-center dialysis environment might be the cause of the favorable mood status. PD patients might need additional psychological support during those periods.","Karaca, Eren, Dincer, Turan, Karaca, Kucuk, Kose, Bek, Bakir, Dervisoglu, Seyahi, Trabulus","https://doi.org/10.1159/000517839","20210913","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Hemodialysis; Peritoneal dialysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17921,""
"An academic-community interprofessional telehealth online training partnership: Impact on students and providers","Telehealth can be used to improve rural communities' access to specialized healthcare services and ameliorate rural care barriers. Use of telehealth quickly increased with the COVID-19 pandemic, and universities shifted to online instruction for the safety of students and faculty. This rapid uptake of telehealth and online instruction has created an urgent need for examples of online training for health professional students in telehealth. Participants for this study included 44 students enrolled in an interprofessional online mental health telehealth course and four health care professionals from rural clinics. Qualitative data were collected and analyzed from students and providers. Four primary themes were identified: student benefits from the IPE telehealth course, patient benefits, clinic benefits, and technological challenges. Student subthemes included learning skills needed for telehealth, improving team skills, learning about professional roles and responsibilities, and understanding rural health needs. Clinic benefits included improving telehealth readiness. This study presents an early example of online interprofessional mental health telehealth training using an academic-community partnership.

"Emotion regulation across the lifespan: age differences in intrapersonal and interpersonal strategies for the adjustment to the COVID-19 pandemic in four countries","Studies have shown age differences in adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic. The processes explaining these age differences remain unclear. Intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion regulation play an important role in psycho-social adjustment and develop across the lifespan. This study investigated whether differences in COVID-19-related adjustment disorder symptoms can be explained by age-differences in rumination in a multi-national sample. Furthermore, linguistic indicators of ruminative processing were examined with reference to age. <i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1401 participants (from USA, UK, Switzerland, Germany, aged 18-88) completed an online survey and a writing task. Measures included brooding, co-brooding, adjustment disorder symptoms, and language indicators of negative self- and communal-focus . Older participants reported less adjustment disorder symptoms which was mediated by less (co-)brooding. Participants reporting more (co-)brooding wrote about COVID-19 more negatively. While in younger adults more self-focus was associated with higher ruminative brooding, in older adults it was associated with less brooding. These findings contribute to a better understanding of regulatory mechanisms that help explain age differences in mental health. They warrant further research considering age-related differences, as our results suggest not only more adaptive emotion regulation as resilience factor in older individuals but also different qualities of self-focus while processing stressful events.","Dworakowski, Huber, Meier, Boyd, Horn","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1972933","20210913","COVID-19; Emotion regulation; adjustment disorder; interpersonal emotion regulation; linguistic markers; ruminative brooding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17923,""
"Nurses' perceptions of social rejection, resilience and well-being during COVID-19: A national comparative study","To determine the level of social rejection and well-being of nurses, whether resilience is a mediator between them and to compare nurses who worked versus did not work on COVID-19 wards. During the COVID-19 pandemic health care workers reported psychological distress and social rejection. An online survey was sent to nursing social media groups in Israel. Respondents completed a Demographic, Social Rejection, Resilience and General Well-being questionnaire. Two hundred and forty-seven nurses responded. The majority were female with a mean age of 43.6Ã‚Â years Approximately one-third were worried about infecting their family members and many agreed that their family fears that the nurse will infect them. Nurses reported their partner, family members, neighbours and the public physically distanced themselves from them. Approximately one quarter reported feeling lonely. Statistically significant differences were found between those who worked versus not work on a COVID-19 unit on general well-being, and social rejection. No differences were found in resilience scores. Social rejection was felt by many nurses as shown by an inverse relationship between the closeness of the relationship and the sense of social rejection and a high level of loneliness and depression. A higher level of social rejection and lower well-being were found among nurses working on COVID-19 wards as opposed to those who did not. General well-being was found to be exceptionally low during COVID-19. Resilience did not mediate the relationship between social rejection and general well-being. Perceived social rejection might be associated with decreased well-being. The level of resilience is related to the level of well-being among nurses in general. Nurses not working in COVID-19 wards have higher levels of well-being and less social rejection compared with nurses working in these wards.","Benbenishty, Ashkenazy, Levdov Avital, Jakobson, Kolpak, DeKeyser Ganz","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16034","20210913","beliefs; depression; nurse; professional boundaries; psychological well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17924,""
"Adolescent well-being amid the COVID-19 pandemic: Are girls struggling more than boys?","Differential effects of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated public restrictions on adolescent girls and boys are emerging but have not been elucidated. This study examined gender differences across broad indicators of adolescent well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iceland, and explored potential explanations for these differences. In total, 523 youth (56.5% girls) born in Iceland in 2004 completed measures on mental health problems (depressive symptoms, anger and suicide attempts) and measures designed for this study to assess broad indicators of adolescent well-being (e.g., day-to-day life, academic performance, family and peer relationships, and mental and physical health) and behavioral changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health problems during the pandemic were compared to expected scores based on nationwide ratings of same-aged peers in 2018. Although both boys and girls appeared affected, girls reported a greater negative impact across all the broad indicators of well-being and behavioral change during COVID-19 than boys, and their depressive symptoms were above and beyond the expected nationwide scores (<i>t</i>(1514)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.80, <i>pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â </i>.001, Cohen's <i>d</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.315). Higher depressive symptoms were associated with increased passive social media use and decreased connecting with family members via telephone or social media among girls, and decreased sleeping and increased online gaming alone among boys. Concern about others contracting COVID-19, changes in daily and school routines, and not seeing friends in person were among the primary contributors to poor mental health identified by youth, particularly girls. Adolescents were broadly negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying restrictions; however, this negative impact was more pronounced in girls. The findings suggest that a steady routine and remaining socially connected may help youth cope with the uncertainty and social restrictions associated with a pandemic. Moreover, healthcare providers, teachers, and other professionals should pay close attention to depressive symptoms among girls during a pandemic.","Halldorsdottir, Thorisdottir, Meyers, Asgeirsdottir, Kristjansson, Valdimarsdottir, Allegrante, Sigfusdottir","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcv2.12027","20210913","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; adolescence; depressive symptoms; gender; mental health; pandemic; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17925,""
"COVID-19 partial school closures and mental health problems: A cross-sectional survey of 11,000 adolescents to determine those most at risk","Understanding adolescents' mental health during lockdown and identifying those most at risk is an urgent public health challenge. This study surveyed school pupils across Southern England during the first COVID-19 school lockdown to investigate situational factors associated with mental health difficulties and how they relate to pupils' access to in-school educational provision. A total of 11,765 pupils in years 8-13 completed a survey in June-July 2020, including questions on mental health, risk indicators and access to school provision. Pupils at home were compared to those accessing in-school provision on risk and contextual factors and mental health outcomes. Multilevel logistic regression analyses compared the effect of eight risk and contextual factors, including access to in-school provision, on depression, anxiety and self-reported deterioration in mental wellbeing. Females, pupils who had experienced food poverty and those who had previously accessed mental health support were at greatest risk of depression, anxiety and a deterioration in wellbeing. Pupils whose parents were going out to work and those preparing for national examinations in the subsequent school year were also at increased risk. Pupils accessing in-school provision had poorer mental health, but this was accounted for by the background risk and contextual factors assessed, in line with the allocation of in-school places to more vulnerable pupils. Although the strongest associations with poor mental health during school closures were established risk factors, further contextual factors of particular relevance during lockdown had negative impacts on wellbeing. Identifying those pupils at greatest risk for poor outcomes is critical for ensuring that appropriate educational and social support can be given to pupils either at home or in-school during subsequent lockdowns.","Mansfield, Newby, Soneson, Vaci, Jindra, Geulayov, Gallacher, Fazel","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcv2.12021","20210913","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; adolescent; mental health; school","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17926,""
"Understanding the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Youth Psychopathology: Genotype-Environment Interplay","Adversity has consistently been found to predict poor mental health outcomes in youth. Perhaps the most omnipresent form of adversity in the past several decades has been the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, a global health crisis linked to elevated rates of numerous forms of youth psychopathology. The ongoing nature of the pandemic renders it critical to identify the mechanisms underlying its effects on mental health. The current study examines pandemic-related disruption across multiple domains (e.g., home life, finances) as an etiologic moderator of several common forms of youth psychopathology. Participants were 637 adolescent twin pairs from the Twin Study of Behavioral and Emotional Development in Children (TBED-C). Mothers reported on disruption experienced by the family, using the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory. A series of biometric genotype-by-environment interaction models revealed that disruption augmented the nonshared environmental contributions to emotional distress and conduct problems but had little effect on the etiology of attention-deficit hyperactivity problems. Our results indicate that identical and fraternal twin similarity in both emotional symptoms and conduct problems decreased with greater disruption, such that children in the same family became less alike, and did so regardless of their degree of genetic resemblance. Put differently, each twin sibling appeared to have their own idiosyncratic experience of pandemic-related disruptions, with downstream consequences for their mental health.","Carroll, Shewark, Hyde, Klump, Burt","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsgos.2021.07.004","20210913","Coronavirus pandemic; Genotype-by-environment interplay; Youth psychopathology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17927,""

"The ongoing activities of livelihood support counselors following nuclear disaster under the COVID-19 restrictions: A preliminary survey","This preliminary study aims to understand the state of support provided in the evacuation areas of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, during the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) restriction. A self-administered survey was conducted with 18 livelihood support counselors from two Social Welfare Councils in November 2020. We investigated the number of consultations since the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of telephonic consultation as opposed to in-person consultations through visits to counselees' homes. Counselors have been continued offering supports to their counselees even under the COVID-19 restrictions, in fact, fifty percent of counselors have increased the consultations. Although some counselors had a sense of unease or concern about telephonic consultation due to the inability to see their non-verbal expressions, there were some advantages of telephonic consultation, in that the counselors were able to have longer sessions and listen more attentively to severe issues. Notably, livelihood support counselors in this study have increased the number of consultations while utilization telephonic consultations, despite the adverse conditions created by the COVID-19 restriction. Moreover, certain advantages of telephonic consultation instead of in-person consultation have been identified. It may be an effective support method avoiding in-person contacts, that also considers infection-prevention measures.","Orui, Fukasawa, Horikoshi, Suzuki, Kawakami","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhip.2021.100107","20210913","COVID-19; Disaster-related support; Mental health; Nuclear disaster; Telephonic consultation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17929,""
"Allostatic load and mental health during COVID-19: The moderating role of neuroticism","During the COVID-19 pandemic increased risk of poor mental health has been evident across different cultures and contexts. This study aims to examine whether allostatic load (AL) prior to the pandemic was predictive of poor mental health during the pandemic, and if any associations were moderated by neuroticism. Data were extracted from Waves 2 (2011, allostatic load), 3 (2012, neuroticism), and the COVID-19 study (April 2020) of the Understanding Society database in the UK; data were available for 956 participants. Mental health increased from 2012- to during the pandemic. Neuroticism and AL were positively associated with poorer mental health during COVID-19, such that those who had scored higher on neuroticism and had higher AL prior to the pandemic reported poorer mental health during the pandemic. Neuroticism was also a significant moderator; the effect of AL on mental health during the pandemic was exacerbated in those with high and moderate levels of neuroticism but not lower. Moreover, this was driven by the immune-related indices of AL. This withstood adjustment for age, gender, employment status and prior mental health. These findings are discussed in relation to the pathophysiological mechanisms of mental health.","Gallagher, Sumner, Creaven, O'SÃƒÂºilleabhÃƒÂ¡in, Howard","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100311","20210913","Allostatic load; COVID-19; Inflammation; Mental health; Neuroticism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17930,""
"A time-varying vulnerability index for COVID-19 in New Mexico, USA using generalized propensity scores","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted systemic inequities in the United States and resulted in a larger burden of negative social outcomes for marginalized communities. New Mexico, a state in the southwestern US, has a unique population with a large racial minority population and a high rate of poverty that may make communities more vulnerable to negative social outcomes from COVID-19. To identify which communities may be at the highest relative risk, we created a county-level vulnerability index. After the first COVID-19 case was reported in New Mexico on March 11, 2020, we fit a generalized propensity score model that incorporates sociodemographic factors to predict county-level viral exposure and thus, the generic risk to negative social outcomes such as unemployment or mental health impacts. We used four static sociodemographic covariates important for the state of New Mexico-population, poverty, household size, and minority population-and weekly cumulative case counts to iteratively run our model each week and normalize the exposure score to create a time-varying vulnerability index. We found the relative vulnerability between counties varied in the first eight weeks from the initial COVID-19 case before stabilizing. This framework for creating a location-specific vulnerability index in response to an ongoing disaster may be used as a quick, deployable metric to inform health policy decisions such as allocating state resources to the county-level.","Gorris, Shelley, Del Valle, Manore","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hpopen.2021.100052","20210913","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17931,""
"Mental and neurological disorders and risk of COVID-19 susceptibility, illness severity and mortality: A systematic review, meta-analysis and call for action","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into a worldwide pandemic, and has been found to be closely associated with mental and neurological disorders. We aimed to comprehensively quantify the association between mental and neurological disorders, both pre-existing and subsequent, and the risk of susceptibility, severity and mortality of COVID-19. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane library databases for studies published from the inception up to January 16, 2021 and updated at July 7, 2021. Observational studies including cohort and case-control, cross-sectional studies and case series that reported risk estimates of the association between mental or neurological disorders and COVID-19 susceptibility, illness severity and mortality were included. Two researchers independently extracted data and conducted the quality assessment. Based on I<sup>2</sup> heterogeneity, we used a random effects model to calculate pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Subgroup analyses and meta-regression analysis were also performed. This study was registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD 42021230832). A total of 149 studies (227,351,954 participants, 89,235,737 COVID-19 patients) were included in this analysis, in which 27 reported morbidity (132,727,798), 56 reported illness severity (83,097,968) and 115 reported mortality (88,878,662). Overall, mental and neurological disorders were associated with a significant high risk of infection (pre-existing mental: OR 1Ã‚Â·67, 95% CI 1Ã‚Â·12-2Ã‚Â·49; and pre-existing neurological: 2Ã‚Â·05, 1Ã‚Â·58-2Ã‚Â·67), illness severity (mental: pre-existing, 1Ã‚Â·40, 1Ã‚Â·25-1Ã‚Â·57; sequelae, 4Ã‚Â·85, 2Ã‚Â·53-9Ã‚Â·32; neurological: pre-existing, 1Ã‚Â·43, 1Ã‚Â·09-1Ã‚Â·88; sequelae, 2Ã‚Â·17, 1Ã‚Â·45-3Ã‚Â·24), and mortality (mental: pre-existing, 1Ã‚Â·47, 1Ã‚Â·26-1Ã‚Â·72; neurological: pre-existing, 2Ã‚Â·08, 1Ã‚Â·61-2Ã‚Â·69; sequelae, 2Ã‚Â·03, 1Ã‚Â·66-2Ã‚Â·49) from COVID-19. Subgroup analysis revealed that association with illness severity was stronger among younger COVID-19 patients, and those with subsequent mental disorders, living in low- and middle-income regions. Younger patients with mental and neurological disorders were associated with higher mortality than elders. For type-specific mental disorders, susceptibility to contracting COVID-19 was associated with pre-existing mood disorders, anxiety, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); illness severity was associated with both pre-existing and subsequent mood disorders as well as sleep disturbance; and mortality was associated with pre-existing schizophrenia. For neurological disorders, susceptibility was associated with pre-existing dementia; both severity and mortality were associated with subsequent delirium and altered mental status; besides, mortality was associated with pre-existing and subsequent dementia and multiple specific neurological diseases. Heterogeneities were substantial across studies in most analysis. The findings show an important role of mental and neurological disorders in the context of COVID-19 and provide clues and directions for identifying and protecting vulnerable populations in the pandemic. Early detection and intervention for neurological and mental disorders are urgently needed to control morbidity and mortality induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there was substantial heterogeneity among the included studies, and the results should be interpreted with caution. More studies are needed to explore long-term mental and neurological sequela, as well as the underlying brain mechanisms for the sake of elucidating the causal pathways for these associations.

"High levels of psychosocial distress among Australian frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound and prolonged impact on healthcare services and healthcare workers. The Australian COVID-19 Frontline Healthcare Workers Study aimed to investigate the severity and prevalence of mental health issues, as well as the social, workplace and financial disruptions experienced by Australian healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. A nationwide, voluntary, anonymous, single timepoint, online survey was conducted between 27 August and 23 October 2020. Individuals self-identifying as frontline healthcare workers in secondary or primary care were invited to participate. Participants were recruited through health organisations, professional associations or colleges, universities, government contacts and national media. Demographics, home and work situation, health and psychological well-being data were collected. A total of 9518 survey responses were received; of the 9518 participants, 7846 (82.4%) participants reported complete data. With regard to age, 4110 (52.4%) participants were younger than 40 years; 6344 (80.9%) participants were women. Participants were nurses (n=3088, 39.4%), doctors (n=2436, 31.1%), allied health staff (n=1314, 16.7%) or in other roles (n=523, 6.7%). In addition, 1250 (15.9%) participants worked in primary care. Objectively measured mental health symptoms were common: mild to severe anxiety (n=4694, 59.8%), moderate to severe burnout (n=5458, 70.9%) and mild to severe depression (n=4495, 57.3%). Participants were highly resilient (mean (SD)=3.2 (0.66)). Predictors for worse outcomes on all scales included female gender; younger age; pre-existing psychiatric condition; experiencing relationship problems; nursing, allied health or other roles; frontline area; being worried about being blamed by colleagues and working with patients with COVID-19.

"Was Sleep a Problem for the Elderly During COVID-19?","Over the past few decades, the population of geriatrics has seen an exponential rise and it is well known that the prevalence of chronic diseases and other associated comorbidities is higher among them which in turn, has an established association with sleep disorders. During these unprecedented circumstances, geriatrics are predisposed to be at an increased risk of sleep disorders due to the social isolation and loneliness imposed on them by the lockdowns. The fact that older adults are at a greater risk of contracting the virus due to theÃ‚Â presence of comorbidities and the high virulence adds on to the existing risk of sleep disturbances. A lack of sleep in these circumstances has the potential to add on to the vicious cycle of sleep disorders predisposed by chronic disease and vice versa. Mental health, sleep and the presence of comorbidities are closely interlinked and they often tend to overlap. Research in sleep has established insomnia to be the most commonly diagnosed sleep disorder affecting almost 50% of the older adults which can subsequently, elevate their risk of falls. This prevalence of sleep disorders is hypothesized to increase during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and a good sleep routine needs to be advocated for to improve the quality of life of this population. However, scientific evidence concerning this is scarce and this review aims to highlight the significance of sleep and urges its readers to undertake studies that investigate the architecture of sleep amongst older adults during the pandemic.","Parveen, George, Chand","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41782-021-00164-2","20210913","Insomnia; Isolation; Lockdown; Pandemic; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17934,""
"Addictive Behaviours among University Students in Malaysia during COVID-19 Pandemic","Preventative measures to stop the spread of the COVID-19 have affected university students in an unprecedented manner. During the pandemic, their well-being and mental health are being shaped by online learning, home confinement, and uncertainty about their future. The overall aim of this study was to examine the frequency of three addictive-like behaviors (i.e., eating, social media, and online gaming) among university students, and their associations with mental health and self-regulation. This study was an online-based cross-sectional study involving 178 students from a public university in Sarawak. They were asked to complete a set of questionnaires that were used to measure substance, cigarette, and alcohol use, psychological distress, anxiety towards COVID-19, self-regulation, as well as food, online gaming, and social media addiction. There was a significant increment in the duration of time spent on online gaming and social media during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of substance use was low, with 3.9% and 12% of the students reported using cigarettes and alcohol, respectively in the last 30 days. Significant positive correlations were found between the three addictive-like behaviors (food, gaming, and social media addiction) and psychological distress. Significant negative correlations were found between self-regulation and the three addictive-like behaviors as well as psychological distress. Multidisciplinary efforts are needed to mitigate potential pre-existing and potential worsening addictive behaviors among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics and natural disasters.","Chuong Hock, Essau","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2021.100375","20210913","Addictive behaviors; COVID-19 pandemic; psychological distress; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17935,""
"Impact of COVID-19 induced lockdown on land surface temperature, aerosol, and urban heat in Europe and North America","The outbreak of SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to human beings, society, and economic activities all over the world. Worldwide rigorous containment measures for limiting the spread of the virus have several beneficial environmental implications due to decreased anthropogenic emissions and air pollutants, which provide a unique opportunity to understand and quantify the human impact on atmospheric environment. In the present study, the associated changes in Land Surface Temperature (LST), aerosol, and atmospheric water vapor content were investigated over highly COVID-19 impacted areas, namely, Europe and North America. The key findings revealed a large-scale negative standardized LST anomaly during nighttime across Europe (-0.11Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C to -2.6Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C), USA (-0.70Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C) and Canada (-0.27Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C) in March-May of the pandemic year 2020 compared to the mean of 2015-2019, which can be partly ascribed to the lockdown effect. The reduced LST was corroborated with the negative anomaly of air temperature measured at meteorological stations (i.e. -0.46Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C to -0.96Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C). A larger decrease in nighttime LST was also seen in urban areas (by Ã¢Ë†Â¼1-2Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C) compared to rural landscapes, which suggests a weakness of the urban heat island effect during the lockdown period due to large decrease in absorbing aerosols and air pollutants. On the contrary, daytime LST increased over most parts of Europe due to less attenuation of solar radiation by atmospheric aerosols. Synoptic meteorological variability and several surface-related factors may mask these changes and significantly affect the variations in LST, aerosols and water vapor content. The changes in LST may be a temporary phenomenon during the lockdown but provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the effects of various forcing controlling factors in urban microclimate and a strong evidence base for potential environmental benefits through urban planning and policy implementation.","Parida, Bar, Kaskaoutis, Pandey, Polade, Goswami","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103336","20210913","Aerosols; Atmospheric pollutants; COVID-19 lockdown; Land surface temperature; Urban heat island; Water vapor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17936,""

"Cross cultural and global uses of a digital mental health app: results of focus groups with clinicians, patients and family members in India and the United States","Despite significant advancements in healthcare technology, digital health solutions - especially those for serious mental illnesses - continue to fall short of their potential across both clinical practice and efficacy. The utility and impact of medicine, including digital medicine, hinges on relationships, trust, and engagement, particularly in the field of mental health. This paper details results from Phase 1 of a two-part study that seeks to engage people with schizophrenia, their family members, and clinicians in co-designing a digital mental health platform for use across different cultures and contexts in the United States and India. Each site interviewed a mix of clinicians, patients, and their family members in focus groups (<i>n</i> = 20) of two to six participants. Open-ended questions and discussions inquired about their own smartphone use and, after a demonstration of the mindLAMP platform, specific feedback on the app's utility, design, and functionality. Our results based on thematic analysis indicate three common themes: increased use and interest in technology during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), concerns over how data are used and shared, and a desire for concurrent human interaction to support app engagement. People with schizophrenia, their family members, and clinicians are open to integrating technology into treatment to better understand their condition and help inform treatment.

Their impact on individuals with neurological conditions, considered vulnerable to COVID-19 complications, remains to be determined. <b>Objective:</b> To investigate associations between physical activity and health-related quality of life outcomes in individuals with a neurological condition during government mandated COVID-19 restrictions. <b>Methods:</b> An e-survey assessing fear of COVID-19, physical activity level and health-related quality of life outcomes (functional disability and pain, anxiety and depression, loneliness, fatigue, and vitality) was distributed to individuals with a neurologically-related mobility disability living in the United Kingdom. Open-ended questions were also included to contextualize barriers and facilitators to engage in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gamma-weighted generalized linear models and tree-structured regression models were employed to determine the associations between physical activity and health-related quality of life. <b>Results:</b> Of 199 responses, 69% reported performing less physical activity compared to pre-pandemic. Tree-structured regression models revealed that lower leisure-time physical activity was significantly associated (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.009) with higher depression and fatigue, but lower vitality. The closure of leisure facilities and organized sport (27%) was the most commonly cited barrier to engage in physical activity, while 31% of participants mentioned concerns around their physical and mental health as a facilitator. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our analysis identified homogenous subgroups for depression, fatigue, and vitality based specifically on leisure-time physical activity cut points, irrespective of additional demographic or situational characteristics.

"Coronavirus Disease 2019 Emergency and Remote Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Group Therapy With Adolescents and Young Adults: Overcoming Lockdown With the Butterfly Hug","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has represented an individual and collective trauma with an impact on mental health. Restrictive measures such as lockdowns have increased risk factors for the development or triggering of various psychopathologies. Timely psychological intervention has constituted a protective factor that has been indicated as a form of prevention. The main objective of this study was to measure changes in the levels of traumatic stress and anxiety in a clinical population of adolescents and young adults aged 13 to 24 years - already assisted by the local primary and specialty care services before the pandemic - following a trauma-focused psychotherapeutic group intervention according to the eye movement desensitization and reprocessing protocol, conducted remotely before the end of the first lockdown. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scales, and the Emotion Thermometer were administered pre- and post-treatment. At the end of the treatment, the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) questionnaire was administered. The results show that there was a significant improvement pre- and post-intervention in the scores of the scales STAI, IES-R, and Emotion Thermometer with a reduction in post-traumatic symptoms related in particular to the domains of intrusiveness and hyperarousal. The domain of avoidance was less significantly modified by therapy. This overall clinical improvement did not correlate with any of the demographic variables of the sample. In addition, the results show a significant positive global perceived change (PTGI) that did not correlate with the reduction of anxiety or post-traumatic symptoms measured by the other self-report scales.

We proposed that (1) participants would use ACAs as avoidance-based emotion regulation strategies; and (2) music engagement would be used for emotion regulation. Australian participants (<i>N</i> = 653) recruited from the general public completed an online survey, which included scales targeting anxiety (GAD7 scale), depression (PHQ9 scale) and loneliness (two UCLA Loneliness Scales, referring to ""Before"" and ""Since"" COVID-19). Participants reported which ACAs they had undertaken and ceased during the pandemic using an established list and ranked their undertaken ACAs in terms of effectiveness at making them ""feel better."" For their top-ranked ACA, participants then completed the Emotion Regulation Scale for Artistic Creative Activities (ERS-ACA), and if participants had undertaken any musical ACAs, also the Musical Engagement Questionnaire (MusEQ). The results supported both hypotheses. ANOVAs indicated that participants ranked significantly higher on the ""avoidance"" ERS-ACA subscale than the other subscales, and that participants ranked significantly higher on the emotion regulation and musical preference MusEQ subscales than the other subscales. Additionally, while ACAs such as ""Watching films or TV shows"" and ""Cookery or baking"" were common, they ranked poorly as effective methods of emotion regulation, whereas ""Listening to music"" was the second-most frequently undertaken ACA and also the most effective. ""Singing"" and ""Dancing"" were among the most ceased ACAs but also ranked among the most effective for emotion regulation, suggesting that support for developing pandemic-safe approaches to these ACAs may provide well-being benefits in future crises. Additionally, correlation analyses showed that younger participants, those who took less exercise during the pandemic, and those with the highest musical engagement reported the poorest well-being. We conclude that ACAs provided an important resource for supporting mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia and could potentially support mental health and well-being in future crises.","Kiernan, Chmiel, Garrido, Hickey, Davidson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.696202","20210913","COVID-19; artistic creative activities; coronavirus; creativity; emotion regulation; mental health; musical engagement; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17941,""
"Coping Strategy, Social Support, and Psychological Distress Among University Students in Jakarta, Indonesia During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the world for a year, where a study in China showed that the disease increased psychological distress among adolescents and college students, such as anxiety about the academic setback, economic effects, and impact on their daily life. However, a further study examining the impact of the disease on the mental health of students is required. Social support is the most vital psychosocial protective resource, where effective coping can reduce stress levels and prevent individuals from experiencing more severe psychological distress. Therefore, this study investigated the coping strategy, social support, and psychological distress among university students in Jakarta who are also the epicenter of COVID-19 in Indonesia. The psychological distress and coping strategy variable were measured through the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) and the COPE Brief instrument, respectively. Meanwhile, the Multidimensional Perceived Social Support-12 instrument was used to measure the social support variable. The study was disseminated via an online form and the number of research subjects included 250 students who matched the research criteria, including DKI Jakarta domicile and active students registered in the area that were confirmed to be COVID-19 positive. According to the results, coping strategies and increased social support were significantly correlated with decreased psychological distress and may serve as the basis for interventions.","Akbar, Aisyawati","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.694122","20210913","COVID-19; coping strategy; psychological distress; social support; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17942,""
"Compulsive Internet Use Scale: Psychometric Properties and Associations With Sleeping Patterns, Mental Health, and Well-Being in Lithuanian Medical Students During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> The increase in problematic Internet use (PIU) among medical students and resident doctors during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may be leading to significant impairments in everyday functioning, including sleeping patterns, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and overall well-being. The Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS) has been developed to assess the severity of PIU, however, it has not been elucidated whether this scale is also applicable to medical students and resident doctors. The first aim of this study was to explore the psychometric properties of the Lithuanian version of the CIUS. The second aim was to examine associations between subjectively reported mental health symptoms and PIU during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 524 medical students and resident doctors (78.60% women, mean age 24 [SD 3] years old) participated in an online survey between December 2020 and February 2021. Participants completed the CIUS, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 (GAD-7), and the WHO-Five Well-Being Index questionnaire (WHO-5). <b>Results:</b> The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) suggested brief versions (CIUS-5, CIUS-7, and CIUS-9) rather than the original (CIUS-14) version of the CIUS questionnaire as reliable and structurally stable instruments that can be used to measure compulsive Internet use severity in the sample of medical students and resident doctors. The most prevalent online behaviors were social media use (90.1%), online shopping (15.6%), and online gaming/gambling (11.3%). Students with higher CIUS scores reported significantly lower academic achievements during the 6 months (<i>r</i> = 0.12-0.13; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.006), as well as more severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, worsened sleep quality, and lower sense of well-being (<i>r</i> = 0.21-0.41; <i>p</i>'s &lt; 0.001). Both, during workdays (<i>d</i> = 0.87) and weekend (<i>d</i> = 0.33), students spent more time online than resident doctors (<i>p</i>'s &lt; 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> The brief, 5-, 7-, and 9-item versions of the Lithuanian CIUS are reliable and valid self-report screening instruments for evaluating the severity of PIU symptoms among the medical student population. Symptoms of PIU during the COVID-19 period were associated with worsened self-reported mental health and everyday functioning.","Milasauskiene, Burkauskas, Podlipskyte, KirÃƒÂ¡ly, Demetrovics, Ambrasas, Steibliene","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.685137","20210913","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; problematic internet use; psychometrics; sleep; validation; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17943,""
"Psychological Problems in a Sample of Jordanian Healthcare Workers Involved in Caring for Patients With COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Purpose:</b> To explore the psychological problems (stress, depression, and anxiety) and the level of resilience among frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) who provide care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Additionally, the current study identified the correlation among these problems, resilience, and demographics of participants. The study explored the main predictors of stress, depression, anxiety, and resilience. <b>Methods:</b> Both the descriptive cross-sectional correlational design and convenience sample technique were used to collect data from active Jordanian HCWs who directly deal with patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 and work at healthcare facilities in Jordan. Data were collected by using online questionnaires about the demographics, stress, anxiety, depression, and resilience of the participants. <b>Results:</b> Data were collected from 225 HCWs. Their mean age was 31.17 years (SD = 6.8). All the participants perceived different levels of stress, with most perceiving exposure to a high level of stress (distress) (46.2% with low level and 53.8% with high level of stress); approximately half of them (52.9%; <i>n</i> = 119) reported a high level of anxiety, and more than half (66.2%; <i>n</i> = 149) had a high level of depression. Additionally, an increased anxiety and depression level was significantly associated with the decreased resilience and increased stress level. Increased age and experience of HCWs are significantly correlated with increased stress levels. The participants having personal protection equipment (PPE) reduced anxiety and depression and increased resilience (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). The predictors of the main variables were varied in the study. <b>Conclusion:</b> Frontline HCWs involved in treating the patients with COVID-19 are liable to have a high level of stress that is associated with increased anxiety and depression levels. These high levels affect their mental well-being and resilience. Healthcare institutions in Jordan must tailor appropriate psychological interventions and support that are congruent with the needs of HCWs during and after caring for patients with COVID-19.","Alhalaiqa, Khalifeh, Al Omari, Yehia, Khalil","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.679785","20210913","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; resilience; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17944,""
"The Prevalence of Psychological Symptoms in Pregnant Healthcare Workers (HCWs) and Pregnant Non-HCWs During the Early Stage of COVID-19 Pandemic in Chongqing, China","<b>Background:</b> Studies showed that healthcare workers (HCWs) and pregnant women bore the burden of mental problems during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While, few studies have focused on the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women who work at healthcare settings. This study aimed to investigate and compare the prevalence difference of psychological symptoms between pregnant HCWs and pregnant non-HCWs during the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic in China. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional online survey with anonymous structured questionnaires was conducted from February 15 to March 9, 2020. A total of 205 pregnant women in Chongqing, China were recruited. The mental health status was assessed using symptom checklist-90 (SCL-90). <b>Results:</b> Our sample was composed of 83 pregnant HCWs (mean age = 29.8) and 122 pregnant non-HCWs (mean age = 30.8). The results suggested the prevalence of psychological symptoms (the factor score Ã¢â€°Â¥2) among all pregnant women ranged from 6.83% (psychosis symptoms) to 17.56% (obsessive-compulsive symptoms). Compared with pregnant non-HCWs, pregnant HCWs reported higher prevalence of psychological symptoms in 10 factors of SCL-90. After controlling the confounding variables, multiple logistic regression demonstrated that pregnant HCWs experienced higher prevalence of psychological symptoms of somatization (18.07 vs. 5.74%, <i>p</i> = 0.006, aOR = 4.52), anxiety disorders (16.87 vs. 6.56%, <i>p</i> = 0.016, aOR = 3.54), and hostility (24.10 vs. 10.66%, <i>p</i> = 0.027, aOR = 2.70) than those among pregnant non-HCW. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study indicated that pregnant HCWs were more likely to suffer from mental health distress than pregnant non-HCWs during the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic. It is vital to implement targeted psychological interventions for pregnant women, especially for pregnant HCWs to cope with distress when facing the emerging infectious diseases.","Liu, Li, Cai, Feng, Wang, Xiong","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.708698","20210913","COVID-19; Chinese; pregnant healthcare workers; pregnant women; psychological symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17945,""
"Exercise as a coping strategy and its impact on the psychological well-being of Japanese community-dwelling older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study","This study aimed to examine the prevalence of exercise as a coping strategy among Japanese community-dwelling older adults and its impact on their psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2019 (baseline [BL]), 720 community-dwelling older adults living in an urban area in Japan participated in a comprehensive health survey. Of these, 618 responded to a mail survey (follow-up [FL]) in June 2020, after the first state of emergency was lifted. Their psychological well-being was assessed using the WHO-5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Exercise as a coping strategy during the stay-at-home period was determined at FL by asking respondents whether they had engaged in 1) walking and 2) at-home exercise and strength training to maintain their physical and mental health. Each type of exercise's impact and the effective exercise combinations were examined. Time and group interaction effects on the WHO-5 scores were investigated using a two-way analysis of covariance. Of the final sample, 65.1% engaged in walking. The WHO-5 mean scores at BL and FL were 16.7 and 15.4 for the walking group and 16.7 and 14.5 for the non-walking group, respectively; interaction for time and group was significant. Additionally, 56.4% of the participants engaged home training. The WHO-5 mean score at BL and FL were 17.5 and 15.5 for the home training group and 15.7 and 14.5 for the no home training group, respectively; there was no significant interaction. Older adults who engaged in both walking and home training received higher score on the WHO-5 than those who engaged in only one activity at FL. The decline in psychological well-being was most attenuated in the walking only group compared to the at-home exercise and strength training groups. Exercise as a coping strategy during the stay-at-home period was associated with psychological well-being, with different impacts observed depending on the type of activity.","Ejiri, Kawai, Kera, Ihara, Fujiwara, Watanabe, Hirano, Kim, Obuchi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2021.102054","20210913","COVID-19 pandemic; Coping strategy; Exercise; Longitudinal study; Older adults; Psychological well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17946,""
"Six-Week Online Multi-component Positive Psychology Intervention Improves Subjective Wellbeing in Young Adults","Improving mental wellbeing has a range of benefits for society, including increased productivity, longevity, and resiliency. However, interventions designed to improve mental wellbeing are often only compared to waitlist controls, leaving uncertainty regarding the mechanisms of their effectiveness. The current study in 326 participants assessed a six-week positive psychology intervention against an active control (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°163) in an online randomized control trial. Outcome measures included life satisfaction, wellbeing (subjective and psychological wellbeing), stress, depression and anxiety symptoms, and self-compassion. The potential moderating effect of participating during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was also explored. The intervention group showed greater improvements in life satisfaction by week six (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.18, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.014) and were maintained through to 7Ã‚Â weeks post-baseline (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.23, <i>t</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.07, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.002) and remained significant when accounting for COVID-19 restrictions. An improvement in composite wellbeing from baseline to 7Ã‚Â weeks post-baseline was detected when accounting for COVID-19 restrictions. Composite wellbeing and total depression and anxiety symptoms improved significantly more in the intervention group for participants with low baseline resiliency resources. These findings support the efficacy of using online multi-component positive psychology interventions in boosting wellbeing and reducing distress symptoms particularly in individuals with fewer resiliency resources who may need added support.

"Prevalence of Symptoms of Anxiety Among Residents of Kabul During Pandemic of COVID-19: A Report from Capital of Afghanistan","This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety among residents of Kabul during the present COVID-19 pandemic. This descriptive cross-sectional, community based survey was conducted in Kabul, Afghanistan, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from July 11, 2020, to July 16, 2020. A bilingual (Dari and English) questionnaire was used for data collection. The first section of the questionnaire collected sociodemographic information of the respondents and the second comprised a self-report standardized scale, i.e. Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to assess symptoms of anxiety. The survey form was distributed through online platforms. All residents of Kabul who used social apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook were eligible to participate in the study and participation was voluntary and non-commercial. Altogether 1135 complete responses were received. The majority of them were males and aged 18-34 years. Almost 18% were healthcare workers. Overall, 28.2% of the respondents reported symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety, 38.8% reported symptoms of mild anxiety, and nearly one third of the respondents reported no symptoms. Female participants reported significantly higher levels of anxiety compared with males (39.7% versus 25.6%; p = 0.0001). No significant association was noted between anxiety levels and age groups, occupations, and healthcare workers versus non-healthcare workers.

"Fear of COVID-19: Psychological distress and coping among university students in Ghana","The advent of the coronavirus pandemic has impacted the psychological well-being of many people. This study examined the relationship between fear of COVID-19, psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress) and coping strategies adopted by undergraduate students in Ghana. A sample of 209 students were recruited to complete online surveys on fear of COVID-19, psychological distress and coping strategies between June and July 2020. Students scored between normal to mild levels of psychological distress but above average scores on fear of coronavirus (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°19.45, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.04). Fear of COVID-19 was positively related to psychological distress. Only maladaptive coping was found to be significantly and positively associated with fear of COVID-19. However post-hoc analysis of the components of coping strategies revealed that denial (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.17, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.028), venting (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.18, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.036) and humour (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.18, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.023; an adaptive coping strategy) were associated with fear of COVID-19. Finally, both adaptive coping and maladaptive coping strategies had a mediating effect on fear of COVID-19 and psychological distress. These findings emphasize the need to design and optimize institutional interventions that will assess psychological distress and fear of COVID-19 levels during this pandemic and provide psychotherapeutic support for students as they return to school.","Oti-Boadi, Malm, Dey, Oppong","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02267-5","20210913","Coping; Fear of COVID-19; Ghana; Psychological distress; Undergraduates","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17949,""
"Psychological distress and resilience in first responders and health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, first responders and health care workers faced elevated virus-related risks through prolonged contacts with the public. Research suggests that these workers already experienced lower levels of psychological well-being linked to occupational risks. Thus, the pandemic's impact might have particularly affected mental health in these groups. This paper analysed data from a large-scale Welsh population study (<i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 12,989) from June to July 2020. Levels of psychological distress were compared across various occupations, including police, fire and rescue, and NHS health care workers. Resilience was also indexed, and its role considered as a protective factor for psychological distress. Surprisingly, health care workers reported lower distress levels than the general population. Further, fire and rescue and police groups had lower distress than most groups and significantly higher resilience. Within police officers, higher resilience levels were protective for distress. Fire and rescue workers were half as likely as others to report distress, even accounting for demographic factors and resilience. The findings offer an optimistic view of psychological resilience in these critical occupations. They illustrate potential benefits to one's mental health of playing a crucial societal role during crises and reiterate the importance of enhancing resilience within groups who encounter high-risk situations daily. Our findings provide evidence that health care workers and first responders showed lower levels of psychological distress than the general population during the first period of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. This may indicate that playing a critical role in society during an episode of crisis, and acting to help others, may be protective of one's own mental health.The research also provides an optimistic view of the psychological resilience of critical first responders and health care workers during a period early on in the COVID-19 pandemic (June-July 2020). This highlights the benefits of fostering resilience in those working within high-risk first responder and health care occupations.","Pink, Gray, O'Connor, Knowles, Simkiss, Snowden","https://doi.org/10.1111/joop.12364","20210913","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; first responders; health care workers; mental wellbeing; pandemic; psychological distress; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17950,""
"Examination of the relationship between emergency department presentations and population mortality: a multicenter analysis of emergency department presentations during the COVID-19 pandemic","In the spring of 2020, Italy experienced a significant reduction in the number of emergency department (ED) presentations during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. If ED access has an impact on patients' prognosis, such a reduction in ED presentations would be expected to correlate with a parallel increase in the mortality rate of the corresponding population. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of reduced ED presentations on the all-cause mortality of the general population. Absolute and relative variation in ED accesses from March 1 to April 30 of both 2019 and 2020 in three hub hospitals in areas with different COVID-19 prevalence and age-standardized mortality data from January 1 to June 30 in 2019 and 2020 of the same areas were evaluated. During March and April 2020, ED consults were decreased of approximately 50% in all three hospitals, as compared with the same months in 2019. There was a marked increase in cumulative mortality in Milan (high SARS-CoV2 infection spread zone) compared with the same period in 2019. In the other two municipalities (Ferrara and Perugia), which had intermediate and low levels of infection spread, the mortality in 2020 was not substantially changed from that of 2019. Taking into account the increase in mortality due to SARS-CoV-2, reductions in ED access did not seem to affect death rates. If this finding will be confirmed, ED organization and access would need to be reconsidered.","Solbiati, Russo, Beverina, Groff, Strada, Furlan, Montano, Costantino, Casazza","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2021.08.004","20210913","Appropriateness; Covid 19; Emergency department; Hospitalization; Mortality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17951,""
"Changes in pediatric hospital care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national qualitative study","The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated rapid changes in healthcare delivery in the United States, including changes in the care of hospitalized children. The objectives of this study were to identify major changes in healthcare delivery for hospitalized children during the COVID-19 pandemic, identify lessons learned from these changes, and compare and contrast the experiences of children's and community hospitals. We purposefully sampled participants from both community and children's hospitals serving pediatric patients in the six U.S. states with the highest COVID-19 hospitalization rates at the onset of the pandemic. We recruited 2-3 participants from each hospital (mix of administrators, front-line physicians, nurses, and parents/caregivers) for semi-structured interviews. We analyzed interview data using constant comparative methods to identify major themes. We interviewed 30 participants from 12 hospitals. Participants described how leaders rapidly developed new hospital policies (e.g., directing use of personal protective equipment) and how this was facilitated by reviewing internal and external data frequently and engaging all relevant stakeholders. Hospital leaders optimized communication through regular, transparent, multi-modal, and bi-directional communication. Clinicians increased use of videoconference and telehealth to facilitate physical distancing, but these technologies may have disadvantaged non-English speakers. Due to declining volumes of hospitalized children and surges of adult patients, clinicians newly provided care for hospitalized adults. This was facilitated by developing care teams supported by adult hospitalists, multidisciplinary support via videoconference, and educational resources. Participants described how the pandemic negatively impacted clinicians' mental health, and they stressed the importance of mental health resources and wellness activities/spaces. We identified several major changes in inpatient pediatric care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the adoption of new hospital policies, video communication, staffing models, education strategies, and staff mental health supports. We outline important lessons learned, including strategies for successfully developing new policies, effectively communicating with staff, and supporting clinicians' expanding scope of practice. Potentially important focus areas in pandemic recovery include assessing and supporting clinicians' mental health and well-being, re-evaluating trainees' skills/competencies, and adapting educational strategies as needed. These findingsÃ‚Â can help guide hospital leaders in supporting pandemic recovery and addressing future crises.","Penwill, De Angulo, Pathak, Ja, Elster, Hochreiter, Newton, Wilson, Kaiser","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06947-7","20210913","COVID-19; Child, hospitalized; Delivery of health care; Hospitals, community; Hospitals, pediatric; Qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17952,""
"Self-efficacy in Insomnia Symptom Management after Digital CBT-I Mediates Insomnia Severity during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) can reduce acute insomnia and depressive symptoms and prevent symptom recurrence. The current study evaluated self-efficacy in managing insomnia symptoms as a potential mediator of the relationship between prior dCBT-I and subsequent insomnia and depressive symptoms assessed during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Participants were 208 adults who completed a randomized controlled trial of dCBT-I versus sleep education in 2016-2017 and also completed self-report assessments of insomnia, depression, and self-efficacy in managing insomnia symptoms. Data were collected in May 2020, five weeks into state-wide COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Regression and mediation analyses were used to evaluate the extent to which self-efficacy accounted for the relationship between treatment condition and improvement in insomnia and depressive symptoms from pre-treatment to COVID-19 follow-up. Prior dCBT-I predicted greater self-efficacy in managing insomnia symptoms. Self-efficacy accounted for 49% and 67% of the protective effect of dCBT-I against COVID-era insomnia and depressive symptoms, respectively. This study affirms the importance of self-efficacy as a key intervention outcome and potential mechanism by which dCBT-I predicts future sleep and mental health. Future studies that evaluate the role of self-efficacy in treatment effectiveness and resilience can provide additional clues about how to optimize dCBT-I for maximum benefit to public health.","Cheng, Casement, Kalmbach, Cuamatzi Castelan, Drake","https://doi.org/10.1080/15402002.2021.1976780","20210913","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17953,""
"COVID-19 and home confinement: A study on fathers, father-child relationships, and child adjustment","The purpose of this study was to explore fathers' adjustment and father-child relationships during the first peak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak (April 2020). More particularly, the study analyzed paternal perceptions of changes concerning familial economic conditions and children's psychological difficulties (namely, emotional problems and hyperactivity) during the lockdown produced by the current pandemic. Furthermore, we investigated the following correlates of fathers' parenting stress: socio-demographic condition, paternal individual stress, anxiety, depression and changes in the father-child relationship during the outbreak. A total of 102 fathers (mean age = 41.60 years; SD = 11.54) with minor children were recruited through an online survey and reported data about their socioeconomic condition, anxiety, and depressive levels, parenting stress, offspring's adjustment, and changes in their relationship with their children. As for the economic conditions, participants were equally distributed between those who did not perceive changes and those who perceived a worsening. With regard to changes in the child's psychological difficulties, results showed that levels of children's emotional problems and inattention/hyperactivity had significantly increased during the lockdown period. A multiple linear regression analysis highlighted that the principal predictor of paternal parenting stress was living in the regions most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by high levels of paternal anxiety symptomatology and high levels of worsening of the relationship with the child during the pandemic. Overall, our study suggests to consider the effects of COVID-19 on fathers as well, as they have been rather overlooked by previous research that has mainly focused on mothers, and to plan specific interventions able to also take them into account.","Trumello, Bramanti, Lombardi, Ricciardi, Morelli, Candelori, Crudele, Cattelino, Baiocco, Chirumbolo, Babore","https://doi.org/10.1111/cch.12912","20210912","COVID-19; anxiety; child adjustment; fathers; parent-child relationship; parenting stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17954,""
"Regenerated silica-based RNA purification columns to address the short supply of RNA purification kits for COVID-19 diagnosis","RT-qPCR technique is the current world-wide method used for the early detection of SARS-CoV2 RNA in the suspected clinical samples. Viral RNA extraction is the key pre-analytical step for SARS-CoV2 detection which often achieved using commercial RNA-extraction kits. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, bulk production and the supply chains for the commercial RNA-extraction kit have been seriously compromised. The shortage of commercial RNA-extraction kit is even more acute in developing country. Furthermore, use of one-off design RNA-columns can generate plastic wastes that have an environmental pollution effect. To address these issues, in this study, we used warm alkaline solution containing Triton X-100 for the complete removal of the residual SARS-CoV2 RNA from the used RNA-binding silica column. Columns regenerated using the alkaline solution have the viral RNA purification capability that is comparable to the fresh silica columns. We also demonstrated that RNA-binding silica columns can be regenerated and reused for a minimum of five-times. Therefore, the use of the RNA-column regeneration method may benefits several SARS-CoV2 diagnostic laboratories throughout the world by cutting down the requirement of commercial RNA-purification column.","Biswal, Ranjan, Dahiya, Mallick, Mohapatra","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06688-0","20210912","COVID-19; RNA-extraction; RT-qPCR; Regenerated RNA-purification column; SARS-CoV2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17955,""
"The Influence of Social Distancing Behaviors and Psychosocial Factors on Physical Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has arguably facilitated a shift toward increased sedentariness and reduced physical activity. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that mental health has also declined during the pandemic. However, it remains unknown to what extent social distancing behaviors and mental health have affected the physical activity levels of the general population. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of social distancing behaviors and prevailing mental health on the odds of being physically active during the early COVID-19 pandemic response. A total of 4,819 adults from the US population (Median age: 46 years [IQR: 35-59]; 51.3% female) completed an online survey during the early pandemic response (April-June 2020). The survey included questions on adherence to 11 social distancing behaviors, and validated questionnaires which assessed self-reported physical activity, depression, anxiety, and mental wellbeing. Respondents were categorized into two physical activity groups: inactive (0-599 MET-minÃ¢Ë†â„¢week-1); and active (Ã¢â€°Â¥600 MET-minÃ¢Ë†â„¢week-1). A logistic generalized additive model (GAM) was used to determine which social distancing factors and mental health outcomes were associated with physical activity level. The GAM analysis revealed that wearing a facemask in public (OR: 1.60 [1.34-1.92]), limiting use of public transport (OR: 1.29 [1.08-1.54]), and restricting travel outside the house (OR: 1.21 [1.02-1.43]) were social distancing behaviors associated with higher odds of being more physically active (P&lt;.05). Conversely, avoiding physical activity outside the house (OR: 0.76 [0.66-0.88]) was associated with higher odds of being inactive (P&lt;.05). Leaving the house more frequently, and a higher mental wellbeing were associated with increasing odds of being physically active (P &lt; .05). Engaging with a moderate number of social distancing behaviors (3-7 total) was positively associated with physical activity, whereas a very high social distancing vigilance (i.e., engaging with Ã¢â€°Â¥10 total behaviors) decreased the odds of being active during the early pandemic response. Based on the findings of our study, we suggest that future public health messaging of social distancing guidelines should include: (i) a clear portrayal of the benefits of regular exercise on mental health; and (ii) a specific focus on how to be physically active outdoors in a COVID-safe manner.","Cross, Isautier, Morris, Johnson, Wheatley-Guy, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.2196/31278","20210912","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17956,""
"Mental health of individuals with and without eating disorders across six months and two waves of COVID-19","The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in a significant mental health toll, and recent findings suggest that individuals with an eating disorder (ED) history may be particularly vulnerable. The current study aimed to: (1) identify changes in the pattern of mental health symptoms over the first six months of the pandemic between individuals with an ED history, compared to a community sample without an ED history (non-ED); and (2) identify differences in mental health symptoms and concerns between two waves of the virus and associated lockdowns. Data from 4915 respondents - 231 with an ED history - were compared across monthly time points from April to September 2020 on psychological symptoms including negative mood, quality of life, coping and hopefulness, as well as changes to eating and exercise behaviours. Mental health symptoms were increased in the ED group, but generally did not differ from non-ED in the pattern of symptoms reported over time. Increased depressive symptoms and restrictive eating behaviours were found across both groups in relation to the second wave/lockdown, as well as decreased hopefulness and quality of life. Respondents in both groups also reported coping worse during the second wave of the virus compared to the first wave. Although non-ED and ED groups tended to generally show the same pattern of symptoms, the mental health status of the ED group was significantly poorer than the non-ED group throughout the pandemic, and exacerbations in some symptoms (i.e. increased food restriction and depressive symptoms) is cause for concern.","Phillipou, Tan, Toh, Van Rheenen, Meyer, Neill, Sumner, Rossell","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2021.101564","20210912","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Eating disorder; Mental health; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17957,""
"Effects of maternal psychological distress and perception of COVID-19 on prenatal attachment in a large sample of Italian pregnant women","Evidence concerning the impact of COVID-19-related stress exposure on prenatal attachment in pregnant women is unknown. In this study we sought to assess the effect of psychological distress and risk perception of COVID-19 on prenatal attachment in a Italian sample of pregnant women. 1179 pregnant women completed an anonymous online survey and self-report questionnaires measuring socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics, psychological distress (STAI Form Y-1-2 and BDI-II), prenatal attachment (PAI) and risk perception of COVID-19. Data were collected from March 2020 to April 2020 referring to the national lockdown period. After adjusting for the socio-demographic and obstetric factors in the multivariable analysis, we found out the state anxiety was shown to be a significant predictor (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0001) of prenatal attachment. Moreover, the COVID-19-risk perception positively moderate the relationship between trait anxiety and prenatal attachment (p=0008), indicating that when COVID-19-risk perception is high, the effects of trait anxiety on prenatal attachment is attenuated. The synergistic effect between STAI Form Y-1 and COVID-19-risk perception index on PAI is partially mediated by STAI Form Y-2 score. Findings from this study showed that state anxiety related to COVID-19 outbreak in pregnant women may affect the prenatal attachment process of the expectant mother negatively. However, an adequate and functional perception of COVID-19 could enhance prenatal attachment. These results underline the importance of monitoring the prenatal attachment process and the mother's mental health during pandemics, to safeguard maternal and infant mental health.","Craig, Gioia, Muggeo, Cajiao, Aloi, Martino, Tenuta, Cerasa, Costabile","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.102","20210912","COVID-19 risk perception; MaternalÃ¢â‚¬â€œfetal attachment; Prenatal attachment; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17958,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department substance use screens and overdose presentations","The COVID-19 pandemic can exacerbate underlying substance use disorder and has impacted this vulnerable population in a variety of ways. There are limited data regarding how this pandemic has impacted emergency department (ED) patient presentations. We extracted data on ED visits from the electronic health record (EHR) of a large healthcare system in the Washington, DC/Baltimore, MD metropolitan area. The dataset includes data from 7 hospitals on ED visits between 11/1/2019-6/30/2020. The health system utilizes a validated screening program for substance use, Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT), for ED patients who are clinically stable and willing to complete screening. We evaluated trends in patients with a positive SBIRT screen and those presenting with a clinical diagnosis of acute alcohol or substance intoxication/overdose before (11/1/19-2/29/2020-pre) and during the first wave of the COVID pandemic (3/1/2020-6/30/2020-post). Data were described using descriptive statistics. Bivariate analyses were conducted using chi-square test and two-sample t-tests. Interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate the changes in the weekly trends with the start of the pandemic. There were 107,930 screens performed in the EDs during the study period (61,961 pre, 45,969 post). The population was primarily African American (64.7%) and female (57.1%). Positive SBIRT screens increased from 12.5% to 15.8% during COVID (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Alcohol intoxication presentations increased as a proportion of positive screens from 12.6% to 14.4% (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001). A higher percentage of screened patients reported problem drinking (AUDIT scoreÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 7) during the pandemic (2.4% pre vs 3.2% post, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Substance intoxication/overdoses among all screened increased from 2.1% to 3.1% (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) and as a percentage of positive screens during the pandemic (16.8% to 20%, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). The proportion of opioid vs. non-opioid overdoses remained unchanged before (67%) and during the pandemic (64%, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.33). There was an increase in the proportion of positive SBIRT screens and visits for acute overdoses and intoxication during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional research should focus on mitigation strategies to address substance use during this vulnerable time.","Chandran, Mazer-Amirshahi, Shankar, Desale, Nelson, Mete","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.08.058","20210912","COVID-19; Emergency department; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17959,""

"Factors Associated With Longitudinal Psychological and Physiological Stress in Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Study Using Apple Watch Data","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a high degree of psychological distress among health care workers (HCWs). There is a need to characterize which HCWs are at an increased risk of developing psychological effects from the pandemic. Given the differences in the response of individuals to stress, an analysis of both the perceived and physiological consequences of stressors can provide a comprehensive evaluation of its impact. This study aimed to determine characteristics associated with longitudinal perceived stress in HCWs and to assess whether changes in heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of autonomic nervous system function, are associated with features protective against longitudinal stress. HCWs across 7 hospitals in New York City, NY, were prospectively followed in an ongoing observational digital study using the custom Warrior Watch Study app. Participants wore an Apple Watch for the duration of the study to measure HRV throughout the follow-up period. Surveys measuring perceived stress, resilience, emotional support, quality of life, and optimism were collected at baseline and longitudinally. A total of 361 participants (mean age 36.8, SD 10.1 years; female: n=246, 69.3%) were enrolled. Multivariate analysis found New York City's COVID-19 case count to be associated with increased longitudinal stress (P=.008). Baseline emotional support, quality of life, and resilience were associated with decreased longitudinal stress (P&lt;.001). A significant reduction in stress during the 4-week period after COVID-19 diagnosis was observed in the highest tertial of emotional support (P=.03) and resilience (P=.006). Participants in the highest tertial of baseline emotional support and resilience had a significantly different circadian pattern of longitudinally collected HRV compared to subjects in the low or medium tertial. High resilience, emotional support, and quality of life place HCWs at reduced risk of longitudinal perceived stress and have a distinct physiological stress profile. Our findings support the use of these characteristics to identify HCWs at risk of the psychological and physiological stress effects of the pandemic.","Hirten, Danieletto, Tomalin, Choi, Zweig, Golden, Kaur, Helmus, Biello, Pyzik, Calcagno, Freeman, Sands, Charney, Bottinger, Murrough, Keefer, Suarez-Farinas, Nadkarni, Fayad","https://doi.org/10.2196/31295","20210913","COVID-19; app; emotion; health care worker; heart rate; heart rate variability; mental health; nervous system; observational; physiology; psychological; psychology; quality of life; resilience; stress; support; wearable device","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-14","",17961,""
