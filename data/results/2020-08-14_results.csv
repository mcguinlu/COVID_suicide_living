"Standing up for health â€“ improving mental wellbeing during COVID-19 isolation by reducing sedentary behaviour","The global COVID-19 outbreak and its management are disrupting ways of life and increasing the risk of poor mental and physical health for many  The restrictions on movement have made some forms of physical activity harder to achieve and increased the chances of more sedentary behaviour  Independent of exercise taken, sedentary behaviour can have a negative impact upon mental health, especially by lowering mood  We suggest evidence-based ways of reducing sedentary behaviour with commentary on how they may be adapted for life at home  These include: ways to use external cues, moving more frequently, maximising movement whilst waiting, reallocating time, workstation alternatives, restructuring the physical environment and recruiting help from others  At a time in which our mental and physical health needs are more critical than ever, the relationship between sedentary behaviour and low mood is of particular importance  The current situation represents a good opportunity for us all to change habits to implement a less sedentary lifestyle, for now and the future  This can start with changes we can make at home during lockdown","Diamond, Rowan; Byrd, Erin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.137","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2020.; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-14","",3849,""
"Facing New Fears During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The State of Americaâ€™s Mental Health","Objective COVID-19 is rearranging our society with fear and worry about the novel coronavirus impacting the mental health of Americans  The current study examines the intersection of COVID-19 fear, worries and perceived threat with social group vulnerabilities and mental health consequences, namely anxiety and depressive symptomatology  Methods Using an online platform, a national sample (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>10, 368) of U S  adults was surveyed during the week of March 23, 2020  The sample was post-strata weighted to ensure adequate representation of the U S  population based on population estimates for gender, race/ethnicity, income, age, and geography  Results Fear and worry are not distributed equally across the country;rather they are concentrated in places where the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is found  Additionally, data highlight significant differences in the subjective perception of distress across groups with varying social vulnerabilities  Women, Hispanics, Asians, families with children under 18, and foreign-born respondents reported higher levels of subjective fear and worry compared to their counterparts  Finally, even after controlling for social vulnerability, subjective assessments of distress were positive, and significantly related to anxiety and depressive symptomatology;prior mental health research from China and Europe confirm what others have begun to document in the United States  Conclusions This preliminary work provides practitioners with a glimpse of what lies ahead, which individuals and communities may be the most vulnerable, and what types of strategic interventions might help to address a wide range of mental health consequences for Americans in the months and years ahead","Fitzpatrick, Kevin M.; Drawve, Grant; Harris, Casey","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102291","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Anxiety Disorders;2020.; Publication details: Journal of Anxiety Disorders;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-14","",3850,""

More important than the intensity of the disorder is its prevalence. When we compare our current knowledge of the impact of the pandemic on the development of mental disorders with the findings of research on acute stress disorder (ASD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) over the last 40 years, it may turn out that they are different from each other, the symptomatic spectrum of mental disorders varies and the possibilities of an effective treatment are very limited. We cannot rule out that a new diagnostic category for specific mental disorders resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may emerge in the near future. This paper presents the extent of the impact of the pandemic on the development of mental instability and current diagnostic possibilities. Subpopulations necessary for planning short-term intervention in the organisational, informative and medical areas were identified.

In this research, we aim to analyse gender-related differences in the psychological impact of the Covid-19 lockdown in Spain. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey (nÂ =Â 1041) with two measurements: at two and five weeks after the declaration of the state of emergency and stay-at-home order in Spain. The presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), perceived loneliness and spiritual well-being were evaluated. Linear mixed models with random slopes were calculated for each variable in the study in order to analyse the effect of longitudinal measures and interaction with gender. Women showed more symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD, more feelings of loneliness and less spiritual well-being compared to men. The psychological impact caused by the pandemic is maintained over time and increases for depression. Covid-19 appears to be having a greater psychological impact on women than men. More attention needs to be paid to this issue to establish the causes and reduce these differences.","AusÃ­n, Berta; GonzÃ¡lez-Sanguino, Clara; Castellanos, Miguel Ãngel; MuÃ±oz, Manuel","https://doi.org/10.1080/09589236.2020.1799768","","Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: J.

"Droplet and Aerosol Generation With Endonasal Surgery: Methods to Mitigate Risk During the COVID-19 Pandemic","OBJECTIVE: To define the aerosol and droplet risks associated with endonasal drilling and to identify mitigation strategies. STUDY DESIGN: Simulation series with fluorescent 3-dimensional (3D) printed sinonasal models and deidentified cadaveric heads. SETTINGS: Dedicated surgical laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cadaveric specimens irrigated with fluorescent tracer and fluorescent 3D-printed models were drilled. A cascade impactor was used to collect aerosols and small droplets of various aerodynamic diameters under 15 Âµm. Large droplet generation was measured by evaluating the field for fluorescent debris. Aerosol plumes through the nares were generated via nebulizer, and mitigation measures, including suction and SPIWay devices, nasal sheaths, were evaluated regarding reduction of aerosol escape from the nose. RESULTS: The drilling of cadaveric specimens without flexible suction generated aerosols &#8804;3.30 Âµm, and drilling of 3D sinonasal models consistently produced aerosols &#8804;14.1 Âµm. Mitigation with SPIWay or diameter-restricted SPIWay produced same results. There was minimal field contamination in the cadaveric models, 0% to 2.77% field tarp area, regardless of drill burr type or drilling location; cutting burr drilling without suction in the 3D model yielded the worst contamination field (36.1%), followed by coarse diamond drilling without suction (19.4%). The simple placement of a flexible suction instrument in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx led to complete elimination of all aerosols &#8804;14.1 Âµm, as evaluated by a cascade impactor positioned immediately at the nares. CONCLUSION: Given the findings regarding aerosol risk reduction, we strongly recommend that physicians use a suction instrument in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx during endonasal surgery in the COVID-19 era.","Dharmarajan, Harish; Freiser, Monika E; Sim, Edward; Boorgu, Devi Sai Sri Kavya; Corcoran, Timothy E; Wang, Eric W; Gardner, Paul A; Snyderman, Carl H","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0194599820949802","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg;: 194599820949802, 2020 Aug 11.; Publication details: Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg;: 194599820949802, 2020 Aug 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-14","",3861,""

"Subjective ratings of emotive stimuli predict the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on affective states","The COVID-19 crisis resulted in a large proportion of the world's population having to employ social distancing measures and self-quarantine. Given that limiting social interaction impacts mental health, we assessed the effects of quarantine on emotive perception as a proxy of affective states. To this end, we conducted an online experiment whereby 112 participants provided affective ratings for a set of normative images and reported on their well-being during COVID-19 self-isolation. We found that current valence ratings were significantly lower than the original ones from 2015. This negative shift correlated with key aspects of the personal situation during the confinement, including working and living status, and subjective well-being. These findings indicate that quarantine impacts mood negatively, resulting in a negatively biased perception of emotive stimuli. Moreover, our online assessment method shows its validity for large-scale population studies on the impact of COVID-19 related mitigation methods and well-being.","LÃƒÂ³pez-Carral, Grechuta, Verschure","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237631","20200813","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-14","",3865,""
"Perceived change in physical activity levels and mental health during COVID-19: Findings among adult twin pairs","Physical distancing and other COVID-19 pandemic mitigation strategies may have unintended consequences on a number of health behaviors and health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between perceived change in physical activity or exercise and mental health outcomes over the short-term in response to COVID-19 mitigation strategies in a sample of adult twins. This was a cross-sectional study of 3,971 identical and same-sex fraternal adult twins (909 pairs, 77% identical) from the community-based Washington State Twin Registry. Participants in this study completed an online survey examining the impact of COVID-19 mitigation on a number of health-related behaviors and outcomes, administered between March 26 and April 5, 2020. In the present study, the exposure was perceived change in physical activity or exercise. The outcomes were levels of perceived anxiety and stress. More twin pairs reported a decrease in physical activity levels (42%) than those reporting no change (31%) or increased physical activity levels (27%). A perceived decrease in physical activity or exercise was associated with higher stress and anxiety levels. However, the physical activity-stress relationship was confounded by genetic and shared environmental factors. On the other hand, the physical activity-anxiety relationship held after controlling for genetic and shared environmental factors, although it was no longer significant after further controlling for age and sex, with older twins more likely to report lower levels of anxiety and females more likely to report higher levels of anxiety. Strategies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic may be impacting physical activity and mental health, with those experiencing a decrease in physical activity also having higher levels of stress and anxiety. These relationships are confounded by genetic and shared environmental factors, in the case of stress, and age and sex, in the case of anxiety.","Duncan, Avery, Seto, Tsang","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237695","20200813","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-14","",3866,""

"Anxiety, pandemic-related stress and resilience among physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic","Physicians play a crucial frontline role in the COVID-19 pandemic, which may involve high levels of anxiety. We aimed to investigate the association between pandemic-related stress factors (PRSF) and anxiety and to evaluate the potential effect of resilience on anxiety among physicians. A self-report digital survey was completed by 1106 Israeli physicians (564 males and 542 females) during the COVID-19 outbreak. Anxiety was measured by the 8-item version of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. Resilience was evaluated by the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Stress was assessed using a PRSF inventory. Physicians reported high levels of anxiety with a mean score of 59.20Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.95.

"The Behaviour Changes in Response to COVID-19 Pandemic within Malaysia","The novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19, is a pandemic that currently affects the whole world. During this period, Malaysians displayed a variety of behaviour changes as a response to COVID-19, including panic buying, mass travelling during movement restriction and even absconding from treatment facilities. This article attempts to explore some of these behaviour changes from a behaviourist perspective in order to get a better understanding of the rationale behind the changes.","Koh Boon Yau, Pang Tze Ping, Shoesmith, James, Nor Hadi, Loo","https://doi.org/10.21315/mjms2020.27.2.5","20200813","COVID-19; behaviourism; mental health; psychiatry; social sciences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-14","",3869,""

"Excessive media consumption about COVID-19 is associated with increased state anxiety: Outcomes of a large online survey in Russia","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has potentially had a negative impact on the mental health and well being of individuals and families. Anxiety levels and risk factors within particular populations are poorly described. To evaluate confidence, understanding, trust and concerns and levels of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic in general population and assess risk factors for increased anxiety. We launched a cross-sectional online survey a large Russian population between 6th and 15th April 2020 using multiple social media platforms. A set of questions targeted confidence, understanding, trust and concerns in respondents. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure anxiety. Multiple linear regressions were used to model predictors of COVID-19 related anxiety. The survey was completed by 23,756 out of 53,966 unique visitors (44.0% response rate); 21,364 of who were residing in 62 areas of Russia. State anxiety (S-Anxiety) scores were higher than Trait anxiety (T-Anxiety) across all regions of Russia (median S-Anxiety score 52 [IQR 44-60]), exceeding published norms. Time spent following news on COVID-19 was strongly associated with an increased S-Anxiety adjusted for baseline anxiety level. One to two hours spent reading COVID news was associated with 5.46 (95%CI 5.03-5.90) point difference, 2-3 hours 7.06 (6.37-7.74) and more than three hours 8.65 (7.82-9.47), respectively; all compared to less than 30 minutes per day. Job loss during pandemic was another important factor associated with higher S-Anxiety scores (3.95 [3.31 - 4.58]). Despite survey respondents reporting high confidence in information regarding COVID-19, as well as understanding of healthcare guidance, they reported low overall trust in state and local authorities and perception of country readiness. Among Russian respondents from multiple social media platforms, there is evidence of higher levels of state-anxiety associated with recent job loss and increased news consumption, as well as lower than expected trust in government agencies. These findings can help inform development of key public-health messages to help reduce anxiety and raise perceived trust in governmental response to this current national emergency. Using similar methodology, comparative surveys are ongoing in other national populations.","Nekliudov, Blyuss, Cheung, Petrou, Genuneit, Sushentsev, Levadnaya, Comberiati, Warner, Tudor-Williams, Teufel, Greenhawt, Dunn Galvin, Munblit","https://doi.org/10.2196/20955","20200813","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-14","",3871,""

"The psychological impact on an orthopaedic outpatient setting in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) a global pandemic on 11 March 2020, after the coronavirus claimed 4628 lives worldwide. Mental health challenges such as making impossible decisions and working under extreme pressures are expected to be faced by frontline healthcare workers who are directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. However, we question if significant stress levels might also be observed in a subspecialty musculoskeletal outpatient department, where staff are not first-line care providers of COVID-19 patients. We hypothesize that these healthcare workers also face significant psychological strain, and we aim to objectively determine the prevalence using a validated caregiver strain index. A cross-sectional study was conducted in outpatient musculoskeletal clinics in a tertiary hospital in Singapore. We collected basic demographic data and used a 13-question tool adapted from the validated Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) to measure psychological strain in these healthcare workers. Participants were divided into 2 groups depending on the level of strain experienced. A total of 62 healthcare workers volunteered for this study. There were 32 participants (51.6%) who had 7 or more positive responses (group 1) and the remaining 30 participants (48.4%) were allocated to group 2. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of demographic data. &quot;Work adjustments&quot; (74.2%), &quot;changes in personal plans&quot; (72.6%), and finding it &quot;confining&quot; (72.6%) garnered the most positive responses in the questionnaire. On the other hand, &quot;financial concerns&quot; garnered the least positive responses (21.0%). The protracted duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and its resultant prolonged adjustments can have unintended consequences of wearing down healthcare resources otherwise allocated to chronic and elective conditions. Countries should ensure that measures are put in place to safeguard the mental well-being of our healthcare workers to avoid needing another reactive strategy in this battle against COVID-19.","Wong, Han, Tay, Koh, Howe","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-020-01862-9","20200813","COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Psychological; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-14","",3873,""
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical care workers in China","Medical care workers experienced unprecedented levels of workload and pressure since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Little is known about its exact impact on medical care workers and related factors in China. This study aims to identify the psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical care workers in China. From February 23 to March 5, 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 863 medical care workers from seven provinces in China using standard questionnaires measuring adverse psychological outcomes including Impact of Event Scale-6 (IES-6), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale(DASS)and related psychosocial factors like perceived threat, social support and coping strategies. Exploratory Factor analysis was performed to identify the dimensions of perceived threat by study participants. Multivariate regression was used to examine the determinants of adverse psychological outcomes. Posttraumatic stress (PTS) were prevalent in this sample of health care professionals, and 40.2% indicated positive screens for significant posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. The proportion of having mild to extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were 13.6, 13.9 and 8.6%, respectively. Perceived threat and passive coping strategies were positively correlated to PTS and DASS scores, while perceived social support and active coping strategies were negatively correlated to DASS scores. Nurses were more likely to be anxious than others among medical care workers during the COVID-19 epidemic. Adverse psychological symptoms were prevalent among medical care workers in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. Screening for adverse psychological outcomes and developing corresponding preventive measures would be beneficial in decreasing negative psychological outcomes.","Si, Su, Jiang, Wang, Gu, Ma, Li, Zhang, Ren, Ren, Liu, Qiao","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00724-0","20200813","Anxiety; COVID-19; China; Depression; Medical care worker; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Psychological; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-14","",3874,""
"Psychological impact of an epidemic/pandemic on the mental health of healthcare professionals: a rapid review","Epidemics or pandemics, such as the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, pose unique challenges to healthcare professionals (HCPs). Caring for patients during an epidemic/pandemic may impact negatively on the mental health of HCPs. There is a lack of evidence-based advice on what would be effective in mitigating this impact. This rapid review synthesizes the evidence on the psychological impact of pandemics/epidemics on the mental health of HCPs, what factors predict this impact, and the evidence of prevention/intervention strategies to reduce this impact. According to rapid review guidelines, systematic searches were carried out in Embase.com , PubMed, APA PsycINFO-Ovid SP, and Web of Science (core collection). Searches were restricted to the years 2003 or later to ensure inclusion of the most recent epidemic/pandemics, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Papers written in French or English, published in peer-reviewed journals, and of quantitative design using validated measures of mental health outcomes were included. Of 1308 papers found, 50 were included. The full protocol for this rapid review was registered with Prospero (reg.no. CRD42020175985). Results show that exposed HCPs working with patients during an epidemic/pandemic are at heightened risk of mental health problems in the short and longer term, particularly: psychological distress, insomnia, alcohol/drug misuse, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, burnout, anger, and higher perceived stress. These mental health problems are predicted by organizational, social, personal, and psychological factors and may interfere with the quality of patient care. Few evidence-based early interventions exist so far. HCPs need to be provided with psychosocial support to protect their mental wellbeing if they are to continue to provide high quality patient care. Several recommendations relevant during and after an epidemic/pandemic, such as COVID-19, and in preparation for a future outbreak, are proposed.","Stuijfzand, Deforges, Sandoz, Sajin, Jaques, Elmers, Horsch","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09322-z","20200813","COVID-19; Epidemic; Healthcare professionals; Intervention; Interventions; Mental health; Outbreak; Pandemic; Prevention; Review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-14","",3875,""
"The status and high risk factors of severe psychological distress in migraine patients during nCOV-2019 outbreak in Southwest China: a cross-sectional study","Psychological distress is highly prevalent among migraineurs during public health emergencies. The coronavirus disease 2019 (nCOV-2019) has created mass panic in China due to its highly contagious by contact and aerosols and lack of effective treatment. However, the emotion status of migraineurs stayed unclear during the nCOV-2019 outbreak. To understand psychological distress of migraineurs by comparing with common population and identify potential high-risk factors of severe psychological distress among migraine patients. We enrolled the migraineurs treated at the department of Neurology of West China Hospital and healthy controls with age- and sex-matched to migraineurs. Data on clinicodemographics and psychological distress in the month of February 2020 (during in the nCOV-2019 outbreak in China) were collected. We used the Kessler 6-item (K-6) scale to assess psychological distress. Potential risk factors of severe psychological distress were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The 144 migraineurs and 150 controls were included in the study. Migraineurs showed significantly higher K-6 scores than controls (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Migraine attack frequency in previous 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°days and time spent paying attention to outbreak showed significant in multivariate logistic regression with respective odds ratios of 2.225 (95%CI 1.361-3.628, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and 1.589 (95% 1.117-2.26, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01).

"Recommendations for a national Coronavirus disease 2019 response guideline for the care of older persons in Nigeria during and post-pandemic: A family physician's perspective","The older persons in our society are a special group of people in need of additional measures of care and protection. They have medical, financial, emotional and social needs. The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) only exacerbates those needs. COVID-19 is a new disease, and there is limited information regarding the disease. Based on currently available information, older persons and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions may be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Family physicians provide care for individuals across their lifespan. Because geriatricians are internists or family physicians with post-residency training in geriatric medicine, they are major stakeholders in geriatric care. The authors are concerned about the absence of a COVID-19 response guideline/special advisory targeting the vulnerable population of older adults. The management and response to COVID-19 will be implemented in part based on the local context of available resources. Nigeria has been described as a resource-constrained nation. Infection prevention in older persons in Nigeria will far outweigh the possibilities of treatment given limited resources. The aim was to recommend actionable strategies to prevent COVID-19-related morbidity or mortality among older persons in Nigeria and to promote their overall well-being during and after the pandemic. These recommendations cut across the geriatric medicine domains of physical health, mental health, functioning ability and socio-environmental situation.","Olagundoye, Enema, Adebowale","https://doi.org/10.4102/phcfm.v12i1.2512","20200813","COVID-19; national health policy; older persons; prevention; the elderly","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-14","",3877,""

In this study, we investigated the risk factors for the anxiety in the otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei province under the COVID-19 epidemic. The otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei Province were surveyed using an online questionnaire in which anxiety was measured against the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the risk factors of anxiety. A total of 449 otolaryngology healthcare workers participated in the study. Of all the participants, 131 (29.18%) had anxiety symptoms. Compared with doctors, nurses were at a higher risk for anxiety (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.162, 95% CI 1.311-3.566). Participants who often suspected self-infection (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.239, 95% CI 1.647-10.909) or family member infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.485, 95% CI 1.511-13.313) were more likely to develop anxiety than those who never.

"The Characterization of <i>chIFITMs</i> in Avian Coronavirus Infection In Vivo, Ex Vivo and In Vitro","The coronaviruses are a large family of enveloped RNA viruses that commonly cause gastrointestinal or respiratory illnesses in the infected host. Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly contagious respiratory pathogen of chickens that can affect the kidneys and reproductive systems resulting in bird mortality and decreased reproductivity. The interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are activated in response to viral infections and represent a class of cellular restriction factors that restrict the replication of many viral pathogens. Here, we characterize the relative mRNA expression of the chicken <i>IFITM</i> genes in response to IBV infection, in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro using the pathogenic M41-CK strain, the nephropathogenic QX strain and the nonpathogenic Beaudette strain. In vivo we demonstrate a significant upregulation of <i>chIFITM1</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>3</i> and <i>5</i> in M41-CK- and QX-infected trachea two days post-infection. In vitro infection with Beaudette, M41-CK and QX results in a significant upregulation of <i>chIFITM1</i>, <i>2</i> and <i>3</i> at 24 h post-infection. We confirmed a differential innate response following infection with distinct IBV strains and believe that our data provide new insights into the possible role of <i>chIFITMs</i> in early IBV infection.","Steyn, Keep, Bickerton, Fife","https://doi.org/10.3390/genes11080918","20200813","avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV); coronavirus; interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-14","",3879,""
"Risk Perception and Depression in Public Health Crises: Evidence from the COVID-19 Crisis in China","<i>Background:</i> Scant attention has been paid to how risk perceptions of public health crises may affect people's mental health. <i>Aims</i>: The aims of this study are to (1) construct a conceptual framework for risk perception and depression of people in public health crises, (2) examine how the mental health of people in the crisis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is affected by risk perception and its associated factors, including distance perception of the crisis and support of prevention and control policies, and (3) propose policy recommendations on how to deal with psychological problems in the current COVID-19 crisis. <i>Methods</i>: Online questionnaire survey was implemented. A total of 6373 people visited the questionnaire online, 1115 people completed the questionnaire, and the number of valid questionnaires was 1081. Structural equation modeling was employed for data analysis. <i>Results</i>: Risk perception and its associated factors significantly affect the mental health of people in public health crises. Specifically, (1) distance perception of public health crises is negatively associated with depression among people, (2) affective risk perception is positively associated with depression of people in public health crises, (3) cognitive risk perception is negatively associated with depression of people in public health crises, and (4) support of prevention and control policies is negatively associated with depression of people in public health crises. <i>Conclusion</i>: The findings of this study suggest that risk perception plays an important role in affecting the mental health of people in a public health crisis. Therefore, health policies aiming to improve the psychological wellbeing of the people in a public health crisis should take risk perception into consideration.","Ding, Xu, Huang, Li, Lu, Xie","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17165728","20200813","COVID-19; depression; public health crisis; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-14","",3880,""
