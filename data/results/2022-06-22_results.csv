"Experiences of mental health and wellbeing support for NHS staff during the COVID-19 pandemic: a reflexive thematic analysis","Staff in the National Health Service (NHS) have been placed under considerable strain during the COVID-19 pandemic; whilst NHS Trusts provide a variety of health and wellbeing support services, there has been little research investigating staff perceptions of these services. Moreover, the research that does exist typically includes only clinical staff, despite a large proportion of patient-facing NHS workers being in non-clinical roles. We interviewed forty-eight clinical and non-clinical healthcare workers from eighteen NHS Trusts in England about their experiences of workplace health and wellbeing support during the pandemic. Reflexive thematic analysis identified that perceived stigma around help-seeking, and staffing shortages due to wider socio-political contexts such as austerity, were barriers to using support services. Visible, caring leadership at all levels (CEO to line managers), peer support, easily accessible services, and clear communication about support offers were enablers. Our evidence suggests Trusts should have active strategies to improve help-seeking. This could involve providing all staff with regular reminders about support options, in a variety of formats (e.g. email, posters, mentioned in meetings), and easily remembered single points of access, delivered by a mix of in-house and externally-provided services, to cater for those more and less concerned about stigma and confidentiality. In addition, managers at all levels should be trained and supported to feel confident to speak about mental health with staff, with formal peer support facilitated by building in time for this during working hours. As others have pointed out, this will require long-term strategic planning to address workforce shortages.","Corinne Clarkson; Hannah Scott; Siobhan Hegarty; Emilia Soulios; Rupa Bhundia; Sam Gnanapragasam; Mary Jane Docherty; Rosalind Raine; Sharon Stevelink; Neil Greenberg; Matthew Hotopf; Simon Wessely; Ira Madan; Anne Marie Rafferty; Danielle Lamb","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.06.15.22276446","20220621","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33085,""
"Can we mitigate the psychological impacts of social isolation using behavioural activation?  Long-term results of the UK BASIL Urgent Public Health COVID-19 pilot randomised controlled trial and living systematic review","Background Behavioural and cognitive interventions remain a credible approach in preventing loneliness and depression. There was a need to rapidly generate and assimilate trial-based data during COVID-19. Objectives We undertook a COVID-19 parallel pilot RCT of behavioural activation for depression and loneliness [the BASIL-C19 trial ISRCTN94091479]. We also assimilate these data in a COVID-19 living systematic review [PROSPERO CRD42021298788]. Methods Primary care participants (>=65 years) with long-term conditions were computer randomised to Behavioural Activation (n=47) versus care-as-usual (n=49). The single blinded primary outcome was the PHQ-9. Secondary outcomes included loneliness (De Jong Gierveld Scale). Data from the BASIL-C19 trial were included in a random effects meta-analysis of depression and loneliness. Findings The 12 months adjusted mean difference for PHQ-9 was -0.70 (95% CI -2.61 to 1.20) and for loneliness was -0.39 (95% CI -1.43 to 0.65). Secondary 12-month trial outcomes suggested evidence of benefit for behavioural activation. The BASIL-C19 meta-analysis (13 trials) found short-term reductions in depression (standardised mean difference [SMD]=-0.31, 95%CI -0.51 to -0.11) and loneliness (SMD=-0.48, 95%CI -0.70 to -0.27). There were few long-term trials, but there was evidence of some benefit (loneliness SMD=-0.20, 95%CI -0.40 to -0.01; depression SMD=-0.20, 95%CI -0.47 to 0.07). Discussion We found a signal of effect in reducing loneliness and depression in the BASIL trial. Living meta-analysis provides strong evidence of short-term benefit for loneliness and depression. Clinical implications Scalable behavioural and cognitive approaches should be considered as population-level strategies for depression and loneliness on the basis of the living systematic review.

"Responses to COVID-19 Threats: An Evolutionary Psychological Analysis","Responses to COVID-19 public health interventions have been lukewarm. For example, only 64% of the US population has received at least two vaccinations. Because most public health interventions require people to behave in ways that are evolutionarily novel and mismatched with evolved human perceptual and decision-making mechanisms, it is imperative that we gain a better understanding of how people respond to public health information, including how they respond under different pandemic conditions and how specific groups may differ in their responses. We conducted two studies, using data from primarily public sources. We found that state-level COVID-19 threats (e.g., infection and mortality rates) had no relationships with mental health symptoms, suggesting that people were not attending to threat information. This result is consistent with the evolutionary psychological explanation that COVID-19 threat information is insufficient to activate the human behavioral immune system. Furthermore, individual differences affected how people responded to COVID-19 threats, supporting a niche picking explanation. Finally, aggregate state IQ levels correlated positively with aggregate vaccination rates, suggesting that intelligence can partially counteract the evolutionary novelty of abstract threat information, supporting the savanna-IQ interaction hypothesis. We conclude with policy implications for improving interventions and promoting greater compliance.","Stephen M Colarelli; Tyler J Mirando; Kyunghee Han; Norman P. Li; Carter Vespi; Katherine A.

"Exploring the experiences of student mental health nurses from ethnic minority backgrounds working through the COVID-19 pandemic: a phenomenological approach","Background/aims The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds more than any other group. The purpose of this study was to explore the experience of mental health students from ethnic minorities who worked during the COVID-19 pandemic in a mental health NHS trust. Methods This study used phenomenology as the theoretical framework and thematic analysis as a method for data analysis. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 12 student mental health nurses, which were held via Microsoft Teams. Results The four themes that emerged from this study were altruism, a sense of connectedness, support and learning opportunities, and role clarity. Students described a sense of altruism while deciding to opt-in to the extended placement. Some also found their faith to be a source of support and resilience, which provided a sense of connectedness. Support was an essential element that emerged in this study where students could rely on both the university and the mental health NHS trust. The learning opportunities that COVID-19 has presented have helped bridge the gap between the physical and mental wellbeing of patients;however, a lack of clarity in their roles was highlighted. Conclusions Adequate and appropriate policies and guidance to support student nurses are needed when working in crisis situations.","Savarimuthu, Darren, Mullobux, Sherida, Newblow, Jaya, Opoku, Bernard","https://doi.org/10.12968/bjmh.2021.0028","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: British Journal of Mental Health Nursing; 11(2):1-10, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33088,""
"Psychological impact and stress factors among Ha'il medical students post COVID19 pandemic","The current COVID-19 pandemic frightfully threatened the whole world, and people in different countries were demanded to be quarantined due to possible contact with the infection. High mortality rate, the spread of COVID19 and the propagation of fake news in social media programs created fear and anxiety among majority of society especially, medical students. One of the most essential changes during the covid-19 was the termination of teaching lectures in physical presence and its replacement by virtual online lectures. Circumstances like these have negative impact on the mental health of medical students. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on medical students' learning and the effect of distressing situation they experienced, psychological and educational variables specifically during return to physical attendance in college and the impact of these variables of probably affecting factors like age, gender, marital status, transition of preclinical years to clinical years. A Cross-sectional study was completed among medical students at UOH, KSA. The data are collected by distributing an online questionnaire. Statistical analysis has been done with Microsoft Power BI. 14.82% of 5th year female participants were unable to stop worrying for different things while 10.54% of male participant were in the 1st year. Large numbers of students who have increased the number of times they wash their hands are found in med3 and med4 while 27.92% agree and 29.05% strongly agree of whole years of study. 45.29% of students were having mental pressure before online session due to internet connection while 51.55% had decreased motivation since the shift to online learning. Data shows that highest numbers of participants who were having past illness and anxious were in age group 21-23 in both male and female. The majority of students was having fear toward returning in physical presence and preferred not to have on- college education. Hence, it is recommended to encourage students and reduce stress by providing with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) course.","Alzedany, Sukaina Kamal, Alessa, Fatima Ismail, Alswedani, Reem Fahad, Almughais, Ebtehaj Saud, Alreshidi, Fatmah Fahad, Al Lafi, Abrar Humoud Fahad, Alruwayshid, Mashael, Alshuniefi, Abeer Suliman, Anwar, Sadaf, Elagib, Halima Mustafa","https://doi.org/10.6026/97320630018392","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Bioinformation; 18(4):392, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33089,""
"Anxiety Levels, Sleep Quality and Follow-up of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective: Obesity, hypertension and diabetes, which increase the risk of developing severe Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, are also the most common comorbidities of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). The in-hospital evaluation and testing of patients with OSAS were delayed due to the pandemic. We aimed to investigate the changes in Epworth sleepiness score (ESS), use of positive airway pressure (PAP) devices, sleep quality, weight change, COVID-19 related anxiety, anxiety at hospital admission, domestic contact and contraction of SARS-CoV-2 in OSA patients during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: In our sleep centre, patients (n=202) who were diagnosed with sleep apnoea were called by telephone and a survey related to COVID-19, anxiety levels, PAP use, weight change, sleep quality and OSA was conducted during the pandemic. Results: In the study, hypertension and diabetes were the most common comorbidities. Overall, some of the patients with OSA gained weight, stopped PAP treatment, and ESS scores increased compared to the prepandemic period. The anxiety of hospitalization due to COVID-19 was found to be higher than the anxiety for COVID-19. There was a positive correlation between the level of anxiety at admission to hospital due to the risk of COVID-19 and the ESS measured at diagnosis (r=0.203 p=0.004). Better sleep quality was seen in 77% of the participants during the pandemic. Conclusion: OSA patients with high ESS at diagnosis, PAP uses, COVID-19 positive or with domestic contact should be monitored closely by telemedicine. In future research should examine sleep quality and the effects of working from home in OSAS individuals.

"Post-traumatic stress disorder among COVID-19 survivors in Manipur: a cross-sectional study","Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a condition which can develop among those experiencing psychological trauma and can cause substantial distress and disruption in one's life during a pandemic. This study aims to assess the prevalence of PTSD among the COVID-19 survivors in Manipur and its predictors. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among the COVID-19 survivors aged 18 years and above from July to September 2020 in Manipur using a validated instrument-the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 (PCL-5) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) for screening PTSD which was administered through phone-based Google Form questionnaire. Descriptive statistics like mean and percentages were used and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were used for predicting PTSD, taking P &lt; 0.2 and P &lt; 0.05, respectively Results: Out of the 228 participants screened, 67.5% were identified for PTSD symptoms. Increasing age of the participants (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 1.1;95% CI: 1.19-1.13), being employed in the private sector (AOR: 14.55;95% CI: 1.50-13.73), urban residence (AOR: 2.07;95% CI: 1.01-4.25), and those referred by a doctor for testing Coronavirus Disease (COVID 19) (AOR: 7.90;95% CI: 2.82-22.1) were found significantly more likely to have the PTSD symptoms Conclusion: Nearly three-fourths of the COVID-19 survivors were found to have PTSD symptoms.

"Agri-Food Waste as a Method for Weed Control and Soil Amendment in Crops","The continued and extensive use of synthetic herbicides to control weeds to maximize crop yield is no longer sustainable, as it results in negative impacts on the environment and human health. Innovative sustainable and resilient food production systems should preserve resources and environmental health by incorporating alternative natural herbicides, recycling waste, and favoring a circular economy. The present work assesses the value of different organic waste (Urtica dioica residues, Vicia faba pods, spent coffee grounds, and corn cobs) as bioherbicides and fertilizers in different seasons through pot and field two-year sequential experiments. Pot assays revealed that V. faba pods, spent coffee grounds, and corn cob waste showed the best inhibitory effect, which were subsequently evaluated in the Springâ€“Summer and Autumn crops. In the field, spent coffee grounds reduced the biomass of total naturally-emerged weeds and stimulated crop growth under scarce rainfall and warm days. However, its effect varied under different environmental conditions. Spent coffee grounds can partially control weeds in the field, which valorizes them as a bioherbicide and boosts sustainable agriculture.","Lorenzo, Paula, Rosa, Guilherme, Barbosa, Sara, Ferreira, AntÃ³nio J.

"NCAA Student-Athlete Training During COVID-19 Stay-At-Home Restrictions","The effects of COVID-19 restrictions were ubiquitous, including decreased physical activity globally. A recent study showed significant consequences on American student-athletes, who were forced to stay at home between March and June 2020. Inadequacy of equipment and programming hampered the resulting improvised training. Resistance exercise was the second most common mode used after cardiovascular exercise, and the primary equipment utilized was dumbbells and resistance bands. More women than men did not resistance train. More women believed they were eating less and healthier. Sleep length and disturbances increased;the latter more in women. Mental health concerns and decreased motivation to train became more frequent, especially within Division III more than Division I. The most-reported overall concerns were maintenance of fitness, sport-specific training, and health, possibly implicating the equipment/programming barriers as contributors to negative psychological effects.

"Social support predicts sleep quality in people with multiple sclerosis during the COVID-19 pandemic","Poor sleep quality is one of the most prominent patient-reported problems in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in PwMS having less contact with physicians, therapists, support groups, and family, which led to decreased access to typical supports. The purpose of this study was to assess how social support impacted sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic in PwMS within the United States. Anonymous surveys were utilized to gather data from February - May 2021 from 209Ã‚Â PwMS during their return appointments (face-to-face and virtual) at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC)'s MS Clinic in the United States. SPSS 27 was used to run four regressions in order to determine if social support predicted sleep quality with and without the inclusion of covariates (age, education, disability, anxiety/depression). The results indicate that overall feelings of being socially supported predict sleep quality. Additionally, various facets of social support predict sleep quality, even when controlling for covariates. Interestingly, while depression and anxiety were significant predictors of sleep quality, those constructs do not attenuate the social support-sleep relationship. These findings will provide key information pertaining to the association between social support and sleep in PwMS during COVID-19 where typical supports were limited. Understanding the challenges facing those living with chronic illnesses, specifically PwMS, will help researchers and clinicians alike create interventions to promote social support in the midst of a global pandemic.","Harris, Zaeske, Ludwig, Baker, Lynch, Thuringer, Bruce, Siengsukon","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2022.103970","20220621","COVID-19; Multiple sclerosis; Sleep health; Sleep quality; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33095,""
"Prenatal distress, access to services, and birth outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from a longitudinal study","During the COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant people have experienced disruptions to prenatal care, as well elevated rates of mental health problems and distress. The current longitudinal study aims to understand how different forms of prenatal distress (mental health problems, COVID-19 stressful experiences, and access to prenatal services) impact infant birth outcomes during the pandemic. Participants were 265 pregnant individuals from Ontario, Canada. Maternal depression, pregnancy-related anxiety, COVID-related stressors (i.e., financial difficulties, social isolation), and disruptions to prenatal and health services were assessed during pregnancy. Delivery experiences and birth outcomes were assessed in the early postpartum period. Associations between pregnancy stressors and birth outcomes were assessed using path analyses. Participants reported experiencing substantial changes to their prenatal care due to COVID-19; 23.0Ã‚Â % had prenatal appointments cancelled, 47.9Ã‚Â % had difficulty accessing prenatal classes, and 60.8Ã‚Â % reported changes to their birth plans. Results of path analyses showed a unique effect of pregnancy-related anxiety during the pandemic on lower birth weight, younger gestational age at birth, and more infant birth problems. Further, multi-group path analysis revealed these effects were more pronounced in male infants. Findings demonstrate that pregnant individuals in Ontario, Canada have experienced considerable disruptions to services during pregnancy. In addition, pregnancy-related anxiety was uniquely linked to elevated risk for adverse birth outcomes, which more heavily impacted male infants. These findings underscore the need for additional mental health support and access to services for pregnant people and their infants, to reduce long-term adverse maternal and fetal health outcomes.","Khoury, Atkinson, Bennett, Jack, Gonzalez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2022.105606","20220621","Birth outcomes; COVID-19; Prenatal stress; Sex differences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33096,""

"Sleep and diet patterns of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns","<b>Introduction</b>: College students experience high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress during the academic year as they juggle the competing demands of young adulthood and their studies. The COVID-19 pandemic heightened this experience. Healthful diets and sleep patterns are associated with improved physical and mental well-being. <b>Purpose</b>: Therefore, the goal of this study was to identify if there was a relationship between changes in sleep and diet during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods</b>: A group of college students was surveyed online using Qualtrics software during the first two months of lockdown restrictions at a large, midwestern university in the United States. <b>Results</b>: More participants reported no changes in diet and increased hours of sleep than reported declines or improvements in diet, or reductions or retained sleep patterns.

A cross-sectional online survey utilizing validated scales was conducted from October 1 to 25, 2020. Path analyses assessed the effects of COVID-19 stress on anxiety and depression, and whether coping and social support moderated these relationships in international students. COVID-19 stress was significantly associated with anxiety and depression in international students. Maladaptive coping moderated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and anxiety but did not moderate the relationship with depression.

"Substance use trajectories among urban college students: associations with symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression before and during COVID-19","This study explored substance use trajectories and associations with mental health among an ethnically/racially diverse college student sample before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We combined repeated cross-sections and panel data from a total of 3,247 college students assessed with an online survey in 2018, 2019, and in three waves in 2020. We estimated trends in substance use and their relation to mental health over the survey waves using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Our results revealed notable associations between 30-day substance use patterns, time of assessment, and psychological well-being. These findings suggest a complex interplay between access to substances, context of substance use, and mental health. We discuss several initiatives that have been launched in response to the results of this ongoing study. Such initiatives may serve as examples for expanding similar efforts to other commuter colleges to prevent further increases in mental health problems and risky substance use.","Brandt, Anthonipillai, LÃƒÂ³pez-Castro, Melara, Espinosa","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2022.2089844","20220621","COVID-19; College students; New York City; mental health; substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33102,""

We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Fall 2020 Cohort of the Healthy Minds Survey, a non-probability sample of students enrolled at one of 28 universities across the United States. Participants completed an online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic (September-December, 2020). Nearly a quarter of the sample (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6999) reported engaging in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), 12.41% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3819) reported suicidal ideation, 4.98% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1531) reported making a suicide plan, and 1.09% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°334) reported a suicide attempt over the past 12 months. When accounting for all COVID-19 factors in the same model, COVID-19 related concern, COVID-19 related discrimination, financial distress, and infection were significantly associated with NSSI, suicidal ideation, and suicide plan; caregiving was significantly associated with lower odds of engaging in non-suicidal self-injury.

"Stress and cardiovascular risk burden after the pandemic: current status and future prospects","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has induced an increase in anxiety, stress and depression in the world population, prompting a re-evaluation of these well-known risk factors on cardiovascular burden. This short report analyzes the impact of the pandemic on stress and depression, highlighting how the phenomenon has particularly affected women and highlights the strategies that can be undertaken after the pandemic to reduce stress and depression. We have analyzed the pandemic because it has completely changed the scenario of cardiovascular risk factors with an important increase in socio-economic stressors. It is still difficult to assess the damage produced on cardiovascular risk just as it is almost impossible to predict how the overwhelming and important increase in Long-Covid Syndromes will impact the population. Strong action is needed to support critical situations and to implement social campaigns aimed at restoring healthy lifestyles.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Burnout Rates of Graduating Canadian Urology Residents","Burnout is a work-related psychologic syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, decreased sense of personal accomplishment, and depersonalization. Burnout among surgeons is increasing with prevalence rates exceeding 50% even under normal working conditions. COVID-19 has affected the medical system with evidence of increased stress and depression levels. This study aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 on burnout rates in Canadian Urology trainees. Thirty-seven chief residents representing all 12 Canadian Urology residency programs attended a preparatory exam on December, 2019 pre-pandemic and thirty-nine chief residents attended virtually on November, 2020 during the pandemic. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) for medical professionals questionnaire was administered anonymously to both groups. The MBI covers emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. There was a 100% response rate in the convenience sample (n=37) in 2019 and 64.1% response rate (n=25) in 2020. 70% of chief residents in Canadian Urology programs showed evidence of burnout in 2019 compared to 88% in 2020, p=0.101. There was a statistically significant difference between the two cohorts in emotional exhaustion [mean Ã‚Â± standard deviation (SD) 16.2 Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.6 in 2019 and 20.2 Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.2 in 2020, p=0.011] and personal accomplishment scores (mean Ã‚Â± SD 32.2 Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.5 in 2019 and 30.6 Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.6 in 2020, p=0.039). This study is the first to examine the impact of the pandemic on burnout rates in Urology trainees. Burnout rates are high in trainees at baseline, and the pandemic appears to have exacerbated emotional exhaustion, and personal accomplishment, but not overall burnout rates.

"Effects of changes in physical and sedentary behaviors on mental health and life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from China","While restriction measures are critical in containing the COVID-19 outbreak, limited studies have investigated the behavioral and psychological impact of these measures. This study aimed to investigate the effects of physical and sedentary behavioral changes and online behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and life satisfaction among the Chinese population. The data were obtained from a cross-sectional survey of 2145 residents aged between 18 and 80 in Hubei province, China between March 23, 2020, and April 9, 2020. Participants who had high frequencies of physical activities before or during the COVID-19 outbreak exhibited higher levels of life satisfaction. Participants who increased their sitting time during the pandemic or kept sitting for more than eight hours before and during the pandemic reported worse mental health than those who maintained less sedentary behavior. Besides, participants who used the Internet for information seeking, communication, and entertainment more frequently reported better mental health and life satisfaction. In contrast, there was a positive association between commercial use of the Internet and symptoms of mental disorders.

"A Telehealth-Delivered Tai Chi Intervention (TaiChi4Joint) for Managing Aromatase Inhibitor-Induced Arthralgia in Patients With Breast Cancer During COVID-19: Longitudinal Pilot Study","Estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer is the most common type of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the endocrine therapy of choice recommended for these patients. Up to 50% of those treated with an AI develop arthralgia, often resulting in poor adherence and decreased quality of life. The study is a single-arm longitudinal pilot study aiming to evaluate the safety, feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of TaiChi4Joint, a remotely delivered 12-week tai chi intervention designed to relieve AI-induced joint pain. Women diagnosed with stage 0-III breast cancer who received an AI for at least 2 months and reported arthralgia with a Ã¢â€°Â¥4 score on a 0 to 10 scale for joint pain were eligible for study enrollment. Participants were encouraged to join tai chi classes delivered over Zoom three times a week for 12 weeks. Program engagement strategies included using a private Facebook study group and a Box cloud for archiving live class recordings. The program uses SMS text messaging and emails with periodic positive quotes and evidence-based information on tai chi for facilitating community bonding and class attendance. Participants were invited to complete the following assessments at baseline and at 1-, 2-, and 3-month intervals from study enrollment: Brief Pain Inventory, Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), The Australian Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index (AUSCAN), Fatigue Symptom Inventory, Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D). A total of 55 eligible patients were invited to participate, and 39 (71%) consented and completed the baseline assessments. Participants attended 61% (median) of the suggested classes, with no tai chi-related adverse events reported. Of the 39 participants, 22 completed the 3-month follow-up assessment with a 56% retention rate. Study participants reported improvement from baseline compared to 3 months as follows (paired t test): Brief Pain Inventory (P&lt;.001), AUSCAN pain subscale (P=.007), AUSCAN function subscale (P=.004), Fatigue Symptom Inventory (P=.004) and PSQI (P&lt;.001), and HFRDIS (P=.02) and CES-D (P&lt;.001). In particular, for our primary end point of interest, improvements in hip and knee symptoms, measured by WOMAC's three subscales, were clinically meaningful and statistically significant when adjusted for multiple comparisons from baseline to 3 months post intervention. The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in the need to rethink how mind-body therapies can be delivered. This study demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of a telehealth-based tai chi intervention for reducing AI-induced arthralgia. The intervention decreased patient-reported pain and stiffness, and improved sleep quality and depressive symptoms. Fully powered, large, telehealth-based tai chi trials for AI-associated arthralgia are needed considering our promising findings.

"Post-COVID-19 Depressive Symptoms: Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Pharmacological Treatment","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still spreading worldwide over 2 years since its outbreak. The psychopathological implications in COVID-19 survivors such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairments are now recognized as primary symptoms of the ""post-acute COVID-19 syndrome."" Depressive psychopathology was reported in around 35% of patients at short, medium, and long-term follow-up after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Post-COVID-19 depressive symptoms are known to increase fatigue and affect neurocognitive functioning, sleep, quality of life, and global functioning in COVID-19 survivors. The psychopathological mechanisms underlying post-COVID-19 depressive symptoms are mainly related to the inflammation triggered by the peripheral immune-inflammatory response to the viral infection and to the persistent psychological burden during and after infection. The large number of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and the high prevalence of post-COVID-19 depressive symptoms may significantly increase the pool of people suffering from depressive disorders. Therefore, it is essential to screen, diagnose, treat, and monitor COVID-19 survivors' psychopathology to counteract the depression disease burden and related years of life lived with disability. This paper reviews the current literature in order to synthesize the available evidence regarding epidemiology, clinical features, neurobiological underpinning, and pharmacological treatment of post-COVID-19 depressive symptoms.","Mazza, Palladini, Poletti, Benedetti","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40263-022-00931-3","20220621","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33111,""
"Investigating a psychological model of mental conditions and coping during the COVID-19 pandemic driven by participatory methods","There is evidence of increased mental health problems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimedÃ‚Â to identify the factors that put certain groups of people at greater risk of mental health problems. We took a participatory approach, involving people with lived experience of mental health problems and/or carers, to generate a set of risk factors and potential moderators of the effects of COVID on mental health. An online cross-sectional survey was completed by 1464 United Kingdom residents between 24th April and 27th June 2020. The survey had questions on whether respondents were existing mental health service users and or carers, level of depression (PHQ9) and anxiety (GAD7), demographics, threat and coping appraisals, perceived resilience (BRS), and specific coping behaviours (validated as part of this study). The relationship between responses and coping strategies was measured using tetrachoric correlations. Structural equation modelling was used to test the model. A model significantly fit our data (rel Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.05, RMSEAÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.029 95%, CI (0.016, 0.042), CFIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.99, TLIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.98, SRMRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.014). Age and coping appraisal predicted anxiety and depression. Whereas, threat appraisal and ethnicity only predicted anxiety, and resilience only predicted depression. Additionally, specific coping behaviours predicted anxiety and depression, with overlap on distraction. Some, but not all, risk factors significantly predict anxiety and depression. While there is a relationship between anxiety and depression, different factors may put people at greater risk of one or the other during the pandemic.","Simblett, Jilka, Vitoratou, Hayes, Morris, Wilson, Odoi, Mutepua, Evans, Negbenose, Jansli, Hudson, Adanijo, Dawe-Lane, Pinfold, Wykes","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02316-9","20220621","COVID-19; Coping; Mental health; Participatory methods","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33112,""

"Analyzing the role of resilience and life satisfaction as mediators of the impact of COVID-19 worries on mental health","The aim of this study was to test whether resilience and life satisfaction (two traditional protective factors) mediate between COVID-19 related worries and the development of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in adolescents and young adults. Participants involved 392 adolescents and young adults (70.20% female) aged between 12 and 25 years (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°17.05 years, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.08). Participants completed the COVID-19 related worries scale, the CD-RISC to analyse resilience, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21 to study emotional symptoms. Descriptive analyses and Pearson correlations were conducted, together with a structural equation modeling testing a mediational model and multigroup invariance. Results show that resilience and life satisfaction play a mediating role in the relation between the COVID-19 related worries and emotional symptoms (depression, anxiety, and stress). This study highlights the role of protective factors on adolescents' and young adults' emotional symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tamarit, De la Barrera, Schoeps, Castro-Calvo, Montoya-Castilla","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22900","20220621","COVID-19, COVID-19-related worries; adolescents; emotional symptoms; life satisfaction; resilience; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33114,""
"Understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatric trainees and what can help","The COVID-19 pandemic has increased rates of psychological distress and burnout in healthcare staff. How can we understand our experiences of the pandemic? We reflect on the experiences of psychiatry trainees in two north London mental health trusts. From a psychoanalytic understanding, states of extreme anxiety can lead to a manic defence and functioning in the paranoid-schizoid position. This position is derived from object relations theory and is characterised by binary thinking, splitting, projection, defensiveness and 'knee-jerk' decision-making. This can affect our perceptions, responses to others, relationships and ability to function and, therefore, our clinical practice and well-being. We consider the importance of recognising these processes and of organisational containment and having space to reflect. This supports functioning in the depressive position, a state of mind where we can tolerate anxiety, address difficult realities and develop new ideas. We hope these understandings are helpful to our colleagues in all professions.","Anastasis, Freudenthal, O'Reilly","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2022.33","20220621","COVID-19; Coronavirus; burnout; trainees; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33115,""
"Suicide Behavior Results From the US Army's Suicide Prevention Leadership Tool Study: The Behavioral Health Readiness and Suicide Risk Reduction Review (R4)","The U.S. Army developed a new tool called the Behavioral Health Readiness and Suicide Risk Reduction Review (R4) for suicide prevention. A 12-month evaluation study with the primary objective of testing the hypothesis (H1) that Army units receiving R4 would demonstrate improved outcomes in suicidal-behavior measures following the intervention, relative to control, was then conducted. The results of analyses to answer H1 are herein presented. The R4 intervention (R4-tools/instructions/orientation) evaluation study, Institutional Review Board approved and conducted in May 2019-June 2020, drew samples from two U.S. Army divisions and employed a repeated measurement in pre-/post-quasi-experimental design, including a nonequivalent, but comparable, business-as-usual control. Intervention effectiveness was evaluated using self-report responses to suicide-related measures (Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised/total-suicide behaviors/ideations/plans/attempts/non-suicidal self-injuries) at 6-/12-month intervals. Analyses examined baseline to follow-up linked and cross-sectional cohorts, incidence/prevalence, and intervention higher-/lower-use R4 subanalyses. Both divisions demonstrated favorable in-study reductions in total-suicide burden, with relatively equivalent trends for total-suicide behaviors, total-suicide risk (Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised), suicidal ideations, and non-suicidal self-injuries. Although both demonstrated reductions in suicide plans, the control showed a more robust trend. Neither division demonstrated a significant reduction in suicide attempts, but subgroup analyses showed a significant reduction in pre-coronavirus disease 2019-attempt incidence among those with higher-use R4 relative to control. There is no evidence of harm associated with the R4 intervention. R4 effectiveness as a function of R4 itself requires confirmatory study. R4 is judged an improvement (no evidence of harmÃ¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°weak evidence of effectiveness) over the status quo (no safety data or effectiveness studies) with regard to tool-based decision-making support for suicide prevention in the U.S. Army.","Curley, Duffy, Kim, Clarke-Walper, Riviere, Wilk","https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usac169","20220621","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33116,""
"Psychotropic Drug Prescription in Nursing Homes During the COVID-19 Pandemic","To limit the introduction of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) into nursing homes, restrictive measures and social distancing were implemented; however, these caused an increase in affective disorders such as depression and anxiety and an alteration of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Therefore, it is expected that prescription trends of psychotropic drugs in nursing homes during the pandemic may have changed significantly. This study aims to compare patterns of prescribing psychotropic drugs in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic to those of the pre-pandemic period. This cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted in geriatric units and psychogeriatric units in seven nursing homes in Gipuzkoa, Spain. On 1 March, 2020, data regarding 511 residents in geriatric units and 163 in psychogeriatric units were recorded. This study examined utilization percentages for psychotropic drugs before the pandemic (April 2018-March 2020) and during the pandemic (April 2020-March 2021) in light of projected usage based on previous years. Following the Anatomical, Therapeutic, Chemical Classification System, four therapeutic groups were analyzed: antipsychotics (N05A), benzodiazepines (N05B and N05C), antidepressants (N06A), and antiepileptic drugs (N03A). In the case of geriatric units, a downward trend of prescription was reversed for antipsychotics (-0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.41, 0.60). Benzodiazepine use also decreased less than expected (-2.00; 95% CI -3.00, -1.00). Antidepressant use increased more than predicted (0.02; 95% CI -0.97, 1.01), as did antiepileptic drug use (2.93; 95% CI 2.27, 3.60). In the psychogeriatric units, the drop in antipsychotic utilization was less than expected (-2.31; 95% CI -3.68, -0.93). Although it was expected that the prescription of benzodiazepines would decrease, usage remained roughly the same (-0.28; 95% CI -2.40, 2.34). Utilization of antidepressants (8.57; 95% CI 6.89, 10.24) and antiepileptic drugs (6.10; 95% CI 3.20, 9.00) increased significantly, which was expected, based on the forecast. For all categories, usage of psychotropic drugs was higher than anticipated based on the forecast; this increase might be related to the worsening of emotional and behavioral disorders caused by the restrictive measures of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ferro Uriguen, Laso Lucas, Sannino Menicucci, Iturrioz Arrechea, Alaba Trueba, EchevarrÃƒÂ­a Orella, Gil Goikouria, Beobide Telleria","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40266-022-00948-9","20220621","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33117,""

"Post-traumatic stress symptoms experienced by healthcare workers in Lebanon four months following Beirut's ammonium nitrate explosion: a survey-based study","On August 4, 2020, Lebanon faced one of the deadliest mass casualty explosions the world has witnessed during the twenty-first century. The human and emotional tolls were heavy on attending physicians, clinical fellows, residents, interns, medical students, and registered nurses, who were working in dramatic conditions, triaging, and treating thousands of blast-related casualties. We evaluated the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSS), among these healthcare workers (HCWs) from different Lebanese hospitals. This is a multicentered, cross-sectional study that was conducted in December 2020, using an online questionnaire that evaluated the risk of developing PTSS based on the validated self-reported PTSD-Checklist for DSM-V (PCL-5). We also explored possible correlates with the participants' socio-demographic characteristics, job profile, mental health, and blast-related events. Out of 519 participants, 44% were at high risk of developing PTSS following Beirut-blast. Nurses, attending physicians, fellows, and participants who are older in age, married, or working at specific hospitals, were at a higher risk. Those identified at higher risk of PTSS were surgeons, anesthesiologists, emergency medicine doctors, or radiologists; and they were more likely to be willing to migrate; having a prior history of psychiatric medication intake for PTSD treatment, a prior history of PTSD, or a personal history of seeking mental health service. At last, the latter two parameters as well as the number of examined injuries, severe home damage, and testing positive for the COVID-19 virus during the two weeks' period that followed the blast were found to be predictors for the development of PTSS. Lebanese in-hospital HCWs were found to be at a high risk of developing PTSS following the Beirut-Blast, thus we recommend public health authorities to provide adequate resources to avoid the emergence of mental illnesses among these rescuers.","Bou Sanayeh, El Chamieh, Saade, Maalouf, Bizri","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-022-00911-5","20220620","Beirut blast; Healthcare workers; Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33119,""
"Infodemiological study on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on increased headache incidences at the world level","The analysis of the public interest as reflected by Internet queries has become a highly valuable tool in many fields. The Google Trends platform, providing timely and informative data, has become increasingly popular in health and medical studies. This study explores whether Internet search frequencies for the keyword ""headache"" have been increasing after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, which could signal an increased incidence of the health problem. Weekly search volume data for 5Ã‚Â years spanning February 2017 to February 2022 were sourced from Google Trends. Six statistical and machine-learning methods were implemented on training and testing sets via pre-set automated forecasting algorithms. Holt-Winters has been identified as overperforming in predicting web query trends through several accuracy measures and the DM test for forecasting superiority and has been employed for producing the baseline level in the estimation of excess query level over the first pandemic wave. Findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increased global incidence of headache (as proxied by related web queries) in the first 6Ã‚Â months after its outbreak, with an excess occurrence of 4.53% globally. However, the study also concludes that the increasing trend in headache incidence at the world level would have continued in the absence of the pandemic, but it has been accelerated by the pandemic event. Results further show mixed correlations at the country-level between COVID-19 infection rates and population web-search behavior, suggesting that the increased headache incidence is caused by pandemic-related factors (i.e. increased stress and mental health problems), rather than a direct effect of coronavirus infections. Other noteworthy findings entail that in the Philippines, the term ""headache"" was the most frequently searched term in the period spanning February 2020 to February 2022, indicating that headache occurrences are a significant aspect that defines population health at the country level. High relative interest is also detected in Kenya and South Africa after the pandemic outbreak. Additionally, research findings indicate that the relative interest has decreased in some countries (i.e. US, Canada, and Australia), whereas it has increased in others (i.e. India and Pakistan) after the pandemic outbreak. We conclude that observing Internet search habits can provide timely information for policymakers on collective health trends, as opposed to ex-post statistics, and can furthermore yield valuable information for the pain management drug market key players about aggregate consumer behavior.","Tudor, Sova","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-13663-7","20220621","COVID-19; Headache; Humans; Incidence; Pandemics; Search Engine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33120,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Korean Adolescents' Mental Health and Lifestyle Factors","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused changes in the daily lives of Korean adolescents and affected their emotional well-being. This study compared lifestyle factors and the mental health status of adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a secondary analysis using data from a national cross-sectional cohort (Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, KYRBS) collected in 2019 before the COVID-19 outbreak and in 2020 during the pandemic. This study included 57,303 students from the 2019 KYRBS and 54,948 from the 2020 KYRBS. Lifestyle factors such as dietary habits, physical activity levels, time spent studying, duration of Internet use, and mental health status, including perceived stress, experience of depressive mood, and suicidal ideation and attempts, were included in the analyses. The perceived stress levels, self-reported depressive mood, and suicidal thoughts and attempts were lower in the students surveyed in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic than in the students surveyed in 2019 before the COVID-19 outbreak. The time spent studying and sleep duration decreased compared to before the pandemic, and sleep satisfaction increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results showed an improvement in mental health status in Korean adolescents during the pandemic, but caution is needed when interpreting these results. Future research is needed to determine the effects of a long-lasting pandemic on mental health and lifestyle factors in adolescents.","Lee, Ko, Chi, Lee, Yoon","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2022.05.020","20220617","Adolescents; COVID-19; Depression; KYRBS; Lifestyle factors; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33121,""
"Factors influencing uptake of telemental health via videoconferencing at high and low adoption sites within the Department of Veterans Affairs during COVID-19: a qualitative study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic dramatically increased the use of telemental health via videoconferencing (TMH-V). While TMH-V has been found to be effective and satisfactory to both patients and providers, little is known regarding factors that influence site-level uptake. We examined facilitators and barriers to TMH-V uptake at higher and lower adoption sites within the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). We conducted twenty-four semi-structured qualitative interviews at four northeastern VA medical centers (two with higher TMH-V adoption and two with lower adoption). Six interviews were conducted per site (one member of mental health leadership, one facility telehealth coordinator/technician, and four mental health providers per site). We performed directed content analysis, guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), followed by a matrix rating process to rank the degree of influence of each of the 19 included CFIR constructs at the four sites. Positive overall influences, negative overall influences, and differentiators were then identified based on patterns in ratings across sites. Five CFIR constructs had positive overall influences across sites: Relative advantage, Patient needs and resources, Relative priority, Knowledge and beliefs, and Self-efficacy. Complexity had a negative overall influence across sites. Four constructs significantly differentiated between higher and lower adoption sites with regards to TMH-V use: Quality, Compatibility, Leadership engagement, and Champions. Several positive overall influences on TMH-V uptake were identified across sites; respondents acknowledged multiple advantages of TMH-V (e.g., convenience), and providers' attitudes towards TMH-V improved as they gained experience. In contrast, complexity was a negative overall influence; TMH-V platforms and processes must be simple and user friendly to promote use. The emergence of Quality, Leadership engagement, and Champions as differentiators speaks to the importance of educating frontline staff and leadership at lower adoption sites about the evidence base demonstrating that TMH-V is high-quality care. Compatibility also emerged as a differentiator; if TMH-V is not easily integrated into provider workflows, uptake will falter. Future work should draw from these findings to develop implementation strategies aiming to increase TMH-V uptake at lower adoption sites, thereby increasing access to high-quality mental health care.","Connolly, Sullivan, Lindsay, Shimada, Heyworth, Weaver, Miller","https://doi.org/10.1186/s43058-022-00318-x","20220620","CFIR; Mental health; Qualitative; Telehealth; Telemental health; Telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33122,""
"Examining resilience of individuals living with sickle cell disease in the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the physical and mental health of people worldwide including those living with genetic conditions. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hematologic chronic disease that causes multisystem damage and morbidity. Individuals living with SCD have had to continue managing their care for their chronic disease while following public health measures to protect against infection with COVID-19. Promoting resilience has been posited as being psychologically protective for those living with SCD. This study examines changes in resilience over time in a SCD population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ninety-seven adults living with SCD completed two parent studies: (1) The INSIGHTS Study, a cross-sectional natural history study conducted from 2014-2019 and (2) The Living with SCD in COVID-19 Pandemic Study, an online survey conducted in 2020. Changes over time in resilience, perceived stress, emotional distress, and physical and mental health were analyzed in multivariable repeated measures model. Results showed that the psychological resilience of our study cohort had significantly decreased (0.19, p=0.01) over time. Resilience during the pandemic was associated with better mental health and physical health and lower perceived stress and emotional distress. In addition, results showed that marital status, education level, and employment were significantly associated with the psychological resilience of study participants. Resilience declined during the COVID-19 pandemic but was still associated with better physical and mental health outcomes. Future studies should investigate the relationship between resilience and sociodemographic factors.","Buscetta, Abdallah, Floyd, Wossenseged, Conn, Ramirez, Bonham","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00862-0","20220620","COVID-19; Psychological resilience; Psychosocial factors; Sickle cell disease","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33123,""

"The impact of online teaching on stress and burnout of academics during the transition to remote teaching from home","The higher education institutions worldwide have been transformed unexpectedly to online teaching. This sudden movement from blended learning or traditional face-to-face teaching has severely disrupted university activities and posed many challenges for teaching staff, who were asked to develop online versions of their courses overnight. This study explores the effect of the current changes in education style and working from home on the stress and burnout levels of teaching staff. This study utilized a cross-sectional design, whereby 278 participants (faculty and course instructors) from 17 campuses of one of the largest colleges in United Arab Emirates completed a web-based survey. Numerous instruments were utilized to obtain the following data: participants demographics; their perceived stress during online teaching; their perception of the impact of teaching from home on their family's daily life, physical health, mental health and ability to cope with stress; burnout level; and their satisfaction with online teaching. Around 60% of participants reported moderate stress level during online teaching (moderate stressÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5 to 8) under COVID-19 (M 6.21Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.26). An independent sample t-test and ANOVA tests revealed that participants with 7-10Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of online teaching experience reported more stress than participants who have 4-6Ã¢â‚¬â€°years online teaching experience (M 7.29, Ã‚Â±1.11 Vs. 5.30, Ã‚Â±2.69; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04). Moreover, multiple regression analysis showed that higher stress levels and lower satisfaction with the online teaching experience were associated with more significant personal and working burnout. Married participants with school-age children were at greater risk of personal burnout. The transition to remote education imposed mental burdens and stress on faculty members. Supportive professional development strategies to enrich faculty with online teaching skills are urgently required.","Mosleh, Kasasbeha, Aljawarneh, Alrimawi, Saifan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03496-3","20220620","Burnout; COVID-19; Remote teaching; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33125,""
"Racial and ethnic differences in perseverative cognition at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic","Coronavirus (COVID-19) disproportionately affects people of color (e.g., Black and Latinx individuals) in the U.S., increasing their morbidity and mortality relative to White people. Despite this greater threat to their well-being, the mental health impact of COVID-19 on people of color remains poorly understood. Perseverative cognition (PC; i.e., excessive worry and/or rumination), is a common psychological response to such threats that independently associates with poor mental and physical health. To examine patterns of PC across race/ethnicity when the COVID-19 pandemic began. This study surveyed 6,514 respondents from the NORC AmeriSpeak panel, a probability-based representative national sample of U.S. adults between 3/18/21-4/18/21. We employed traditional statistical analyses and natural language processing of open-ended data to examine pandemic-related worries. Weighted regression analyses with relevant covariates revealed group differences across specific domains of COVID-related worry. Relative to White respondents, Hispanic/Latino respondents reported more worries about social disarray, meeting basic needs, experiencing economic impacts, obtaining healthcare, and contracting COVID-19. Black respondents reported more worry about economic impacts relative to Whites. Additional group differences in worry emerged in open-ended data: Black respondents perseverated about death from COVID-19, whereas Hispanic/Latino respondents reported concerns about COVID-19 spread, and people refusing to uphold mitigation mandates. In contrast, White respondents expressed worry over compromised immune systems and economic collapse. Results identify significant group differences in COVID-19 related PC, suggesting that people of color faced greater threat to mental well-being at the onset of the pandemic, and may be at greater risk for downstream PC-related physical health consequences.","Williams, Jones, Holman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115105","20220622","COVID; Mental health; Novel coronavirus; People of color; Perseverative cognition; SARS-CoV-2; Worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33126,""
"A prospective study revealing a compounded burden of COVID-19, sex, and clinical diagnosis of alcohol use disorder and HIV infection on quality of life, anxiety, and alcohol use","The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented restrictions to mitigate disease spread, leading to consequences affecting mental health. Many studies examining COVID-19 pandemic effects on well-being and mental health initiated inquiry after the pandemic onset, whereas we used self-report questionnaires obtained before the pandemic to re-assess the same functions during the pandemic. Participants were drawn from our ongoing longitudinal studies of people with HIV infection, alcohol use disorder (AUD), HIVÃ‚Â +Ã‚Â AUD comorbidity, and controls. We used phone or mail contact to invite all to participate in our COVID phone survey, which included three self-report questionnaires: Health-related Quality of Life (QoL), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). Of 218 eligible participants, 86 responded (July 2020-March 2021): clinical (29 men, 23 women; 17 AUD, 21 HIV, 14 HIVÃ‚Â +Ã‚Â AUD); control (17 men, 17 women). QoL scores declined, and anxiety symptoms increased from pre-COVID surveys in all groups; clinical women reported greater negative changes than the other groups. QoL subscales revealed COVID-related declines in emotional well-being in all groups, with clinical women reporting additional declines in energy, physical and social functioning, health, and pain increase. Clinical men also reported health declines. Although AUDIT scores were stable in all groups between assessments, changes in AUDIT scores were inversely correlated with QoL scores in clinical women; in clinical men, changes in STAI scores were inversely correlated with QoL scores. Although all groups were adversely affected by the pandemic, the negative effects were greater in the clinical group regardless of diagnosis and greatest in clinical women.","Lannoy, Fama, Sassoon, Le Berre, Asok, Zahr, Pfefferbaum, Sullivan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.06.017","20220622","Anxiety; COVID-19; Pandemic; Prospective study; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33127,""
"The Epidemiology of Major Trauma During the First Wave of COVID-19 Movement Restriction Policies: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies","The objective of this systematic review is to investigate changes in the epidemiology of major trauma presentations during the implementation of movement restriction measures to manage the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. A systematic search in six databases, as well as a search of grey literature was performed from January 2020 to August 2021. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. The certainty of evidence was rated according to the GRADE approach. The review is reported using both PRISMA guideline and the MOOSE checklist. In total, 35 studies involving 36,987 patients were included. The number of major trauma admissions overall decreased during social movement restrictions (-24%; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01; 95% CI [-0.31; -0.17]). A pooled analysis reported no evidence of a change in the severity of trauma admissions (OR:1.17; 95%CI [0.77, 1.79], I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°77%). There was no evidence for a change in mortality during the COVID-19 period (OR:0.94, 95%CI [0.80,1.11], I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°53%). There was a statistically significant reduction in motor vehicle trauma (OR:0.70; 95%CI [0.61, 0.81], I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°91%) and a statistically significant increase in admissions due to firearms and gunshot wounds (OR:1.34; 95%CI [1.11, 1.61], I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°73%) and suicide attempts and self-harm (OR:1.41; 95%CI [1.05, 1.89], I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°39%). Although evidence continues to emerge, this systematic review reports some decrease in absolute major trauma volume with unchanged severity and mortality during the first wave of COVID-19 movement restriction policies. Current evidence does not support the reallocation of highly specialised trauma professionals and trauma resources.

"Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma: In-Person and Online Delivery of an Intervention to Promote Mental Health Among Latina Immigrant Women","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> A few mindfulness-based interventions have been developed for Latina immigrant populations. We describe the feasibility and acceptability of Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA), a culturally grounded intervention developed to prevent and reduce depression and anxiety among Latina immigrants. We also compare participation in the intervention in-person with an online adaptation developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> ALMA was developed through several years of formative research in collaboration with community organizations serving Latino immigrants. The curriculum integrates mindfulness-based approaches with Latino cultural strengths to reduce stress, enhance coping strategies, and increase social support. Latina immigrant women who spoke Spanish were recruited from Latino serving organizations to participate in an intervention trial. The program consisted of eight sessions offered weekly in person to groups of Ã¢Ë†Â¼20 Latina immigrants. After the onset of the pandemic, the program was adapted to be delivered online via zoom. Attendance and fidelity were monitored by intervention staff, and a satisfaction survey was given to participants post-intervention. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We enrolled 226 Latina immigrant women with an average age of 40 years and an average of 15.0 years living in the United States. The majority of participants were monolingual Spanish speakers (59%) with a high school degree (66%), although almost half were living on less than $2,200 per month (48%). One hundred and seven (47%) attended the program in-person, and 119 (53%) participated online. Program attendance was similar across modalities, with an average of 58% sessions completed among in-person and 60% among online participants. Participant satisfaction and perceived efficacy of the intervention were high in both in-person and online groups. <b><i>Discussion:</i></b> Our findings indicate that the ALMA intervention is acceptable and feasible in this population. Future research should assess the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions in Latina immigrant populations, including both in-person and online modalities.

"Design of vestibules as transitional spaces in infection control: Necessity of working space changes to cope with communicable infections","After the spread of infectious diseases, people stay at home as a shelter space to be safe and sound. Current homes and work spaces have shown not to be a good environment for health and hygiene. During different crises of infectious diseases, architects and designers analyze the needs for change and evolve of environments to achieve a suitable design that prevents the spread of pathogens. This proper design should help improve people's living standards and mental health in terms of functionality and environmental psychology. In the traditional architecture of some countries, such as Canada, Japan, and Iran, the vestibule has provided some possibility of separating the external and internal space. The design of the intermediate space with the appropriate scale of today's buildings at the entrance can create a filter between the indoor and outdoor environments by dividing these spaces. The use of intermediate space by modern technology can prevent the transfer of viral infection into the interior of the building. This can be done by removing the virus from clothes, changing or covering shoes, disinfecting equipment, separating infected items, and creating proper ventilation in the intermediate space so that microorganisms cannot be transferred into the safe environment. In this paper, we looked at the architectural design in a new light to have a healthier life and more security, by inspiration of the patterns in traditional architecture and the human body.","Andalib, Faghani, Heidari, Tabari Khomeiran","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-210216","20220620","COVID-19; Vestibule; health design; workplace psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33131,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Suicide Prevention Helpline in The Netherlands","<b/> <i>Background:</i> Although the number of suicides did not increase in 2020, there are concerns about the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. <i>Aims:</i> To present the demand for the Dutch suicide prevention helpline during times of lockdown and to describe the coronavirus-related problems discussed. <i>Methods:</i> An observational and exploratory study analyzing the frequency of helpline requests and registration data (<i>n</i> = 893 conversations). <i>Results:</i> Demand for the helpline did increase, but with no distinctive relation with the lockdown measures. During the first lockdown, approximately a quarter of the analyzed helpline conversations were registered as coronavirus-related by the counselors. Most frequently mentioned conversation topics were the interruption to or changes in professional help, social isolation and loss of structure, and ways to find a distraction from suicidal thoughts/rumination. <i>Limitations:</i> Observational study design prevents causal inferences, and demand for the helpline is impacted by multiple factors. <i>Conclusion:</i> These coronavirus-related problems made help-seekers vulnerable to suicidal thoughts and a reduced desire to live. That many suffered from loneliness is concerning as this contributes to the risk of suicidal ideation. The distress among help-seekers due to the sudden loss of mental health care underscores the importance of maintaining contact with those in care and lowering the threshold for help.","van der Burgt, MÃƒÂ©relle, Beekman, Gilissen","https://doi.org/10.1027/0227-5910/a000863","20220620","COVID-19; conversation topics; lockdown; mental health; suicide prevention helpline","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33132,""

"Psychological Distress and Access to Mental Health Services Among Undergraduate Students During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Uganda","Lockdown is an important public health approach aimed at curbing the raging effect of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed at determining the impact of prolonged lockdown on mental health and access to mental health services among undergraduate students in Uganda. An online cross-sectional study was conducted anonymously among undergraduates across 10 universities in Uganda. The Distress Questionnaire-5 (DQ-5) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) were used. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine factors associated with psychological distress. We enrolled 366 participants with a mean age of 24.5 Ã‚Â± 4.6 years. The prevalence of psychological distress was 40.2% (<i>n</i> = 147) (cut off 14/25 based on DQ-5) while depression stood at 25.7% (<i>n</i> = 94; cut off 3/6 based on PHQ-2) with mean scores of 12.1 Ã‚Â± 4.6 and 1.7 Ã‚Â± 1.6 respectively. Female gender (aOR: 1.6, 95%CI: 1.0-2.6, <i>p</i> = 0.032), pursuing a non-medical program (aOR: 2.2, 95%CI: 1.3-3.7, <i>p</i> = 0.005) were factors associated with psychological distress while non-medical program (aOR: 2.2, 95%CI: 1.3-3.7, <i>p</i> = 0.005) was associated with increased depression. Access to mental health services was associated with both reduced distress (aOR: 0.5, 95%CI: 0.3-0.8, <i>p</i> = 0.005) and depression (aOR: 0.6, 95%CI: 0.3-0.9, <i>p</i> = 0.034). A majority (65.3%) of the participants reported knowing how to access mental health care and 188 (51.4%) reported having needed emotional support but, only 67 (18.3%) ever sought care from a mental health professional. Of those who had access, only 10 (7%), and 13 (9%) accessed a counselor or a mental health unit, respectively. The barriers to accessibility of mental health care included financial limitations (49.5%), lack of awareness (32.5%), lack of mental health professionals (28.4%), and stigma (13.9%). Among university students in Uganda during the COVID- 19 lockdown, the burden of psychological distress and depression was substantial. However, access to mental health services was limited by several factors.","Nantaayi, Ndawula, Musoke, Ssewante, Nakyagaba, Wamala, Makai, Wannyana, Wamala, Kanyike, Akech, Ojilong, Agira, Nakimuli, Asiimwe, Bongomin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.792217","20220620","COVID-19; access mental health services; depression; lockdown; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33134,""
"Correlation Between Schizophrenia and Coronavirus Disease in North Sumatera, Indonesia: A Correlative Analytical Study","In the first quarter of 2020, two cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were reported in Indonesia, approximately 4 months after the first case was reported in China. The numbers continued to increase following the introduction of many variants of the virus. The pandemic may have an impact on the community's mental health, particularly on those with mental illnesses. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the correlation between schizophrenia and COVID-19 based on demographic characteristics. This nominal-nominal and numerical-nominal correlative analytical study used a cross-sectional approach and was conducted at a psychiatric hospital in North Sumatra. The sample population consisted of 48 patients and 48 healthy controls, who were selected using a non-probability consecutive sampling method. The analysis showed that there were correlations between schizophrenia and COVID-19 (<i>r</i> = 0.417, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and between the age of patients with schizophrenia and COVID-19 with (<i>r</i> = 0.544). COVID-19 is correlated with schizophrenia and the age of patients with schizophrenia. We recommend that patients with schizophrenia follow the same health guidelines as the clinical high-risk group for COVID-19 and receive the same treatment. Physicians that treat patients with COVID-19 should pay close attention to those with schizophrenia because they may underestimate their condition.","Amin, Futrawan, Husada","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.896623","20220620","COVID-19; Indonesia; age; coronavirus disease; schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33135,""
"Changes in Brain-Health Related Modifiable Risk Factors in Older Adults After One Year of COVID-19-Restrictions","The COVID-19 pandemic has major influence on lifestyle and mental health, which might affect brain-health and increase the risk of cognitive decline, particularly in older adults. We aimed to describe changes in modifiable risk factors related to brain-health in older adults after one year of COVID-19 restrictions. An online survey was disseminated between February and March 2021 to 17,773 registrants of the Dutch Brain Research Registry, aged Ã¢â€°Â¥50, without a self-reported diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Participants were asked to report potential changes in behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to pre-pandemic, in eight domains related to brain health: physical activity, sleep, feeling of memory decline, perceived stress, feeling of loneliness, diet, alcohol consumption, and smoking. We used negative binomial regression analyses to relate (socio)demographics, subjective memory complaints and COVID-19 related aspects (fear of, or current/past COVID-19 infection) to the number of reported detrimental and beneficial changes as dependent variable. 3,943 participants (66 Ã‚Â± 8 years old; 76% female; 71% highly educated) completed the survey. After one year of COVID-19-restrictions, 74% reported at least one detrimental lifestyle change unfavorable for their brain health, most frequently reported were feelings of loneliness, sleep problems, and less physical activity. 60% of participants reported at least one beneficial change, which were most often more physical activity, healthier dietary habits, and less alcohol consumption. Individuals who are younger [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.98-0.99], female (1.20, 1.11-1.30), living alone (1.20, 1.11-1.28) and in urban environments (1.18, 1.08-1.29), who are less satisfied with their income (1.38, 1.17-1.62), experiencing subjective memory complaints (1.40, 1.28-1.52) and those with a past or current (1.19, 1.06-1.34) or fear of a COVID-19 infection (1.33, 1.25-1.42) reported higher numbers of detrimental changes. The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced lifestyle in both positive and negative ways. We identified (socio)demographic factors associated with more detrimental changes in modifiable risk factors related to brain health, suggesting that some individuals are more vulnerable for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings provide an opportunity for targeted prevention and education to promote a healthy lifestyle during and after the pandemic.","Waterink, Bakker, Visser, Mangialasche, Kivipelto, Deckers, KÃƒÂ¶hler, Sikkes, Prins, Scheltens, van der Flier, Zwan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.877460","20220620","COVID-19; aging; cognitive decline; lifestyle; lockdown; mental health; prevention; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33136,""
"The Evolution of Psychological and Behavioral Consequences of Self-Isolation During Lockdown: A Longitudinal Study Across United Kingdom and Italy","Several countries imposed nationwide or partial lockdowns to limit the spread of COVID-19 and avoid overwhelming hospitals and intensive care units. Lockdown may involve restriction of movement, stay-at-home orders and self-isolation, which may have dramatic consequences on mental health. Recent studies demonstrated that the negative impact of lockdown restrictions depends on a wide range of psychological and socio-demographic factors. This longitudinal study aimed to understand how internal factors such as personality and mindfulness traits, and external factors, such as daily habits and house features, affect anxiety, depression and general wellbeing indicators, as well as cognitive functions, during the course of a lockdown. To address these questions, 96 participants in Italy and the United Kingdom filled out a survey, once a week for 4 weeks, during the first-wave lockdowns. The survey included questions related to their habits and features of the house, as well as validated questionnaires to measure personality traits, mindful attitude and post-traumatic symptoms. Indicators of wellbeing were the affective state, anxiety, stress and psychopathological indices. We also measured the emotional impact of the pandemic on cognitive ability by using two online behavioral tasks [emotional Stroop task (EST) and visual search]. We found that internal factors influenced participants' wellbeing during the first week of the study, while external factors affected participants in the last weeks. In the first week, internal variables such as openness, conscientiousness and being non-judgmental toward one's own thoughts and emotions were positively associated with wellbeing; instead, neuroticism and the tendency to observe and describe one's own thoughts and emotions had detrimental effects on wellbeing. Toward the end of the study, external variables such as watching television and movies, browsing the internet, walking the dog, and having a balcony showed a protective value, while social networking and engaging in video calls predicted lower values of wellbeing. We did not find any effects of wellbeing on cognitive functioning. Recognizing specific traits and habits affecting individuals' wellbeing (in both short and long terms) during social isolation is crucial to identify people at risk of developing psychological distress and help refine current guidelines to alleviate the psychological consequences of prolonged lockdowns.","Zaninotto, Bossi, Terry, Riccaboni, Galli","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.826277","20220620","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; lockdown; longitudinal; pandemic; stress; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33137,""
"Adapting Peer Researcher Facilitated Strategies to Recruit People Receiving Mental Health Services to a Tobacco Treatment Trial","One of the most challenging aspects of conducting intervention trials among people who experience severe mental illness (SMI) and who smoke tobacco, is recruitment. In our parent ""QuitLink"" randomized controlled trial (RCT), slower than expected peer researcher facilitated recruitment, along with the impact of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, necessitated an adaptive recruitment response. The objectives of the present study were to: (i) describe adaptive peer researcher facilitated recruitment strategies; (ii) explore the effectiveness of these strategies; (iii) investigate whether recruitment strategies reached different subgroups of participants; and (iv) examine the costs and resources required for implementing these strategies. Finally, we offer experience-based lessons in a Peer Researcher Commentary. People were included in the RCT if they smoked at least 10 cigarettes a day and were accessing mental health support from the project's two partnering mental health organizations in Victoria, Australia. The majority of people accessing these services will have been diagnosed with SMI. Recruitment occurred over 2 years. We began with peer facilitated recruitment strategies delivered face-to-face, then replaced this with direct mail postcards followed by telephone contact. In the final 4 months of the study, we began online recruitment, broadening it to people who smoked and were accessing support or treatment (including from general practitioners) for mental health and/or alcohol or other drug problems, anywhere in the state of Victoria. Differences between recruitment strategies on key participant variables were assessed. We calculated the average cost per enrolee of the different recruitment approaches. Only 109 people were recruited from a target of 382: 29 via face-to-face (March 2019 to April 2020), 66 from postcards (May 2020 to November 2020), and 14 from online (November to December 2020 and January to March 2021) strategies. Reflecting our initial focus on recruiting from supported independent living accommodation facilities, participants recruited face-to-face were significantly more likely to be living in partially or fully supported independent living (<i>n</i> = 29, &lt;0.001), but the samples were otherwise similar. After the initial investment in training and equipping peer researchers, the average cost of recruitment was AU$1,182 per participant-~US$850. Face-to-face recruitment was the most expensive approach and postcard recruitment the least (AU$1,648 and AU$928 per participant). Peer researcher facilitated recruitment into a tobacco treatment trial was difficult and expensive. Widely dispersed services and COVID-19 restrictions necessitated non-face-to-face recruitment strategies, such as direct mail postcards, which improved recruitment and may be worthy of further research. The trial is registered with ANZCTR (www.anzctr.org.au): ACTRN12619000244101 prior to the accrual of the first participant and updated regularly as per registry guidelines. The trial sponsor was the University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia.","Baker, McCarter, Brophy, Castle, Kelly, Cocks, McKinlay, Brasier, Borland, Bonevski, Segan, Baird, Turner, Williams, Forbes, Hayes, Attia, Lambkin, Barker, Sweeney","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.869169","20220620","cost analysis; mental illness; peer worker; quitline; recruitment; severe mental illness (SMI); smoking cessation; tobacco treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33138,""
"Prevalence and Associated Factors of Diabetes Distress, Depression and Anxiety Among Primary Care Patients With Type 2 Diabetes During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Egypt: A Cross-Sectional Study","The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is growing worldwide. T2DM is often complicated by a range of psychological disorders that interfere with glycemic control and self-care. Previous studies have reported diabetes distress, depression, and anxiety among patients with T2DM; however; little is known about the burden of these comorbid mental disorders in primary care patients with T2DM treated in Egypt during the COVID-19 era. Participants were selected by convenient sampling from eight rural primary healthcare facilities from Ismailia in Egypt. Symptoms of diabetes distress, depression and anxiety were assessed by using the Arabic version of the 20-item Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID), Patient Health Questionnaire 9, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scales, respectively. Multiple hierarchical logistic regression models were used to estimate the significant factors associated with diabetes distress, depression, and anxiety. A total of 403 individuals with T2DM were interviewed. The prevalence of severe diabetes distress was 13.4% (95% CI: 10.1-16.7), while prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 9.2% (95% CI: 6.4-12.0%), and 4.0% (95% CI: 2.1-5.9), respectively. In a series of hierarchical logistic regression models, significant predictors for diabetes distress were being married, illiterate, not-working, living with insufficient income, and having multi-comorbidities. Likewise, the significant predictors for depression and anxiety were elevated glycated hemoglobin level and the higher PAID total score, while having multi-comorbidities was a significant predictor for anxiety only. Diabetes distress was more prevalent than depressive and anxiety symptoms in this study population. Several sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were identified to be related with psychological problems among patients with T2DM, which necessitate a multidisciplinary team-based approach for optimal screening and management.","Sayed Ahmed, Fouad, Elotla, Joudeh, Mostafa, Shah, Shah, Mohamed","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.937973","20220620","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; diabetes distress; primary healthcare; type 2 diabetes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33139,""
"Exploring a Dance/Movement Program on Mental Health and Well-Being in Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence During a Pandemic","The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility and benefits of a 12-session dance/movement program for intimate partner violence survivors' mental health and PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The specific purposes were fourfold: (1) To determine the feasibility of delivering a virtual dance/movement workshop program; (2) to examine the effects of the program on symptoms of PTSD and psychological distress; (3) to determine whether heart rate variability improves; and (4) to describe the individual and shared experiences of a subgroup of participants of the program. Forty-five women ages 23-48 years were randomized to a 12-session virtual creative dance/movement program or a usual care control group, and completed questionnaires about PTSD and mental health symptoms, general health, physical activity, and underwent a brief measurement of heart rate variability. A subset of the intervention group participated in a semi-structured focus group. The results of the study showed that the female survivors of intimate partner violence who participated in the virtual workshops felt better, and they experienced improved affect and reduced tension. They found new ways to express themselves, attune to their bodies, learn new self-care habits, and build community as they engaged in the workshops. Over the course of the study, the participants' symptoms of PTSD and psychological distress lessened. There were no changes in heart rate variability. This complex study was successfully completed during a global pandemic and resulted in improvements in some mental health symptoms and overall well-being. Given the importance of this work with intimate partner violence survivors, further work exploring dance/movement workshops for participants virtually and in-person is needed.","Ãƒâ€“zÃƒÂ¼merzifon, Ross, Brinza, Gibney, Garber","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.887827","20220620","PTSD; dance; domestic violence; intimate partner violence; mental health; physical activity; stress; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33140,""

However, healthcare workers soon had to face new challenges at a time when the national health system was working hard to recover. This study focuses on this difficult period to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Italian healthcare workers. Healthcare workers from all Italian regions [<i>n</i> = 5,502] completed an online questionnaire during the reopening phase after the first wave lockdown. We assessed a set of individual-level factors (e.g., stigma and violence against HCWs) and a set of workplace-level factors (e.g., trust in the workplace capacity to handle COVID-19) that were especially relevant in this context. The primary outcomes assessed were score Ã¢â€°Â¥15 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and score Ã¢â€°Â¥4 on the General Health Questionnaire-12, indicators of clinically significant depressive symptoms and psychological distress, respectively. Logistic regression analyses were performed on depressive symptoms and psychological distress for each individual- and workplace-level factor adjusting for gender, age, and profession. Clinically significant depressive symptoms were observed in 7.5% and psychological distress in 37.9% of HCWs. 30.5% of healthcare workers reported having felt stigmatized or discriminated, while 5.7% reported having experienced violence. Feeling stigmatized or discriminated and experiencing violence due to being a healthcare worker were strongly associated with clinically significant depressive symptoms [OR 2.98, 95%CI 2.36-3.77 and OR 4.72 95%CI 3.41-6.54] and psychological distress [OR 2.30, 95%CI 2.01-2.64 and OR 2.85 95%CI 2.16-3.75]. Numerous workplace-level factors, e.g., trust in the workplace capacity to handle COVID-19 [OR 2.43, 95%CI 1.92-3.07] and close contact with a co-worker who died of COVID-19 [OR 2.05, 95%CI 1.56-2.70] were also associated with clinically significant depressive symptoms. Similar results were found for psychological distress. Our study emphasizes the need to address discrimination and violence against healthcare professionals and improve healthcare work environments to strengthen the national health system's capacity to manage future emergencies.","Moro, Calamandrei, Poli, Di Mattei, Perra, Kurotschka, Restrepo, Romano, La Torre, Preti, Mascayano, Picardi, Chiarotti, Rapisarda, Urban, Alvarado, Susser, Carta","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.867080","20220620","COVID-19; Italy; depression; healthcare workers; mental health; psychological distress; stigma; violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33141,""
"Virtual Clinical Listening Groups for Psychological Intervention With University Students in the COVID-19 Pandemic","The pandemic has affected people's mental health and university students are considered one of the most vulnerable groups, encouraging the development of psychological interventions that can minimize the suffering and illness of this public. Among the possibilities of intervention, virtual clinical listening groups were created which, during the period of social isolation, had the purpose of opening up a listening space for university students suffering from emotional distress. The focus of the group meetings was how university students were experiencing the pandemic, as well as the consequences of this experience. In this article, we discuss virtual clinical listening groups as a form of psychological intervention in the mental health care of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic at a university in northeastern Brazil. This is a qualitative study that began with 274 university students and 5 psychologists who facilitated the listening groups. We used as instruments the registration forms, the participation records of the virtual clinical listening groups and the field diaries written by the facilitators after each meeting. We described in the results the collected data and, from the field diaries, the themes that emerged in the various meetings were listed and analyzed in dialogue with the literature. At the end of the psychological screening process, 117 students participated in the 17 organized groups, with an average of 8 university students per group. Among the main motivations for participating in virtual clinical listening groups, we highlight: the desire to share experiences, a search for control of anxiety, depression and stress, care for mental health, a willingness to promote listening to psychological support for themselves and for others, and self-knowledge. We discuss the nuances in the process of forming the listening groups and the characteristics of the participants, as well as a central element of the group process, which is the establishment of bonds and mutual help among the participants. Feeling vulnerable and the fear of contamination is an element of suffering and, above all, of stress experienced by university students. The group presented itself as an alternative of mutual care in the pandemic context.","Bloc, de AraÃƒÂºjo, Leite, Barreto, Carneiro, Melo, Boris, Moreira","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.772698","20220620","COVID-19; listening groups; mental health; psychological intervention; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33142,""
"Internet gaming disorder in an adolescent during the COVID-19 pandemic: a case report","The internet has become an indispensable tool in peopleÃ‚Â´s daily lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. Internet and video game use are experiencing rapid growth in the youth and adult populations as a major source of entertainment. However, excessive gaming may cause addiction and negatively impact mental health, entailing low psychosocial well-being, poor social skills, and decreased academic achievement. We report the case of a 16-year-old student with a ""typical"" pattern of internet gaming disorder (IGD) developed during the pandemic, which improved after weeks of treatment with pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions.

"Employment and disability among young Australians and associations with psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic","Emerging global data indicates that the employment status and mental health of young people is being adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little research has focused on young people with disabilities, despite their lower pre-pandemic employment rates and poorer mental health. We quantified the association between employment status and mental health among young Australians, and tested for effect modification by disability status. Linear regression analysis of Wave 9 (October-December 2020) of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) assessing the association between employment status (employed, unemployed) on psychological distress (Kessler-10) and including an interaction term for employment status and disability. The association between employment status and psychological distress differed by disability status. Young adults with disabilities had higher adjusted mean K10 scores indicating greater psychological distress both when they were employed (mean 22.99, 95% CI 21.41, 24.58) and unemployed (mean 29.19, 95% CI 25.36, 33.03) compared to their peers without disabilities (employed mean 18.72, 95% CI 17.75, 19.70; unemployed mean 20.45, 95% CI 18.60, 22.29). Young Australians in general may benefit from additional supports to improve their employment and mental health outcomes. Young people with disabilities may particularly benefit from targeted supports to gain and maintain employment and improve mental health.","Shields, Spittal, Dimov, Kavanagh, King","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2022.101140","20220620","COVID-19 pandemic; Disability; Employment; Mental health; Psychological distress; Young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33144,""
"The impact of COVID-19 measures on parent-reported restricted and repetitive behaviours in pre-school children with autism","COVID-19 restrictive measures have had a considerable impact on daily life routines, which may be especially challenging for families of children with autism. In pre-schoolers with autism, it is likely that the disruption of routines mainly impacts the presence of restrictive and repetitive behaviours (RRBs). Furthermore, influence of comorbid conditions, secondary behavioural difficulties and home environment characteristics on RRBs was explored. A cross-sectional online survey design was used to collect parent-report data on 254 children with autism (2.5-6 years) during lockdown in the early months of the pandemic. RRBs were assessed using the Repetitive Behaviour Scale-Revised (RBS-R). Parents reported a significant increase in stereotypic, self-injurious, compulsive and ritualistic behaviour, and restricted interests after implementation of COVID-19 restrictions. The presence of a co-occurring condition, such as language impairments or intellectual disability, was associated with more self-injurious and stereotypic behaviour. However, there was no effect of home environment on RRB's. Further, most children showed increases in internalising and/or externalising behaviour. Increased inattentive behaviour was associated with more ritualistic and stereotypic behaviour, and restricted interests. Decreases in hyperactivity were related to more restricted interests. Importantly, in a subset of children, parents reported less behavioural difficulties during the lockdown. Findings highlight the importance of flexible implementation and continuity of care for pre-schoolers with autism and support for parents. Further follow-up of children with autism and RRBs, and co-occurring behavioural difficulties is needed and could enhance our understanding of the long-term effects associated with sudden restrictive measures to daily routines.","Boterberg, Zanatta, Moerman, Schaubroeck, Siew, De Schryver, Roeyers","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09727","20220620","Autism; COVID-19 Pandemic; Pre-school Children; Restricted and Repetitive Behaviours (RRBs)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33145,""
"Medical Scribe Impact on Provider Efficiency in Outpatient Radiation Oncology Clinics Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Purpose/Objectives:</b> Medical documentation has become increasingly challenging for providers, particularly with changes to telemedicine visit formats during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Medical scribes may help mitigate this burden. Our objective was to determine how scribes affect provider efficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Materials/Methods:</b> Providers completed a survey in February 2020 (S1, prepandemic) and 1 year into the COVID-19 pandemic in February 2021 (S2, during pandemic). S1 evaluated perceived impact of scribes on clerical work, medical documentation, and efficiency during office visits using the Likert scale. S2 also addressed scribe use during telemedicine visits. Provider time spent on documentation with or without a scribe was evaluated using a five-level ordinal scale. Provider response was assessed using descriptive frequency statistics. Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables. Analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). All tests were two sided with an alpha level of 0.05. <b>Results:</b> Fifty-eight providers responded to the surveys: 36 (62%) for S1 and 22 (38%) for S2. Scribe use decreased perceived clerical work and facilitated chart review, and recording of physical examination findings, note documentation, and improved efficiency, both before and during the pandemic (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.5, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.7, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.8, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.8, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.9, respectively). Scribe use significantly decreased time to complete documentation prepandemic (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002) and during the pandemic for both in-person (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001) and telemedicine visits (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0004). More providers took &gt;60Ã¢â‚¬â€°min to complete medical documentation without the use of a scribe prepandemic (72% vs. 30% with a scribe, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006) and during the pandemic, after both in-person (40% vs. 0% with a scribe, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002) and telemedicine visits (35% vs. 0% with a scribe, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002). <b>Conclusions:</b> Scribe use decreases provider time spent on medical documentation and improves overall efficiency before and during the COVID-19 pandemic for both in-person and telemedicine visits.

"The moderating effect of COVID-19 stress on school racial climate and parent and child mental well-being","The deleterious and racially disparate health outcomes of COVID-19 have been on full display since the pandemic began in the United States; however, less exploration has been dedicated to understanding short- and long-term mental health outcomes for U.S. parents and their children as a result of COVID's impact on schooling. This cross-sectional study examined U.S. parents perspectives on COVID-19 stress as a moderating influence on the relationship between perceptions of school racial climate (i.e., intergroup interactions and campus racial socialization) and parent and child mental health outcomes. Participants were recruited from <i>Prolific's</i> online survey platform and included a sample of 397 U.S. parents (52% female, average age 40, 74% White) with a child between the ages of 6 and 17, enrolled in a K-12 public school setting during the 2020-2021 academic year. The results revealed that COVID-19 stress moderated the relationship between parents' perceptions of campus racial socialization and parent mental well-being. Parents who reported either low, moderate, or high levels of COVID-19 stress had improved mental health when racial socialization in their child's school was high. This impact was greater for parents with high levels of COVID-19 stress than with low levels of COVID-19 stress. However, parents' perceptions of COVID-19 stress did not moderate the relationship between school racial climate factors and child behavioral and emotional problems. Findings have important implications which are discussed.","Eugene, Blalock, Robinson, Crutchfield","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2022.106572","20220620","COVID-19 stress; Child and adolescent mental health; Parent mental well-being; School racial climate","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33147,""
"The Well-Being of Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has turned into a global healthcare challenge, causing significant morbidity and mortality.Healthcare workers (HCWs)Ã‚Â who are on the frontline of the COVID-19 outbreak response face an increased risk of contracting the disease. Some common challenges encountered by HCWs include exposure to the pathogen, psychological distress, and long working hours. In addition, HCWs may be more prone to develop mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sleep disorders, and drug addictions compared to the general population. These issues arise from increased job stress, fear of spreading the disease to loved ones, and potential discrimination or stigma associated with the disease. This study aims to review the current literature to explore the effects of COVID-19 on healthcare providers' physical and mental well-being and suggest interventional strategies to combat these issues.

"Different Impacts of COVID-19 on Quality of Therapy, Psychological Condition, and Work Life Among Occupational Therapists in Physical and Mental Health Fields","The negative impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have worsened the quality of therapy, psychological condition, and work life of second-line healthcare workers and occupational therapists (OTs). However, no study has investigated whether the impact of COVID-19 varies among OTs working in different fields. This study aimed to investigate the differences on the impact of COVID-19 between OTs in the physical and mental health fields. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Japan between January 20 and January 25, 2021. A total of 4,418 registered OTs who were members of the Japanese Association of Occupational Therapists volunteered for this study. After screening using the exclusion criteria, 1,383 participants were classified into two groups based on their field (mental health and physical health), and their quality of therapy, psychological condition, and work life were analyzed. OTs in the mental health field showed a greater decrease in therapy quality and increase in workload and a lower rate of decrease in working hours than those in the physical health field. In the multinomial logistic regression analysis, decreased and increased therapy quality and decreased therapy quality were significantly associated with depression in the physical health field, and decreased therapy quality was associated with insomnia in the mental health field. Furthermore, insomnia and anxiety were commonly associated with increased workload and working hours, respectively, in both fields, whereas anxiety and depression were associated with increased workload only in the physical health field. These results demonstrate that COVID-19 differently impacted quality of treatment, workload, work time, and psychological condition in the physical and mental health fields; moreover, the relationships among these are different in these two fields. These results highlight the importance of investigating the field-specific negative impacts of COVID-19 on OTs and may provide helpful information for devising tailored and effective prevention and intervention strategies to address these challenges.","Sawamura, Ito, Miyaguchi, Nakamura, Ishioka","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.887069","20220621","COVID-19; healthcare worker; mental health; occupational therapy; psychological condition; therapy quality; work life; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Mental Health; Occupational Therapists; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33153,""
"Application of Telemedicine in COVID-19: A Bibliometric Analysis","Telemedicine as a tool that can reduce potential disease spread and fill a gap in healthcare has been increasingly applied during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many studies have summarized telemedicine's technologies or the diseases' applications. However, these studies were reviewed separately. There is a lack of a comprehensive overview of the telemedicine technologies, application areas, and medical service types. We aimed to investigate the research direction of telemedicine at COVID-19 and to clarify what kind of telemedicine technology is used in what diseases, and what medical services are provided by telemedicine. Publications addressing telemedicine in COVID-19 were retrieved from the PubMed database. To extract bibliographic information and do a bi-clustering analysis, we used Bicomb and gCLUTO. The co-occurrence networks of diseases, technology, and healthcare services were then constructed and shown using R-studio and the Gephi tool. We retrieved 5,224 research papers on telemedicine at COVID-19 distributed among 1460 journals. Most articles were published in <i>the Journal of Medical Internet Research</i> (166/5,224, 3.18%). The United States published the most articles on telemedicine. The research clusters comprised 6 clusters, which refer to mental health, mhealth, cross-infection control, and self-management of diseases. The network analysis revealed a triple relation with diseases, technologies, and health care services with 303 nodes and 5,664 edges.

A total of 232 frontline nurses responded to 79 items in four domains (stressors, physio-psychosocial symptoms, coping, and support) between May 6, 2020, and June 30, 2020. A two-way ANOVA, regression analysis, and mediation of effects were used to analyze the data. This study found that both social support and use of coping strategies contributed to the reduction of physio-psychosocial symptoms. Differences were found in how older frontline nurses perceived the efficacy of social support and certain coping strategies. This study provides further evidence of the importance of organizational support in addressing the harmful physio-psychosocial symptoms experienced by nurses.","Ali, Fatemi, Ali, Hamasha, Hamasha","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.839600","20220621","COVID-19; coping strategies; nursing staff; social support; supervisor support; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Pandemics; Social Support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33155,""
"Neurological and Psychological Characteristics of Young Nitrous Oxide Abusers and Its Underlying Causes During the COVID-19 Lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic has a serious impact on the mental health of the public due to its economic and social impact. And psychological effects have led to drug and alcohol abuse. After the city lifted the lockdown, we consecutively encountered several young nitrous oxide abusers admitted to hospital for neurological treatment. To inform physician decisions and social intervention, this observational study aimed at investigating the neurological and psychological characteristics of nitrous oxide abusers and its underlying causes during the COVID-19 lockdown. The nitrous oxide abusers who sought neurological treatment at our hospital between May 2020 and June 2020 were enrolled. Clinical data including socio-demographic, physical examination, laboratory examination, electromyography and neuroimaging were collected. Their motivations for inhaling nitrous oxide, knowledge about the nitrous oxide abuse and the accompanying of family were investigated face to face. Psychological status was assessed by the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) psychological evaluation. Six nitrous oxide abusers were enrolled and the age was 22 Ã‚Â± 4.3. Clinical presentations included varying degrees of limb numbness and an ataxic gait. Laboratory examination revealed that all the patients did not have pernicious anemia, 4 patients had decreased vitamin B12 while 3 patients exhibited elevated homocysteine levels. MR of the spinal cord revealed that 4 patients had abnormal signals in the cervical spinal cord of high symmetry with splayed or inverted V sign after T2WI. Electromyogram (EMG) test showed 5 patients had peripheral nerve damage. The SCL-90 psychological evaluation results indicated that all patients had severe anxiety, depression and psychosis and they had severer psychological problems than ordinary citizens. Their motives for inhaling nitrous oxide are to relieve boredom, curiosity and buddy pressure. Their family spent &lt;1 day per week to stay with them during city lockdown. The enrolled patients caused by abuse of nitrous oxide presented with symptoms of subacute combined with spinal degeneration. They had more serious psychological problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These cases make us value the psychological problems of young people under the outbreak and take multi-layered measures from families, schools (companies), hospitals, and governments to address it.","Wu, Wang, Wang, Han, Yu, Feng, Wang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.854977","20220621","COVID-19; neurological; nitrous oxide; psychological; subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord; Adolescent; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Nitrous Oxide; Pandemics; Vitamin B 12","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33156,""
"Are Malaysians Ready to Resume the New Norm? Findings From a Nationwide Study","The study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practices toward the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the public in Malaysia. A cross-sectional study was conducted online among the general public in Malaysia from June 2020 to August 2020 between the second and third wave (Phase 3 of the Recovery Movement Control Order). Participants were conveniently recruited through multiple social media platforms to encourage nationwide participation. A patient-administered questionnaire was used to assess their knowledge, attitude, and practice toward the prevention of COVID-19. For descriptive analysis, percentage, mean, and standard deviation (SD) were used to report demographic characteristics and knowledge, attitude, and practice scores. For inferential analysis, <i>t</i>-test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, Spearman's correlation, Chi-square test, and Binary Logistic Regression was used to analyze the study variables' differentiation, association, and correlations. The confidence interval selected for this study was 95%. A total of 420 respondents participated in this survey. The majority of the participants (<i>n</i> = 412, 98%) were aware of COVID-19. Most participants (60%) learned about the pandemic through social media. About half of the participants had poor knowledge (45.5%) and a negative attitude (43.3%). Participants residing in urban areas showed good preventive practices as compared to those residing in rural areas (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). There was a significant association between participants' attitudes and preventive practices toward COVID-19, where the majority of the participants (57.4%) who showed negative attitudes were more likely to follow poor preventive practices. Despite having good knowledge, participants with a negative attitude toward COVID-19 were less likely to follow the preventive practices of COVID-19. People's mindset and willingness may play an important role to influence their practices. Thus, these are the vulnerable groups, and strategies should be made to change their mindset through proper counseling and education.","Suet, Farrukh, Qi, Saleem, Salman, Ur Rahman, Goh, Ming","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.823047","20220621","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; cross-sectional survey; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33157,""
"The Eudemonic Wellbeing of Volunteers in a Public Health Emergency: COVID-19 in China","With improvements in the public awareness regarding volunteer opportunities, more people are participating in social work, particularly during emergency events. The mental health of volunteers has been attracting more academic attention due to its increasing social significance. Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behavior, a qualitative interview was conducted to identify important attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control factors guiding people's volunteering behaviors in an emergency context. Then, a sequential quantitative survey was implemented based on the results of the qualitative study to explore the impact of the aforementioned factors and job involvement on eudemonic well-being. The moderating role of empathy in these relationships was also investigated in this nested design. The results indicate that behavioral attitudes, perceived control, and job involvement have significant positive effects on volunteers' eudemonic well-being. A high perspective taking (cognitive empathy) of volunteers positively moderates the relationship between job involvement and eudemonic well-being, while high personal distress (affective empathy) buffers this relationship. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed in relation to emergency volunteer activities.","Tang, Li, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.903147","20220620","empathy; eudemonic wellbeing; job involvement; public health emergency; volunteer","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33158,""
"Children's Mental Health During the First Two Years of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Burden, Risk Factors and Posttraumatic Growth - A Mixed-Methods Parents' Perspective","The COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying containment measures such as physical distancing and school closures led to major changes in children's everyday lives. By means of a mixed-methods study, the ""Tyrolean COVID-19 Children's Study"" investigated the effects of the pandemic and factors influencing mental health and health-related quality of life of North Tyrolean (Austria) and South Tyrolean (Italy) children aged 3-13 years. Parents filled out <i>N</i> = 2,691 online questionnaires (951 preschool children: 3-6 years; 1,740 schoolchildren: 7-13 years) at four measurement time points (March 2020, December 2020, June 2021, December 2021). For both age groups, children's mental health outcomes (internalising problems, posttraumatic stress symptoms) were worse in December 2021 (t4) than children's mental health outcomes in March 2020 (t1). With regard to aggressive behaviour, this difference was only found among schoolchildren. Thematic analysis of an open ended, written question revealed the following positive changes in children during the Corona crisis: (1) the importance of intra- and extra-familial relationships, (2) new competences and experiences, (3) values and virtues, (4) use of time, and (5) family strength. Using multilevel modelling, threat experience, economic disruption, and perceived posttraumatic growth were shown to be the strongest predictors of all outcomes. Additionally, male gender was shown to be a predictor of aggressive behaviour. In terms of age, schoolchildren showed more internalising problems, aggressive behaviour, and threat experience than preschool children. With regard to time, parents in December 2021 reported more threat experience in older children and less perceived posttraumatic growth in both older and younger children, than parents at the beginning of the pandemic. Targeted support for vulnerable children may prevent longer-term development of psychopathologies and contribute to society's psychosocial resilience in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, sustainable promotion of children's posttraumatic growth can also contribute to children's mental health and could even offer a chance to turn the crisis into an opportunity.","Wenter, Schickl, Sevecke, Juen, Exenberger","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.901205","20220620","COVID-19; children; mental health; posttraumatic growth; psychiatric symptoms; quality of life; risk factors; threat experience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33159,""
"Influence of COVID-19 quarantine on the health of adults with mild cognitive impairment","COVID-19 is an infectious disease declared by the World Health Organization as a public health emergency of international concern. The objective of this article was to determine the physical, psychological, and social health conditions and mood of COVID-19 quarantine in adults with mild cognitive impairment. The sample consisted of 129 participants, most of them were healthy, but some have mild cognitive impairment. The data were collected with a questionnaire and the Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale applied through phone calls from April to June 2020. Statistically significant differences were found in the changes in sleep habits of the healthy participants (p=0.018). Intragroup comparisons of the Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale in healthy participants were significant (p=0.010) and at the intergroup level before and after quarantine showed significant differences in pretest scores (p=0.003).

"The Difference in Learning Activities of Postgraduate Students of Different Qualification Types Under the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multi-Group Latent Class Analysis","There are two types of master's qualifications in China. One is the academic qualification that pays more attention to academic research, aiming to cultivate research-oriented talents; while the other is the application-oriented qualification that focuses more on practical ability, aiming to cultivate applied-oriented talents. The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of the COVID-19 on the learning activities of postgraduate students, as well as the differences in the extent to which the learning activities of postgraduate students of different qualification types are affected and their mental health status. A self-constructed scale for the pandemic's impact on master's students, the self-rating anxiety scale and the self-rating depression scale were applied in the study. The single- and multi-group latent class analyses were used to investigate the impact of the pandemic on postgraduate students of different qualification types. A total of 2818 responses were collected. The single-group latent class analysis identified four classes. The multi-group latent class analysis showed that no absolute homogeneity existed between different groups. In general, the number of academic master's students affected was greater than application-oriented master's students. Application-oriented master's students were more affected by course activities, while academic master's students were more affected by academic and social activities. Results show that individuals more affected had higher levels of anxiety and depression. Compared to course activities, impacts on social activities were more likely to cause anxiety and depression. Universities can provide a more flexible way of assistance to different qualification types of postgraduate students. Furthermore, social activities play an important role in the mental health of postgraduate students. Therefore, under the background of normalization of pandemic prevention and control, schools should pay more attention to students' interpersonal communication activities to help relieve students' anxiety, depression, and other negative emotions.","Liang, Wang, Zhang, He, Quan, Yi","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S358118","20220620","COVID-19 pandemic; academic postgraduate students; application-oriented postgraduate students; learning activities; multi-group latent class analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33161,""
"Supporting the productivity and wellbeing of remote workers: Lessons from COVID-19","We examine the survey responses of 278 individuals who transitioned from the workplace to working from home (WFH) as a result of the Covid 19 pandemic to understand how individuals' attainment of productivity in work and meaning in life are affected by WFH. We also assess their perceived stress and health challenges experienced since WFH. On average, workers perceive that productivity and meaning changed in opposite directions with the shift to WFH-productivity increased while the meaning derived from daily activities decreased. Stress was reduced while health problems increased. By investigating these changes, we identify important common sources of support and friction associated with remote work that affect multiple dimensions of work and life. For example, personal fortitude is an important source of support, and the intrusion of work into life is an important friction. Our findings lead to concrete recommendations for both organizational leaders and workers in setting key priorities for supporting remote work.","George, Atwater, Maneethai, Madera","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orgdyn.2021.100869","20220620","Covid 19; Productivity; Remote work; Stress; Wellbeing; Working from home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33162,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on brain and psychological health, its possible mechanisms, and coping strategies","COVID-19 pandemic has been depicted to possess a robust association with psychological disorders. SARS-CoV-2 is the most recent virus of the coronavirus family and has the potential to bind the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) receptor. The receptor is majorly present peripherally and up to some extent in the brain. Different psychological and neurodegenerative disorders can arise due to the peripheral origin of destruction. These triggers could be inflammatory pathways releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines reaching the brain and causing neuroinflammation. In continuation with traditional viruses, SARS-CoV-2 too might lead to brain diseases like meningitis, encephalitis, etc. Besides, several peripheral hormonal changes like cortisol can influence neurochemical alterations, thereby inflicting mood-related activities and psychological phenomenon. In this regard, health care workers, frontline line worriers, family and relatives of COVID-19 patients can be the secondary victims; however, patients with COVID-19 themselves remain the primary ones prone to neurological health problems. Several strategies like socialization, engagement, physical activity, etc. are well-opted measures to get relief from and check the psychiatric disturbances. The worth of this review can be attributed to the understanding of brain-related mechanisms of COVID-19 in the context of its mechanism of action to create the pathology pertaining to brain disorder, precisely psychological devastation. Likewise, its epidemiological relevance has concisely been mentioned. Furthermore, different categories and classes of people prone to psychological deterioration are briefly elaborated. Lastly, some coping strategies and approaches to minimize or combat mental health problems have been discussed.","Simnani, Singh, Choudhury, Akhtar","https://doi.org/10.2174/1872208316666220617110402","20220620","ACE receptor; COVID-19; Cortisol; Neuroinflammation; Psychological disorders; SARS-COV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33163,""

"Amplifying patient voices amid pandemic: Perspectives on tracheostomy care, communication, and connection","To investigate perspectives of patients, family members, caregivers (PFC), and healthcare professionals (HCP) on tracheostomy care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The cross-sectional survey investigating barriers and facilitators to tracheostomy care was collaboratively developed by patients, family members, nurses, speech-language pathologists, respiratory care practitioners, physicians, and surgeons. The survey was distributed to the Global Tracheostomy Collaborative's learning community, and responses were analyzed. Survey respondents (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 191) from 17 countries included individuals with a tracheostomy (85 [45Ã‚Â %]), families/caregivers (43 [22Ã‚Â %]), and diverse HCP (63 [33.0Ã‚Â %]). Overall, 94Ã‚Â % of respondents reported concern that patients with tracheostomy were at increased risk of critical illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19; 93Ã‚Â % reported fear or anxiety. With respect to prioritization of care, 38Ã‚Â % of PFC versus 16Ã‚Â % of HCP reported concern that patients with tracheostomies might not be valued or prioritized (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.002). Respondents also differed in fear of contracting COVID-19 (69Ã‚Â % PFC vs. 49Ã‚Â % HCP group, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.009); concern for hospitalization (55.5Ã‚Â % PFC vs. 27Ã‚Â % HCP, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001); access to medical personnel (34Ã‚Â % PFC vs. 14Ã‚Â % HCP, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.005); and concern about canceled appointments (62Ã‚Â % PFC vs. 41Ã‚Â % HCP, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.01). Respondents from both groups reported severe stress and fatigue, sleep deprivation, lack of breaks, and lack of support (70Ã‚Â % PFC vs. 65Ã‚Â % HCP, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.54).

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicides: A population study","This study examines the factors associated with the change in the number of suicides per month during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2019 to 2021. For economic indicators, employment and unemployment rates, Consumer Price Index, and Consumer Sentiment Index were used. As inverse indicators of social distancing, the numbers of overseas departures, domestic trips, and movie audience were used. The monthly numbers of inpatients and outpatients for depression were included to consider the effect of the prevalence of depression. Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis and a linear regression were conducted. There was a continued decrease in the number of suicides of 1.7% in 2021 from 2020 following the 4.4% decrease in the previous year. The employment rate was positively associated with the number of suicides for males, while the consumer price index was negatively associated with the number of suicides for females. While the inverse social distancing measures were positively correlated with the number of suicides, no significant association was observed in the regression analysis. Commonly shared thoughts that the pandemic would lead to an increase in suicides by its direct negative impact on mental health or indirect impact through the aggravation of economic conditions and social distancing need to be re-examined.","Kim","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114663","20220622","COVID-19; Consumer Price Index; Consumer Sentiment Index; Depression; Employment; Pandemic; Social distancing; Suicide; Unemployment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33166,""

"Psychology Internship Training Amidst COVID-19: Balancing Training Opportunities, Patient Care, and Risk of Exposure","The emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has dramatically altered how psychologists deliver its training. At least for the time being, virtual care has become the primary method for delivering mental health services. This has allowed patients and clinicians to continue to access and provide services in a way that would have been impossible years ago. Not only has this shift impacted patients, but it has also impacted supervision and training. The impact has been especially profound on inpatient units where the psychiatric and medical acuity is high of patients and the therapeutic milieu is an important aspectÃ‚Â of treatment. The purpose of this paper is to review the impact of COVID-19 on pre-doctoral psychology interns during their rotation on an inpatient psychiatry unit at the start of the pandemic (January to June of 2020) and use these experiences to onboard the next class of interns in the new academic year (July 2020 to June 2021) using a hybrid model of in-person and virtual training experiences. At the end of 2020/2021 rotation, we voluntarily asked interns to complete a questionnaire that was developed based on the qualitative experiences of the previous class to assess the effectiveness of this hybrid model. We also surveyed multi-disciplinary staff members who were essential personnel and required to work in person during this time about their experiences of safety and support. With this information, we explore and offer guidance to other inpatient training sites who are likely to encounter similar challenges during this time. In particular, we discuss the integration of virtual technology into this training experience, as well as the restructuring of clinical and supervisory experiences. We highlighted several short-term strategies that we have flexibly adapted to our inpatient unit. The lessons learned herein seek to guide supervisors and trainees alike in adapting their psychology training programs to meet the evolving demands of COVID-19.","Stein, O'Keefe, Mace, Foley, White, Ruchensky, Curtiss, Moran, Evans, Beck","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10880-022-09890-9","20220618","COVID-19; Inpatient psychiatry; Psychology internship; Telemental health; Training; Virtual care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33168,""
"Barriers to COVID-19 vaccination among older adults in Mexico City","Vaccines are effective to reduce COVID-19 related outcomes, but universal vaccination campaigns can reveal within-country access inequities. Mexico City has had high rates of COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality and a population survey warned that vaccine acceptance was lowest in older adults. Since February 2021, Mexico started a universal and free vaccination campaign prioritizing older adults. By April 17, every older adult in Mexico City had been eligible to receive the first dose. A week later, we conducted a telephone survey representative of older adults residing in Mexico City (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°503). We asked if they received their first dose and, if they haven't, we followed-up with an open question to register their reasons. In addition to sociodemographic characteristics and food insecurity, we also inquired about vaccine hesitancy, health concerns related to COVID-19, self-rated health, comorbidities, frailty, and depression. The objective of the study was to identify the main barriers to receive the first dose of the vaccine. We estimated descriptive statistics and logistic regression models. Results show that 7.6% of older adults in Mexico City did not receive their first dose. Barriers for not receiving it were vaccine hesitancy (60.4%), not having COVID-19 health concerns (46.4%), poor self-rated health (46.7%), a previous diagnosis of depression (35.7%), low socioeconomic status (65.4%), and household food insecurity (59.8%). Responses to the open question clustered in four themes: misinformation about the process (30%), distrust of the vaccine (24%), personal health problems (24%), and difficulties to get an appointment (22%). Logistic regression models adjusted for vaccine hesitancy and revealed two distinct reasons for not having their first dose: 1) vaccine hesitancy and misinformation on COVID-19, and 2) household food insecurity. Reaching these two groups requires active and differentiated public-health measures; the first with additional information from trusted sources, and the second by facilitating vaccination in neighborhoods with high levels of food insecurity and informal labor, where missing a day's work is a strong disincentive. Vaccination campaigns need an equity lens to reach universal coverage; ensuring full access demands thorough and carefully tailored new interventions.","GaitÃƒÂ¡n-Rossi, Mendez-Rosenzweig, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Alberto, Vilar-Compte","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-022-01685-6","20220621","COVID-19; Food insecurity; Health inequities; Older adults; Vaccine hesitancy; Aged; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Mexico; Vaccination; Vaccines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33169,""
"Examining telehealth use among primary care patients, providers, and clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic","At the onset of COVID-19, there was a rapid expansion of telehealth (video/telephone) visits to maintain delivery of primary care (PC) services at the Veterans Health Administration (VA). This study examines patient, provider, and site-level characteristics of any virtual and video-based care in PC. Interrupted time series (ITS) design was conducted using VA administrative/clinical, electronic healthcare data, 12-months before and 12-months after COVID-19 onset (set at March 2020) at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (GLA), between 2019 and 2021. Patients with at least one visit to a VA PC clinic at GLA (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°547,730 visits) were included in the analysis. The two main outcomes for this study were 1) any telehealth (versus in-person), as well as 2) video-based care (versus telephone). For the ITS analysis, segmented logistic regression on repeated monthly observations of any telehealth and video-based care was used. Percent telehealth and video use increased from 13.9 to 63.1%, and 0.3 to 11.3%, respectively, before to after COVID-19 onset. According to adjusted percentages, GLA community-based clinics (37.7%, versus 29.8% in hospital-based clinics, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), social workers/pharmacists/dietitians (53.7%, versus 34.0% for PC clinicians, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and minority groups, non-Hispanic African Americans (36.3%) and Hispanics (34.4%, versus 35.3% for Whites, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) were more likely to use telephone than video. Conversely, mental health providers (43.3%) compared to PC clinicians (15.3%), and women (for all age groups, except 75+) compared to men, were more likely to use video than telephone (all p'sÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Since telehealth care provision is likely to continue after COVID-19, additional research is needed to identify which PC outpatient services are better suited for telephone (e.g., case management) versus video-based care (e.g., integrated mental health visits). Additionally, it is important to understand how all clinics can systematically increase access to both telephone- and video-based PC services, while ensuring equitable care for all patient populations.","Der-Martirosian, Chu, Steers, Wyte-Lake, Balut, Dobalian, Heyworth, Paige, Leung","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-022-01738-3","20220621","Primary Care; Telehealth; US Veterans Health Admininstration; Veterans; Video-Based Care; COVID-19; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Primary Health Care; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33170,""
"Metacognitive beliefs, maladaptive coping strategies, and depressive symptoms: A two-wave network study of the COVID-19 lockdown and reopening","To address the increased levels of depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 and other pandemics, it is useful to identify the psychological processes that may explain the relationship between pandemic-related stressors and symptoms. In this study, both the combined network of metacognitions and maladaptive coping strategies-derived from the metacognitive therapy model-and the depressive symptoms were studied during the COVID-19 related lockdown and the partial reopening of the Norwegian society about 3 months later. In an online survey, 4936 participants responded at both these time points. They completed the Cognitive Attentional Syndrome-1 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The combined process and symptom networks were estimated. The maladaptive coping strategies worry/rumination, avoidance, and thought suppression and the symptoms depressed mood and worthlessness showed both high strength centrality at the lockdown and, at least, moderate correlations between their change and overall symptom change from the lockdown to the reopening. None of the metacognitive beliefs attained these criteria. From the lockdown to the reopening, no change in strength centrality was observed. The network structure, however, was significantly different across the periods and several different connections (edge weights) between variables were revealed. For instance, low energy showed a stronger connection to anhedonia and a weaker connection to sleep problems during the reopening than during the lockdown. In conclusion, worry/rumination, avoidance, and thought suppression may maintain central depressive symptoms such as depressed mood and worthlessness during the COVID-19 pandemic. These propositions are actionable as they give access to well-established interventions.","Hoffart, Johnson, Ebrahimi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.06.008","20220622","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Maladaptive coping strategies; Metacognitions; Network analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33171,""
"Can an online expressive writing program support people with inflammatory bowel disease? A feasibility randomised controlled trial","We explored feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of an online writing intervention (WriteforIBD) against an active control condition for distress in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. A feasibility RCT was conducted in 19 adults (89.5% female, aged 20-69 years) with IBD and mild-moderate distress. Participants allocated to the WriteForIBD group completed a 4-day 30-min writing program adapted for IBD. The active control group wrote about trivial topics provided by researchers. Feasibility was established based on the recruitment and retention while acceptability based on completion rates and a numeric rating scale. All participants completed measures of mental health and disease activity before and after the intervention (one week) and at follow-up three months after the study commencement. The retention rate in the study was high (100% WriteForIBD; 82% control). All participants attended every session. 84.2% of participants were satisfied with the intervention. All participants reported a significant improvement in IBD-Control immediately after the intervention; F (2, 33.7)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 7.641, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .002. A significant interaction of group*time for resilience was noted, R<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.19, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001, with the active control group reporting a significant decline in resilience from the first follow-up to three months while no significant change in resilience for the WriteForIBD group was recorded. Online expressive writing is potentially feasible and highly acceptable to people with IBD who report distress. Future large-scale trials should explore the intervention that is adapted from this feasibility study.

"Invisible wounds: Suturing the gap between the neurobiology, conventional and emerging therapies for posttraumatic stress disorder","A sharp increase in the prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety, substance use disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has occurred due to the traumatic nature of the persisting COVID-19 global pandemic. PTSD is estimated to occur in up to 25% of individuals following exposure to acute or chronic trauma, and the pandemic has inflicted both forms of trauma on much of the population through both direct physiological attack as well as an inherent upheaval to our sense of safety. However, despite significant advances in our ability to define and apprehend the effects of traumatic events, the neurobiology and neuroanatomical circuitry of PTSD, one of the most severe consequences of traumatic exposure, remains poorly understood. Furthermore, the current psychotherapies or pharmacological options for treatment have limited efficacy, durability, and low adherence rates. Consequently, there is a great need to better understand the neurobiology and neuroanatomy of PTSD and develop novel therapies that extend beyond the current limited treatments. This review summarizes the neurobiological and neuroanatomical underpinnings of PTSD and discusses the conventional and emerging psychotherapies, pharmacological and combined psychopharmacological therapies, including the use of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies and neuromodulatory interventions, for the improved treatment of PTSD and the potential for their wider applications in other neuropsychiatric disorders resulting from traumatic exposure.","Gonda, Dome, Erdelyi-Hamza, Krause, Elek, Sharma, Tarazi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroneuro.2022.05.010","20220618","Neurobiology; PTSD; Pharmacotherapy; Psychedelics; Psychotherapy; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33173,""
"The Significant Value of Sustainable Cosmetics Fragrance in the Spotlight After COVID-19","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought major changes to the world's population. This has led to increased wearing of masks to prevent infectious diseases, which can contribute to exacerbation of stress and the emergence of mental illness due to a physical health crisis. Therefore, this study comprehensively investigated the reasons why cosmetics customers pay attention to sustainable fragrances after COVID-19. This review article is a literature review, and a narrative review approach was used in this study. A total of 598 references were selected from 2004 to 2022 using representative journal search sites such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and RISS. Among them, a total of 39 articles were successfully completed in this study using the PRISMA flowchart in the final stage. has been selected. In this study, by identifying the changes and needs of K-beauty and global cosmetics industry consumers who aspire for sustainable safety amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in bad breath caused by the increase in mask wearing was recognized, and the need for fragrance due to mental health was recognized. Demand is expected to increase. This study tried to change the perception of cosmetic fragrances into safe edible fragrances. Therefore, it is expected to be used as an important marketing material for the global cosmetics market.","Lee, Kwon","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.15166","20220618","COVID-19; Edible plants; Fragrance; Mask; Mental health; Safety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33174,""
"Placental pathology in sudden intrauterine death (SIUD) in SARS-CoV-2-positive oligosymptomatic women","Pregnant women are also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Although an infection of the placenta may be rare, pregnancy may occasionally be affected by intrauterine failure. The knowledge of placental morphology on sudden intrauterine demise is still limited. Fetal and placental tissue of two cases of sudden intrauterine death in the second trimester were analysed morphologically and by immunohistochemistry. One case was evaluated by RT-PCR. Both mothers were tested positive for the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 but were oligosymptomatic for COVID-19. Unexpected sudden intrauterine death (SIUD) occurred at 15Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°2 and 27Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°3Ã‚Â weeks of gestation. One fetus demonstrated an intrauterine growth restriction. No malformations nor inflammatory changes were observed in either fetus on autopsy. In contrast to the placentas, the fetal tissue was negative for SARS-CoV-2 on immunohistochemical and RT-PCR analyses. Macroscopically, the placentas showed an increased consistency with a white, reticular cutting surface covering about 95% of the whole placenta. Only very focal histiocytic chronic intervillositis was noted histologically. Massive perivillous fibrin deposits with extensive necroses of the villous trophoblast were present in more than 90% of the placental tissue. Immunohistochemical staining was strong and diffusely positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the villous trophoblast and rarely within the villous stromal cells. Placental SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR. Sudden intrauterine death may occur in mothers who are oligosymptomatic for COVID-19. Acute placental failure is responsible for SIUD, demonstrated by massive perivillous fibrin deposits and extensive necroses of the villous trophoblast with SARS-CoV-2-positivity based on immunohistochemical staining and RT-PCR. Detailed histopathological examination of placental and fetal tissue is mandatory to verify SARS-CoV-2 and to evaluate the pathogenesis and functionality of this disease.","Horn, KrÃƒÂ¼cken, Hiller, Niedermair, Perac, Pietsch, HÃƒÂ¶hn","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-022-06614-0","20220618","COVID-19; Fibrin deposits; Intrauterine death; Placenta; SARS-CoV-2; Trophoblast","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33175,""
"Young People's Experiences of Death Anxiety and Responses to the Covid-19 Pandemic","Capacity for death awareness and death anxiety in young people has been previously documented but the impact of Covid-19 is not currently known. Therefore, the aim of this study of this study was to explore young people's experiences and responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. Qualitative data was collected from young people via a two-stage process across the United Kingdom: Stage One consisted of an online questionnaire; Stage Two comprised online semi-structured interviews. Responses for Stage One of the study totalled 120 young people; 9 of these were interviewed for Stage Two of the study. Thematic analysis of data identified four themes relating to young people's experiences of the Covid-19 pandemic: death anxiety; mental health; normalising death; and identified support needs. Young people experienced heightened death anxiety due to the pandemic but death also became normalized for them and their mental health was negatively affected.","Hughes, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1177/00302228221109052","20220618","adolescence; death anxiety; interviews; mental health; questionnaire; service development","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","",33176,""
