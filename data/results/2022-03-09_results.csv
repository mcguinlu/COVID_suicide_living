"Clinician Distress and Inappropriate Antibiotic Prescribing for Acute Respiratory Tract Infections: A Retrospective Cohort Study","Background The National Academy of Medicine's 2019 consensus study on clinician burnout identified a need for research evaluating the impact of clinician distress on healthcare quality. We examined the association between clinician distress and the inappropriate use of antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in adult outpatients. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic health record visit data linked to annual wellness surveys administered to all clinicians at Boston Medical Center from May 4 to June 20, 2017, and June 5 to July 6, 2018. We included outpatient visits occurring in Family Medicine (FM), General Internal Medicine (GIM), or the Emergency Department (ED) where an acute RTI for an otherwise healthy adult was listed as a primary diagnosis. We examined the association of clinician depression, anxiety, and burnout with the visit-level odds of a clinician inappropriately prescribing an antibiotic for an acute RTI. Results Out of the 2,187 visits eligible for inclusion, 1668 visits were included in the final sample. Overall, 33.8% and 50.1% of clinicians reported depression/anxiety and burnout symptoms, respectively. Each one standard deviation increase in a clinician's composite depression and anxiety score was associated with a 28% increase (ORÂ =Â 1.28, 95% CI 1.02 â€“ 1.61) in the adjusted odds of an inappropriate antibiotic prescription for an acute RTI. Clinician burnout had no significant association with inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute RTIs. Conclusions Our findings suggest that clinician depression and anxiety may be important indicators of healthcare quality in routine outpatient care.","Brady, Keri J.

"Cyber Risks Awaiting Children and Young People in the 21st Century","According to data of January 2020 reports by We Are Social and Hootsuite, with an increase of 4% since January 2019, Turkey has 62.7 million internet users and 54 million social media users. With regard to children and young people, digitalization offers possibilities for widening learning opportunities, rapid access to information and a liberating way for self-expression and maintaining social connections with family/friends (Borca et al. 2015), but at the same time it exposes them to the dark and dangerous side of digital environment (unsafe internet use, for instance) (Cosma et al. 2020). [...]the present study aims to examine the risks of these digital applications for children and young people, the types of cyber risks resulting in bullying and victimization and the effect of being exposed to these risks on mental health. [...]due to their limited self-regulation capacities and vulnerability to peer pressure, children and teenagers may not avoid the potential negative effects of social media use, which therefore may increase their risk to develop mental disorders (Keles at al. 2020). Adding both strangers and acquaintances as ""friends"" on social media brings about the risk for children and teenagers to meet strangers on virtual platforms, who may not be their peers (Subrahmanyam and Greenfield 2008). [...]a case occurred in the USA 17 years ago sets a dreadful example of the danger that may come from a ""friend"" on social media.","Bacioglu, Seda Donat","https://doi.org/10.18863/pgy.896800","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psikiyatride Guncel Yaklasimlar; 14(1):29-37, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28040,""

"Ethical Standards for a Post-COVID-19 World","The cataclysmic events of 2020 created an urgent need for mental health counseling to help individuals, families, and communities deal with grief, loss, and trauma. The sheer magnitude of the challenges has highlighted the necessity for collective interventions, as the need for help far surpasses what can be met through traditional individual or family counseling. Clinical mental health counselors must be prepared to respond to the new challenges in creative, culturally responsive, and ethical ways. The authors discuss the limitations of the prevailing codes of ethics, which are grounded in principle ethics, and propose that virtue ethics and relational ethics perspectives can be incorporated into ethical reasoning to make the process more responsive to collective interventions. A case scenario is presented and analyzed to illustrate this broader and more inclusive approach to ethical decision-making in a situation that calls for a collective intervention.","Mifsud, Anabel, Herlihy, Barbara","https://doi.org/10.17744/mehc.44.l.07","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Mental Health Counseling; 44(1):82-96, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28042,""
"The Need to Consider Requiring Trauma Training in Entry-Level Academic Training Programs in Clinical Mental Health Counseling","The COVID-19 pandemic and heightened awareness of racial injustice and discrimination in the United States are likely to have a negative impact on mental health. This is concerning, given the already alarming prevalence rates of trauma exposure and adverse childhood experiences in the U.S. general population prior to the current pandemic, their immediate and long-lasting effects on human development across the life span, and their documented effects on adult chronic health conditions. For clinical mental health counselors (CMHCs) to respond effectively to the needs of the U.S. general population, entry-level counseling programs must provide comprehensive trauma training and education. The purpose of this article is to provide information about clinical competencies and relevant training requirements for CMHCs in trauma prevention and treatment to highlight the need to require comprehensive trauma training in entry-level academic training programs for CMHCs through relevant research and policy.","Moh, Yoon Suh, Sperandio, Katharine R.","https://doi.org/10.17744/mehc.44.1.03","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Mental Health Counseling; 44(1):18-31, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28043,""

"Anxiety, depression and insomnia in pregnant women during the COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing","Objective: To evaluate the anxiety, depression and sleep problems and the related factors in pregnant women and during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: Totally 885 pregnant women were recruited in and surveyed by online self-evaluating questionnaire from Feb 28th to April 26th, 2020 in four hospitals. The psychological assessment included Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) for anxiety symptoms, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depressive symptoms, and insomnia severity index (ISI) for insomnia symptoms. Results: In this sample, the detection rates of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptom and insomnia symptoms were 12. 2%, 24. 6% and 13. 6% respectively. Less care (OR = 1. 73), delivery worries (OR = 3. 95) and poor psychological resilience (OR = 4. 57) were risk factors for anxiety symptoms. High family income (OR = 1. 94), delivery worries (OR = 2. 39) and poor resilience (OR= 3. 04) were risk factors for depressive symptoms. Oilier marital status except married (OR =4. 95) and larger gestational weeks (13 - 27 weeks, OR = 2. 03;28 weeks or more, OR = 2. 13), history of somatic disease (OR = 1. 77), delivery worries (OR = 2. 78) and poor psychological resilience (OR = 1. 67) were risk factors for insomnia symptoms. Conclusion: Anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms and insomnia symptoms of pregnant women in Beijing are more common during the COVID-19 epidemic, especially in those with delivery worries and poor psychological resilience under COVID-19.

"Prominent Efficacy of Amantadine against Human Borna Disease Virus Infection In Vitro and In Vivo Comment on Fink et al Amantadine Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 In Vitro Viruses 2021, 13, 539","Amantadine (1-amino-adamantane) is a versatile antiviral compound which has been licensed for decades against influenza viruses. During the Corona pandemic, its effect to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro has been investigated. However, an in vivo oral inapplicability was concluded due to ID50 doses exceeding eight times the estimated maximum tolerable plasma levels reached by 600 mg orally daily. In contrast, amantadine has been shown to be extraordinarily efficient against human neurotropic Borna disease virus (BoDV-1), presenting with both anti-depressive and anti-viral efficacy against a placebo, achieved by a well-tolerated low oral daily dose of 200 mg amantadine.","Bode, Liv, Dietrich, Detlef E.; Spannhuth, Carsten W.; Ludwig, Hanns","https://doi.org/10.3390/v14030494","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Viruses; 14(3):494, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28048,""
"Electrochemical Biosensor Based on Laser-Induced Graphene for COVID-19 Diagnosing: Rapid and Low-Cost Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Biomarker Antibodies","The severe acute respiratory syndrome originated by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in late 2019, known to be a highly transmissible and pathogenic disease, has caused the COVID-19 global pandemic outbreak. Thus, diagnostic devices that help epidemiological public safety measures to reduce undetected cases and isolation of infected patients, in addition to significantly help to control the population's immune response to vaccine, are required. To address the negative issues of clinical research, we developed a Diagnostic on a Chip platform based on a disposable electrochemical biosensor containing laser-induced graphene and a protein (SARS-CoV-2 specific antigen) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The biosensors were produced via direct laser writing using a CO2 infrared laser cutting machine on commercial polyimide sheets. The presence of specific antibodies reacting with the protein and the K3[Fe(CN)6] redox indicator produced characteristic and concentration-dependent electrochemical signals, with mean current values of 9.6757 and 8.1812 &micro;A for reactive and non-reactive samples, respectively, proving the effectiveness of testing in clinical samples of serum from patients. Thus, the platform is being expanded to be measured in a portable microcontrolled potentiostat to be applied as a fast and reliable monitoring and mapping tool, aiming to assess the vaccinal immune response of the population.","Oliveira, Marcely Echeverria, Lopes, Bruno Vasconcellos, Rossato, JÃ©ssica Helisa Hautrive, Maron, Guilherme Kurz, Gallo, Betty Braga, La Rosa, Andrei Borges, Balboni, Raphael Dorneles Caldeira, Alves, Mariliana Luiza Ferreira, Ferreira, Marcos Roberto Alves, da Silva Pinto, Luciano, ConceiÃ§Ã£o, Fabricio Rochedo, Piva, Evandro, de Pereira, Claudio Martin Pereira, Escote, Marcia Tsuyama, CarreÃ±o, Neftali Lenin Villarreal","https://doi.org/10.3390/surfaces5010012","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Surfaces; 5(1):187-201, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28049,""
"Ports Opening for Seafarer Change during the COVID-19: Models and Applications","Countries around the world have tightened their border controls in response to the spread of COVID-19. Consequently, seafarers are prohibited from boarding or leaving ships at most ports, with few exceptions. This situation means that seafarers are highly likely to serve onboard vessels beyond their contracted shifts. Most seafarers are prone to depression because they have to spend long periods at sea away from family and friends, and, thus, banning crew changes will put their mental health further at risk. This will increase the likelihood of maritime accidents, thus jeopardizing global supply chains and ultimately exacerbating current hardships. To tackle this emergency, the International Maritime Organization and the European Commission have called on governments to coordinate efforts to designate ports for crew changes during the pandemic. This study aims to solve the crew change problem by using an integer linear programming model. In the sensitivity analysis section, we find that the number of opening ports for crew changes and the cost of crew changes decrease when the cost of opening ports increases. The results show governments will not invest in opening more ports when the cost of opening ports increases. However, the penalty increases when the number of open ports decreases, and the cost of opening ports increases. As the number of crew changes is decreasing, this leads to the penalty increasing, when the number of open ports decreases.","Guo, Yu, Yan, Ran, Wu, Yiwei, Wang, Hans","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14052908","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(5):2908, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28050,""
"Breastfeeding Awareness and Empowerment (BAE): A Black Women-Led Approach to Promoting a Multigenerational Culture of Health","(1) Background: Critical gaps in the U.S. healthcare system perpetuate adverse reproductive health outcomes for Black people. Grounded in reproductive justice and trauma-informed care, Breastfeeding Awareness and Empowerment (BAE) has developed a program titled BAE Cafe to directly address these gaps by providing community-based lactation and perinatal mental health support. A literature review identified key programmatic gaps, namely, access to knowledge relevant to troubleshooting breastfeeding, peer support, community support and healthcare system support, and system-level factors that impede families and communities from accessing lactation support. (2) Methods: This paper describes BAE Cafe through a group process observation and participant survey. (3) Results: The observation of groups highlighted the core elements of the BAE Cafe model: knowledge, support and mental health support in a peer driven format. Participant survey feedback was overwhelmingly positive and highlighted the critical importance of lactation support for Black women by Black women and BAEâ€™s role in participantsâ€™ decisions to continue breastfeeding. (4) Conclusions: BAE Cafe is a replicable, scalable, peer-driven and low-barrier intervention that has the potential to improve outcomes for Black families. Additional research and investment are now needed to assess large-scale implementation to reduce disparities and address health inequity across different contexts and settings.","Duncan, Rebecca, Coleman, Jabina, Herring, Sharon, Kawan, Meg, Santoro, Christy, Atre, Meghana, Mason, Aleigha, Moore, Shawana, Kumar, Aparna","https://doi.org/10.3390/soc12010028","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Societies; 12(1):28, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28051,""
"Sound Healing: Mood, Emotional, and Spiritual Well-Being Interrelationships","Psychosocial stress, tension, and depression are quite common in many parts of the developed world. Integrative medicine techniques which may potentially increase spiritual and emotional well-being may be useful in combating chronic psychosocial stress, as well as challenges with depression and excessive tension. The present observational study examines the effect of singing-bowl sound healing on emotional and spiritual well-being and particularly examines interrelationships between changes in spiritual well-being with changes in tension and depressed mood post-sound healing. Participants experienced a sound healing environment of vibrational musical instruments such as singing bowls (bell-like instruments), gongs, and other vibrational instruments. Sixty-two participants were examined in an observational study using singing-bowl sound healing. Emotional and spiritual well-being were examined by utilizing standardized questionnaires. Results revealed significant correlations between improvements in scores of spiritual well-being and reductions in scores of tension and depression post-sound healing. Moreover, effects varied by age of the study participants. Specifically, the association between spiritual well-being improvement and depression improvement was strongest for ages 31â€“40, while spiritual well-being improvement and tension improvement associations were strongest for ages 51â€“60. Implications for applying sound healing meditations as a potential low-cost, low-technology therapeutic technique are discussed for emotional and spiritual well-being.","Goldsby, Tamara L.; Goldsby, Michael E.; McWalters, Mary, Mills, Paul J.","https://doi.org/10.3390/rel13020123","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Religions; 13(2):123, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28052,""
"Medical Applications of Artificial Intelligence (Legal Aspects and Future Prospects)","Background: Cutting-edge digital technologies are being actively introduced into healthcare. The recent successful efforts of artificial intelligence in diagnosing, predicting and studying diseases, as well as in surgical assisting demonstrate its high efficiency. The AIâ€™s ability to promptly take decisions and learn independently has motivated large corporations to focus on its development and gradual introduction into everyday life. Legal aspects of medical activities are of particular importance, yet the legal regulation of AIâ€™s performance in healthcare is still in its infancy. The state is to a considerable extent responsible for the formation of a legal regime that would meet the needs of modern society (digital society). Objective: This study aims to determine the possible modes of AIâ€™s functioning, to identify the participants in medical-legal relations, to define the legal personality of AI and circumscribe the scope of its competencies. Of importance is the issue of determining the grounds for imposing legal liability on persons responsible for the performance of an AI system. Results: The present study identifies the prospects for a legal assessment of AI applications in medicine. The article reviews the sources of legal regulation of AI, including the unique sources of law sanctioned by the state. Particular focus is placed on medical-legal customs and medical practices. Conclusions: The presented analysis has allowed formulating the approaches to the legal regulation of AI in healthcare.","Laptev, Vasiliy Andreevich, Ershova, Inna Vladimirovna, Feyzrakhmanova, Daria Rinatovna","https://doi.org/10.3390/laws11010003","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Laws; 11(1):3, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28053,""
"From Fragility to Resilienceâ€”How Prepared Was the Romanian Business Environment to Face the COVID-19 Crisis?","The issue of business resilience is a topical one, in the context of which a large number of the companies on the market have faced many challenges in the last two years, raising the issue of market survival. But was the Romanian business environment ready to face the COVID-19 crisis? How prepared is it to continue to face the obstacles posed by the pandemic? The purpose of this paper is to identify the main effects that the pandemic has generated on Romanian SMEs, while presenting the results of a study on this topic. We proceeded to determine the level of familiarity of respondents on the evolution of SMEs during the pandemic and the study of their level of interest, on the effects generated by the current epidemiological context, and on the evolution of the business environment, while analysing the level of optimism/pessimism of the respondents, regarding the general evolution of the Romanian business environment.

"A Selective Histamine H4 Receptor Antagonist, JNJ7777120, Role on glutamate Transporter Activity in Chronic Depression","Glutamate release and reuptake play a key role in the pathophysiology of depression. glutamatergic nerves in the hippocampus region are modulated by histaminergic afferents. Excessive accumulation of glutamate in the synaptic area causes degeneration of neuron cells. The H4 receptor is defined as the main immune system histamine receptor with a pro-inflammatory role. To understand the role of this receptor, the drug JNJ7777120 was used to reveal the chronic depression-glutamate relationship. We have important findings showing that the H4 antagonist increases the glutamate transportersâ€™ instantaneous activity. In our experiment, it has been shown that blocking the H4 receptor leads to increased neuron cell viability and improvement in behavioral ability due to glutamate. Therefore, JNJ can be used to prevent neurotoxicity, inhibit membrane phospholipase activation and free radical formation, and minimize membrane disruption. In line with our findings, results have been obtained that indicate that JNJ will contribute to the effective prevention and treatment of depression.","Yeni, Yesim, Cakir, Zeynep, Hacimuftuoglu, Ahmet, Taghizadehghalehjoughi, Ali, Okkay, Ufuk, Genc, Sidika, Yildirim, Serkan, Yavuz Selim, Saglam, Calina, Daniela, Tsatsakis, Aristidis, Docea, Anca Oana","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm12020246","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Personalized Medicine; 12(2):246, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28055,""
"Areas of Interest and Social Consideration of Antidepressants on English Tweets: A Natural Language Processing Classification Study","Background: Antidepressants are the foundation of the treatment of major depressive disorders. Despite the scientific evidence, there is still a sustained debate and concern about the efficacy of antidepressants, with widely differing opinions among the population about their positive and negative effects, which may condition peopleâ€™s attitudes towards such treatments. Our aim is to investigate Twitter posts about antidepressants in order to have a better understanding of the social consideration of antidepressants. Methods: We gathered public tweets mentioning antidepressants written in English, published throughout a 22-month period, between 1 January 2019 and 31 October 2020. We analysed the content of each tweet, determining in the first place whether they included medical aspects or not. Those with medical content were classified into four categories: general aspects, such as quality of life or mood, sleep-related conditions, appetite/weight issues and aspects around somatic alterations. In non-medical tweets, we distinguished three categories: commercial nature (including all economic activity, drug promotion, education or outreach), help request/offer, and drug trivialization. In addition, users were arranged into three categories according to their nature: patients and relatives, caregivers, and interactions between Twitter users. Finally, we identified the most mentioned antidepressants, including the number of retweets and likes, which allowed us to measure the impact among Twitter users. Results: The activity in Twitter concerning antidepressants is mainly focused on the effects these drugs may have on certain health-related areas, specifically sleep (20.87%) and appetite/weight (8.95%). Patients and relatives are the type of user that most frequently posts tweets with medical content (65.2%, specifically 80% when referencing sleep and 78.6% in the case of appetite/weight), whereas they are responsible for only 2.9% of tweets with non-medical content. Among tweets classified as non-medical in this study, the most common subject was drug trivialization (66.86%). Caregivers barely have any presence in conversations in Twitter about antidepressants (3.5%). However, their tweets rose more interest among other users, with a ratio 11.93 times higher than those posted by patients and their friends and family. Mirtazapine is the most mentioned antidepressant in Twitter (45.43%), with a significant difference with the rest, agomelatine (11.11%). Conclusions: This study shows that Twitter users that take antidepressants, or their friends and family, use social media to share medical information about antidepressants. However, other users that do not talk about antidepressants from a personal or close experience, frequently do so in a stigmatizing manner, by trivializing them. Our study also brings to light the scarce presence of caregivers in Twitter.","de Anta, Laura, Alvarez-Mon, Miguel Angel, Ortega, Miguel A.; Salazar, Cristina, Donat-Vargas, Carolina, Santoma-Vilaclara, Javier, Martin-Martinez, Maria, Lahera, Guillermo, Gutierrez-Rojas, Luis, Rodriguez-Jimenez, Roberto, Quintero, Javier, Alvarez-Mon, Melchor","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm12020155","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Personalized Medicine; 12(2):155, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28056,""
"Hippocampal Over-Expression of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) Is Associated with Susceptibility to Stress-Induced Anhedonia in Mice","The phenomenon of individual variability in susceptibility/resilience to stress and depression, in which the hippocampus plays a pivotal role, is attracting increasing attention. We investigated the potential role of hippocampal cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which regulates plasticity, neuroimmune function, and stress responses that are all linked to this risk dichotomy. We used a four-week-long chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm, in which mice could be stratified according to their susceptibility/resilience to anhedonia, a key feature of depression, to investigate hippocampal expression of COX-2, a marker of microglial activation Iba-1, and the proliferation marker Ki67. Rat exposure, social defeat, restraints, and tail suspension were used as stressors. We compared the effects of treatment with either the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (30 mg/kg/day) or citalopram (15 mg/kg/day). For the celecoxib and vehicle-treated mice, the Porsolt test was used. Anhedonic (susceptible) but not non-anhedonic (resilient) animals exhibited elevated COX-2 mRNA levels, increased numbers of COX-2 and Iba-1-positive cells in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 area, and decreased numbers of Ki67-positive cells in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. Drug treatment decreased the percentage of anhedonic mice, normalized swimming activity, reduced behavioral despair, and improved conditioned fear memory.

"Effect of Curcumin in Experimental Pulmonary Tuberculosis: Antimycobacterial Activity in the Lungs and Anti-Inflammatory Effect in the Brain","Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the ten leading causes of death worldwide. Patients with TB have been observed to suffer from depression and anxiety linked to social variables. Previous experiments found that the substantial pulmonary inflammation associated with TB causes neuroinflammation, neuronal death, and behavioral impairments in the absence of brain infection. Curcumin (CUR) is a natural product with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities. In this work, we evaluated the CUR effect on the growth control of mycobacteria in the lungs and the anti-inflammatory effect in the brain using a model of progressive pulmonary TB in BALB/c mice infected with drug-sensitive mycobacteria (strain H37Rv). The results have shown that CUR decreased lung bacilli load and pneumonia of infected animals. Finally, CUR significantly decreased neuroinflammation (expression of TNFa, IFN<U+03B3> and IL12) and slightly increased the levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related to factor 2 (Nrf2) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, improving behavioral status. These results suggest that CUR has a bactericidal effect and can control pulmonary mycobacterial infection and reduce neuroinflammation. It seems that CUR has a promising potential as adjuvant therapy in TB treatment.","Lara-Espinosa, Jacqueline V.; Arce-Aceves, MarÃ­a Fernanda, LÃ³pez-Torres, Manuel O.; Lozano-Ordaz, Vasti, Mata-Espinosa, Dulce, Barrios-PayÃ¡n, Jorge, Silva-Islas, Carlos Alfredo, Maldonado, Perla D.; Marquina-Castillo, Brenda, HernÃ¡ndez-Pando, Rogelio","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23041964","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Molecular Sciences; 23(4):1964, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28058,""
"A Phenomenological Study of Nurses' Experience in Caring for COVID-19 Patients","This study aimed to understand and describe the experiences of nurses who cared for patients with COVID-19. A descriptive phenomenological approach was used to collect data from individual in-depth interviews with 14 nurses, from 20 October 2020 to 15 January 2021. Data were analyzed using the phenomenological method of Colaizzi. Five theme clusters emerged from the analysis: (1) nurses struggling under the weight of dealing with infectious disease, (2) challenges added to difficult caring, (3) double suffering from patient care, (4) support for caring, and (5) expectations for post-COVID-19 life. The findings of this study are useful primary data for developing appropriate measures for health professionals' wellbeing during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Specifically, as nurses in this study struggled with mental as well as physical difficulties, it is suggested that future studies develop and apply mental health recovery programs for them. To be prepared for future infectious diseases and contribute to patient care, policymakers should improve the work environment, through various means, such as nurses' practice environment management and incentives.","Jang, Hye-Young, Yang, Jeong-Eun, Shin, Yong-Soon","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052924","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(5):2924, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28059,""
"Sleep Quality and Its Associations with Physical and Mental Health-Related Quality of Life among University Students: A Cross-Sectional Study","The association between sleep problems and quality of life has been well documented and the COVID-19 pandemic seemingly had an impact on both sleep quality and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, recent evidence about this relationship among university students is limited. The aims of this study are to investigate the prevalence of poor sleep quality and insomnia and to explore the associations between these outcomes, perceived stress, and HRQoL among Italian university students. An anonymous questionnaire comprising the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Short Form-12 health survey, and the Perceived Stress Scale was administered to a convenience sample of 1279 students (1119 females and 160 males, mean age: 23.4 &plusmn;2.5 years) attending one of the largest Italian universities. A total of 65% of the participants showed poor sleep quality, whereas 55% reported insomnia symptoms. Students reporting poor sleep quality and insomnia obtained higher perceived stress scores and lower physical and mental HRQoL scores. Controlling for health-related variables and perceived stress, hierarchical regression analyses showed that sleep quality components added a significant contribution to the prediction of both physical (&Delta;R2 = 0.1) and mental (&Delta;R2 = 0.02) HRQoL. As a whole, these findings confirm the relevance of sleep for university students' well-being and might inform the development of health promotion interventions for this population.","Carpi, Matteo, Cianfarani, Claudia, Vestri, Annarita","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052874","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(5):2874, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28060,""
"The General Public's Perceptions of How the COVID-19 Pandemic Has Impacted the Elderly and Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities","This study examined the general public's perceptions of how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the elderly and people with intellectual disabilities as well how these perceptions relate to people's level of familiarity and contact quality with these groups. A cross-sectional survey was administered to a sample of the Dutch population (n = 1458 and n = 1761, comprising questions related to the elderly and people with intellectual disabilities, respectively). The general public was found to be generally aware of the deleterious impact of the pandemic upon the elderly and people with intellectual disabilities. Specifically, the respondents reported that both groups' quality of life, physical and mental health, and quality and frequency of social contact was lower than it was prior to COVID-19, in addition to perceiving them as lonelier and less self-reliant. Notably, the impact on the elderly was considered to be greater than that on people with intellectual disabilities. Furthermore, those who had no familiarity with people with intellectual disabilities in real life perceived the impact to be lower than those who had a greater degree of familiarity. These findings have important implications, both for increasing awareness of the pandemic's negative impact on these vulnerable groups and in terms of sufficiently addressing their specific needs and concerns. The findings also underscore that, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to increase the visibility of groups who already relied more on help and support from others in society prior to the pandemic, such as the elderly and people with intellectual disabilities, via, among other things, self-advocacy, education, and enhanced intergroup contact, in order to be able to sufficiently address their needs during these challenging times.","Dekker, Maria R.; Frielink, Noud, Hendriks, Alexander H.

"The Mediating Role of Resilience and Life Satisfaction in the Relationship between Stress and Burnout in Medical Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Following the WHO's declaration of a public health emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the subsequent quarantine and confinement measures that were adopted, including distance learning measures, were shown to have caused a significant deterioration in the mental health of medical students. The goal of this study was to explore the mediating role of resilience and life satisfaction in the relationship between perceived stress and burnout among medical students in the context of COVID-19. A transversal assessment was performed using an online questionnaire, to which 462 students responded. The instruments applied were the Perceived Stress Scale-10, the Resilience Scale-25 items, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the Burnout Scale (Oldenburg Inventory). A regression model was estimated for each dimension of burnout. The results revealed that resilience and life satisfaction play a mediating role in the association between stress and the dimensions of burnout. This suggests that measures of promoting mental health based on resilience and improving perceptions of life should be implemented.","Duarte, Ivone, Alves, Ana, Coelho, Ana, Ferreira, Ana, Cabral, Beatriz, Silva, Bebiana, Peralta, JoÃ£o, Silva, Juliana, Domingues, Pedro, Nunes, Pedro, SerrÃ£o, Carla, Santos, Cristina","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052822","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(5):2822, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28062,""
"Burnout and Psychological Vulnerability in First Responders: Monitoring Depersonalization and Phobic Anxiety during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: It is common knowledge that first responders are among the helping professionals most at risk of burnout and psychological vulnerability. During the COVID-19 pandemic, their mental health has been subjected to various risk factors. Methods: Data on socio-demographic characteristics, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and psychological vulnerability (SCL-90-R) were obtained from 228 subjects (55.3% female;M age = 45.23, SD = 13.14) grouped on the basis of their actual involvement during the emergency phases (82% First Responders and 18% Second Responders). Results: First responders exceeded the MBI clinical cut-off, while SRs did not (&chi;&sup2;&ge;0.5);specifically, EE = 89.8%, DP = 85.8%, and PA = 82.1%. The FR group showed a higher mean in the global severity index (GSI = 49.37) than did the SRs (=43.95), and the FR group exceeded the clinical cut-off in the SCL-90-R scales of SOM (51.06), ANX (52.40), and PHOB (53.60), while the SF group did so only for the PHOB scale (50.41). The MBI dimensions correlated significantly (p = 0.05) with all investigated clinical scales of the SCL-90-R. Conclusions: Emergency situations expose first responders to specific risk factors related to work performance and relational aspects, which contribute to increased psychological vulnerability and burnout.","Benincasa, Veronica, Passannante, Maria, Pierrini, Filippo, Carpinelli, Luna, Moccia, Giuseppina, Marinaci, Tiziana, Capunzo, Mario, Pironti, Concetta, Genovese, Armando, Savarese, Giulia, De Caro, Francesco, Motta, Oriana","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052794","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(5):2794, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28063,""
"Stress and Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Neighborhood Context","Neighborhoods play a central role in health and mental health, particularly during disasters and crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined changes in psychological distress following the pandemic, and the potential role of neighborhood conditions among 244 residents of New Orleans, Louisiana. Using modified linear regression models, we assessed associations between neighborhood characteristics and change in psychological distress from before to during the pandemic, testing effect modification by sex and social support. While higher density of offsite alcohol outlets (&beta;= 0.89;95% CI: 0.52, 1.23), assault rate (&beta;= 0.14;95% CI: 0.03, 0.24), and walkable streets (&beta;= 0.05;95% CI: 0.02, 0.07) in neighborhoods were associated with an increase in distress, access to neighborhood parks (&beta;= &minus;0.03;95% CI: &minus;0.05, &minus;0.01), collective efficacy (&beta;= &minus;0.23;95% CI: &minus;0.35, &minus;0.09), and homicide rate (&beta;= &minus;1.2;95% CI: &minus;1.8, &minus;0.6) were associated with reduced distress related to the pandemic. These relationships were modified by sex and social support. Findings revealed the important but complicated relationship between psychological distress and neighborhood characteristics. While a deeper understanding of the neighborhoods' role in distress is needed, interventions that target neighborhood environments to ameliorate or prevent the residents' distress may be important not only during crisis situations.","Kondo, Michelle C.; Felker-Kantor, Erica, Wu, Kimberly, Gustat, Jeanette, Morrison, Christopher N.; Richardson, Lisa, Branas, Charles C.; Theall, Katherine P.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052779","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(5):2779, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28064,""
"Caregiving of Older Persons during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Russian Arctic Province: Challenges and Practice","Older people and their families were particularly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, but not much is known about the context of the Arctic regions of Russia. In this study, we identified the changes in family care before and during the pandemic using a questionnaire for the informal caregivers of older people. We investigated how and to what extent the pandemic has affected the relationships between caregiver and older person, and how the mental and physical health of older people and caregivers were affected by self-isolation in the Arkhangelsk region of Russia. The pandemic has changed the contribution of care from various actors: the share of care by charities, churches, and other aid agencies increased, while that of municipal services decreased. Sixteen percent of female and forty percent of male caregivers informed the study that COVID-19-related restrictions led to deterioration in the health of older people cared for at home. Family caregivers' own health worsened, especially mental health: 28% of caregivers reported aggravated stress during the COVID-19 pandemic and expressed various fears. Our data show that the main resources in overcoming the period of self-isolation have been telephone communication, personal contact, reading/music, friends, as well as the help of social services and maintaining a positive attitude.","Golubeva, Elena, Emelyanova, Anastasia, Kharkova, Olga, Rautio, Arja, Soloviev, Andrey","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052775","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(5):2775, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28065,""
"Moderating Effects of Intercultural Social Efficacy and the Role of Language in the Context of Coping Strategies in Study Abroad Depression","This study examined the relationship between intercultural social efficacy (ISE), coping strategies, Mandarin Chinese and English language proficiency, and depression. In total, 1870 foreign students in Taiwan participated in the study. Study results indicated that aspects of background demographics may influence depression levels. Participants with an immigrant background and those who are older are more likely to suffer from depression;however, gender and length of stay do not seem to affect depression. The moderating effects of Mandarin Chinese and English language proficiency and ISE on the relationship between coping strategies and depression were examined. Based on the results, the moderating role of Mandarin Chinese and English language proficiency was not supported, suggesting that coping strategies are independent of linguistic proficiency. However, knowing both languages is an important factor in reducing the stress of studying abroad. Additionally, the results confirmed the moderating effects of ISE, suggesting that a higher level of social effectiveness reinforces the negative association between coping strategies and depression. Students who are better able to interact with other cultures may be able to develop effective coping strategies. Moreover, this study found that although most of the study abroad students were not depressed, early intervention and prevention measures could help alleviate possible mental health crises.","Hu, Yueh-Luen, Roberts, Amy, Ching, Gregory S.; Pei-Ching, Chao","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042409","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(4):2409, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28066,""
"Characterizing the Environmental Health Literacy and Sensemaking of Indoor Air Quality of Research Participants","This study is based on in-depth semi-structured interviews with the participants of an indoor air quality monitoring study. The purpose of the interviews was to capture participantsâ€™ perceptions of indoor air quality and engage them in a discussion of those factors that influenced their behavior. Interview study participants (n = 20) noted the importance of family health concerns and their own sensory awareness of possible contaminants. They discussed their level of personal control over their home environment as well as their access to needed resources. This study is based on grounded theory and applies interpretivist epistemological methods. Study findings offer insights into how people perceive their home environment and what influences their decision making and action. Analyses indicate that perceived agency, risk perception, access to resources, and information all influenced participantsâ€™ sense of ability to take action as well as their interest in taking action. These insights serve to challenge some of the current work in environmental health literacy which tends to focus on and measure an individualâ€™s knowledge or skills.

"Mobile Applications in Mood Disorders and Mental Health: Systematic Search in Apple App Store and Google Play Store and Review of the Literature","Objectives: The main objective of this work was to explore and characterize the current landscape of mobile applications available to treat mood disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, and dysthymia. Methods: We developed a tool that makes both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store searchable using keywords and that facilitates the extraction of basic app information of the search results. All app results were filtered using various inclusion and exclusion criteria. We characterized all resultant applications according to their technical details. Furthermore, we searched for scientific publications on each appâ€™s website and PubMed, to understand whether any of the apps were supported by any type of scientific evidence on their acceptability, validation, use, effectiveness, etc. Results: Thirty apps were identified that fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The literature search yielded 27 publications related to the apps. However, these did not exclusively concern mood disorders. 6 were randomized studies and the rest included a protocol, pilot-, feasibility, case-, or qualitative studies, among others. The majority of studies were conducted on relatively small scales and 9 of the 27 studies did not explicitly study the effects of mobile application use on mental wellbeing. Conclusion: While there exists a wealth of mobile applications aimed at the treatment of mental health disorders, including mood disorders, this study showed that only a handful of these are backed by robust scientific evidence.

"Treatment Preferences for Pharmacological versus Psychological Interventions among Primary Care Providers in Nepal: Mixed Methods Analysis of a Pilot Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial","There is increasing evidence supporting the effectiveness of psychological interventions in low- and middle-income countries. However, primary care providers (PCPs) may prefer treating patients with medication. A secondary exploratory analysis of a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate psychological vs. pharmacological treatment preferences among PCPs. Thirty-four health facilities, including 205 PCPs, participated in the study, with PCPs in 17 facilities assigned to a standard version of the mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) training delivered by mental health specialists. PCPs in the other 17 facilities received mhGAP instruction delivered by specialists and people with lived experience of mental illness (PWLE), using a training strategy entitled Reducing Stigma among HealthcAre ProvidErs (RESHAPE). Pre- and post- intervention attitudes were measured through quantitative and qualitative tools. Qualitative interviews with 49 participants revealed that PCPs in both arms endorsed counselingâ€™s benefits and collaboration within the health system to provide counseling. In the RESHAPE arm, PCPs were more likely to increase endorsement of statements such as â€œdepression improves without medicationâ€ (F = 9.83, p &lt; 0.001), â€œnot all people with depression must be treated with antidepressantsâ€ (<U+03C7>2 = 17.62, p &lt; 0.001), and â€œproviding counseling to people who have alcohol abuse problems is effectiveâ€ (<U+03C7>2 = 26.20, p &lt; 0.001). These mixed-method secondary findings from a pilot trial suggest that in-person participation of PWLE in training PCPs may not only reduce stigma but also increase PCPsâ€™ support of psychological interventions.

"Feelings of Loneliness: Understanding the Risk of Suicidal Ideation in Adolescents with Internet Addiction A Theoretical Model to Answer to a Systematic Literature Review, without Results","The Internet has become an essential tool for adolescents. It is part of their social integration within peers and supports their identity construction. The Internet can also become a source of addiction, especially when used as a coping strategy towards unpleasant life situations. Addiction to the Internet is often linked with an increase in the feeling of loneliness. The feeling of loneliness is an emotion present during adolescence. However, in excess, it can lead to suicidal ideation. Addiction to the Internet is also linked to an increased suicide risk. We questioned ourselves on the impact of the feeling of loneliness on the link between an excessive use of the Internet by adolescents and the risks of suicidal ideation. We attempted to find an answer to this question by performing a systematic review of the literature. We found no result matching our search criteria. We noted the absence of studies with regards to the interaction between the feeling of loneliness, addiction to the Internet and the risk of suicidal ideation amongst adolescents. We established a theoretical model which could be used as a lead for future research. We insist on the importance that studies need to be conducted in this domain, in order to enable us to establish efficient preventive measures for the risks of suicidal ideation amongst adolescents.","Khatcherian, EugÃ©nie, Zullino, Daniele, De Leo, Diego, Achab, Sophia","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042012","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(4):2012, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28071,""

We systematically searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases and used cross-referencing to review the interventions published from 2010 to 2020. Eleven interventions were included in this review;nine were school-based, one community, and one digital. Most of the school-based programs used a life skills curriculum. Additionally, coping skills and resilience curricula showed improvement in depressive symptoms, cognitive abilities, academic stress, problem-solving, and overall mental well-being. The multi-component whole-school intervention was quite promising and helped in improving the overall school climate and various other mental health outcomes. Hence, school-based programs should be implemented as an entry point for screening mental health problems. However, there is a need for a more comprehensive mental health program in the country for adolescents. Additionally, there is a need to address the gap by conducting more interventions for early and out-of-school adolescents.","Mehra, Devika, Lakiang, Theophilus, Kathuria, Nishtha, Kumar, Manish, Mehra, Sunil, Sharma, Shantanu","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10020337","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(2):337, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28073,""
"Detecting Depression Signs on Social Media: A Systematic Literature Review","Among mental health diseases, depression is one of the most severe, as it often leads to suicide;due to this, it is important to identify and summarize existing evidence concerning depression sign detection research on social media using the data provided by users. This review examines aspects of primary studies exploring depression detection from social media submissions (from 2016 to mid-2021). The search for primary studies was conducted in five digital libraries: ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, SpringerLink, Science Direct, and PubMed, as well as on the search engine Google Scholar to broaden the results. Extracting and synthesizing the data from each paper was the main activity of this work. Thirty-four primary studies were analyzed and evaluated. Twitter was the most studied social media for depression sign detection. Word embedding was the most prominent linguistic feature extraction method. Support vector machine (SVM) was the most used machine-learning algorithm. Similarly, the most popular computing tool was from Python libraries. Finally, cross-validation (CV) was the most common statistical analysis method used to evaluate the results obtained. Using social media along with computing tools and classification methods contributes to current efforts in public healthcare to detect signs of depression from sources close to patients.","Salas-ZÃ¡rate, Rafael, Alor-HernÃ¡ndez, Giner, MarÃ­a del Pilar, Salas-ZÃ¡rate, Mario AndrÃ©s, Paredes-Valverde, Bustos-LÃ³pez, Maritza, SÃ¡nchez-Cervantes, JosÃ© Luis","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10020291","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(2):291, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28074,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Impact on Training Programs of Medical Residency in Romania","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the training process for resident physicians. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on professional training, and also the subjective perception of the levels of stress, anxiety, and depression among resident doctors specializing in gastroenterology in Romania. Methods: We conducted an observational cross-sectional study, for a period of two months, among 180 resident doctors specializing in gastroenterology, working in university hospitals in Romania. A questionnaire consisting of 29 questions distributed through social media platforms was completed in Google Forms. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS software v.20. Results: A linear relationship was identified between the number of daily hospitalizations in the gastroenterology department and the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection among resident physicians. In total, 80% of the participants reported an increase in the levels of stress, anxiety, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 88.3% stated that they were unsatisfied by online courses. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has had negative effects on both professional training and levesl of stress, anxiety and depression of resident doctors specializing in gastroenterology. In the specialty of gastroenterology there may be certain peculiarities, due to the interventional aspects that this medical specialty involves, for example, endoscopic procedures. Thus, the necessity to acquire practical skills in addition to theoretical knowledge increases the negative impact on gastroenterology internship.","Constantinescu, Gabriel, Gheorghe, Gina, Ionescu, Vlad Alexandru, Plotogea, Oana-Mihaela, Sandru, Vasile, Diaconu, Camelia Cristina, Varlas, Valentin Nicolae, Bacalbasa, Nicolae, Diaconu, Carmen Cristina, Stan-Ilie, Madalina","https://doi.org/10.3390/gastroent13010012","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Gastroenterology Insights; 13(1):106-116, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28075,""
"Fear, Isolation, and Invisibility during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study of Adults with Physical Disabilities in Marginalized Communities in Southeastern Michigan in the United States","This study examines the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults with physical disabilities from marginalized communities in southeastern Michigan, one of the early pandemic epicenters in the United States. A purposeful sample of fifteen adults with moderate to severe physical disabilities were recruited, taking part in individual remote semi-structured qualitative interviews, which were recorded, transcribed, and coded for emergent themes using a thematic approach to coding and analysis. Three interrelated, overarching themes emerged: fear, feelings of isolation, and a sense of being invisible. These were identified in the contexts of health and healthcare, home care assistance, and access to resources. The findings help illuminate the experiences of those from socioeconomically and racially marginalized communities, populations that are often 'always already';vulnerable. Participant narratives made visible the negative impact of the pandemic on physical and mental health as well as the lack of accommodations available. They showed that participants were faced with a dilemma between engaging in risky behavior to have their needs met or avoiding risk and not have those needs met. This knowledge can expand awareness and appreciation of how social, economic, and political systems impact adults with physical disabilities in lower-income and racially diverse communities and provide guidance in designing future clinical and emergency response policies.","Reber, Lisa, Kreschmer, Jodi M.; DeShong, Gina L.; Meade, Michelle A.","https://doi.org/10.3390/disabilities2010010","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Disabilities; 2(1):119-130, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28076,""
"Diagnosis of Depressive Disorder Model on Facial Expression Based on Fast R-CNN","This study examines related literature to propose a model based on artificial intelligence (AI), that can assist in the diagnosis of depressive disorder. Depressive disorder can be diagnosed through a self-report questionnaire, but it is necessary to check the mood and confirm the consistency of subjective and objective descriptions. Smartphone-based assistance in diagnosing depressive disorders can quickly lead to their identification and provide data for intervention provision. Through fast region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN), a deep learning method that recognizes vector-based information, a model to assist in the diagnosis of depressive disorder can be devised by checking the position change of the eyes and lips, and guessing emotions based on accumulated photos of the participants who will repeatedly participate in the diagnosis of depressive disorder.","Young-Shin, Lee, Won-Hyung, Park","https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics12020317","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Diagnostics; 12(2):317, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28077,""
"Finding the True Number of Females with Autistic Spectrum Disorder by Estimating the Biases in Initial Recognition and Clinical Diagnosis","The proportion of females whose ASD diagnosis is missed is unknown. The ratio of males to females with ASD is generally quoted as 4:1, though it is believed that there are biases preventing females from being diagnosed and that the true ratio is lower. These biases have not been clearly identified or quantified. Starting with a clinical dataset of 1711 children &lt;18 years old, four different methods were employed in an inductive study to identify and quantify the biases and calculate the proportion of females missed. A mathematical model was constructed to compare the findings with current published data. The true male-to-female ratio appears to be 3:4.

"Sleep, Diet, Physical Activity, and Stress during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed routines and habits, raising stress and anxiety levels of individuals worldwide. The goal of this qualitative study was to advance the understanding of how pandemic-related changes affected sleep, diet, physical activity (PA), and stress among adults. We conducted semi-structured, qualitative interviews with 185 participants and selected 33 interviews from a represented sample based on age, race, and gender for coding and analysis of themes. After coding for thematic analysis, results demonstrated four primary themes: sleep, diet, PA, and stress. Sleep sub-themes such as poorer sleep quality were reported by 36% of our participants, and 12% reported increased an frequency of vivid dreams and nightmares. PA was decreased in 52% of our participants, while 33% experienced an increase and 15% experienced no change in PA. Participants also reported having an improved diet, mostly among women. Stress was elevated in 79% of our participants and was more likely to be discussed by women. Many participants reported how stress was involved in precipitating health behavior change, especially for sleep. Increased stress was also linked to elevated anxiety and depression among participants. The results of this qualitative study demonstrate how managing stress could have a beneficial effect on promoting health behaviors and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Orr, Kyanna, Ta, Zachary, Shoaf, Kimberley, Halliday, Tanya M.; Tobin, Selene, Baron, Kelly Glazer","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12030066","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 12(3):66, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28079,""
"Pandemic Puppies: Demographic Characteristics, Health and Early Life Experiences of Puppies Acquired during the 2020 Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the UK","The UK recorded sharp rises in puppy purchasing during the 2020 phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, with many first-time dog owners purchasing puppies to improve their mental health during this challenging period. Government restrictions on movement and social interaction during the pandemic led to animal welfare concerns over puppies' reduced time-sensitive exposures to key environmental and social stimuli during their critical developmental period. This study aimed to compare demographics, health and early-life experiences of puppies purchased and brought home &lt; 16 weeks of age between 23 March&ndash;31 December 2020 ('Pandemic Puppies';), with dogs purchased and brought home &lt; 16 weeks during the same date period in 2019 ('2019 puppies';). An online survey of UK-based puppy owners was conducted between 10 November and 31 December 2020 with valid responses representing 5517 puppies (Pandemic Puppies: n = 4369;2019 puppies: n = 1148). Multivariable logistic regression modelling revealed that Pandemic Puppies were less likely to have attended puppy training classes (67.9% 2019 vs. 28.9% 2020;p &lt; 0.001) or had visitors to their home (94.5% 2019 vs. 81.8% 2020;p &lt; 0.001) aged &lt; 16 weeks compared with 2019 puppies. Fewer Pandemic Puppies underwent veterinary checks prior to purchase than 2019 puppies (2019: 91.3% vs. 2020: 87.4%;p &lt; 0.001), but more were sold with a passport (2019: 4.1% vs. 2020: 7.1%;p &lt; 0.001). Pandemic Puppies were significantly more likely to be 'Designer Crossbreeds' (2019: 18.8% vs. 2020: 26.1%;p &lt; 0.001) and less likely to be Kennel Club registered than 2019 puppies (2019: 58.2% vs. 2020: 46.2%;p &lt; 0.001).

"A Digital Mental Health Intervention in an Orthopedic Setting for Patients With Symptoms of Depression and/or Anxiety: Feasibility Prospective Cohort Study","Background: Symptoms of depression and anxiety commonly coexist with chronic musculoskeletal pain, and when this occurs, standard orthopedic treatment is less effective. However, mental health intervention is not yet a routine part of standard orthopedic treatment, in part because of access-related barriers. Digital mental health intervention is a potential scalable resource that could be feasibly incorporated into orthopedic care. Objective: This studyâ€™s primary purpose was to assess the feasibility of introducing a digital mental health intervention (Wysa) in an outpatient orthopedic setting to patients with coexisting symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. The secondary purpose was to perform a preliminary effectiveness analysis of the intervention. Methods: In this single-arm, prospective cohort study, participants included adult patients (18 years and older) who presented to a nonsurgical orthopedic specialist at a single tertiary care academic center for evaluation of a musculoskeletal condition and who self-reported symptoms of depression and/or anxiety (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] Depression and/or Anxiety score =55). Face-to-face enrollment was performed by a research coordinator immediately after the participantâ€™s encounter with an orthopedic clinician. Participants were provided 2 months of access to a mobile app called Wysa, which is an established, multicomponent digital mental health intervention that uses chatbot technology and text-based access to human counselors to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness training, and sleep tools, among other features. For this study, Wysa access also included novel, behavioral activationâ€“based features specifically developed for users with chronic pain. Primary feasibility outcomes included the study recruitment rate, retention rate, and engagement rate with Wysa (defined as engagement with a therapeutic Wysa tool at least once during the study period). Secondary effectiveness outcomes were between-group differences in mean longitudinal PROMIS mental and physical health score changes at 2-month follow-up between high and low Wysa users, defined by a median split. Results: The recruitment rate was 29.3% (61/208), retention rate was 84% (51/61), and engagement rate was 72% (44/61). Compared to low users, high users reported greater improvement in PROMIS Anxiety scores (between-group difference -4.2 points, 95% CI -8.1 to -0.2;P=.04) at the 2-month follow-up. Between-group differences in PROMIS Depression (-3.2 points, 95% CI -7.5 to 1.2;P=.15) and Pain Interference scores (-2.3 points, 95% CI -6.3 to 1.7;P=.26) favored high users but did not meet statistical significance. Improvements in PROMIS Physical Function scores were comparable between groups. Conclusions: Delivery of a digital mental health intervention within the context of orthopedic care is feasible and has the potential to improve mental health and pain-related impairment to a clinically meaningful degree. Participantsâ€™ engagement rates exceeded industry standards, and additional opportunities to improve recruitment and retention were identified. Further pilot study followed by a definitive, randomized controlled trial is warranted.

"An Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Program for Anxiety and Depression (Tranquility): Adaptation Co-design and Fidelity Evaluation Study","Background: Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) is a necessary step toward increasing the accessibility of mental health services. Yet, few iCBT programs have been evaluated for their fidelity to the therapeutic principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or usability standards. In addition, many existing iCBT programs do not include treatments targeting both anxiety and depression, which are commonly co-occurring conditions. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the usability of Tranquilityâ€”a novel iCBT program for anxietyâ€”and its fidelity to CBT principles. This study also aims to engage in a co-design process to adapt Tranquility to include treatment elements for depression. Methods: CBT experts (n=6) and mental healthâ€“informed peers (n=6) reviewed the iCBT program Tranquility. CBT experts assessed Tranquilityâ€™s fidelity to CBT principles and were asked to identify necessary interventions for depression by using 2 simulated client case examples. Mental healthâ€“informed peers engaged in 2 co-design focus groups to discuss adaptations to the existing anxiety program and the integration of interventions for depression. Both groups completed web-based surveys assessing the usability of Tranquility and the likelihood that they would recommend the program. Results: The CBT expertsâ€™ mean rating of Tranquilityâ€™s fidelity to CBT principles was 91%, indicating a high fidelity to CBT. Further, 5 out of 6 CBT experts and all mental healthâ€“informed peers (all participants: 11/12, 88%) rated Tranquility as satisfactory, indicating that they may recommend Tranquility to others, and they rated its usability highly (mean 76.56, SD 14.07). Mental healthâ€“informed peers provided suggestions on how to leverage engagement with Tranquility (eg, adding incentives and notification control). Conclusions: This preliminary study demonstrated the strong fidelity of Tranquility to CBT and usability standards. The results highlight the importance of involving stakeholders in the co-design process and future opportunities to increase engagement.","Patterson, Victoria C.; Rossi, Meghan A.; Pencer, Alissa, Wozney, Lori","https://doi.org/10.2196/33374","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Formative Research; 6(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28082,""
"Methods and Applications of Social Media Monitoring of Mental Health During Disasters: Scoping Review","Background: With the increasing frequency and magnitude of disasters internationally, there is growing research and clinical interest in the application of social media sites for disaster mental health surveillance. However, important questions remain regarding the extent to which unstructured social media data can be harnessed for clinically meaningful decision-making. Objective: This comprehensive scoping review synthesizes interdisciplinary literature with a particular focus on research methods and applications. Methods: A total of 6 health and computer science databases were searched for studies published before April 20, 2021, resulting in the identification of 47 studies. Included studies were published in peer-reviewed outlets and examined mental health during disasters or crises by using social media data. Results: Applications across 31 mental health issues were identified, which were grouped into the following three broader themes: estimating mental health burden, planning or evaluating interventions and policies, and knowledge discovery. Mental health assessments were completed by primarily using lexical dictionaries and human annotations. The analyses included a range of supervised and unsupervised machine learning, statistical modeling, and qualitative techniques. The overall reporting quality was poor, with key details such as the total number of users and data features often not being reported. Further, biases in sample selection and related limitations in generalizability were often overlooked. Conclusions: The application of social media monitoring has considerable potential for measuring mental health impacts on populations during disasters. Studies have primarily conceptualized mental health in broad terms, such as distress or negative affect, but greater focus is required on validating mental health assessments. There was little evidence for the clinical integration of social mediaâ€“based disaster mental health monitoring, such as combining surveillance with social mediaâ€“based interventions or developing and testing real-world disaster management tools. To address issues with study quality, a structured set of reporting guidelines is recommended to improve the methodological quality, replicability, and clinical relevance of future research on the social media monitoring of mental health during disasters.","Teague, Samantha J.; Shatte, Adrian B.

"Patient Digital Health Technologies to Support Primary Care Across Clinical Contexts: Survey of Primary Care Providers, Behavioral Health Consultants, and Nurses","Background: The acceptance of digital health technologies to support patient care for various clinical conditions among primary care providers and staff has not been explored. Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore the extent of potential differences between major groups of providers and staff in primary care, including behavioral health consultants (BHCs;eg, psychologists, social workers, and counselors), primary care providers (PCPs;eg, physicians and nurse practitioners), and nurses (registered nurses and licensed practical nurses) in the acceptance of various health technologies (ie, mobile apps, wearables, live video, phone, email, instant chats, text messages, social media, and patient portals) to support patient care across a variety of clinical situations. Methods: We surveyed 151 providers (51 BHCs, 52 PCPs, and 48 nurses) embedded in primary care clinics across the United States who volunteered to respond to a web-based survey distributed in December 2020 by a large health care market research company. Respondents indicated the technologies they consider appropriate to support patientsâ€™ health care needs across the following clinical contexts: acute and chronic disease, medication management, health-promoting behaviors, sleep, substance use, and common and serious mental health conditions. We used descriptive statistics to summarize the distribution of demographic characteristics by provider type. We used contingency tables to compile summaries of the proportion of provider types endorsing each technology within and across clinical contexts. This study was exploratory in nature, with the intent to inform future research. Results: Most of the respondents were from urban and suburban settings (125/151, 82.8%), with 12.6% (n=19) practicing in rural or frontier settings and 4.6% (n=7) practicing in rural-serving clinics. Respondents were dispersed across the United States, including the Northeast (31/151, 20.5%), Midwest (n=32, 21.2%), South (n=49, 32.5%), and West (n=39, 25.8%). The highest acceptance for technologies across clinical contexts was among BHCs (32/51, 63%) and PCPs (30/52, 58%) for live video and among nurses for mobile apps (30/48, 63%). A higher percentage of nurses accepted all other technologies relative to BHCs and PCPs. Similarly, relative to other groups, PCPs indicated lower levels of acceptance. Within clinical contexts, the highest acceptance rates were reported among 80% (41/51) of BHCs and 69% (36/52) of PCPs endorsing live video for common mental health conditions and 75% (36/48) of nurses endorsing mobile apps for health-promoting behaviors. The lowest acceptance across providers was for social media in the context of medication management (9.3% [14/151] endorsement across provider type). Conclusions: The survey suggests potential differences in the way primary care clinicians and staff envision using technologies to support patient care. Future work must attend to reasons for differences in the acceptance of various technologies across providers and clinical contexts. Such an understanding will help inform appropriate implementation strategies to increase acceptability and gain greater adoption of appropriate technologies across conditions and patient populations.","Zaslavsky, Oleg, Chu, Frances, Renn, Brenna N.","https://doi.org/10.2196/32664","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Formative Research; 6(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28084,""
"eHealth Interventions for Treatment and Prevention of Depression, Anxiety, and Insomnia During Pregnancy: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Background: Pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for depression, anxiety, and insomnia. eHealth interventions provide a promising and accessible treatment alternative to face-to-face interventions. Objective: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the effectiveness of eHealth interventions in preventing and treating depression, anxiety, and insomnia during pregnancy. Secondary aims are to identify demographic and intervention moderators of effectiveness. Methods: A total of 5 databases (PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane) were searched from inception to May 2021. Terms related to eHealth, pregnancy, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), depression, anxiety, and insomnia were included. RCTs and pilot RCTs were included if they reported an eHealth intervention for the prevention or treatment of depression, anxiety, or insomnia in pregnant women. Study screening, data extractions, and quality assessment were conducted independently by 2 reviewers from an 8-member research team (KAS, PRS, Hangsel Sanguino, Roshni Sohail, Jasleen Kaur, Songyang (Mark) Jin, Makayla Freeman, and Beatrice Valmana). Random-effects meta-analyses of pooled effect sizes were conducted to determine the effect of eHealth interventions on prenatal mental health. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to identify potential moderators. Results: In total, 17 studies were included in this review that assessed changes in depression (11/17, 65%), anxiety (10/17, 59%), and insomnia (3/17, 18%). Several studies included both depression and anxiety symptoms as outcomes (7/17, 41%). The results indicated that during pregnancy, eHealth interventions showed small effect sizes for preventing and treating symptoms of anxiety and depression and a moderate effect size for treating symptoms of insomnia. With the exception of intervention type for the outcome of depressive symptoms, where mindfulness interventions outperformed other intervention types, no significant moderators were detected. Conclusions: eHealth interventions are an accessible and promising resource for treating symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia during pregnancy. However, more research is necessary to identify ways to increase the efficacy of eHealth interventions for this population.

"Sensing Apps and Public Data Sets for Digital Phenotyping of Mental Health: Systematic Review","Background: Mental disorders are normally diagnosed exclusively on the basis of symptoms, which are identified from patientsâ€™ interviews and self-reported experiences. To make mental health diagnoses and monitoring more objective, different solutions have been proposed such as digital phenotyping of mental health (DPMH), which can expand the ability to identify and monitor health conditions based on the interactions of people with digital technologies. Objective: This article aims to identify and characterize the sensing applications and public data sets for DPMH from a technical perspective. Methods: We performed a systematic review of scientific literature and data sets. We searched 8 digital libraries and 20 data set repositories to find results that met the selection criteria. We conducted a data extraction process from the selected articles and data sets. For this purpose, a form was designed to extract relevant information, thus enabling us to answer the research questions and identify open issues and research trends. Results: A total of 31 sensing apps and 8 data sets were identified and reviewed. Sensing apps explore different context data sources (eg, positioning, inertial, ambient) to support DPMH studies. These apps are designed to analyze and process collected data to classify (n=11) and predict (n=6) mental states/disorders, and also to investigate existing correlations between context data and mental states/disorders (n=6). Moreover, general-purpose sensing apps are developed to focus only on contextual data collection (n=9). The reviewed data sets contain context data that model different aspects of human behavior, such as sociability, mood, physical activity, sleep, with some also being multimodal. Conclusions: This systematic review provides in-depth analysis regarding solutions for DPMH. Results show growth in proposals for DPMH sensing apps in recent years, as opposed to a scarcity of public data sets. The review shows that there are features that can be measured on smart devices that can act as proxies for mental status and well-being;however, it should be noted that the combined evidence for high-quality features for mental states remains limited. DPMH presents a great perspective for future research, mainly to reach the needed maturity for applications in clinical settings.","Mendes, Jean P.

"Remotely Delivered Interventions to Support Women With Symptoms of Anxiety in Pregnancy: Mixed Methods Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Background: Symptoms of anxiety are common in pregnancy, with severe symptoms associated with negative outcomes for women and babies. Low-level psychological therapy is recommended for women with mild to moderate anxiety, with the aim of preventing an escalation of symptoms and providing coping strategies. Remotely delivered interventions have been suggested to improve access to treatment and support and provide a cost-effective, flexible, and timely solution. Objective: This study identifies and evaluates remotely delivered, digital, or web-based interventions to support women with symptoms of anxiety during pregnancy. Methods: This mixed methods systematic review followed a convergent segregated approach to synthesize qualitative and quantitative data. The ACM Digital Library, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Applied Social Sciences Index and s, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination database, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, Health Technology Assessment Library, IEEE Xplore, Joanna Briggs Institute, Maternity and Infant Care, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Social Science Citation Index were searched in October 2020. Quantitative or qualitative primary research that included pregnant women and evaluated remotely delivered interventions reporting measures of anxiety, fear, stress, distress, womenâ€™s views, and opinions were included. Results: Overall, 3 qualitative studies and 14 quantitative studies were included. Populations included a general antenatal population and pregnant women having anxiety and depression, fear of childbirth, insomnia, and preterm labor. Interventions included cognitive behavioral therapy, problem solving, mindfulness, and educational designs. Most interventions were delivered via web-based platforms, and 62% (8/13) included direct contact from trained therapists or coaches. A meta-analysis of the quantitative data found internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy and facilitated interventions showed a beneficial effect in relation to the reduction of anxiety scores (standardized mean difference -0.49, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.22;standardized mean difference -0.48, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.22). Due to limitations in the amount of available data and study quality, the findings should be interpreted with caution. Synthesized findings found some evidence to suggest that interventions are more effective when women maintain regular participation which may be enhanced by providing regular contact with therapists or peer support, appropriate targeting of interventions involving components of relaxation and cognitive-based skills, and providing sufficient sessions to develop new skills without being too time consuming. Conclusions: There is limited evidence to suggest that women who are pregnant may benefit from remotely delivered interventions. Components of interventions that may improve the effectiveness and acceptability of remotely delivered interventions included providing web-based contact with a therapist, health care professional, or peer community. Women may be more motivated to complete interventions that are perceived as relevant or tailored to their needs. Remote interventions may also provide women with greater anonymity to help them feel more confident in disclosing their symptoms.","Evans, Kerry, Rennick-Egglestone, Stefan, Cox, Serena, Kuipers, Yvonne, Spiby, Helen","https://doi.org/10.2196/28093","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Medical Internet Research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28087,""
"A Conceptual Framework to Design Connected Mental Health Solutions in the United Arab Emirates: Questionnaire Study","Background: Connected mental health (CMH) is a field presenting information and communications technologyâ€“based mental care interventions that could help overcome many mental care delivery barriers. Culture and background influence peopleâ€™s attitudes, preferences, and acceptance of such solutions. Therefore, the suitability of CMH solutions to the targeted population is an important factor in their successful adoption. Objective: The aim of this study is to develop a framework for the design and creation of CMH solutions suitable for the UAE context. The framework is based on investigating enablers and barriers of CMH adoption in the United Arab Emirates, from the mental health professional's (MHP) perspective and from related literature. Methods: A survey of literature on relevant studies addressing the use of technology for mental care in Arab countries, and a web-based questionnaire-based survey with 17 MHPs practicing in the United Arab Emirates investigating their attitudes and views toward CMH was conducted. Results from the questionnaire and from related studies were analyzed to develop the design framework. Results: On the basis of findings from the literature survey and analyzing MHP answers to the web-based survey, a framework for the design of CMH solutions for the UAE population was developed. The framework presents four types of recommendation categories: favorable criteria, which included blended care, anonymity, and ease of use;cultural factors including availability in multiple languages, mainly Arabic and English, in addition to religious and cultural considerations;technical considerations, including good-quality communication, availability in formats compatible with mobile phones, and providing technical support;and usersâ€™ health and data safety considerations, including usersâ€™ suitability testing, confidentiality, and ensuring MHP integrity. Conclusions: CMH has the potential to help overcome many mental care barriers in the United Arab Emirates in particular and in the Arab world in general. CMH adoption in the United Arab Emirates has a potential for success. However, many factors should be taken into account, mainly cultural, religious, and linguistic aspects.","Drissi, Nidal, Ouhbi, Sofia, Amiri, Leena, Fadwa Al, Mugaddam, Jan, Reem K.; Isomursu, Minna","https://doi.org/10.2196/27675","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Formative Research; 6(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28088,""
"Internet-Based Audiologist-Guided Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Tinnitus: Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: Tinnitus is a symptom that can be very distressing owing to hearing sounds not related to any external sound source. Managing tinnitus is notoriously difficult, and access to evidence-based care is limited. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a tinnitus management strategy with the most evidence of effectiveness but is rarely offered to those distressed by tinnitus. The provision of internet-based CBT for tinnitus overcomes accessibility barriers;however, it is not currently readily available in the United States. Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of internet-based CBT compared with that of weekly monitoring for the management of tinnitus in reducing tinnitus distress;reducing tinnitus-related comorbidities, including tinnitus cognitions, insomnia, anxiety, and depression;and assessing the stability of the intervention effects 2 months after the intervention. Methods: A 2-arm randomized clinical trial comparing audiologist-guided internet-based CBT (n=79) to a weekly monitoring group (n=79) with a 2-month follow-up assessed the efficacy of internet-based CBT. Eligible participants included adults seeking help for tinnitus. Recruitment was conducted on the web using an open-access website. Participants were randomized via 1:1 allocation, but blinding was not possible. The study was undertaken by English or Spanish speakers on the web. The primary outcome was a change in tinnitus distress as measured using the Tinnitus Functional Index. Secondary outcome measures included anxiety, depression, insomnia, tinnitus cognition, hearing-related difficulties, and quality of life. Results: Internet-based CBT led to a greater reduction in tinnitus distress (mean 36.57, SD 22) compared with that in weekly monitoring (mean 46.31, SD 20.63;effect size: Cohen d=0.46, 95% CI 0.14-0.77) using an intention-to-treat analysis. For the secondary outcomes, there was a greater reduction in negative tinnitus cognition and insomnia. The results remained stable over the 2-month follow-up period. No important adverse events were observed. Further, 16% (10/158) of participants withdrew, with low overall compliance rates for questionnaire completion of 72.3% (107/148) at T1, 61% (91/148) at T2, and 42% (62/148) at T3. Conclusions: This study is the first to evaluate and indicate the efficacy of audiologist-delivered internet-based CBT in reducing tinnitus distress in a US population. It was also the first study to offer internet-based CBT in Spanish to accommodate the large Hispanic population in the United States. The results have been encouraging, and further work is indicated in view of making such an intervention applicable to a wider population. Further work is required to improve compliance and attract more Spanish speakers.

"Characteristics of Mobile Health Platforms for Depression and Anxiety: Content Analysis Through a Systematic Review of the Literature and Systematic Search of Two App Stores","Background: Mobile health (mHealth) platforms show promise in the management of mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. This has resulted in an abundance of mHealth platforms available for research or commercial use. Objective: The objective of this review is to characterize the current state of mHealth platforms designed for anxiety or depression that are available for research, commercial use, or both. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using a two-pronged approach: searching relevant literature with prespecified search terms to identify platforms in published research and simultaneously searching 2 major app storesâ€”Google Play Store and Apple App Storeâ€”to identify commercially available platforms. Key characteristics of the mHealth platforms were synthesized, such as platform name, targeted condition, targeted group, purpose, technology type, intervention type, commercial availability, and regulatory information. Results: The literature and app store searches yielded 169 and 179 mHealth platforms, respectively. Most platforms developed for research purposes were designed for depression (116/169, 68.6%), whereas the app store search reported a higher number of platforms developed for anxiety (Android: 58/179, 32.4%;iOS: 27/179, 15.1%). The most common purpose of platforms in both searches was treatment (literature search: 122/169, 72.2%;app store search: 129/179, 72.1%). With regard to the types of intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy and referral to care or counseling emerged as the most popular options offered by the platforms identified in the literature and app store searches, respectively. Most platforms from both searches did not have a specific target age group. In addition, most platforms found in app stores lacked clinical and real-world evidence, and a small number of platforms found in the published research were available commercially. Conclusions: A considerable number of mHealth platforms designed for anxiety or depression are available for research, commercial use, or both. The characteristics of these mHealth platforms greatly vary. Future efforts should focus on assessing the qualityâ€”utility, safety, and effectivenessâ€”of the existing platforms and providing developers, from both commercial and research sectors, a reporting guideline for their platform description and a regulatory framework to facilitate the development, validation, and deployment of effective mHealth platforms.","Qiao Ying, Leong, Sridhar, Shreya, Blasiak, Agata, Tadeo, Xavier, Yeo, GeckHong, Remus, Alexandria, Ho, Dean","https://doi.org/10.2196/27388","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Medical Internet Research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28090,""
"â€˜Best day since the bad germs cameâ€™: Exploring changing experiences in and the value of coastal blue space during the COVID-19 pandemic, a Fylde Coast case study","Blue spaces have long been associated with beneficially impacting human health and wellbeing. This article reflects upon the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people?s experiences in coastal blue space and the health and wellbeing benefits derived from exposure to the space. Undertaken after the UK?s first lockdown during Summer 2020, the work employed a qualitative mixed methods approach through a survey and interviews to provide an in-depth case study of people?s experiences in and value of coastal blue space before and during the pandemic on the Fylde Coast in Lancashire. Findings show that participants valued the physical and mental health benefits derived from routine visits to coastal space, stimulated by emotional connections, a sense of escape and sensorial immersion. However, a busier coast in the lockdown?s aftermath provoked a changed experience in coastal space for many participants due to a detachment from coastal space and the provoking of negative emotional experiences driven by heightened fears, reduced safety and increased litter. Mitigatory responses, through a changed coastal routine, and reflective responses, through a changed value of the coast, were found, the latter due to an increased appreciation of the health benefits from coastal exposure for some participants. Importantly, the findings highlight the need for coastal management to account for these experiences in protecting the health value of coastal space.","Earl, Joseph, Gormally-Sutton, Alexandra, Ilic, Suzana, James, Mike R.","https://doi.org/10.1177/26349817211065321","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Coastal Studies & Society;: 26349817211065321, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28091,""
"Predicting Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Do Socioeconomic Factors Matter?","Background and purpose:The COVID-19 pandemic has posed considerable challenges to people?s mental health, and the prevalence of anxiety and depression increased substantially during the pandemic. Early detection of potential depression is crucial for timely preventive interventions;therefore, there is a need for depression prediction.Data and methods:This study was based on survey data collected from 5001 Norwegians (3001 in 2020 and 2000 in 2021). Machine learning models were used to predict depression risk and to select models with the best performance for each pandemic phase. Probability thresholds were chosen based on cost-sensitive analysis, and measures such as accuracy (ACC) and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the models? performance.Results:The study found that decision tree models and regularised regressions had the best performance in both 2020 and 2021. For the 2020 predictions, the highest accuracies were obtained using gradient boosting machines (ACC = 0.72, AUC = 0.74) and random forest algorithm (ACC = 0.71, AUC = 0.75). For the 2021 predictions, the random forest (ACC = 0.76, AUC = 0.78) and elastic net regularisation (ACC = 0.76, AUC = 0.78) exhibited the best performances. Highly ranked predictors of depression that remained stable over time were self-perceived exposure risks, income, compliance with nonpharmaceutical interventions, frequency of being outdoors, contact with family and friends and work?life conflict. While epidemiological factors (having COVID symptoms or having close contact with the infected) influenced the level of psychological distress to a larger extent in the relatively early stage of pandemic, the importance of socioeconomic factors (gender, age, household type and employment status) increased substantially in the later stage.Conclusion: Machine learning models consisting of demographic, socioeconomic, behavioural and epidemiological features can be used for fast ?first-hand? screening to diagnose mental health problems. The models may be helpful for stakeholders and healthcare providers to provide early diagnosis and intervention, as well as to provide insight into forecasting which social groups are more vulnerable to mental illness in which social settings.","Bakkeli, Nan Zou","https://doi.org/10.1177/08944393211069622","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Science Computer Review;: 08944393211069622, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28092,""
"Adapting a School-Based Motivational Interviewing Mentoring Program for Use in India","We report on the process of planning, adapting, and implementing a brief, instrumental, school-based mentoring curriculum originally developed in the United States, in three cities in India. India has the world?s largest population of young adults aged 10-24 years, a developmental period associated with heightened psychosocial stressors and the onset of mental health issues, as well as a dire shortage of mental health professionals. Moving services that are typically provided by highly skilled professionals to individuals with fewer credentials or less formal training (e.g., from psychologists to mentors) can increase access to adolescent mental health services. Yet, transferring programs internationally is accompanied by unique barriers including cultural differences, and should be guided by an established framework. In this paper, we discuss the formation of a research-practice partnership designed to generate applied knowledge through emic cultural perspectives. We describe each stage of the program adaptation process within the Cultural Adaptation Framework ( Fendt-Newlin et al., 2020), including our decisions to strategically adjust, remove, or retain content from the original mentoring intervention. Although program delivery was prematurely discontinued due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we provide a brief synopsis of lessons learned through the international partnership.","Hart, Mackenzie J.; Sable, Rahul, Gupta, Arundhuti, Boddu, Jean, McQuillin, Samuel D.","https://doi.org/10.1177/01430343221080782","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: School Psychology International;: 01430343221080782, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28093,""

Two-wave longitudinal research was conducted i one hundred six college students completing measures of affective experiences, mental health, and quality of life during the prepandemic and lockdown periods. Increased negative affect and internalizing symptoms during the prepandemic period and decreased positive affect and increased perceived stress during the lockdown period both significantly predicted increased internalizing symptoms during the lockdown period.

"The Death-Based Model of Organizational Learning: Accident, Pandemic, and Workplace Change in New York Public Transit","The public transportation workers of New York City lost their lives to COVID-19 at a shocking rate in the spring of 2020, likely abetted by their employer?s resistance to allow workers to wear masks until mere days before a region-wide lockdown was declared. We might see this death toll as a tragic outcome of uncertainty in the face of the unprecedented, yet the stance of the employer (the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, or MTA) was consistent with its longstanding reluctance to assimilate or pursue signals that suggest need for safety reforms ? that is, until a worker dies. This article terms this pattern a ?death-based model of organizational learning,? and situates the virus? toll on transport workers from three angles: first, from workers? experience of existential precarity in their workplaces, rooted in dangers workers readily problematize but which are not addressed by management;second, by showing how the MTA may modify rules following an employee fatality, at least when that death cannot be explained by individual failures alone;and third, by exploring the MTA?s longstanding hostility to health and safety research conducted in its physical and institutional bounds. These prior patterns articulated in the MTA?s response to COVID-19, such as in passivity in the face of general public health guidelines, disinterest in obvious founts of expertise to tailor its response to the pandemic, and in the eventual acceptance of a nascent public health role in light of the mounting death toll of its employees.","McClain, Noah","https://doi.org/10.1177/00027642211066052","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: American Behavioral Scientist;: 00027642211066052, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28095,""

Much enthusiasm exists to imagine how teaching practices can be enriched within the so-called ?new normal.? The physical and mental health benefits associated with school physical education have attracted considerable attention during the pandemic. Capitalizing on the raised awareness of the many positive contributions of school physical education, a pressing priority is to now reengage children with physical activity in a manner that promotes enjoyable experiences and adaptive engagement with movement. In this paper, we draw from self-determination theory, physical literacy theory and socioecological perspectives to present the case for blended-gamified approaches as a means of reimagining physical education in a post-pandemic world. To support all young people to lead healthy and active lifestyles, we propose the use of a systematic and evidence-based approach to programme development, evaluation and implementation.

"The mental health and well-being of adults with intellectual disability during the COVID-19 pandemic: A narrative review","Prior to the start of the pandemic, adults with intellectual disability (ID) were more likely to experience mental health difficulties and face barriers obtaining mental health care. COVID-related public health restrictions, combined with heightened challenges to obtain timely mental health care, have served to worsen this situation internationally, with a combination of new onset conditions and worsening mental health for those already struggling. In this narrative review, we summarize literature on the mental health of adults with ID during the COVID-19 pandemic to describe what is known based on clinician perceptions, existing administrative health data, family and staff perceptions, and self-report. In addition to noting similarities and differences in findings based on the source of information, we also explored how experiences differed depending on where and when the research was conducted. Based primarily on research conducted during the first six months of the pandemic, there is a consistent finding across sources of increased anxiety, stress, and isolation. This review also explored the delivery of virtual mental health care and the impact of pandemic-based mental health interventions. There have been very few research studies evaluating clinical care during this time but clinicians have managed to provide supports virtually, which has been evaluated positively by some individuals. This narrative review concludes by identifying gaps in the literature and suggests key directions for future mental health research, policy, and practice efforts. Any mental health efforts now and during pandemic recovery need to have an understanding of how the mental health needs and services for adults with ID have evolved over the course of the pandemic. Further research is needed on the impact of both clinical interventions and other nonclinical efforts on the mental health of people with ID.","Lunsky, Yona, Jahoda, Andrew, Navas, Patricia, Campanella, Sabrina, Havercamp, Susan M.","https://doi.org/10.1111/jppi.12412","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Policy and Practice in Intellectual Disabilities; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28097,""

Objetiva-se analisar as notÃ­cias falsas veiculadas no contexto da pandemia pelo novo coronavÃ­rus. Materiais e mÃ©todos: Pesquisa documental realizada com base no portal de notÃ­cias do MinistÃ©rio da SaÃºde do Brasil intitulado ""SaÃºde sem Fake News"". Foram identificadas as publicaÃ§Ãµes ocorridas de dezembro/2019 a marÃ§o/2020, por meio das seguintes palavras-chave: coronavÃ­rus e COVID-19. Para a apreciaÃ§Ã£o dos dados, foi adotada a anÃ¡lise de conteÃºdo proposta por Bardin. Resultados: Foram identificadas 66 publicaÃ§Ãµes, com o total de 92 fake news. A anÃ¡lise revelou as caracterÃ­sticas comuns Ã s fake news, dentre elas: manchetes e imagens chamativas, dados alarmantes e disseminaÃ§Ã£o cÃ­clica. AlÃ©m disso, as mÃ­dias sociais despontaram como importante via de disseminaÃ§Ã£o e, para conferir efeito de verdade ao dito, a atribuiÃ§Ã£o da autoria a Ã³rgÃ£os ou profissionais da saÃºde foi comum.

The objective is to analyze fake news published in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: A documentary research was conducted based on the Brazilian Ministry of Health news website titled ""Health without fake news"". Coronavirus and COVID-19 were the keywords used to identify news published between December 2019 and March 2020. For data visualization, the content analysis approach developed by Bardin was applied. Results: 66 publications with a total of 92 fake news were identified. The analysis found common characteristics among fake news such as the use of flashy headlines and images, alarming data and circular diffusion. In addition, social networks emerged as an important means of diffusion in which, in order to give a sense of truthfulness to news, it was common to attribute the authorship of fake news to healthcare organizations or professionals. News articles were classified into six thematic groups in which prevention methods (32.6%) and natural history of the disease (28.2%) were the most common topics. Discussion: There is growing interest in topics related to the diffusion of information about coronavirus. Global research points out the importance of identifying and combating fake news by government and healthcare agencies. Conclusions: Fake news related to coronavirus poses a threat to individual and collective health, addresses a variety of issues and carries potential harm to physical and mental health.; IntroducciÃ³n: La infodemia, entendido como el alto flujo de informaciÃ³n, presenta un comportamiento similar al de los virus, ya que se propaga de persona a persona, lo que representa un nuevo reto para las autoridades sanitarias.

Materiales y mÃ©todos: Se realizÃ³ una investigaciÃ³n documental basada en el portal de noticias del Ministerio de Salud de Brasil con el tÃ­tulo de ""Salud sin noticias falsas"". Las palabras claves utilizadas para identificar las publicaciones realizadas entre diciembre de 2019 y marzo de 2020 fueron coronavirus y COVID-19. Para la visualizaciÃ³n de los datos, se incluyÃ³ el anÃ¡lisis de contenido propuesto por Bardin. Resultados: Se identificaron 66 publicaciones con un total de 92 noticias falsas. En el anÃ¡lisis se revelaron las caracterÃ­sticas comunes de las noticias falsas como el uso de titulares e imÃ¡genes llamativas, datos alarmantes y difusiÃ³n cÃ­clica. AsÃ­ mismo, las redes sociales surgieron como una importante vÃ­a de difusiÃ³n en las que, para dar una sensaciÃ³n de veracidad a estas noticias, era habitual atribuir la autorÃ­a de estas a organismos o profesionales sanitarios. Las noticias se clasificaron en seis grupos temÃ¡ticos, entre los que se encuentran los mÃ©todos de prevenciÃ³n (32.6%) y la historia natural de la enfermedad (28.2%) como los mÃ¡s frecuentes. DiscusiÃ³n: Se observa un creciente interÃ©s en los temas relacionados con la difusiÃ³n de informaciÃ³n sobre el nuevo coronavirus y las investigaciones a nivel mundial seÃ±alan la importancia de identificar y combatir las noticias falsas por parte del gobierno y las agencias de salud. Conclusiones: Las noticias falsas relacionadas con el nuevo coronavirus representan una amenaza para la salud individual y colectiva, abordan diversas temÃ¡ticas y conllevan daÃ±os potenciales para la salud fÃ­sica y mental.","Santos Alencar, Nadyelle Elias; Fernandes Lima, Francisca Fabiana; de Oliveira Gouveia, Marcia Teles; Freitas da Silva, Grazielle Roberta","https://revistas.udes.edu.co/cuidarte/article/view/1297/2201; https://fi-admin.bvsalud.org/document/view/4dbcb","","Database: COVIDWHO; LILACS; Publication type: article; Publication details: rev. cuid.

"Validation and Psychometric Properties of the Sri Lankan Versions of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (preprint)","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has created unprecedented mental health issues among the worldwide general population. One of the most reported consequences is the fear of COVID-19. The present study translated and validated the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) into Sri Lankan local languages (Sinhalese and Tamil). A total of 286 Sri Lankan adults participated in the study. Both translations of the FCV-19S demonstrated a good fit for the two-factor structure (TLI: 0.90 Sinhalese & 0.89 Tamil) and showed very good internal consistency (a = 0.85 Sinhalese, a = 0.88 Tamil). Concurrent validity indicated positive significant correlations with Kesslerâ€™s Psychological Distress Scale (Sinhalese: r=.305, p&lt;.01, Tamil: r=.306, p&lt;.01). The Sinhalese and Tamil FCV-19S demonstrated reliable and valid psychometric properties for assessing fear of COVID-19 among Sri Lankans.","Kanchana, Tanika Gayani, Jayamanne, Bernard Deepal, Griffiths, Mark","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1387004/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28100,""
"A Systematic Review on Digitalisation, Parenting, and Childrenâ€™s Mental Health in China amid the Pandemic (preprint)","While a raft of existing Chinese literature examines the associations between the outbreak of the pandemic and studentsâ€™ mental health, rarely do Chinese studies assess the nuanced relationships between digital learning, parenting, and studentsâ€™ mental health since the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Such a rarely discussed topic has substantial scholarly value as mismanagement of digital learning and parenting, such as the exposure to cyberbullying and negative parenting during the public health crisis, could add substantial, unforeseeable psychological burdens for Chinese students. In this article, the author applied a systematic review to find all relevant Chinese literature that contains the words â€œdigital learningâ€, â€œchildren/adolescentsâ€, â€œmental healthâ€, and â€œparentingâ€ published since January 2020. As such a complex topic has rarely been addressed in Chinese contexts, the author was only able to find four related scholarly articles. The author summarises the arguments and empirical findings to explore the nuanced relationships between a) digitalisation, isolation, parenting, and childrenâ€™s mental health, b) parenting, teacher-student relationships, and studentsâ€™ mental health, and c) maternal and paternal parenting styles.","Hung, Jason","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202203.0057.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28101,""
"Short-term improvement of mental health after a COVID-19 vaccination (preprint)","Importance The role of COVID-19 vaccination on the mental health of the general population remains poorly understood. Objective To assess the short-term change of depressive and anxiety symptoms in relation to COVID-19 vaccination among Swedish adults. Design A prospective cohort study with monthly data collections on self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms from December 2020 to October 2021 and COVID-19 vaccination from July to October 2021. Setting The Omtanke2020 Study, Sweden. Participants 7,925 participants of the Omtanke2020 study with complete data on depressive and anxiety symptoms and vaccination status. Intervention(s) or Exposure(s) Receiving the first or second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Main outcomes(s) and Measure(s) Binary measures of depression (PHQ-9, cut-off =10) and anxiety (GAD-7, cut-off =10) one month before the first dose, one month after the first dose, and, if applicable, one month after the second dose. For individuals not vaccinated or chose to not report vaccination status (unvaccinated individuals), we selected three monthly measures of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 with 2-month intervals in-between based on data availability. Results 5,079 (64.1%) individuals received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, 1,977 (24.9%) received one dose, 305 (3.9%) were not vaccinated, and 564 (7.1%) chose not to report vaccination status. There was a lower prevalence of depression and anxiety among vaccinated, compared with unvaccinated, individuals, especially after the second dose. Among individuals receiving two doses of vaccine, the prevalence of depression and anxiety was lower after both first (aRR=0.82, 95%CI 0.76-0.88 for depression;aRR=0.81, 95%CI 0.73-0.89 for anxiety) and second (aRR=0.79, 95%CI 0.73-0.85 for depression;aRR=0.73, 95%CI 0.66-0.81 for anxiety) dose, compared with before vaccination. Similar results were observed among individuals receiving only one dose (aRR=0.76, 95%CI 0.68-0.84 for depression;aRR=0.82, 95%CI 0.72-0.94 for anxiety, comparing after first dose to before vaccination). These results were independent of age, sex, recruitment type, body mass index, smoking, relationship status, history of psychiatric disorder, number of comorbidities, COVID-19 infection status, and seasonality. Conclusions and Relevance We observed a positive short-term change in depressive and anxiety symptoms among adults receiving a COVID-19 vaccine in the current pandemic. Key points Question Is COVID-19 vaccination associated with a short-term change in mental health? Findings This longitudinal study included 7,925 Swedish adults with self-reported COVID-19 vaccination and symptoms of mental health responding from December 2020 to October 2021. The prevalence of depressive or anxiety symptoms was lower one month after vaccination compared to one month before vaccination. The effect size was greater among individuals receiving two doses of vaccine, compared with those receiving only one dose. Meaning Receiving vaccination against COVID-19 is associated with short-term improvement in mental health.","Chourpiliadis, Charilaos, Lovik, AnikÃ³, KÃ¤hler, Anna, ValdimarsdÃ³ttir, Unnur, Frans, Emma, Nyberg, Fredrik, Sullivan, Patrick, Fang, Fang","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.22.22271327","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28102,""
"Psychiatric emergencies during, after, and before the COVID-19 lockdown;what happened to our patients? A naturalistic observational study (preprint)","Background:  Despite concerns on mental health problems related to COVID19 lockdown, recent reports revealed a reduction in psychiatric admissions in Emergency Departments (ED) during the lockdown period compared with the previous year in several countries. Most of the existing studies focused on the first lockdown not considering the different phases of the COVID-19 crisis. The present study aimed to analyze differences in ED admission for psychiatric consultation during three different phases of the COVID-19 pandemia in Italy. Methods: Information on ED admission for psychiatric consultations were retrospectively collected at the ED of the Santo Spirito Hospital in Rome (Italy), and compared between the three periods: the lockdown (March - June 2020) and the post-lockdown period (June 2020 - June 2021) compared to the pre-lockdown (January 2019 - March 2020). Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the risk of accessing ED for psychiatric consultation before, during, after the lockdown. Results: 3,871 ED psychiatric consultations were collected. A significant reduction of psychiatric consultations in ED during the lockdown period and the post-lockdown (H: 762,45;p&lt;0.001) was documented. Multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that compared to pre-lockdown during the lockdown and post-lockdown patients were more likely to be men (RRR: 1.52;95% CI: 1.10 - 2.12) and more often diagnosed with non-severe mental illnesses (nSMI) (relative risk ratio [RRR]: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.10 - 2.15;and 1.72, 95% CI: 1.42 - 2.08);during the lockdown, patients were also more often diagnosed with alcohol/substance abuse (A&S) (RRR: 1.70;95% CI: 1.10 - 2.65). Conclusions: Several changes in the clinical characteristics of psychiatric consultations during and after the lockdown emerged from the present study;nSMI and A&S abuse patients were more likely to present at the ED in the lockdown and post-lockdown periods while SMI patients appeared to be less likely. These may inform clinicians and future preventive strategies among community mental health services.","Brandizzi, Martina, Polselli, Annalivia, Corigliano, Valentina, Tamorri, Stefano Maria, Venturini, Paola, Azzoni, Antonella, Grasso, Silvia, Onofri, Antonio, Pesce, Salvatore, Romani, Fiammetta, Polselli, Gian Marco, Forte, Alberto","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1391996/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28103,""
"Online academic satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic in medical students: role of sleep, emotions, college adjustment, and digital skills (preprint)","Background:  The measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, led to significant changes in university education, resulting in the new normal standard of virtual teaching in many undergraduate medical schools worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to determine the factors related to academic satisfaction with virtual teaching in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : A cross-sectional-analytical study was conducted on medical students at a private university in Peru, through self-reported questionnaires divided into sociodemographic data and variables of interest that could influence academic satisfaction during the pandemic. To evaluate possible factors related to academic satisfaction, stepwise regression models were performed for both sexes. Results: : In total, data from 310 medical students, 117 males and 193 females, were analyzed. Academic satisfaction reached a score of 11.2 Â± 2.9, which was similar in both sexes. The best regression model for males (AIC: 544.32;RMSE: 2.42;R 2 0.30) showed that adaptation to university life (favorable change) and depression (unfavorable change) explained 30% of changes in students' academic satisfaction. While in females (AIC: 907.59;RMSE: 2.49;R 2 0.22) the model integrated favorable factors such as adjustment to college life and anxiety;while depression and poor sleep quality were unfavorable factors. Conclusion:  Factors that contributed to academic satisfaction in medical students were determined in this study, which differed by gender. Thus, it is important to take into account the particularities of male and female medical students in order to improve their academic satisfaction during their university careers.","Medina-Ramirez, Sebastian, Rojas-Humpire, Ricardo, Canaza, Josue, Hernandez, Fiorella, Huancahuire-Vega, SalomÃ³n","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.76127.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28104,""
"Mental Health of Korean Adolescents in the Era of COVID-19: Web-based Survey Focused on Suicide-related Factors (preprint)","Background:  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively impacted many aspects of life. In particular, measures for combatting the spread of the virus, such as quarantining and restrictions on social gatherings, may have led to psychological anxiety and depressive symptoms among adolescents. Such mental health impacts may increase the risk of suicidal ideation. This study aimed to examine mental health among adolescents amid the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, and identify and analyze predictors of suicidal ideation, suicide planning, and suicide attempts. Methods: : Data for 57,925 adolescents who participated in the 2020 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey were used for this research. Based on their responses to suicide-related questions, the sample was divided into a healthy group, suicide-ideation group, suicide-planning group, and suicide-attempt group, respectively. The groupsâ€™ descriptive statistics were then analyzed. An analysis of covariance, post-hoc tests, and multiple logistic regression were performed on the four groups. Results: : Overall, 6.9% of the participants reported suicidal ideation, 2.2% reported planning suicide, and 1.9% reported attempting suicide in the previous 12 months. Stress, sadness and despair, loneliness, and generalized anxiety disorder were all highest in the suicide-attempt group and lowest in the healthy group. Sex, academic achievement, economic status, impact of COVID-19 on economic status, sleep, alcohol use, drug use, smartphone overdependence, and suicide-associated factors significantly predicted adolescentsâ€™ mental health status. Conclusions: : Amid the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, there is a strong need for various individualized programs that identify and intervene to support adolescents with a suicidal risk by accurately assessing their mental health risk factors, such as stress, sadness and despair, loneliness, and generalized anxiety disorder.","Jeong, Yeong Mi, Park, Hye Seon, Kim, Sang Mi","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1385359/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28105,""
"Mental health and alcohol use among patients attending a post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic: a cohort study (preprint)","Background:  Ongoing mental health problems following COVID-19 infection warrant greater examination. This study aimed to investigate psychiatric symptoms and problematic alcohol use among Long COVID patients. Methods: : The study was conducted at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospitalâ€™s post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic in Dublin, Ireland. A prospective cohort study design was used encompassing assessment of patientsâ€™ outcomes at 2-4 months following an initial clinic visit (Time 1), and 7â€“14-month follow-up (Time 2). Outcomes regarding participantsâ€™ demographics, acute COVID-19 healthcare use, mental health, and alcohol use were examined. Results: : The baseline sampleâ€™s (n = 153) median age = 43.5yrs (females = 105 (68.6%)). Sixty-seven of 153 patients (43.8%) were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, 9/67 (13.4%) were admitted to ICU, and 17/67 (25.4%) were readmitted to hospital following an initial COVID-19 stay. Sixteen of 67 (23.9%) visited a GP within seven days of hospital discharge, and 26/67 (38.8%) did so within 30 days. Seventeen of 153 participants (11.1%) had a pre-existing affective disorder. The prevalence of clinical range depression, anxiety, and PTSD scores at Time 1 and Time 2 (n = 93) ranged from 12.9% (Time 1 anxiety) to 22.6% (Time 1 PTSD). No statistically significant differences were observed between Time 1 and Time 2 depression, anxiety, and PTSD scores. Problematic alcohol use was common at Time 1 (45.5%) and significantly more so at Time 2 (71.8%). Clinical range depression, anxiety, and PTSD scores were significantly more frequent among acute COVID-19 hospital admission and GP attendance (30 days) participants, as well as among participants with lengthy ICU stays, and those with a previous affective disorder diagnosis.

"Locked up at home : A cross-sectional study into the effects of COVID-19 lockdowns on domestic violence in households with children in Belgium (preprint)","Background:  Policymakers worldwide took measures to limit the spread of the COVID-19-virus. While these sanitary measures were necessary to fight the spread of the virus, several experts warned for a significant impact on mental health and a potential increase in domestic violence. To study the impact of the COVID-19 measures in Belgium, and the factors influencing the occurrence of domestic violence, we set up the study on relationships, stress, and aggression. In this study, we evaluate the prevalence of domestic violence victimization during the COVID-19 lockdown in Belgian children aged zero to seventeen years and the associations of the parentsâ€™ financial status, relationships, mental health, and previous victimization to the childâ€™s victimization. Methods: A stepwise forward binary logistic regression was used to analyse the association between multiple risk factors of domestic violence and victimization of the respondentâ€™s child. The respondent being an assailant, the respondentâ€™s age, and the age of the children in the household were added as moderators. Results: In this model an association with domestic child abuse was found for the age of the respondent, the householdâ€™s size, the presence of children between zero and five years in the household, the perceived stress level of the respondent, and victimization of the respondent during the first wave of the sanitary measures, as well as victimization before the COVID-19 pandemic. None of the interacting effects were found to be significant. Conclusion: It is advisable to make extra efforts to improve well-being when maintaining sanitary measures by providing appropriate assistance and helping households struggling with increased or acute stress to install positive coping strategies - especially in larger households with children between six and 17 years. Besides, our findings draw attention to the clustering of risk of child and adult violence exposure in lockdown situations as well as to the potential cumulative impact of exposure to violence across the lifespan and across generations. It is key to invest in training healthcare workers and staff at schools to screen for and assess risks of domestic violence development and ongoing or past occurrence in order to detect, refer and follow-up on families at risk.","Fomenko, Elizaveta, De Schrijver, Lotte, Vandeviver, Christophe, Keygnaert, Ines","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1355725/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28107,""
"Living with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic: insights into identity from the IDEAL cohort (preprint)","The continuing COVID-19 pandemic and social restrictions have impacted on the cognitive decline and mental health of people with dementia. Social isolation and loss of activities due to social restrictions may also have implications as to sense of identity for people with dementia. As part of the INCLUDE component of the IDEAL cohort study, the overall aim of this subtle realist qualitative study was to explore the perspectives of people with dementia on living through the COVID-19 pandemic in England and Wales during the post-vaccine time period;also with focus on the study findings in relation to understandings of identity in dementia. Seven people with mild-to-moderate dementia were interviewed, and themes derived using framework analysis. Themes suggest intervieweesâ€™ stoic acceptance of the pandemic and social restrictions but also fear of decline related to the temporality of their condition as well as loss of self-confidence to re-engage with the world, and loss of social connections. Under threat due to lack of access to dementia groups, the importance of a shared, social identity, particularly for people with young-onset dementia, was apparent. With valued activities also prevented or reinvented during the pandemic, the relevance of occupation for identity is discussed. Although under continued pressure, services must consider how people with dementia and their family caregivers can best be supported during the ongoing pandemic.","Stapley, Sally, Pentecost, Claire, Collins, Rachel, Quinn, Catherine, Dawson, Eleanor, Morris, Robin, Sabatini, Serena, Thom, Jeanette, Clare, Linda","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1401908/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28108,""

"The Health Organization Resilience in Covid-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background:  Health care facilities are responsible for preventing and controlling diseases and must have sufficient resilience to deal with crises. Iranian health care facilities have faced challenges in managing COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to identify the challenges to the resilience of Iranian health care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide appropriate solutions. Methods: : This qualitative study was conducted with a phenomenological approach and using semi-structured interviews with 59 managers, policy makers, health system experts, and faculty members. The participants were selected through snowball sampling. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: : The resilience challenges of Iranian health care facilities were classified into eight groups: leadership and management;planning;organizational culture;organizational learning;employee management;customer management;resource management;and process management. The most important resilience challenges were: lack of an integrated management system;poor leadership;incompatibility of the management system and the network structure;lack of a national program;poor case detection program;lack of resources;inefficient information system;negative attitude of managers and employee;organizational inertia;failure to build on lessons learned from crises;lack of workforce preparedness;lack of community-based management;declining social capital;and lack of oversight. Managers must use community-based, evidence-based, and integrated management to build resilience against COVID-19, have sufficient knowledge and experience to organize operations, use appropriate and effective coordination models, develop a creative and participatory culture, reengineer structures and processes, and provide the necessary resources.

"Global research on syndemics: a meta-knowledge analysis (2001-2020) (preprint)","Background:  Syndemics or synergies of cooccurring epidemics are widely studied across health and social sciences in recent years. Methods: We conducted a meta-knowledge analysis of articles published between 2001 to 2020 in this growing field of academic scholarship. Results: We found a total of 830 articles authored by 3025 authors, mostly from high-income countries. Publications on syndemics are gradually increasing since 2003, with rapid development in 2013. Each article was cited more than 15 times on average, and most (n = 604) articles were original studies. Syndemics research focused on several areas, including HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, mental health, gender minority stressors, racism, violence, chronic physical and mental disorders, food insecurity, social determinants of health, and coronavirus disease 2019. Moreover, biopsychosocial interactions between multiple health problems were studied across medical, anthropological, public health, and other disciplines of science. Conclusions: The limited yet rapidly evolving literature on syndemics informs transdisciplinary interests to understand complex coexisting health challenges in the context of systematic exclusion and structural violence in vulnerable populations.

Since the mental health of home-HCWs and related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic have not been clarified, we aimed to investigate the status and associated factors of the fear of COVID-19 infection, anxiety, and depression among home-HCWs in Japan. Methods: A multicenter cross-sectional web-based anonymous survey of home-HCWs was conducted in August 2021, during the fifth wave of the pandemic in Japan. We surveyed members of facilities that provide home visit services during the COVID-19 pandemic. We measured the Japanese version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S-J) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) as objective variables, and the Japanese version of the Assessment of Interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale-II (J-AITCS-II) as an explanatory variable. Results: A total of 328 members of 37 facilities responded to the survey, and we ultimately analyzed 311 participants. The most frequent occupation was nurse (32.8%), followed by doctor (24.8%) and medical office staff (18.0%). The mean score of the FCV-19S-J was 16.5 Â± 5.0 (7.0 â€“ 31.0), and the prevalences of definitive anxiety and depression were 7.4% and 15.7%, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the J-AITCS-II teamwork subscale was significantly negatively associated with FCV-19S-J, HADS-anxiety, and HADS-depression (ÃŸ=-0.171, p= 0.004;ÃŸ=-0.151, p=0.012;ÃŸ=-0.225, p&lt;0.001). Medical office staff showed significant positive associations with FCV-19S-J and HADS-depression (ÃŸ=0.219, p= 0.005;ÃŸ=0.201, p=0.009), and medical social workers with HADS-anxiety and HADS-depression (ÃŸ=-0.166, p= 0.011;ÃŸ=-0.214, p&lt;0.001) compared to doctors. The unmet support need for expert lectures on COVID-19 was significantly positively associated with FCV-19S-J (ÃŸ=0.131, p= 0.048), and the unmet support need for support systems for psychological stress and emotional exhaustion was significantly positively associated with HADS-anxiety (ÃŸ=0.141, p= 0.022). Conclusions: Recognizing that different occupations experience different mental health issues, providing learning opportunities about COVID-19 and expert psychological support, and building good teamwork are important for maintaining the mental health of home-HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hamano, Jun, Tachikawa, Hirokazu, Takahashi, Sho, Ekoyama, Saori, Nagaoka, Hiroka, Ozone, Sachiko, Masumoto, Shoichi, Hosoi, Takahiro, Arai, Tetsuaki","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1178966/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28112,""
"COVID-19â€™s intersectional impact on work life, home life and wellbeing: A mixed-methods analysis of Georgia womenâ€™s experiences during the pandemic (preprint)","Background:  Women have been especially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to characterize women's adverse experiences related to their work lives, home lives and wellbeing during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and to describe demographic differences of those lived experiences. Methods: : Using the validated Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory, we collected data from reproductive-aged women in the state of Georgia about their exposure to adverse events during the pandemic. A latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to identify subgroups of women with similar endorsement of adverse experiences and describe their sociodemographic/economic characteristics. An optional open-ended question yielded qualitative data that were analyzed and combined with subgroup findings. Data were collected from September 2020 to January 2021. Results: : 423 women aged 18-49 completed the survey, with 314 (74.2%) providing qualitative responses. The LCA yielded 4 subgroups: (1) the largest subgroup (n=150, 35.5%) was characterized by relatively low probability of adverse experiences but high probability of negative changes in mental health and lifestyle;(2) a â€œcaregiving stressâ€ subgroup (n=104, 24.6%) had a high probability of challenges with home and work life, including increased conflict with a partner;(3) a â€œhigh exposureâ€ subgroup (n=46, 10.9%) with high probability of experiencing multiple adversities across domains (e.g., financial insecurity, health challenges, barriers to access to healthcare, intimate partner violence (IPV), and loss of loved ones) and more likely to be racial/ethnic or sexual minority women;and (4) a â€œlow exposureâ€ subgroup (n=123, 29.1%) with relatively low probability of adverse experiences across domains. Individuals in subgroups 1 and 4, which had low probabilities of adverse experiences, were significantly more likely to be non-Hispanic white. Qualitative insights expanding upon experiences and provided greater context for pandemic-related adversity with dominant themes reflecting stress, family, mental health, financial impact, and adaptation/resilience. Conclusions: : Though many individuals in our sample experienced hardship, minority populations were most impacted by pandemic-related adverse experiences in work life, home life, and wellbeing. Recovery and future emergency preparedness efforts in Georgia must incorporate support mechanisms for mental health and IPV, focusing especially on the complex needs of racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities.","McCool-Myers, Megan, Grasso, Damion, Kozlowski, Debra, Cordes, Sarah, Jean, Valerie, Gold, Heather, Goedken, Peggy","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1171339/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28113,""

"Advancing Syringe Services in the United States: The Untapped Role of the Americans with Disabilities Act (preprint); Americans with Disabilities Act | syringe service programs | COVID-19 | harm reduction services","The United States is facing an unprecedented set of public health challenges. Now killing nearly 1000 people daily, the COVID-19 pandemic is also compounding the ongoing crisis of addiction and risky substance use. Disruption in treatment and support services, economic shocks, despair and social isolation wrought by coronavirus have all impeded efforts to bend the overdose curveâ€”now surging again after a momentary deceleration prior to the onset of the pandemic. By the same token, there is evidence that people with substance use disorder are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and its deadly sequelae. Now more than ever, prevention and supportive services are vital to safeguarding the health of people with substance use disorder. Although access to substance use treatment has received substantial attention and support, harm reduction services are being left behind. These vital programs include syringe service programs (SSPs), naloxone distribution, drug checking, and supervised consumption facilities. Intended to address the needs of highly-stigmatized, criminalized people who use illicit drugs, SSPs have been shown especially effective as platforms for stemming bloodborne infections, preventing overdose, and facilitating access to a broad range of assistance, including COVID-19 testing, substance use treatment, housing, and other essential support.","Fletes, Abigail, Delos Reyes, Maria Katherine, Messinger, John C.; Blake, Valarie, Beletsky, Leo","https://www.google.com/search?q=Advancing+Syringe+Services+in+the+United+States:+The+Untapped+Role+of+the+Americans+with+Disabilities+Act+(preprint);+Americans+with+Disabilities+Act+|+syringe+service+programs+|+COVID-19+|+harm+reduction+services","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28115,""

However, little is known about possible predictors of mental health or psychiatric symptoms in Brazilian health care students during this period. : To evaluate possible associated factors of anxiety and depressive symptoms, as a measure of psychiatric outcomes, and quality of life, as a parameter of overall functionality in Brazilian students from health care programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional study conducted with Brazilian students from health care programs from May to December 2020. Participants were recruited through social media and answered a 71-item open online questionnaire exploring demographic characteristics and personal behaviors during the pandemic, anxiety, depression and quality of life. We searched for potential associated variables of psychiatric symptoms and mental health in these individuals using Poisson regression models. Multivariate models showed depression and anxiety were associated to poor quality of life, and medication abuse was associated with higher anxiety and poor quality of life. Psychotherapy was an effective coping strategy for anxiety, and meditation or mindfulness practice and physical activity improved the quality of life of the students. Our study provides important information about the factors and coping strategies associated with psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic that should be helpful to reflect and to design appropriate interventions.","Moraes, Baumont, Dreher, Gauer, Manfro","https://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2021-0416","20220308","Anxiety; Covid-19 pandemic; depression; quality of life; students from health care programs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28116,""
"Impact of screen time during COVID-19 on eating habits, physical activity, sleep, and depression symptoms: A cross-sectional study in Indian adolescents","This study attempted to address the limited knowledge regarding the impact of screen time (ST) on lifestyle behaviors in Indian adolescents during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives were to 1) evaluate frequency and duration of using screens, and screen addiction behaviors in 10-15 years old adolescents in Mumbai during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2) examine the association of ST with lifestyle behaviors- eating habits, snacking patterns, physical activity (PA) levels, sleep quality and depression symptoms. An online survey was completed between January and March 2021. Eating habits, snacking patterns, time spent in different screen-based activities, and screen addiction behaviors were reported. The PA levels, sleep quality, and depression symptoms were evaluated using the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children/Adolescents (PAQ C/A), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine the impact of ST on lifestyle behaviors. Adolescents (n = 1298, Mage 13.2(1.1), 53.3% boys) reported the mean weekday and weekend ST as 442.3 (201.5) minutes/d and 379.9 (178.2) minutes/d respectively. Overall, 33.4% spent &gt; 6hours/d for studying or doing homework, 65.4% used social networking sites for at least 2-3 hours/d, and 70.7% agreed that ST had taken up the majority of their leisure time. Only 12% engaged in moderate to vigorous PA (PAQ C/A scores &lt;2). More than half (52.5%) reported PSQI &gt;5 indicating poor sleep quality and 8.6% scored Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3 on PHQ-2 to suggest a risk of depression. A higher ST was associated with lower PA and increased sleep problems and a greater screen addiction was inversely associated with the eating habit, PA, and sleep-related variables. The study draws attention to a high prevalence of excess ST and its impact on eating habits, PA levels, and sleep quality in Indian adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Targeted health promotion interventions that encourage judicious use of screens for education and entertainment and emphasize the adverse health effects of excess ST are required.","Moitra, Madan","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264951","20220308","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28117,""

"COVID-19 Distress Impacts Adolescents' Depressive Symptoms, NSSI, and Suicide Risk in the Rural, Northeast US","Widespread concern exists about the impacts of COVID-19 and related public health safety measures (e.g., school closures) on adolescent mental health. Emerging research documents correlates and trajectories of adolescent distress, but further work is needed to identify additional vulnerability factors that explain increased psychopathology during the pandemic. The current study examined whether COVID-19-related loneliness and health anxiety (assessed in March 2020) predicted increased depressive symptoms, frequency of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and suicide risk from pre-pandemic (late January/early February 2020) to June 2020. Participants were 362 middle and high school adolescents in rural Maine (<i>M</i> ageÃ‚Â = 15.01Ã‚Â years; 63.4% female; 76.4% White). Data were collected during a time in which state-level COVID-19 restrictions were high and case counts were relatively low. Self-reports assessed psychopathology symptoms, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) was used to capture COVID-19-related distress during the initial days of school closures. Loneliness predicted higher depressive symptoms for all adolescents, higher NSSI frequency for adolescents with low pre-pandemic frequency (but less frequent NSSI for adolescents with high pre-pandemic frequency), and higher suicide risk for adolescents with higher pre-pandemic risk. Health anxiety predicted higher NSSI frequency for adolescents with high pre-pandemic frequency, and secondary analyses suggested that this pattern may depend on adolescents' gender identity. Results underscore the impact of COVID-19 on adolescent mental health, with benefits for some but largely negative impacts for most. Implications for caretakers, educators, and clinicians invested in adolescent mental health are discussed.","Schwartz-Mette, Duell, Lawrence, Balkind","https://doi.org/10.1080/15374416.2022.2042697","20220308","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28119,""
"Promoting Wellness in Orthopaedic Surgery Residency","The challenges associated with surgical residency have been well documented and described. Despite implementation of work-hour restrictions, residency remains a balancing act between patient care, surgical and clinical education, medical record documentation, and research endeavors. The added challenge of balancing these duties with life outside of the hospital further complicates the situation. Multiple studies have documented the stress associated with residency training, highlighting the prevalence of emotional exhaustion, detachment from people both in and out of the hospital, and a concerning rate of clinical depression among residents. Moreover, this emotional exhaustion has been shown to directly correlate with residents' clinical performance and abilities to carry out academic duties. More recently, feelings of isolation and detachment have been exacerbated by the necessity of COVID-19 precautions and change in clinical duties. The Accreditation for Graduate Medical Education (ACGM) now requires all residencies to include programming that focuses on resident well-being. Programs have implemented various strategies in an effort to help their trainees cope with the stress associated with residency and beyond. Despite the variety in approaches of programs, these initiatives have the similar objective of teaching resilience and the ability to navigate stressors in a healthy and effective manner. The programming can also serve to promote resident interaction and develop camaraderie in an effort to minimize feelings of emotional exhaustion and isolation. In this article, we discuss the importance of sustained physician wellness and describe approaches from various professions that can be implemented into the wellness curriculum for residency programs across the country. By promoting a culture of wellness and incorporating effective wellness programming, our aim is that residents will be able to succeed not only in their training but also in their personal lives and professional endeavors after graduation.","Federico, Higgins, Nolte, Kogan","https://doi.org/10.5435/JAAOSGlobal-D-21-00227","20220308","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28120,""

"Evaluating Depression and Anxiety Throughout Pregnancy and Postpartum: Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique social, economic, and psychological challenges for individuals globally. As a result, individuals who are pregnant face unprecedented mental health challenges. We sought to determine the impact of the pandemic on perinatal depression and anxiety in a longitudinal pregnancy cohort. We hypothesized increased depression and anxiety scores in individuals during pregnancy and postpartum in the pandemic at all time points. Participants were enrolled in the Ontario Birth Study (OBS), a pregnancy cohort embedded in clinical care at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto. Perinatal depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-2 (GAD-2) in early pregnancy while the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and GAD-2 were used in late pregnancy and postpartum. Logistic regression models were created to examine the association of the pandemic with clinically elevated mental health scores in pre-pandemic vs. during pandemic groups while adjusting for covariates. 1159 survey responses from 649 participants between March 1, 2019, to February 28, 2021, were used to conduct this study. Participants were assessed in early pregnancy (416), in late pregnancy (373), and postpartum (370). Responses received on or prior to February 29, 2020, were considered the ""pre-pandemic"" group, while responses after were considered the ""pandemic"" group. Mean rank scores of depression and anxiety were significantly higher in the pandemic group (p=0.02, p=0.003) in the postpartum period. There was no significant association between pandemic time and antenatal scores. However, postnatally, mothers were 2.6 times more likely to score 13 or above on the EPDS during the pandemic than pre-pandemic (95% CI= 1.2-5.7, p=0.02). Adjustment for ethnicity and income strengthened this association as the odds ratio increased to 3.3 (95% CI= 1.4-8.0, p=0.007). Pandemic-associated increases in depression and anxiety scores were confined to the postpartum period, highlighting a need for increased screening and interventions for Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders postnatally as this pandemic continues.","Zhang, Okeke, Levitan, Murphy, Foshay, Lye, Knight, Matthews","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2022.100605","20220308","Anxiety; COVID-19 Pandemic; Depression; Developmental Programming; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire; Patient Health Questionnaire; Perinatal Mental Health; Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28122,""
"Inflammation at the crossroads of COVID-19, cognitive deficits and depression","Acute neurological alterations have been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, it is becoming clear that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors may experience long-term neurological abnormalities, including cognitive deficits and mood alterations. The mechanisms underlying acute and long-term impacts of COVID-19 in the brain are being actively investigated. Due to the heterogeneous manifestations of neurological outcomes, it is possible that different mechanisms operate following SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may include direct brain infection by SARS-CoV-2, mechanisms resulting from hyperinflammatory systemic disease, or a combination of both. Inflammation is a core feature of COVID-19, and both central and systemic inflammation are known to lead to acute and persistent neurological alterations in other diseases. Here, we review evidence indicating that COVID-19 is associated with neuroinflammation, along with blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Similar neuroinflammatory signatures have been associated with Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder. Current evidence demonstrates that patients with pre-existing cognitive and neuropsychiatric deficits show worse outcomes upon infection by SARS-CoV-2 and, conversely, COVID-19 survivors may be at increased risk of developing dementia and mood disorders. Considering the high prevalence of COVID-19 patients that recovered from infection in the world and the alarming projections for the prevalence of dementia and depression, investigation of possible molecular similarities between those diseases may shed light on mechanisms leading to long-term neurological abnormalities in COVID-19 survivors.","Lyra E Silva, Barros-AragÃƒÂ£o, De Felice, Ferreira","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2022.109023","20220308","Blood-brain barrier; Cytokine; Memory; Mood disorders; Neuro-infectious diseases; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28123,""

"Preparing the Next Generation of Academic Researchers During the Pandemic: Lessons from a National Mental Health Research Postdoctoral Fellowship","The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted all aspects of academic medicine, including post-doctoral research fellowship training. The current survey examined ways in which research fellows across 28 U.S. nationally diverse sites have been impacted. Survey participants included 62 M.D. and Ph.D. post-doctoral fellows and 27 local fellowship center directors within the Veterans Affairs (VA) Advanced Fellowship in Mental Illness Research and Treatment (MIRT), a national fellowship program tasked to develop academic clinician researchers within the field of mental health. Survey questions focused on productivity and challenges experienced by fellows during the pandemic. Half of fellows reported working entirely off-site during the COVID-19 pandemic. All fellows reported some level of disruption in productivity during the pandemic; 73% reported a disruption in data collection, 69% reported decreased scholarly output, 41% reported disruption in grant writing, and 73% reported disruption in ability to provide clinical care. Yet, the majority of fellows (66%) reported not having to change their research goals, pivoting to telehealth-based data collection, and employing extant data for research projects and peer-reviewed publications.

"Prefrontal Cortical Thickness, Emotion Regulation Strategy use and Covid-19 Mental Health","Covid-19 and associated restrictions have been linked to negative mental health outcomes across the globe. Cognitive emotion regulation strategies, neurally supported by prefrontal and limbic regions, constitute means to mitigate negative affects resulting from adverse life experiences. Variations in cognitive emotion regulation strategy use, anxiety and depression were assessed in 43 adults (31Ã¢â„¢â‚¬/12Ã¢â„¢â€š, age=35.14Ã‚Â±9.20y) during the first months following Covid-19 onset and at the end of 2020 (seven assessments). Direct and indirect effects of emotion regulatory brain structures assessed prior to the pandemic and emotion regulation strategy use during the pandemic were assessed in relation to mental well-being. Varying levels of anxiety and depression were observed. While adaptive emotion regulation strategies were most frequently employed, maladaptive strategies explained the highest variation in anxiety and depression scores. The effectiveness of specific emotion regulation strategies varied. Momentary emotion regulation strategy use mediated the association between cortical thickness in right lateral prefrontal cortex assessed prior to the pandemic and mental health during the pandemic. Early mental health measures impacted later mental well-being. Maladaptive strategies have a negative effect on mental health during prolonged stress as induced by pandemics, providing possible targets for intervention.","Dimanova, BorbÃƒÂ¡s, Schnider, Fehlbaum, Raschle","https://doi.org/10.1093/scan/nsac018","20220308","Covid-19; cortical thickness; emotion regulation; mental health; prefrontal cortex","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28126,""
"The Moderating Role of Community Capacity for Age-friendly Communication in Mitigating Anxiety of Older Adults During the COVID-19 Infodemic: Cross-sectional Survey","Older adults were perceived as a vulnerable group during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the health and mental health challenges they faced. The pandemic was accompanied by an ""infodemic"" of overabundant and questionable information that has affected older adults' mental health. As the infodemic and ageist narratives were prevalent online, more anxiety symptoms have been induced among older adults who used social media. Age-friendly communication, advocated by the World Health Organization's Age-friendly City (AFC) guide, could be an antidote by providing tailored information via appropriate channels for older adults. This study investigated the role of community capacity for age-friendly communication in mitigating anxiety during the pandemic. We hypothesized that age-friendly communication would moderate the effects of infection risks and social media use on anxiety. A double-moderating effect was hypothesized in the context of diminished trust in traditional media. Data were collected from a cross-sectional telephone survey conducted in Hong Kong in 2020. Older adults (N=3421, ageÃ¢â€°Â¥60 years) were interviewed about their well-being and daily lives. Community capacity for age-friendly communication was measured in a living district-based evaluation. It had 2 components: the reach of appropriate information to older adults (AFC-Information) and the age-friendliness of communication technologies (AFC-Communication Technology) in the community. We tested the hypothesized moderation and double-moderation effects with ordinary least squares regressions. Perceived COVID-19 infection risk (b=0.002, <i>P</i>=.02) and use of social media for COVID-19 information (b=0.08, <i>P</i>=.04) were associated with more anxiety symptoms. The effect of using social media was moderated by AFC-Information (b=-0.39, <i>P</i>=.002) and AFC-Communication Technology (b=-1.06, <i>P</i>&lt;.001), and the effect of perceived COVID-19 infection risk was moderated by AFC-Information (b=-0.03, <i>P</i>=.002) and AFC-Communication Technology (b=-0.05, <i>P</i>&lt;.001). Lower trust in traditional media exacerbated anxiety symptoms associated with social media use (b=-0.08, <i>P</i>=.02). Higher AFC-Information alleviated this moderation effect (AFC-Information Ãƒâ€” media trust b=-0.65, <i>P</i>&lt;.001; AFC-Information Ãƒâ€” social media use b=-2.18, <i>P</i>&lt;.001; 3-way interaction b=0.40, <i>P</i>=.003). Our findings highlight the role of community age-friendly communication in mitigating anxiety related to the infodemic. Although using social media may have exacerbated the impact of the infodemic on older adults, it has the potential to deliver timely information for an adequate health response. Although the amplifying effects of low media trust was associated with social media use, age-friendly communication determined its strength. Instead of discouraging the use of digital technologies for COVID-19 information, efforts should be made in tailoring information and communication technologies in local communities for older adults.","Wong, Leung, Wong, Liu, Lu, Chan, Wong, Lum","https://doi.org/10.2196/33029","20220308","COVID-19; Hong Kong; information technology; media trust; mental health; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28127,""
"Plasma Biomarkers of Neuropathogenesis in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 and Those With Postacute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection","Although patients hospitalized with COVID-19 frequently present with encephalopathy, those with mild initial COVID-19 disease who never required hospitalization also often develop neurologic symptoms as part of postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (neuro-PASC). The pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 encephalopathy and neuro-PASC are unknown. We sought to establish biochemical evidence of CNS injury in those patients and their association with neuropsychiatric manifestations and SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia. We recruited hospitalized, posthospitalized, and nonhospitalized patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 with neurologic symptoms in addition to healthy control (HC) subjects. Plasma neurofilament light chain (pNfL), plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (pGFAP), and plasma SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid antigen (pN Ag) were measured by HD-X Simoa analyzer (Quanterix) and compared with neuropsychiatric symptoms, patient-reported quality-of-life measures, and standardized cognitive assessments. Neuroglial scores (pGFAP/pNfL) were calculated to estimate the relative contribution of astroglial and neuronal involvement. We enrolled a total of 64 study participants, including 9 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 encephalopathy (CE), 9 posthospitalization neuro-PASC (PNP) patients, 38 nonhospitalized neuro-PASC (NNP) patients, and 8 HC subjects. Patients with CE were older, had higher pNfL and pGFAP concentrations, and more frequent pN Ag detection than all neuro-PASC groups. PNP and NNP patients exhibited similar PASC symptoms, decreased quality-of-life measures, and cognitive dysfunction, and 1 of the 38 (2.6%) NNP patients had pN Ag detectable 3 weeks postsymptoms onset. Patients with neuro-PASC presenting with anxiety/depression had higher neuroglial scores, which were correlated with increased anxiety on quality-of-life measures. pNfL, pGFAP, and pN Ag measurements indicate neuronal dysfunction and systemic involvement in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with encephalopathy. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 N Ag in blood 3 weeks after symptoms onset in a nonhospitalized patient suggests that prolonged antigenic stimulation, or possibly latent infection, may occur. Anxiety was associated with evidence of astroglial activation in patients with neuro-PASC. These data shed new light on SARS-Cov-2 neuropathogenesis and demonstrate the value of plasma biomarkers across the COVID-19 disease spectrum.","Hanson, Visvabharathy, Ali, Kang, Patel, Clark, Lim, Orban, Hwang, Mattoon, Batra, Liotta, Koralnik","https://doi.org/10.1212/NXI.0000000000001151","20220308","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28128,""
"Occupational challenges of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study","To address structural determinants and healthcare workers' (HCWs) physical, mental, emotional and professional challenges of working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Exploratory qualitative study with semistructured interviews. Collected data were analysed using thematic analysis. This qualitative study was undertaken with HCWs who mainly worked in intensive care units in six non-profit hospitals in Vienna, Austria. Data were collected from June 2020 to January 2021. A total of 30 HCWs (13 medical doctors, 11 qualified nursing staff, 2 nurse assistants, 2 physiotherapists and 2 technical/cleaning staff) who were in direct and indirect contact with patients with COVID-19 were included. Three overall themes resulted as relevant: challenges due to lack of preparedness, structural conditions, and physical and mental health of HCWs. Lack of preparedness included delayed infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines, shortages of personal protective equipment combined with staff shortages (especially of nursing staff) and overworked personnel. Physical and mental strains resulted from HCWs being overworked and working permanently on alert to face medical uncertainties and the critical conditions of patients. HCWs lacked recognition on multiple levels and dealt with stigma and avoidance behaviour of colleagues. To mitigate HCWs' occupational health risks and staff turnover, we propose context-specific recommendations. The number of available essential workers in care of patients with COVID-19, especially nursing staff, should be carefully planned and increased to avert chronic work overload. Timely training and education in IPC for all HCWs is important. Providing supportive supervision is as essential as appropriate recognition by higher level management and the public.","Jeleff, Traugott, Jirovsky-Platter, Jordakieva, Kutalek","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054516","20220308","COVID-19; occupational &amp; industrial medicine; public health; social medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28129,""
"Daily Associations Between Adolescent Sleep and Socioemotional Experiences During an Ongoing Stressor","Ongoing stress can result in sleep disturbances and daytime socioemotional difficulties. Data on how sleep and daytime socioemotional functioning may be bidirectionally related to one another in the midst of an ongoing stressor are limited, particularly during adolescence, a developmental period when risk for the onset of mental health difficulties and sleep disturbances is high. Participants (NÃ‚Â = 459, ages of 13-18Ã‚Â years) were recruited from across the United States and completed an intake survey and one week of daily reports beginning 2Ã‚Â weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency. Participants reported on their daily post-traumatic stress symptoms, positive and negative affect, loneliness, sleep onset difficulties, nightmares, sleep quality, and time in bed. Lagged hierarchical linear models adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, medication use, medical conditions, and ongoing stressors were estimated to examine bidirectional associations between night-time sleep and next-day mental health. Poorer sleep quality and more nightmares at night predicted higher next-day negative affect, and greater daytime negative affect predicted lower sleep quality and a greater likelihood of having nightmares the following night. Poor sleep quality predicted greater next-day post-traumatic stress, which, in turn, predicted poorer sleep quality the following night and more difficulties falling asleep. Poor sleep quality and a longer time in bed also predicted greater next-day loneliness. Overall, these findings provide insight into how sleep disturbances and socioemotional difficulties unfold during a major life stressor in an adolescent sample.","Palmer, Oosterhoff, Massey, Bawden","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2022.01.127","20220308","Mental health; Negative emotion; Positive emotion; Sleep; Stress; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28130,""
"Infection control and the prevalence, management and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections in mental health wards in London, UK: lessons learned from wave 1 to wave 2","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) has high morbidity and mortality in older adults and people with dementia. Infection control and prevention measures potentially reduce transmission within hospitals. We aimed to replicate our earlier study of London mental health in-patients to examine changes in clinical guidance and practice and associated COVID-19 prevalence and outcomes between COVID-19 waves 1 and 2 (1 March to 30 April 2020 and 14 December 2020 to 15 February 2021). We collected the 2 month period prevalence of wave 2 of COVID-19 in older (Ã¢â€°Â¥65 years) in-patients and those with dementia, as well as patients' characteristics, management and outcomes, including vaccinations. We compared these results with those of our wave 1 study. Sites reported that routine testing and personal protective equipment were available, and routine patient isolation on admission occurred throughout wave 2. COVID-19 infection occurred in 91/358 (25%; 95% CI 21-30%) v. 131/344, (38%; 95% CI 33-43%) P &lt; 0.001 in wave 1. Hospitals identified more asymptomatic carriers (26/91; 29% v. 16/130; 12%) and fewer deaths (12/91; 13% v. 19/131; 15%; odds ratio = 0.92; 0.37-1.81) compared with wave 1. The patient vaccination uptake rate was 49/58 (85%). Patients in psychiatric in-patient settings, mostly admitted without known SARS-CoV-2 infection, had a high risk of infection compared with people in the community but lower than that during wave 1. Availability of infection control measures in line with a policy of parity of esteem between mental and physical health appears to have lowered within-hospital COVID-19 infections and deaths. Cautious management of vulnerable patient groups including mental health patients may reduce the future impact of COVID-19.","Liu, Kulatilake, Kalafatis, Smith, King, Serra-Mestres, Huzzey, Ng, Kandangwa, Elliott, Sommerlad, Marston, Livingston","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.31","20220308","COVID-19; Dementia; in-patient treatment; older adults; patients","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28131,""
"The prevalence, incidence, prognosis and risk factors for symptoms of depression and anxiety in a UK cohort during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound consequences for population mental health. However, it is less clear for whom these effects are sustained. To investigate the prevalence, incidence, prognosis and risk factors for symptoms of depression and anxiety in a UK cohort over three distinct periods in the pandemic in 2020. An online survey was completed by a UK community cohort at three points (n = 3097 at baseline, n = 878 completed all surveys): April (baseline), July to September (time point 2) and November to December (time point 3). Participants completed validated measures of depression and anxiety on each occasion, and we prospectively explored the role of sociodemographic and psychological factors (loneliness, positive mood and perceived risk of and worry about COVID-19) as risk factors. Depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 means: baseline, 7.69; time point 2, 5.53; time point 3, 6.06) and anxiety scores (Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 means: baseline, 6.59; time point 2, 4.60; time point 3, 4.98) were considerably greater than pre-pandemic population norms at all time points. Women reported greater depression and anxiety symptoms than men. Younger age, history of mental health disorder, more COVID-19-related negative life events, greater loneliness and lower positive mood at baseline were all significant predictors of poorer mental health at time point 3. The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health has persisted to some degree. Younger people and individuals with prior mental health disorders are at greatest risk. Easing of restrictions and resumption of social interaction could mitigate the risk factors of loneliness and positive mood.","Jia, Ayling, Chalder, Massey, Gasteiger, Broadbent, Coupland, Vedhara","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.34","20220308","COVID-19; Mental health; anxiety; depression; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28132,""
"Six-month outcomes of the HOPE smartphone application designed to support treatment with medications for opioid use disorder and piloted during an early statewide COVID-19 lockdown","Morbidity and mortality related to opioid use disorder (OUD) in the U.S. is at an all-time high. Innovative approaches are needed to address gaps in retention in treatment with medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Mobile health (mHealth) approaches have shown improvement in engagement in care and associated clinical outcomes for a variety of chronic diseases, but mHealth tools designed specifically to support patients treated with MOUD are limited. Following user-centered development and testing phases, a multi-feature smartphone application called HOPE (Heal. Overcome. Persist. Endure) was piloted in a small cohort of patients receiving MOUD and at high risk of disengagement in care at an office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) clinic in Central Virginia. Outcomes were tracked over a six-month period following patient enrollment. They included retention in care at the OBOT clinic, usage of various features of the application, and self-rated measures of mental health, substance use, treatment and recovery. Of the 25 participants in the HOPE pilot study, a majority were retained in care at 6Ã‚Â months (56%). Uptake of bi-directional features including messaging with providers and daily check-ins of mood, stress and medication adherence peaked at one month, and usage persisted through the sixth month. Patients who reported that distance to clinic was a problem at baseline had higher loss to follow up compared to those without distance as a reported barrier (67% vs 23%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03). Patients lost to in-person clinic follow up continued to engage with one or more app features, indicating that mHealth approaches may bridge barriers to clinic visit attendance. Participants surveyed at baseline and 6Ã‚Â months (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16) scored higher on scales related to overall self-control and self-efficacy related to drug abstinence. A pilot study of a novel multi-feature smartphone application to support OUD treatment showed acceptable retention in care and patient usage at 6Ã‚Â months. Further study within a larger population is needed to characterize 'real world' uptake and association with outcomes related to retention in care, relapse prevention, and opioid-associated mortality.","Hodges, Waselewski, Harrington, Franklin, Schorling, Huynh, Tabackman, Otero, Ingersoll, Tiouririne, Flickinger, Dillingham","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13722-022-00296-4","20220308","Digital health; Medications for opioid use disorder; Mobile health; Opioid use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-09","",28133,""

Not only were emergency nurses caring for patients with physical symptoms, they were also confronted by anxiety, depression, stress, and uncertainty in patients, peers, and themselves. Even as nurses cared for patients seeking their help, they were dealing with their own struggles as members of the larger community and the organization. The purpose of this study was to examine emergency nursesâ€™ resiliency and to provide nurse leaders a different lens for viewing resilience. Five interconnected elements surfaced through direct observations with live environmental music therapy, focus groups, and essays with emergency room nurses.
