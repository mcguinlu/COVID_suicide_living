"COVID-19 COGNITIVE DEFICITS AFTER RESPIRATORY ASSISTANCE IN THE SUBACUTE PHASE:A COVID-REHABILITATION UNIT EXPERIENCE","Introduction: COVID-19 complications can include neurological, psychiatric, psychological, and psychosocial impairments. Little is known on the consequences of SARS-COV-2 on cognitive functions of patients in the sub-acute phase of the disease. We aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on cognitive functions of patients admitted to the COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit of the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy). Material and Methods: 87 patients admitted to the COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit from March 27th to June 20th 2020 were included. Patients underwent Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Data were divided in 4 groups according to the respiratory assistance in the acute phase: Group1 (orotracheal intubation), Group2 (non-invasive ventilation using Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure), Group3 (Venturi Masks), Group4 (no oxygen therapy). Follow-ups were performed at one month after home-discharge. Results: Out of the 87 patients (62 Male, mean age 67.23 +/- 12.89 years), 80% had neuropsychological deficits (MoCA and MMSE) and 40% showed mild-to-moderate depression. Group1 had higher scores than Group3 for visuospatial/executive functions (p=0.016), naming (p=0.024), short- and long-term memory (p=0.010, p=0.005), abstraction (p=0.024), and orientation (p=0.034). Group1 was younger than Groups2 and 3. Cognitive impairments correlated with patients' age. Only 18 patients presented with anosmia. Their data did not differ from the other patients. FIM (<100) did not differ between groups. Patients partly recovered at one-month follow-up and 43% showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusion: Patients with severe functional impairments had important cognitive and emotional deficits which might have been influenced by the choice of ventilatory therapy, but mostly appeared to be related to aging, independently of FIM scores. These findings should be integrated for decision-making in respiratory and neuropsychiatric assistance of COVID-19 patients in the subacute phase of the disease, and show the need for long-term support and psychological treatment of post-COVID-19 patients.","Federica Alemanno; Elise Houdayer; Anna Parma; Alfio Spina; Alessandra Del Forno; Alessandra Scatolini; Sara Angelone; Luigia Brugliera; Andrea Tettamanti; Luigi Beretta; Sandro Iannaccone","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.12.20229823","20201115","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-15","",7157,""
"Protective behaviours and secondary harms from non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa: a multisite prospective longitudinal study","Background: In March 2020 South Africa implemented strict non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain Covid-19. Over the subsequent five months NPIs were eased in stages according to national strategy. Covid-19 spread throughout the country heterogeneously, reaching rural areas by July and peaking in July-August. Data on the impact of NPI policies on social and economic wellbeing and access to healthcare is limited. We therefore analysed how rural residents of three South African provinces changed their behaviour during the first epidemic wave. Methods: The South African Population Research Infrastructure Network (SAPRIN) nodes in Mpumalanga (Agincourt), KwaZulu-Natal (AHRI) and Limpopo (DIMAMO) provinces conducted longitudinal telephone surveys among randomly sampled households from rural and peri-urban surveillance populations every 2-3 weeks. Interviews included questions on: Covid-19 knowledge and behaviours; health and economic impact of NPIs; and mental health. Results: 2262 households completed 10,966 interviews between April and August 2020. By August, self-reported satisfaction with Covid-19 knowledge had risen from 48% to 85% and facemask use to over 95%. As selected NPIs were eased mobility increased, and economic losses and anxiety and depression symptoms fell. When Covid-19 cases spiked at one node in July, movement dropped rapidly, and missed daily medication rates doubled. Economic concerns and mental health symptoms were lower in households receiving a greater number of government-funded old-age pensions. Conclusions: South Africans reported complying with stringent Covid-19 NPIs despite the threat of substantial social, economic and health repercussions. Government-supported social welfare programmes appeared to buffer interruptions in income and healthcare access during local outbreaks. Epidemic control policies must be balanced against impacts on wellbeing in resource-limited settings and designed with parallel support systems where they threaten income and basic service access.","Guy Harling; Francesc Xavier GÃ³mez-OlivÃ©; Joseph Tlouyamma; Tinofa Mutevedzi; Chodziwadziwa Whiteson Kabudula; Ruth Mahlako; Urisha Singh; Daniel Ohene-Kwofie; Rose Buckland; Pedzisa Ndagurwa; Dickman Gareta; Resign Gunda; Thobeka Mngomezulu; Siyabonga Nxumalo; Emily B Wong; Kathleen Kahn; Mark J Siedner; Eric Maimela; Stephen Tollman; Mark Collinson; Kobus Herbst","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.12.20230136","20201115","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-15","",7158,""
"Low uptake of COVID-19 prevention behaviours and high socioeconomic impact of lockdown measures in South Asia: evidence from a large-scale multi-country surveillance programme","Background. South Asia has become a major epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding South Asians awareness, attitudes and experiences of early measures for the prevention of COVID-19 is key to improving the effectiveness and mitigating the social and economic impacts of pandemic responses at a critical time for the Region. Methods. We assessed the knowledge, behaviours, health and socio-economic circumstances of 29,809 adult men and women, at 93 locations across four South Asian countries. Data were collected during the national lockdowns implemented from March to July 2020, and compared with data collected prior to the pandemic as part of an ongoing prospective surveillance initiative. Results. Participants were 61% female, mean age 45.1 years. Almost half had one or more chronic disease, including diabetes (16%), hypertension (23%) or obesity (16%). Knowledge of the primary COVID-19 symptoms and transmission routes was high, but access to hygiene and personal protection resources was low (running water 63%, hand sanitisers 53%, paper tissues 48%). Key preventive measures were not widely adopted. Knowledge, access to, and uptake of COVID-19 prevention measures were low amongst people from disadvantaged socio-economic groups. Fifteen percent of people receiving treatment for chronic diseases reported loss of access to long-term medications; 40% reported symptoms suggestive of anxiety or depression. The prevalence of unemployment rose from 9.3% to 39.4% (P<0.001), and household income fell by 52% (P<0.001) during the lockdown. Younger people and those from less affluent socio-economic groups were most severely impacted. Sedentary time increased by 32% and inadequate fruit and vegetable intake increased by 10% (P<0.001 for both), while tobacco and alcohol consumption dropped by 41% and 80%, respectively (P<0.001), during the lockdown. Conclusions. Our results identified important knowledge, access and uptake barriers to the prevention of COVID-19 in South Asia, and demonstrated major adverse impacts of the pandemic on chronic disease treatment, mental health, health-related behaviours, employment and household finances. We found important sociodemographic differences for impact, suggesting a widening of existing inequalities. Our findings underscore the need for immediate large-scale action to close gaps in knowledge and access to essential resources for prevention, along with measures to safeguard economic production and mitigate socio-economic impacts on the young and the poor.","Dian Kusuma; Rajendra Pradeepa; Khadija I Khawaja; Mehedi Hasan; Samreen Siddiqui; Sara Mahmood; Syed Mohsin Ali Shah; Chamini K De Silva; Laksara de Silva; Manoja Gamage; Menka Loomba; Vindya P Rajakaruna; Abu AM Hanif; Rajan Babu Kamalesh; Balachandran Kumarendran; Marie Loh; Archa Misra; Asma Tassawar; Akansha Tyagi; Swati Waghdhare; Saira Burney; Sajjad Ahmad; Viswanathan Mohan; Malabika Sarker; Ian Y Goon; Anu Kasturiratne; Jaspal S Kooner; Prasad Katulanda; Sujeet Jha; Ranjit Mohan Anjana; Malay K Mridha; Franco Sassi; John Chambers","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.12.20229898","20201114","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-15","",7159,""

"Mental health considerations in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic: a literature review","Introduction: The global pandemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has had a significant impact on the mental health of populations across the world. However, the scope of this impact on children and adolescents has not yet been fully assessed. Methods: A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted using the terms â€œCOVID-19â€, â€œnCoV-2â€, â€œchildrenâ€, â€œadolescentsâ€, â€œanxietyâ€, â€œdepressionâ€, â€œattention deficit-hyperactivity disorderâ€, â€œADHDâ€, â€œautismâ€, â€œautism spectrum disorderâ€, â€œmental healthâ€ and â€œpsychiatryâ€ in various permutations and combinations. A total of 23 articles of direct relevance were retrieved, including four observational studies. Results: Emotional disturbances were noted in substantial numbers of children. In younger children (aged 3-6 years), these were mainly non-specific, such as clinginess, fearfulness and irritability. In older children, symptoms of anxiety and depression were noted in 19-22%. Children with pre-existing disorders, such as ADHD, were at risk of symptom exacerbation. Other concerns flagged in the literature included an elevated risk of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, an increased risk of child abuse or neglect, and the need for special care in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The challenges of delivering mental health services in the context of social distancing measures were highlighted. Conclusion: Emotional and behavioural symptoms are a common reaction in children and adolescents, perhaps more so in children with additional risk factors. The management of these problems requires concerted cooperation between mental health professionals, families, and local authorities.","Ravi Philip Rajkumar","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-DF3-14C","20200624","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder; depression; autism; children; anxiety; adolescents; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-15","",7161,""
