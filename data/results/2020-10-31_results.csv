"Episcopal Farmworker Ministry and disaster response to COVID-19","Farmworkers in the US confront numerous challenges  They receive poverty wages and have high rates of wage theft, precarious immigration status, and a high risk of injury and fatality  They also face rampant food insecurity, with 40 to 70 percent of farmworkers experiencing a lack of reliable access to nutritious meals  Add to these challenges poor mental health from social isolation for guest workers who hold H2-A visas for agricultural work, the potential of working under dangerous and abusive conditions, and substandard housing  The general picture is of a workforce vulnerable to exploitation that does not receive the same benefits and protections as other workers due to agriculture's exemption from many labor regulations  These challenges have been exacerbated by the current pandemic, which has hit farmworker communities particularly hard  Episcopal Farmworker Ministry (EFWM) is on the front lines of addressing these challenges  EFWM, which is located in Dunn NC, is a joint ministry of the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina and the Episcopal Diocese of East Carolina  EFWM provides direct services, leadership development programs, and educational and advocacy programs aimed toward a systemic change of the policies that affect farmworkers and their families","Garzon, Lariza, Smolski, Andrew R.","https://doi.org/10.5304/jafscd.2020.094.002","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development;9(4):191, 2020.; Publication details: Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development;9(4):191, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6615,""

"Mental health status of health-care professionals working in quarantine and non-quarantine Egyptian hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Variable models of care have been adopted in different countries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Egypt has assigned certain hospitals specifically for the quarantine of COVID-19 patients, where operational medical teams work continuously for 14 days, after which they are released for self-isolation at home for a similar period. Aims: The study aimed to evaluate and compare perceived adverse psychological symptoms (stress, anxiety, depression), and insomnia by health-care professionals working in quarantine and non-quarantine hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt, and to explore associated factors with adverse psychological symptoms and insomnia. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was performed in April 2020, using a snowball sampling method. Sociodemographic information perceived general health, healthy lifestyle, insomnia (using Insomnia Severity Index), adverse psychological symptoms (using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21), worries and concerns about COVID-19, future perspective about COVID-19, and coping strategies were collected. Results: Five hundred and forty health-care professionals participated; 10.2% (n=55) worked in quarantine hospitals. Younger age (ORa=0.96, 95% CI:0.93-0.99, ORa=0.95; 95% CI:0.92-0.97; ORa=0.96 CI:0.93-0.99), being not ready/sure of readiness to work in quarantine hospital (ORa=1.91, 95% CI:1.22-3.00; ORa=2.01, 95% CI:1.28-3.15; ORa=1.91, 95% CI:1.22-2.98), and insomnia (ORa=5.22, 95% CI:3.38-8.05; ORa=7.58, 95% CI:4.91-11.68; ORa=6.38 95% CI:4.19-9.73) significantly predicted stress, depression and anxiety, respectively. Being female (ORa=1.59, 95% CI:1.04-2.42; ORa=2.09, 95% CI:1.38-3.16) could also significantly predict stress and anxiety. Conclusion: Female and younger age health care professionals were more prone to report adverse psychological symptoms. More and earlier screening for health-care professionals dealing with COVID-19, in addition to providing psychological support, is highly encouraged.","Youssef, Naglaa; Mostafa, Aya; Ezzat, Reem; Yosef, Mostafa; El Kassas, Mohamed","https://dx.doi.org/10.26719/emhj.20.116","","Country: EG; EGITO; EGYPT; EGIPTO; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: East Mediterr Health J;26(10): 1155-1164, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: East Mediterr Health J;26(10): 1155-1164, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6620,""

"Anxiety as a mediator of relationships between perceptions of the threat of COVID-19 and coping behaviors during the onset of the pandemic in Poland","At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (10-14 March, 2020) we conducted a survey (n = 1028) of a nationally representative sample (age, sex, and locale) in Poland. Respondents indicated how strong they thought the threat was to themselves, to Poland, and the world. They also described their emotional reactions to the pandemic, which we used to calculate three scores: Anxiety, Hopelessness, and Panic. Respondents also indicated how often they engaged in various coping behaviors and how much they supported different types of economic sacrifice. We used these responses to calculate measures that we labelled as Spread Prevention (e.g., social distancing), Self-preservation (food stockpiling), and Economic Sacrifice (e.g., fighting COVID-19 regardless of the cost). Multiple regression analyses found that perceived threat to self was the most reliable predictor (positive) of emotional reactions and of coping behaviors, and that Anxiety was the most reliable predictor (positive) of Spread prevention and Economic sacrifice. Panic predicted (positively) Self-preservation. A series of mediation analyses found that Anxiety mediated relationships between threat and coping behaviors, and that Panic mediated the relationship between perceived threats and Self-preservation. In addition, we found that scores on all measures, except Panic, increased following the announcement of the first COVID-19 related fatality in Poland, which occurred on the third (middle) day of the study. The mediational relationships we found did not vary as a function of whether the data were collected before or after this announcement. The present results suggest that emotional reactions to perceived threats can serve an instrumental function by providing the motivation to engage in coping behaviors. Such a mechanism complements much research on stress that has focused on how coping mediates threat-emotion relationships.","CypryaÃ…â€žska, Nezlek","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241464","20201030","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6623,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on allied health professions","The purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) on allied health professionals work environment, access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19 testing, and mental health. A 34-question survey was developed and distributed electronically to allied health professionals through listservs of professional organizations and social media groups. A total of 921 responses from allied health professionals in a variety of work settings were analyzed. The majority of allied health professionals had access to medical-grade PPE and agreed with their clinics decisions to stay open or closed. Private practices appeared to be the most negatively impacted with regards to employment in the form of pay reductions, furloughs, lay-offs, or the requirement of using paid time off. Importantly, 86% of all respondents, irrespective of employment status, reported feeling stressed with regards to changes in their work environment and transmission of the virus. However, levels of stress were dependent upon access to PPE and mental health resources. Specifically, those with access to mental health support reported lower stress levels than those without such access. These results highlight the need for continuous monitoring of mental health for allied health professionals in order to inform clinic and hospital policies for PPE and the development of brief interventions to mitigate adverse long-term mental health outcomes.","Coto, Restrepo, Cejas, Prentiss","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241328","20201030","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6624,""
"Social Isolation and Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-National Analysis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in social isolation globally, creating heightened levels of stress and anxiety. This study investigates the link between social isolation and mental well-being in later life, and how it varies across countries. We draw on a subset of older adults from Global Behaviors and Perceptions in the COVID-19 pandemic, a unique global online survey of 13,660 participants from 62 countries. We use mixed-effects models to analyze the data. Social isolation (distancing) significantly predicts poor mental health operationalized as coronavirus-induced distress (p &lt; 0.01). At the aggregate level, average distress varies positively across countries with higher numbers of coronavirus-related deaths (p &lt; 0.10) and more fragile state capacity (p &lt; 0.05), while varying negatively across those with more stringent anti-coronavirus policies (p &lt; 0.05). Finally, we report several cross-level interactions between social isolation and the total number of deaths (p = 0.025), policy stringency (p =0.065), state fragility (p = 0.061), and globalization index (p = 0.071). Our study shows that a proper understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on the mental well-being of older adults should consider the moderating role of national context.","Kim, Jung","https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaa168","20201030","COVID-19; Mental well-being; Multilevel analysis; National context; Social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6625,""
"Virtual Care Expansion in the Veterans Health Administration During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Clinical Services and Patient Characteristics Associated with Utilization","To describe the shift from in-person to virtual care within Veterans Affairs (VA) during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify at-risk patient populations who require greater resources to overcome access barriers to virtual care. Outpatient encounters (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°42,916,349) were categorized by care type (e.g. primary, mental health, etc.) and delivery method (e.g., in-person, video). For 5,400,878 Veterans, we used Generalized Linear models to identify patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with: 1) use of virtual (phone or video) care versus no virtual care and 2) use of video care versus no video care; between 3/11/2020 and 6/6/2020. By June, 58% of VA care was provided virtually compared to only 14% prior. Patients with lower income, higher disability, and more chronic conditions were more likely to receive virtual care during the pandemic. Yet, Veterans aged 45-64 and 65+ were less likely to use video care compared to those aged 18-44 (aRR 0.80 [95%CI 0.79, 0.82] and 0.50 [0.48, 0.52], respectively). Rural and homeless Veterans were 12% and 11% less likely to use video care compared to urban (0.88 [0.86, 0.90]) and non-homeless Veterans (0.89 [0.86, 0.92]). Veterans with high clinical or social need had higher likelihood of virtual service use early in the COVID-19 pandemic, however, older, homeless, and rural Veterans were less likely to have video visits, raising concerns for access barriers. While virtual care may expand access, access barriers must be addressed to avoid exacerbating disparities.","Ferguson, Jacobs, Yefimova, Greene, Heyworth, Zulman","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa284","20201030","COVID-19; Veterans; access to care; disparities; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6626,""
"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with narcolepsy","To the best of our knowledge, there has not as yet been any study on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with narcolepsy; in particular in relation to its impact on sleep schedules, symptoms, the need for medication, work, income, and quality of life. This study therefore aimed to explore these factors and their possible influence on sleep, circadian timing and narcolepsy symptoms during the pandemic. Patients with narcolepsy who had been in quarantine for at least three months completed a 36-question online survey. Questions targeted the conditions of the quarantine, sleep-related behaviors, and factors known to affect sleep and circadian rhythms (work status, income, appetite, narcolepsy symptoms, and medication), as well as the quality of life during the quarantine period. The routines of the participants had been altered by quarantine, with changes in their place of work, and an increase in narcolepsy symptoms such as cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hallucinations, nocturnal awakenings, and sleepiness. Sleep and wake times changed, resulting in altered sleep patterns in the majority of the sample. No association between changes in the place of work and narcolepsy symptoms was found. Regarding medication, the participants used fewer antidepressant pills but took more stimulants. Appetite was increased and self-reported quality of life decreased during the period. During the quarantine the patients with narcolepsy reported changes in their bedtime and waking-up schedules, suggesting a tendency to circadian misalignment. In Brazil, the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak have gone beyond the direct action of the virus, because of the collateral damage it has caused in respect of unemployment, financial hardship and a reduction in quality of life. These impacts have been amplified in Brazil because of the level of social inequality found in the country, and they have particularly affected vulnerable patients with rare diseases, such as the narcolepsy population.","Rodrigues Aguilar, Frange, Huebra, Dias Gomes, Tufik, Santos Coelho","https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.8952","20201030","covid-19; narcolepsy; quality of life; quarantine; sleep; sleep-wake schedules","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6627,""
"Telephone based Interventions for Psychological Problems in Hospital Isolated Patients with COVID-19",": The COVID-19 is overwhelming health care systems globally. Hospital isolation may generate considerable psychological stress. However, there has been scarce evidence on psychological interventions for these patients due to maintain staff safety. We investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of telephone based interventions for psychological problems in hospital isolated patients with COVID-19. Psychiatrists visited the ward where the patients were hospitalized and interventions were given by using a ward telephone for 30 minutes. All patients were approached to receive a two-week psychological intervention program and/or pharmacotherapy whenever needed. Psychological problems were assessed at baseline, one, and two weeks. For the assessment of anxiety and depressive symptoms, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was administered to patients once a week. Insomnia severity index and Beck Depression Inventory 9 item were checked weekly to assess insomnia and suicide idea. Of 33 enrolled, clinically meaningful psychological symptoms were found in 6 (18%) patients for anxiety; 13 (39%) for depression; 10 (30%) for insomnia; and 3 (9%) for suicidal ideation. In 9 patients (27%), psychotropic medications were prescribed to manage anxiety, agitation, depressed mood, insomnia, impulsivity, and suicide idea. Compared to baseline, significant improvements were found in anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation at one week. There were no statistical differences between the values evaluated at baseline and at two weeks. Our report at least indicates potential usefulness of telephone based interventions in hospital isolated patients with COVID-19, and will hopefully form the basis for future randomized clinical trials.","Kim, Stewart, Kang, Jung, Kim, Kim","https://doi.org/10.9758/cpn.2020.18.4.616","20201030","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Suicide.","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6628,""

"Knowledge, Beliefs/Attitudes, and Practices of Rural Residents in the Prevention and Control of COVID-19: An Online Questionnaire Survey","The outbreak of COVID-19 quickly spread to 184 countries and regions around the world. It has drawn great attention from the WHO and was declared an international public health emergency on January 31, 2020. Because the population is generally susceptible to the virus, there are no effective drugs and vaccines, and active participation of the entire population in self-protection and self-isolation has become the key to cutting off transmission routes and effectively controlling the epidemic. A self-designed questionnaire to assess residents' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to COVID-19 prevention and control used the Questionnaire Star service platform, and snowball sampling was used to invite rural residents to complete the questionnaire on WeChat. A total of 554 valid questionnaires were collected. Rural residents' average scores on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding prevention and control were 40 Ã‚Â± 7 (total of 50 points), 45 Ã‚Â± 3 (total of 52 points), and 92 Ã‚Â± 12 (total of 127 points), respectively. A lack of protective materials and weak awareness of prevention and control are the greatest difficulties and challenges experienced by rural residents during the epidemic. Accordingly, social support services, such as public transportation plans, supply chains for living materials, and orderly returns to work, need to be strengthened. Moreover, new infectious disease control is not only a task for individuals but also a global issue. It is of great significance to guarantee information transparency and enhance health risk communication.","Ma, Liu, Tao, Jiang, Wang, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0314","20201030","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6630,""
"Self-care strategies in response to nurses' moral injury during COVID-19 pandemic","These are strange and unprecedented times in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most frontline healthcare professionals have never witnessed anything like this before. As a result, staff may experience numerous and continuous traumatic events, which in many instances, will negatively affect their psychological well-being. Particularly, nurses face extraordinary challenges in response to shifting protocols, triage, shortages of resources, and the astonishing numbers of patients who require care in expedited time constraints. As most healthcare workers are passionate nursing professionals, frustration and often a sense of powerlessness occur when they find themselves unable to provide needed care to their patients. The overwhelming number of deaths, patients isolated and dying alone, and the ever-present fear of being infected and then infecting colleagues, family, friends due to the lack of protective gear or known protocols takes its toll on emotional and psychological well-being. For nurses, the experience of this significant (hopefully once-in-a-lifetime) event can inflict on-going moral injury. Nurses affected by this trauma require education, coping tools, and therapy to help avoid or alleviate the adverse effects on their well-being. Institutions must provide these resources to tend to the well-being of their healthcare staff, during and beyond the pandemic. This article aims to investigate moral distress-considering it as a moral injury-and offer tools and recommendations to support healthcare nurses as they respond to this crisis and its aftermath.","Hossain, Clatty","https://doi.org/10.1177/0969733020961825","20201030","COVID-19; moral distress; moral injury; nurses; pandemic; self-care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6631,""

"[Position paper of the Austrian Alzheimer Association (Ãƒâ€“sterreichische Alzheimer Gesellschaft, Ãƒâ€“AG) : Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria on people with dementia and their care environment-problem areas, recommendations, and strategies]","Older adults are particularly affected by the current COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. The risk of dying from COVID-19 increases with age and is often associated with pre-existing health conditions. Globally, more than 50Ã‚Â million-in Austria currently approximately 140,000 people-suffer from dementia. The co-occurrence of dementia as aÃ‚Â &quot;pandemic of old age&quot; together with the COVID-19 pandemic has aÃ‚Â double impact on persons living with dementia and their caregivers. The COVID-19 pandemic poses major challenges for individuals with dementia and their caregivers: (1)Ã‚Â People with dementia have limited access to information on COVID-19, may have difficulties with protective measures such as wearing masks and in remembering safety regulations. (2)Ã‚Â People with dementia live alone or with their family, or are institutionalized. To reduce the chance of infection among older people in nursing homes, Austrian local authorities have banned visitors to nursing homes and long-term care facilities and implemented strict social-distancing measures. As aÃ‚Â result, older people lost face-to-face contact with their family members, became isolated and social activities stopped. Consequently, anxiety, stress and serious concerns about infections among staff in nursing homes increased and they developed signs of exhaustion and burnout during the full lockdown of the facilities. Thus, due to the emerging COVID-19 crisis, the Austrian Alzheimer Association (Ãƒâ€“sterreichische Alzheimer Gesellschaft, Ãƒâ€“AG) and international societies developed recommendations to support people living with dementia and their caregivers on various issues of physical and mental health.","Defrancesco, Bancher, Dal-Bianco, Hinterhuber, Schmidt, Struhal, Ransmayr, StÃƒÂ¶gmann, Marksteiner","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40211-020-00363-9","20201030","COVID-19; Cargivers; Dementia; Nursing homes; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6633,""

"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated risk factors during the initial stage among the general population in India","In the absence of treatment and unclear prognosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) itself, and public health measures like lockdown enforced by the government to limit the spread of the virus poses a threat to the psychological health of the general population. To assess the psychological status of the Indian population during the initial phase of lockdown. It was a cross-sectional online survey where the questionnaire was disbursed by snowballing. The link to the survey was shared in different social networking platforms between 6th and 22nd of April 2020. The questionnaire collected responses related to the sociodemographic variables, exposure history, precautionary measures used, and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) score. A total of 541 participants responded to the questionnaire. Only 422 respondents' responses from 23 states of India who completed the questionnaire were included for assessment. The mean age of the participants was 30.5 (SD=10.9) years. Female constituted 60.4% (n=255) of the respondents. The pre-existing medical illness that the respondents had were diabetes mellitus, four per cent (n=17), hypertension, five per cent (n=21), thyroid dysfunction, nine per cent (n=38), and mental illness, five per cent (n=21). The median (IQR) of the DASS-21 item scale was found to be 16 (4-32). The percentage of the respondents who reported stress was 35.5% (n=149), anxiety, 32% (n=135), and depression, 34.7% (n=146). Respondents with sociodemographic variables like being single, student status, competed education till graduation, homemakers, working in public sector, and history of mental illness were more likely to experience stress, anxiety, and depression. A majority of the respondents were practicing hand hygiene and social distancing. Respondents who were unaware of their exposure status were more likely to have depression. The Indian population is experiencing the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which may increase with the spread of the infection. India needs to gear up to face mental health consequences. People with a pre-existing physical and psychological illness needs extra care and precaution to prevent any relapse or development of complications.","Hazarika, Das, Bhandari, Sharma","https://doi.org/10.5958/2394-2061.2021.00009.4","20201030","Anxiety; Depression; Mental Health; Public Health; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6635,""
"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice of High-Risk Age Groups to Coronavirus Disease-19 Prevention and Control in Korem District, Tigray, Ethiopia: Cross-Sectional Study","The emerging of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China, since the time declared as a public health emergency of international concern, its impact on the lives of people is negatively substantial. Despite the vulnerability of all ages from the pandemic, evidence showed that elder people are at high-risk for adverse outcomes from coronavirus disease-19. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of high-risk age groups to coronavirus disease-19 prevention and control in Korem district, Tigray, Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among high-risk age groups from April 2 to May 9/2020 in Korem district, Tigray, Ethiopia. A total of 422 study participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique. The collected data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 22.0 for analysis. Multivariable analysis was done using linear regression after checking collinearity, and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 419 study participants were included in the study with a response rate of 99.3%. Overall, about 37.7%, 43.4%, and 52.5% of participants had poor knowledge, negative attitude, and poor practice towards coronavirus disease-19 prevention and control, respectively. Being elder (Ã¢â€°Â¥80) years, with no formal education, and having low-income status were among the significantly associated factors. About 76.1% of the respondents did not use hand-rub-based alcohol or sanitizer, and 88.8% did not use any mask in crowding area. Generally, the knowledge about coronavirus disease-19 in elders was roughly appropriate but the preventive practices and attitude towards coronavirus disease-19 were found less and inappropriate. Since no proven medicine is invented yet, so maximizing knowledge, increasing behavioral change, and strengthening preventive practices towards coronavirus disease-19 prevention and control is the appropriate solution.","Adhena, Hidru","https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S275168","20201030","COVID-19; Ethiopia; Korem; attitude; elders; knowledge; practice; risky group","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6636,""
"The Experience of COPD Patients in Lockdown Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic","On March 16, 2020, the Spanish government declared a state of alarm due to the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were restricted to remain confined at home, and medical visits were cancelled for 3 months. The impact of this lockdown on the manifestations of COPD and the quality-of-life of these patients has not been explored. One hundred patients with COPD were interviewed by telephone from May 2-18, 2020. The interviews included questions about the lockdown, missed medical appointments, fears of the disease, possible COVID-19 infection, and exacerbations of COPD suffered during this period and their management. In addition, the COPD Assessment Test, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression, and the 5-Dimension Euro Quality-of-Life questionnaires were administered. Sixty-four (64%) patients claimed to have strictly complied with the lockdown, and only 42 (42%) stated they had left home at least once during lockdown. Only one patient (1%) was hospitalized due to COVID-19, and 13 (13%) patients presented an exacerbation of COPD self-managed at home with no admissions due to exacerbation of COPD during this period. A medical consultation or complementary test was cancelled in 90% of the patients, but 61% had a medical telephone visit with a high degree of satisfaction (mean 9.3/10). Most patients declared that their feeling regarding lung disease and general health was similar or even better during lockdown (82% and 81%, respectively). Our results indicate that in general lockdown had a low impact on COPD patients. Only one patient was affected by COVID-19, but moderate exacerbations of COPD were not infrequent. Although many medical visits and test were cancelled, patients were very satisfied with the medical telephone visits.","Pleguezuelos, Del Carmen, Moreno, Ortega, Vila, Ovejero, Serra-Prat, Palomera, Garnacho-CastaÃƒÂ±o, Loeb, Farago, Miravitlles","https://doi.org/10.2147/COPD.S268421","20201030","COPD; COVID-19; lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6637,""

"The Protective Roles of Exercise and Maintenance of Daily Living Routines for Chinese Adolescents During the COVID-19 Quarantine Period","Adolescents are particularly vulnerable during the COVID-19 quarantine periods and may be at risk for developing psychological distress symptoms that extend beyond a crisis, including depression. This study examined adolescents' postquarantine depressive symptoms associated with pandemic stressors. The primary aim was to identify potential protective factors that may buffer the association between the presence of COVID-19 cases in adolescents' communities and their postquarantine depressive symptoms. Adolescents from public schools were recruited from Zhengzhou city, Henan, China (NÃ‚Â = 1,487, M<sub>age=</sub>13.14Ã‚Â years, 50% girls). Adolescents reported the presence of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases in their communities, their daily activities and routines during the 2-month quarantine period, and depressive symptoms after the quarantine period. The presence of cases in adolescents' communities during the quarantine contributed to more depressive symptoms in adolescents after the quarantine. This association was buffered by adolescents' spending more time on physical activities and better maintenance of daily living routines during the quarantine period. The presence of community infection was also more strongly associated with depressive symptoms in older adolescents. The presence of COVID-19 cases in communities contributed to adolescents' poorer mental health, and the association was stronger for older adolescents. Spending time on physical activities and maintaining daily living routines during the quarantine appear to be practical strategies that can be used by adolescents to mitigate the association between pandemic stressors and their diminishing mental health.","Ren, He, Bian, Shang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.09.026","20201030","Adolescent mental health; COVID-19; Daily routines; Depressive symptoms; Physical activities; Protective factors; Quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6639,""
"The psychotherapeutic practice and potential of mental health nurses: an Australian survey","ObjectiveMental health nurses (MHNs) have a long, under-recognised, history of engaging in psychotherapeutic practice across the spectrum of mental illness and mental health problems. There is a need for a psychotherapeutic response for people with complex or serious mental health problems within the stepped care model and in response to increased need for psychotherapeutic responses to COVID-19 and natural disasters. This project sought to identify the educational preparation and self-reported competency of MHNs to clinically undertake psychotherapy across the continuum of care.MethodsSituated within a larger mixed-methods study exploring how MHNs practice psychotherapy, adapt it to routine care and envisage the future, this paper reports the findings from a survey of MHNs regarding their educational preparation, experience and competence in modalities of psychotherapy and the application of psychotherapy with specific clinical groups.ResultsIn all, 153 MHNs responded to a request to participate in the study. In this cohort, 86% of nurses had postgraduate qualifications specific to psychotherapy and 95% had worked for over 10 years in the mental health field and had hundreds of hours of training in psychotherapy. There was a high level of self-reported competence in working with people with serious mental health problems and at-risk or vulnerable groups.ConclusionsCurrently, MHNs are not recognised in federal funding arrangements to procure psychotherapeutic intervention for members of the Australian population who require it. MHNs ought to be recognised as independent providers based on both the psychotherapeutic skills they possess and their specialist clinical skills of working with people across the spectrum of mental health problems. Appropriately qualified MHNs need to be funded to use their skills in psychotherapy via access to appropriate funding arrangements, such as Better Access and the National Disability Insurance Scheme.What is known about the topic?MHNs do not appear to be recognised as having postgraduate knowledge and skills in psychotherapy and other psychotherapeutic interventions. This lack of recognition has resulted in the Australian public being unable to access subsidised specialist psychotherapeutic services by this highly experienced group. Most published commentary has been around the Mental Health Nurse Incentive Program, but, to date, scholarly work related to this program has not influenced public views and policy formation despite multiple favourable evaluations.What does this paper add?This study highlights that MHNs possess a largely unrecognised and valuable skill set in psychotherapy practice that they can adapt to work with people with complex needs.What are the implications to practitioners?MHNs possess skills and experience that, if recognised and funded, could be rapidly mobilised to improve consumer outcomes across the continuum of stepped care and in response to increased need during COVID-19.","Lakeman, Cashin, Hurley, Ryan","https://doi.org/10.1071/AH19208","20201030","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6640,""
"COVID-19-Related Mental Health Effects in the Workplace: A Narrative Review","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has deeply altered social and working environments in several ways. Social distancing policies, mandatory lockdowns, isolation periods, and anxiety of getting sick, along with the suspension of productive activity, loss of income, and fear of the future, jointly influence the mental health of citizens and workers. Workplace aspects can play a crucial role on moderating or worsening mental health of people facing this pandemic scenario. The purpose of this literature review is to deepen the psychological aspects linked to workplace factors, following the epidemic rise of COVID-19, in order to address upcoming psychological critical issues in the workplaces. We performed a literature search using Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus, selecting papers focusing on workers' psychological problems that can be related to the workplace during the pandemic. Thirty-five articles were included. Mental issues related to the health emergency, such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and sleep disorders are more likely to affect healthcare workers, especially those on the frontline, migrant workers, and workers in contact with the public. Job insecurity, long periods of isolation, and uncertainty of the future worsen the psychological condition, especially in younger people and in those with a higher educational background. Multiple organizational and work-related interventions can mitigate this scenario, such as the improvement of workplace infrastructures, the adoption of correct and shared anti-contagion measures, including regular personal protective equipment (PPE) supply, and the implementation of resilience training programs. This review sets the basis for a better understanding of the psychological conditions of workers during the pandemic, integrating individual and social perspectives, and providing insight into possible individual, social, and occupational approaches to this &quot;psychological pandemic&quot;.","Giorgi, Lecca, Alessio, Finstad, Bondanini, Lulli, Arcangeli, Mucci","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17217857","20201030","COVID-19 pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; mental health; occupational health and safety; psychological disorders; workplace organization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6641,""

"Prevalence of anxiety and depression in South Asia during COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted biopsychosocial health and wellbeing globally. Pre-pandemic studies suggest a high prevalence of common mental disorders, including anxiety and depression in South Asian countries, which may aggravate during this pandemic. This systematic meta-analytic review was conducted to estimate the pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression in South Asian countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: We systematically searched for cross-sectional studies on eight major bibliographic databases and additional sources up to October 12, 2020, that reported the prevalence of anxiety or depression in any of the eight South Asian countries. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled proportion of anxiety and depression. Results: A total of 35 studies representing 41,402 participants were included in this review. The pooled prevalence of anxiety in 31 studies with a pooled sample of 28,877 was 41.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 34.7-48.1, I2 = 99.18%). Moreover, the pooled prevalence of depression was 34.1% (95% CI: 28.9-39.4, I2 = 99%) among 37,437 participants in 28 studies. Among the South Asian countries, India had a higher number of studies, whereas Bangladesh and Pakistan had a higher pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression. No studies were identified from Afghanistan, Bhutan, and Maldives. Studies in this review had high heterogeneity and varying prevalence across sub-groups. Conclusion: South Asian countries have high prevalence rates of anxiety and depression, suggesting a heavy psychosocial burden during this pandemic. Clinical and public mental health interventions should be prioritized alongside improving the social determinants of mental health in these countries. Lastly, a low number of studies with high heterogeneity requires further research exploring the psychosocial epidemiology during COVID-19, which may inform better mental health policymaking and practice in South Asia.","Mahbub Hossain et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-A84-FE2","20201031","PsyArXiv|Meta-science; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; epidemiology; india; nepal; depression; anxiety; afghanistan; syndemic; pakistan; sri lanka; south asia; maldives; covid-19; bhutan; psychiatry; bangladesh; pandemic; coronavirus; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6644,""
"Anxiety Talking: Does Anxiety Predict Sharing Information about COVID-19?","Could fear and anxiety play a functional role during the COVID-19 pandemic by driving greater information sharing about the viral threat? To explore whether anxiety may serve as a unique emotional indicator of sharing information in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we used a representative sample of the United States from the American Trends Panel (N=9,188) conducted April 20th-26th, 2020. Participants reported how they have felt in the past week, where they got their news about the outbreak from, and whether they had posted COVID-19 news on social media or discussed the pandemic with others. Even after controlling for other emotions, news sources, and a range of demographic measures, feeling anxiousâ€”more so that other negative emotions, such as feeling depressedâ€”predicted greater information sharing on social media (<U+0001D6FD> = .05, p < .001) and beyond (<U+0001D6FD> = .14, p < .001). These findings are consistent with functionalist theories of emotion, which predict that fear and anxiety play a unique role in both identifying and communicating threats to oneself and to others.","Ori Cantwell et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46141-929-0DF","20201031","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Evolution; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Evolution|Survival and Psychological Adaptations; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Motivational Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; mental health; trump; computer-mediated communication; technology; health behavior; covid-19; coronavirus; pandemic; social psychology; information sharing; health psychology; mass media; emotion; cmc; media; social media; depression; communication; covid19; anxiety; health; information; misinformation; donald trump; cyberpsychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-31","",6645,""
