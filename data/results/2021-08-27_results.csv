"Survivors of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Show Neuropsychiatric Sequelae Measured by Surveys, Neurocognitive Testing, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Preliminary Results","A significant number of individuals experience physical, cognitive, and mental health symptoms in the months after acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This study assessed depressive and anxious symptoms, cognition, and brain structure and function in participants with symptomatic COVID-19 confirmed by PCR testing (n=100) approximately three months following infection, leveraging self-report questionnaires, objective neurocognitive testing, and structural and functional neuroimaging data. Preliminary results demonstrated that over 1/5 of our cohort endorsed clinically significant depressive and/or anxious symptoms, and >40% of participants had cognitive impairment on objective testing across multiple domains, consistent with brain-fog. While depression and one domain of quality of life (physical functioning) were significantly different between hospitalized and non-hospitalized participants, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and most domains of functioning were not, suggesting that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection does not necessarily relate to the severity of neuropsychiatric outcomes and impaired functioning in the months after infection. Furthermore, we found that the majority of participants in a subset of our cohort who completed structural and functional neuroimaging (n=15) had smaller olfactory bulbs and sulci in conjunction with anosmia. We also showed that this subset of participants had dysfunction in attention network functional connectivity and ventromedial prefrontal cortex seed-based functional connectivity. These functional imaging dysfunctions have been observed previously in depression and correlated with levels of inflammation. Our results support and extend previous findings in the literature concerning the neuropsychiatric sequelae associated with long COVID. Ongoing data collection and analyses within this cohort will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the longitudinal relationships between neuropsychiatric symptoms, neurocognitive performance, brain structure and function, and inflammatory and immune profiles.","Laura M Hack; Jacob Brawer; Megan Chesnut; Xue Zhang; Max Wintermark; Bin Jiang; Philip Grant; Hector Bonilla; Patrick Stetz; Jerome A Yesavage; Aruna Subramanian; Leanne M Williams","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.23.21256078","20210826","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17383,""
"Improving Mental Health Awareness","It's important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of mental illness and to take action to ensure people experiencing mental health problems receive the assistance and treatment they need. For nurses, this is as true at home as it is at work, particularly so when a person is exhibiting aggressive tendencies or other behaviors that could potentially lead to harm. With the COVID-19 crisis leading many family members to live more closely together for extended periods, nurses should be able to identify concerning behaviors and know what to do if they observe these in their loved ones.","Sabella","https://doi.org/10.1097/01.NAJ.0000790660.73133.d8","20210826","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17384,""

"Preliminary suicide trends during the COVID-19 pandemic in Milan, Italy","Europe was the second most affected continent by the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, with Italy paying very high death tolls, especially in Lombardy, a region in Northern Italy. The pandemic profoundly impacted mental health and the world's rates of suicide since its outbreak. COVID-19-related suicide rates nonetheless followed a non-linear trend over the pandemic, decreasing after the COVID-19 outbreak, then raising during an extended follow-up period. Thus, we aimed to further assess the suicide rates in Lombardy. We carried out a retrospective analysis of all the autopsies performed in the year 2020 and within the first four months of the year 2021 through the database of the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Milan. In the year 2020, the recorded suicides decreased in comparison to 2016-2019 (21.19-22.97% of the autopsies), being 98 (18.08% out of 542 autopsies), while, in the first 4 months of the year 2021, 35 suicides were documented (185 autopsies, overall). Since the region of Lombardy was severely affected by COVID-19 since the early months of the year 2020, the extended retrospective follow-up allowed for firmer conclusions and insights about the need to extend the follow-up of COVID-19 pandemic beyond the first months after the outbreak, worldwide. This is with special emphasis towards the need to allocate the proper funds for mental health prevention for the general population as well as the most vulnerable ones, such as people with severe mental illness and caregivers, frontline health workers, and others bereaved by COVID-19.","Calati, Gentile, Fornaro, Tambuzzi, Zoja","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.08.029","20210826","COVID-19; Italy; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17386,""
"Attitudes of patients with severe mental illness towards COVID-19 vaccinations: A preliminary report from a public psychiatric hospital","As patients with severe mental illness are at increased risk for COVID-19 mortality, the issue of willingness to be vaccinated is of extreme importance. During February 2021 Shalvata Mental Health hospital provided Covid-19 vaccines to its patients. Fifty one patients suffering from severe mental illness, out of 196 patients hospitalized in closed, open or day wards during that period, signed the informed consent and were assessed for their clinical condition (OQ-45), fear of Covid-19 (FCV-19S) and approach to the vaccine (C19-VHS). All patients who were not vaccinated in February 2021 (baseline) were re-approached a month later to assess whether they had gotten vaccinated since. Patients who were not vaccinated at baseline had an oppositional approach to the vaccine, and did not significantly differ in their fear of Covid-19 levels or in levels of clinical severity (t(49)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.51, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02) from those who were vaccinated. From the 29 patients who were not vaccinated at baseline approach to the vaccine was a good predictor to getting vaccinated after one month (79% positive predictive value). The majority of patients suffering from a severe mental illness are willing to get vaccinated, and their decision of whether or not to get vaccinated is based on their viewpoint on the vaccine rather than being an outcome of their level of distress (OQ-45). It is important to allow vaccine accessibility to hospitalized patients, to consider their opinions and to provide useful information to lower vaccine hesitancy and improve vaccination rates.","Danenberg, Shemesh, Tzur Bitan, Maoz, Saker, Dror, Hertzberg, Bloch","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.08.020","20210826","Covid-19; Mental illness; Vaccination hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17387,""

"Mental Health and Substance Use Among Adults with Disabilities During the COVID-19 Pandemic - United States, February-March 2021","Adults with disabilities, a group including &gt;25% of U.S. adults (1), experience higher levels of mental health and substance use conditions and lower treatment rates than do adults without disabilities* (2,3). Survey data collected during April-September 2020 revealed elevated adverse mental health symptoms among adults with disabilities (4) compared with the general adult population (5). Despite disproportionate risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality among some adults with disabilities (6), information about mental health and substance use in this population during the pandemic is limited. To identify factors associated with adverse mental health symptoms and substance use among adults with disabilities, the COVID-19 Outbreak Public Evaluation (COPE) Initiative<sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â </sup> administered nonprobability-based Internet surveys to 5,256 U.S. adults during February-March 2021 (response rateÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 62.1%). Among 5,119 respondents who completed a two-item disability screener, nearly one third (1,648; 32.2%) screened as adults with disabilities. These adults more frequently experienced symptoms of anxiety or depression (56.6% versus 28.7%, respectively), new or increased substance use (38.8% versus 17.5%), and suicidal ideation (30.6% versus 8.3%) than did adults without disabilities. Among all adults who had received a diagnosis of mental health or substance use conditions, adults with disabilities more frequently (42.6% versus 35.3%; p &lt;0.001) reported that the pandemic made it harder for them to access related care or medication. Enhanced mental health and substance use screening among adults with disabilities and improved access to medical services are critical during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Czeisler, Board, Thierry, Czeisler, Rajaratnam, Howard, Clarke","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7034a3","20210826","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17389,""

"""Corticosteroids for COVID-19 symptoms and quality of life at one year from admission""","The long-term evolution of COVID-19 is unknown, making it necessary to study the persistence of symptoms over time and their impact on quality of life in people who have had the disease. We analysed these aspects at one year from admission for COVID-19 and explored the influence of treatment with systemic corticosteroids during the acute phase of the illness. This observational cohort study took place in a tertiary hospital in March and April 2021 and included people admitted due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 in March, April, or May 2020. We excluded patients who had died, were unreachable, or had substantial cognitive impairment. A telephone survey was undertaken to assess the presence of symptoms related to COVID-19 and to administer the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire. Other variables collected were demographic and clinical data along with the treatment received and the evolution over time. We analysed 76 patients, including 44 who did not receive corticosteroids and 32 who did. Most symptoms were less frequent in the group that received corticosteroids, with statistically significant differences for headache, dysphagia, chest pain, and depression. These patients also showed significantly better outcomes in the SF-36 domains for 'bodily pain' and 'mental health'. Corticosteroids administered in the acute phase of COVID-19 could attenuate the presence of long-term symptoms and improve patients' quality of life. This article is protected by copyright.

"Risk Factors Affecting Mental Health During The Early Stages Of The Covid-19 Pandemic In High-Risk 50+ Population In The Czech Republic","This study deals with key factors affecting mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results are based on the longitudinal representative 50+Ã‚Â population-based multi-country panel study Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) in which representative samples of individuals in European countries plus Israel were collected. The goal is to turn the challenges of aging into opportunities as well as provide valid and reliable data for evidence-based policies. A total of 2,631 participants were interviewed by telephone in the Czech Republic during the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. After a descriptive analysis showed that participants complied well with most preventative and protective COVID-19 measures, subsequent modeling using logistic regression analysis and a decision tree algorithm identified key determinants that have contributed to an understanding of variation in declared feelings of depression. We found that nervousness, previously unexperienced trouble with sleep, and self-rated health status before the COVID-19 outbreak and gender remained significant predictors of depression, from which statistically significant different categories concerning the percentage of depression could be formed. These identified potential risk factors should be considered in planning further supportive strategies for high-risk 50+Ã‚Â population.","VaculÃƒÂ­kovÃƒÂ¡, HankovÃƒÂ¡","https://doi.org/10.1080/01634372.2021.1939219","20210826","COVID-19; depression; determinants; older adults; risk factors; share","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17392,""
"Stress symptoms and resilience factors in children with neurodevelopmental disabilities and their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study examined the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Italy by specifically looking at the psychosocial response of children/adolescents with neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD) and their parents, and explored which factors could potentially contribute to increasing or mitigating stress-related behaviors in children/adolescents as well as their parents' stress. An online anonymous survey was designed to investigate family demographic characteristics, COVID-19 outbreak and restriction-related variables, children/adolescents' behavioral regulation problems, parental stress, and resilience. Data were collected from 1,472 parents (83.1% mothers) of 1632 NDD children/adolescents (33.7% females). Compared to pre-emergency, parents reported a significant increase in their children's behavioral regulation problems: Anxious/depressed behavior, Attention problems, and Aggressive behavior (p &lt; .001), and they reported feeling more Overwhelmed and Burdened (p &lt; .001) as parents but less Unfulfilled, Numbness, Devastated, and Angry (p &lt; .001). A hierarchical stepwise regression analysis revealed that both behavioral regulation problems in NDD children/adolescents and parental stress are-at least partially-buffered by resilience factors in parents (Perception of self, Planned future, Family cohesion). Results showed that behavioral regulation problems in children/adolescents with NDD and parental stress increased. However, parental resilience can act as a protective factor, counterbalancing parental difficulties in the care of their NDD children during the emergency. Identifying risk and protective factors impacting the psychosocial response ofchildren/adolescents with NDD and their parents is essential to implement appropriate support interventions both for parents and children/adolescents with NDD during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Chinese American adolescents' experiences of COVID-19 racial discrimination: Risk and protective factors for internalizing difficulties","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has fueled anti-Asian racism and xenophobia in the United States, which negatively impact Asian Americans' adjustment. To identify risk and protective factors for Chinese American adolescents' mental health, the present study examined: (1) the associations between Chinese American adolescents' experiences of COVID-19-related racial discrimination and their internalizing difficulties; (2) the moderating roles of: (a) adolescents' bicultural identity integration (BII; harmony and blendedness dimensions separately) and (b) parents' promotion of mistrust ethnic-racial socialization (PMERS); and (c) the interplay between BII and PMERS in the associations between racial discrimination and internalizing difficulties. Participants included 211 Chinese American adolescents of 10-18 years old (M age = 13.92, SD = 2.33; 48% girls) and their parents (M age = 46.18 years, SD = 5.17; 81% mothers). Overall, adolescents' experiences of COVID-19-related racial discrimination were associated with more internalizing difficulties, and this association was buffered by BII harmony and blendedness and exacerbated by PMERS. However, a complex interplay among specific BII dimensions and parental PMERS in the associations between racial discrimination and adolescent internalizing problems was revealed. Adolescents with lower levels of BII blendedness were more vulnerable to the negative effects of racial discrimination on their internalizing problems and more susceptible to their parents' PMERS; adolescents who reported higher levels of BII harmony and perceived lower levels of parental PMERS were more protected from the negative effects of racial discrimination on their internalizing problems. Both adolescents' and parents' contributions should be considered simultaneously in promoting resilience in Chinese American families.

"The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic for families of infants involved with Child Protection Services for maltreatment concerns","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical distancing restrictions have exacerbated social, economic and health disadvantage within our communities. With increases in mental health difficulties and family violence already being seen, there is concern that the risk of child maltreatment risk may also be increased. The current study aimed to explore the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic for families identified to be at risk of child maltreatment in Victoria, Australia. Understanding the experiences of the pandemic for families already at risk is essential in identifying how to best support vulnerable parents and young children during this challenging time. Interviews were conducted with 11 parents currently involved with Child Protection Services, and nine clinicians working within a child and family health services, supporting clients with child protection involvement. Parents and clinicians described a range of pandemic related stressors including employment and financial stress, worry about infection and changes to service access. In addition, parents with children in out of home care discussed decreased access to their children resulting from physical distancing restrictions. Parents and clinicians perceived the pandemic to be having a negative impact on parent mental health, parenting stress and isolation. Although parents raised minimal concerns about the impact of the pandemic on child well-being, clinicians expressed concerns about the rise in risk factors for child maltreatment. Parents discussed a range of coping strategies which they perceived to be helpful during the pandemic, and clinicians and parents described the need for additional mental health support and support to access basic needs. The study highlights the importance of ensuring at risk families have access to parenting and mental health support throughout the pandemic and the importance of ensuring children within at-risk families are sighted and their safety assessed.","Fogarty, Jones, Evans, O'Brien, Giallo","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13555","20210826","COVID-19; child maltreatment; family violence; infant mental health; pandemic; parent mental health; parenting support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17396,""
"The short-term effect of COVID-19 pandemic on disability, pain intensity, psychological status, and exercise habits in patients with chronic pain","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the lives of people worldwide. The first declaration of a state of emergency in Japan, based on the Act on Special Measures for the Prevention and Control of the Novel Coronavirus, was issued from 16 April 2020 to 14 May 2020 to reduce person-to-person contact. Restrictions on going out, participating in community activities, and visiting hospitals were in place. This study investigates the short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with chronic pain. This study included outpatients with chronic pain undergoing treatment at the Pain Center of Nara Medical University Hospital. The patients had completed questionnaires for a disability during the study period, from 1 July to 30 September 2019 (baseline), 1 October to 31 December 2019 (pre-pandemic), and 1 July to 30 September 2020 (during the pandemic). The questionnaire covered changes in disability, pain intensity, health-related quality of life (QOL), anxiety, depression, catastrophic thinking, and the presence/absence of exercise habits at baseline, pre-pandemic, and during the pandemic. Of the 245 eligible patients, there was no significant disability difference between baseline, pre-pandemic, and during the pandemic (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.14). Similarly, pain intensity, health-related QOL, anxiety, depression, and the presence/absence of exercise habits did not significantly differ between baseline, pre-pandemic, and during the pandemic either. The current study observed significant differences in terms of catastrophic thinking (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02).

"Preexisting Mental Disorders Increase the Risk of COVID-19 Infection and Associated Mortality","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease of unknown origin, has a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Individuals with mental disorders may have a higher risk of infection and worse clinical outcomes because of a variety of factors such as poorer general resilience and lower immune function. However, there have been no studies to date specifically investigating the risk of COVID-19 and associated mortality in these patients. This was addressed in the present study by analyzing the data of 473,958 subjects included in the UK Biobank, 14,877 of whom tested positive for COVID-19 infection. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations between mental disorders and risks of COVID-19 infection and associated mortality. The results showed that subjects who were diagnosed with a mental disorder had a significantly higher risk of developing COVID-19 and a worse outcome as evidenced by higher rates of COVID-19-related mortality, with the strongest effects observed for dementia. Among dementia subtypes, Alzheimer disease patients had the highest risks of COVID-19 infection (7.39-fold increase) and associated mortality (2.13-fold increase). Late-life anxiety only increased the risk of developing COVID-19 while late-life depression not only was associated with a higher risk of infection but also a worse outcome. These findings highlight the need to prioritize patients with mental disorders-especially those who experience these disorders later in life-when implementing preventive strategies such as vaccinations.","Wang, Yang, Ren, Shao, Tao, Dai","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.684112","20210826","COVID-19; Parkinson's disease; SARS-CoV-2; dementia; late-life; mental disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17398,""

These 200 samples were randomly extracted from the list of employees and selected. Data were collected using three questionnaires, including (1) a demographic, (2) the NASA-Task Load Index (1988) (Hart &amp; Staveland, 1988) and (3) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Quality of Life. Data were analyzed using SPSS-24 software and descriptive and analytical statistical methods. The overall mean scores of nurses' quality of work life were significantly different between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05). The average score of quality of life in nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 is 92.57, more than nurses caring for patients without COVID-19, 79.43. Among the dimensions of mental workload: Performance and efficiency, with an average score of 77.32 Ã‚Â± 15.85, had the highest score, while discouragement and failure, with an average score of 58.04 Ã‚Â± 26.72, had the lowest score of mental workload. There is a significant difference between the mental load of work in the two groups (P = 0.001). There is a significant inverse relationship between total quality of work life and total mental workload (r = -14 and P = 0.01). In this study, it was observed that nurses caring for Covid-19 patients are in a more unfavorable situation in terms of the studied characteristics. Due to the work period, these nurses have a high workload and a low quality of work life to compensate for the mental and physical deficiencies required by a long presence in the work environment.","Nikeghbal, Kouhnavard, Shabani, Zamanian","https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.3386","20210826","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17399,""
"Online search trends and word-related emotional response during COVID-19 lockdown in Italy: a cross-sectional online study","The strong and long lockdown adopted by the Italian government to limit COVID-19 spreading represents the first threat-related mass isolation in history that can be studied in depth by scientists to understand individuals' emotional response to a pandemic. We investigated the effects on individuals' mental wellbeing of this long-term isolation by means of an online survey on 71 Italian volunteers. They completed the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and Fear of COVID-19 Scale and judged valence, arousal, and dominance of words either related or unrelated to COVID-19, as identified by Google search trends. Emotional judgments changes from normative data varied depending on word type and individuals' emotional state, revealing early signals of individuals' mental distress to COVID-19 confinement. All individuals judged COVID-19-related words to be less positive and dominant. However, individuals with more negative feelings and COVID-19 fear also judged COVID-19-unrelated words to be less positive and dominant. Moreover, arousal ratings increased for all words among individuals with more negative feelings and COVID-19 fear but decreased among individuals with less negative feelings and COVID-19 fear. Our results show a rich picture of emotional reactions of Italians to tight and 2-month long confinement, identifying early signals of mental health distress. They are an alert to the need for intervention strategies and psychological assessment of individuals potentially needing mental health support following the COVID-19 situation.","Montefinese, Ambrosini, Angrilli","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11858","20210826","Affective rating; Coping; Covid-19; Emotional response; Google trends; Lockdown; Online search; Words","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17400,""
"Anxiety and depression symptoms in older adults during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: A community-based cross-sectional study","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has caused high morbidity and mortality in older adults over the world. Because the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic greatly affects older adults who have a preexisting health condition, they are generally susceptible to a high incidence of severe symptoms of anxiety and depression. Therefore, we aimed to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in older adults during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Community-based cross-sectional study was completed in August 2020. Standardized and pretested General Anxiety Disorder-7 and Geriatric Depression Scale were used to screen the symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Data were entered into EpiData (version 4.3.2) and transferred to SPSS (version 24) for further analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out to determine the significantly associated variables with a 95% confidence interval at <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05. Of the total older adults interviewed, 68.7% had developed symptoms of anxiety and 59.9% had symptoms of depression during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Female participants, having a chronic disease and poor knowledge of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms. Age category of 81 to 90 and above 90, lack of social support, and having a chronic disease were significantly associated with symptoms of depression. The symptoms of anxiety and depression among older adults in the North Shoa Zone during coronavirus disease 2019 were higher than before the coronavirus disease 2019 happened. The results were evidence points for developing a psychological intervention to tackle the older adults' mental health needs in the community during and after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Jemal, Geleta, Deriba, Awol","https://doi.org/10.1177/20503121211040050","20210826","Coronavirus disease 2019; Ethiopia; anxiety; depression; older adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17401,""
"The association between COVID-19 related stressors and mental health in refugees living in Australia","Refugees may be particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health due to their traumatic pasts and the challenges of the postmigration environment. To evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 related stressors and their relationship to key mental health and functioning outcomes in a resettled refugee sample. <i>N</i> =Ã‚Â 656 refugees and asylum seekers living in Australia completed a survey in June 2020 to index their mental health (posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, health anxiety and disability) and COVID-19 experiences. The relationship between COVID-19 stressors and mental health was examined using a series of hierarchical linear regression models while controlling for other key demographic factors. Refugees' most prevalent stressors related to worries of being infected by COVID-19 or the risk COVID-19 posed to others, which predicted health anxiety and PTSD. Social-related difficulties predicted depression and disability symptoms. Accessing and trusting information from authorities were the least prevalent stressors and were not significantly associated with mental health outcomes; neither was accessing basic supplies and financial support. Fears relating to the future such as concerns about visa application processes predicted health anxiety and disability. Crucially, the strongest predictor of all mental health outcomes was COVID-19 serving as a reminder of difficult past events. Refugees may be uniquely affected by COVID-19 because the pandemic serves as a reminder of their past conflict and persecution trauma. It is critical that mental health strategies accommodate the specific needs of refugees during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Antecedentes</b>: Los refugiados pueden ser particularmente vulnerables a los efectos adversos de la pandemia del COVID-19 en la salud mental a consecuencia de sus pasados traumÃƒÂ¡ticos y los desafÃƒÂ­os del ambiente post migraciÃƒÂ³n.<b>Objetivo</b>: Evaluar la prevalencia de los estresores relacionados al COVID-19 y su relaciÃƒÂ³n a resultados claves funcionamiento y salud mental claves en una muestra de refugiados reubicados.<b>MÃƒÂ©todo</b>: <i>N</i> =Ã‚Â 656 refugiados y personas en bÃƒÂºsqueda de asilo que viven en Australia completaron una encuesta en junio de 2020 para identificar su salud mental (trastorno de estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico (TEPT), depresiÃƒÂ³n, ansiedad de salud y discapacidad) y las experiencias de COVID-19. Fueron examinadas la relaciÃƒÂ³n entre los estresores de COVID-19 y la salud mental usando una serie de modelos de regresiÃƒÂ³n lineal jerÃƒÂ¡rquica mientras se controlaron otros factores demogrÃƒÂ¡ficos claves.<b>Resultados</b>: Los estresores mÃƒÂ¡s prevalentes de los refugiados se relacionaban con la preocupaciÃƒÂ³n de infectarse de COVID-19 o el riesgo del COVID-19 hacia otros, lo cual predijo la ansiedad de salud y TEPT. Las dificultades sociales predijeron los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de depresiÃƒÂ³n y discapacidad. Acceder y confiar en la informaciÃƒÂ³n proporcionada por las autoridades fueron los estresores menos prevalentes y no se asociaron significativamente a los resultados de salud mental; tampoco lo fue el acceder a insumos bÃƒÂ¡sicos y apoyo financiero. Los temores asociados al futuro tales como preocupaciones sobre los procesos de aplicaciÃƒÂ³n a la visa predijeron la ansiedad de salud y discapacidad. De manera crucial, el predictor mÃƒÂ¡s fuerte de todos los resultados de salud mental fue el COVID-19 sirviendo como un recordatorio de los eventos pasados difÃƒÂ­ciles.<b>Conclusiones</b>: Los refugiados pueden estar afectados de forma ÃƒÂºnica por el COVID-19 porque la pandemia sirve como un recordatorio de sus conflictos pasados y trauma de persecuciÃƒÂ³n.

"Applications of laboratory findings in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of COVID-19","The worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents us with a serious public health crisis. To combat the virus and slow its spread, wider testing is essential. There is a need for more sensitive, specific, and convenient detection methods of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Advanced detection can greatly improve the ability and accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, which is conducive to the early suitable treatment and supports precise prophylaxis. In this article, we combine and present the latest laboratory diagnostic technologies and methods for SARS-CoV-2 to identify the technical characteristics, considerations, biosafety requirements, common problems with testing and interpretation of results, and coping strategies of commonly used testing methods. We highlight the gaps in current diagnostic capacity and propose potential solutions to provide cutting-edge technical support to achieve a more precise diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19 and to overcome the difficulties with the normalization of epidemic prevention and control.","Meng, Guo, Zhou, Li, Wang, Ying","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00731-z","20210826","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17403,""
"Impact of social restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical activity levels of adults aged 50-92 years: a baseline survey of the CHARIOT COVID-19 Rapid Response prospective cohort study","Physical inactivity is more common in older adults, is associated with social isolation and loneliness and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. We examined the effect of social restrictions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in the UK (lockdown), on physical activity (PA) levels of older adults and the social predictors of any change. Baseline analysis of a survey-based prospective cohort study. Adults enrolled in the Cognitive Health in Ageing Register for Investigational and Observational Trials cohort from general practitioner practices in North West London were invited to participate from April to July 2020. 6219 cognitively healthy adults aged 50-92 years completed the survey. Self-reported PA before and after the introduction of lockdown, as measured by metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes. Associations of PA with demographic, lifestyle and social factors, mood and frailty. Mean PA was significantly lower following the introduction of lockdown from 3519 to 3185 MET min/week (p&lt;0.001). After adjustment for confounders and prelockdown PA, lower levels of PA after the introduction of lockdown were found in those who were over 85 years old (640 (95% CI 246 to 1034) MET min/week less); were divorced or single (240 (95% CI 120 to 360) MET min/week less); living alone (277 (95% CI 152 to 402) MET min/week less); reported feeling lonely often (306 (95% CI 60 to 552) MET min/week less); and showed symptoms of depression (1007 (95% CI 612 to 1401) MET min/week less) compared with those aged 50-64 years, married, cohabiting and not reporting loneliness or depression, respectively. Markers of social isolation, loneliness and depression were associated with lower PA following the introduction of lockdown in the UK.

"Serious health threats of novel adulterants of the street heroin: a report from India during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and a consequent nationwide lockdown in India for several weeks had restricted the access to street heroin and treatment for substance abuse. Use of cutting agents to increase the volume or psychoactive effect has been widely practised under such circumstances. Our patient with opioid use disorder chased heroin with an unknown cutting agent to enhance psychoactive effect from the limited quantities of heroin. He suffered from an abrupt onset sedation, weakness, postural imbalance, slurred speech, cognitive dysfunctions and disinhibited behaviour. Symptoms rapidly reversed following abstinence and initiation of buprenorphine-naloxone. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis of the adulterant revealed high concentrations of benzodiazepines and barbiturates, alongside the usual cutting agents-caffeine and acetaminophen. Abrupt reduction in availability of 'street drugs' in conjunction with poor healthcare access can lead to the use of novel adulterants with potentially serious clinical and public health implications.","Mahintamani, Ghosh, Jain","https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2021-242239","20210826","drugs misuse (including addiction); sedation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17405,""
"Assessment of antenatal anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder in pregnant women in the COVID-19 era","To assess the mental health of pregnant women, with reference to anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Ireland during the third wave of the pandemic between February and March 2021. Psychiatric, social and obstetric information was collected from pregnant women in a Dublin maternity hospital, alongside self-reported measures of mental health status. Of 392 women responding, 23.7% had anxiety, scoring &gt;9 for GAD-7 (7-item generalised anxiety disorder), 20.4% had depression, scoring &gt;9 for PHQ-9 (9-item depression screening tool: Patient health questionnaire) and 10.3% had obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), scoring &gt;13 for Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale symptom checklist (Y-BOCS). Amongst self-reported OCD symptoms, there was a preponderance for obsessions rather than compulsions. Of 392 women, 36.2% described their mental health as worse during the pandemic, most frequently describing symptoms of anxiety and sleep disturbance. When analysed against test scores, self-reported worsening of mental health was significantly associated with higher scores on the GAD-7, PHQ-9 and Y-BOCS scales. The three scores were positively interrelated. Poor mental health scores were associated with self-reported strain in relationship with the baby's father, and current or previous history of mental illness. This study found high levels of depression, anxiety and OC symptoms amongst pregnant women during COVID-19. This highlights the vulnerability of this group to mental illness and the importance of enhanced screening and support during pandemics.","Hinds, Lindow, Abdelrahman, Hehir, O'Connell","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2021.57","20210826","Anxiety; COVID-19; depression; mental health; obsessive-compulsive disorder; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17406,""
"Analysis of tweets on toothache during the COVID-19 pandemic using the CrystalFeel algorithm: a cross-sectional study","Reasons such as the lack of information on the COVID-19 disease, lack of proven treatment for it, uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic, or social isolation affect people's mental health. This study aimed to analyze the emotional type and intensity in tweets on toothache posted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the Twitter Search API, we collected tweets in English associated with the keywords ""Corona, Toothache"" ""Corona, Tooth, Pain"" ""Corona, Dental Pain"" ""Covid-19, Toothache"" ""Covid-19, Tooth, Pain"" and ""Covid-19, Dental Pain"" posted between March 11, 2020 and June 30, 2020 all around the world. After the relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, 426 posts were selected and analyzed using the CrystalFeel algorithm, a sensitivity analytical technology with proven accuracy. The chi-square test (SPSS v23, IBM) was used to compare emotions and emotional intensities according to the words used. It was determined that 80.3% of the participants experienced fear and 61.7% had a negative emotional intensity. There was no statistically significant difference between the distributions of emotions according to the words without time distinction (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.136). There was a statistically significant difference between the distributions of emotional intensity according to the words without time distinction (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006). The keyword ""Corona, Toothache"" was used the most frequently by 30.8% of the participants. This study is the first to analyze the emotional reactions of individuals who experienced toothaches during the COVID-19 pandemic using the CrystalFeel algorithm. Monitoring the social media posts of individuals experiencing toothache during the pandemic will help reduce fear and anger emotions and design public information messages that are compatible with the target group's needs.","Altan, CoÃ…Å¸gun","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-021-01778-8","20210826","COVID-19; Emotions; Pandemic; Social media; Toothache","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17407,""
"Psychological distress among Ethiopian migrant returnees who were in quarantine in the context of COVID-19: institution-based cross-sectional study","In association with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many numbers of Ethiopian migrants are returning to their home country, and they are required to stay in mandatory quarantine centers. This results in severe disruptions of life routines, social isolation, and loss of freedom. Studies on psychological distress among Ethiopian migrant returnees in the context of COVID-19 are scarce. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of psychological distress and associated factors among migrant returnees who were in quarantine during the time of COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 405 migrant returnees recruited from quarantine centers in Addis Ababa. We developed a structured questionnaire to collect data on sociodemographic, migration related, quarantine related and COVID-19 related characteristics of participants. We used the 21 item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale to assess psychological distress. Univariate and multivariable negative binomial regression models were fitted to assess the association between exposure variables with depression, anxiety and stress separately. A little more than half of the participants (55%) had depressive symptoms; around half had anxiety symptoms (48.9%) and more than a third (35.6%) experienced symptoms of stress. We found significantly higher prevalence of anxiety (ARRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.59; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.39, 0.91) and depressive symptoms (ARRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.56; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.39, 0.81) among women than men. Fear of discrimination after the quarantine was significantly associated with depressive (ARRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.76; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.63, 0.92) and anxiety symptoms (ARRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.77; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.62, 0.97). Experiencing COVID-19 like symptoms is associated with depressive (ARRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.40; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.25, 0.65), anxiety (ARRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.35; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.20, 0.62) and stress symptoms (ARRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.43; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.28, 0.66). Have no a plan of what to do after the quarantine (ARRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.30; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.09, 1.54) was significantly associated with increasing stress scores. We found a very high prevalence of depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms among Ethiopian migrant returnees who were in quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Screening, integration of mental health services with other socioeconomic and psychosocial services, and effective and efficient referral may be useful to address the burden of psychological distress in this group.","Habtamu, Desie, Asnake, Lera, Mequanint","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03429-2","20210826","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Ethiopia; Migrant returnees; Psychological distress; Quarantine; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17408,""
"Is there an association of lifestyle habits, anxiety, and depression between incontinent and continent women during COVID-19 pandemic?","Urinary incontinence (UI) is directly correlated with the risk of death and negatively affects the quality of life of women. During the COVID-19 pandemic, women had to adapt their lifestyles to get accustomed to the restrictive measures. The present study aimed to investigate the association between lifestyle habits, anxiety, and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic between incontinent and continent women. Seventy-seven Brazilian participants aged &gt;18Ã‚Â years were assessed through semi-structured telephonic interviews from July to August 2020. The interview included a questionnaire to investigate lifestyle habit changes and two questions from the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) to identify the presence of UI and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Women were allocated into two groups according to their answers to the KHQ: incontinent and continent. The chi-square test was applied, the significance level was set at 5%. Significant differences were found between groups regarding the habit to study and the time spent talking to relatives/friends (<i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .05). Neither anxiety nor depression symptoms showed a significant association between the groups. It seems that women with UI changed specific lifestyle habits during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to continent women, while anxiety and depression symptoms did not differ between the groups.","da Silva, Padilha, Rocha Rodrigues, Reis, Driusso","https://doi.org/10.1080/03630242.2021.1970081","20210826","COVID-19; WomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Health; pandemic; urinary incontinence; urogynecology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17409,""
"Qualitative Findings on the Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on Australian Gay and Bisexual Men: Community Belonging and Mental Well-being","COVID-19 may threaten the already poor mental health outcomes of Australian gay and bisexual men and cut ties to important social/sexual networks and community. Qualitative research into the experiences of gay and bisexual men during COVID-19 regulations is currently sparse. We report on 489 responses to a qualitative free-text question asking Australian gay and bisexual men about the impacts of COVID-19 during April 2020. Issues pertinent to gay and bisexual men include lost ties to gay and bisexual social/sexual communities, spaces, and activities, which can reduce a sense of belonging to important sexual identity spaces, as well as significant mental well-being vulnerabilities. Reminiscing the collective response to HIV/AIDS, findings reinforce the value of gay and bisexual community organizations, spaces, and networks as supports for gay and bisexual men and emphasize the need for delivering mental health services.","Philpot, Holt, Murphy, Haire, Prestage, Maher, Bavinton, Hammoud, Jin, Bourne","https://doi.org/10.1177/10497323211039204","20210826","Australia; COVID-19; community; free-text; gay and bisexual men; mental health; qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17410,""

"Editorial: Transition to Telehealth for Mental Health Clinics: Future Considerations","The acute mental health demands during the COVID-19 pandemic galvanized early adoption of telehealth for care delivery in all medical settings. This is even more so for the field of psychiatry.<sup>1</sup> Whether an established telehealth program existed or not, the abrupt lifting of regulations and urgent need for access to care opened the telehealth flood gates. While video visits and telephone visits improved immediate access to care, they simultaneously challenged our ability to structure, organize, educate, operationalize, and track such visits.<sup>1</sup> This swift shift in health care delivery forced providers, health care systems, and patients into a nationwide experiment to learn what works well via telehealth and what does not. The ground-breaking article by Folk etÃ‚Â al.<sup>2</sup> focuses on challenges and successes for a new shared phenomenon: the sudden pivot from in-person to video/telephone care. We examine the data collected by this consortium and compare it with our own experience at UPMC Western Psychiatric behavioral health outpatient settings, both academic and rural.","Perez, Szigethy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2021.07.008","20210826","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-27","",17412,""
