"Maternal distress/coping and childrenâ€™s adaptive behaviors during the covid-19 lockdown: Mediation through childrenâ€™s emotional experience","The present study focused on the psychological impact that the lockdown due to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) had on families in Italy  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian government imposed a strict lockdown for all citizens  People were forced to stay at home, and the length of the lockdown was uncertain  Previous studies analyzed the impact of social distance measures on individualsâ€™ mental health, whereas few studies have examined the interplay between the adultsâ€™ functioning, as parents, during this period and the association with the childâ€™s adjustment  The present study tested if maternal distress/coping predicts childrenâ€™s behaviors during the COVID-19 lockdown, hypothesizing a mediation effect via childrenâ€™s emotional experience  Participants were 144 mothers (Mage = 39 3, 25â€“52, SD = 5 6) with children aged 5â€“10 years (Mage = 7 54, SD = 1 6, 82 boys);mothers answered to an online survey  Results indicated that mothers with higher exposure to COVID-19 showed higher levels of distress and higher display of coping attitudes, even if in the structural equation modeling model, the COVID-19 exposure was not a predictor of mothersâ€™ distress  Compared with mothers with good coping skills, mothers with higher stress levels were more likely to attribute negative emotions to their children at the expense of their positive emotions  Moreover, childrenâ€™s emotions acted as mediators between maternal distress/coping and childrenâ€™s adaptive/maladaptive behaviors  In conclusion, it is important to support parents during pandemic emergence, by providing them with adequate information to manage the relationship with their children, to reduce their level of distress and to enhance their coping abilities  Â© 2020 Petrocchi, Levante, Bianco, Castelli and Lecciso","Petrocchi, S.; Levante, A.; Bianco, F.; Castelli, I.; Lecciso, F.","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.587833","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Frontiers in Public Health;8, 2020.; Publication details: Frontiers in Public Health;8, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",7984,""

"The impact of travel and timing in eliminating COVID-19","While the spread of communicable diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is often analyzed assuming a well-mixed population, more realistic models distinguish between transmission within and between geographic regions  A disease can be eliminated if the region-to-region reproductive number-i e , the average number of other regions to which a single infected region will transmit the disease-is reduced to less than one  Here we show that this region-to-region reproductive number is proportional to the travel rate between regions and exponential in the length of the time-delay before region-level control measures are imposed  If, on average, infected regions (including those that become re-infected in the future) impose social distancing measures shortly after experiencing community transmission, the number of infected regions, and thus the number of regions in which such measures are required, will exponentially decrease over time  Elimination will in this case be a stable fixed point even after the social distancing measures have been lifted from most of the regions  Large-scale containment measures that reduce the spread of COVID-19 have proven to have too large an impact on both the economy and our mental health to be sustainable in the long term  Here, the authors show that travel reductions between geographical regions and timely local control measures can reduce the region-to-region reproduction number below one, thus eliminating the epidemic and preventing recurrent waves without the need for long-term lockdown measures","Siegenfeld, A.

"Urgent behavioral health phone calls from skilled nursing and long-term care facilities during COVID-19 lockdown","Abstract Background Beginning the third week in March 2020 Skilled Nursing and Long-Term Care Facilities (SNF-LTC) in Indiana instituted protocols aimed at preventing the transmission of COVID-19  These included exclusion of all visitors, room isolation and other measures  These measures were anticipated to have a deleterious effect on the mental health of SNF-LTC residents  An Indiana neuro-behavioral health practice (Vanguard Eldercare Medical Group), providing on-site care at greater than 200 SNF-LTC?s, measured the change in incoming urgent/emergent patient care phone requests during April as a potential proxy for a negative change in SNF-LTC resident neuro-psychiatric status  Method Urgent/emergent incoming behavioral health phone requests were compiled from January 1, 2020 until May 17, 2020 on a weekly basis  Incoming calls during regular business hours (BH) (M-F 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM) and after-hours (AH) were measured from the medical group?s telephone monitoring system and EMR  These were analyzed using one-tailed t-tests to determine if the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (declared 3/11/2020) increased the number of incoming calls after accounting for the number of patients  Result In Figure 1, the number of BH calls appears to increase in the end of March, while AH calls appear to decline  Table 1 shows the mean number of BH calls per week prior to 3/9/2020 increases from 41 44 to 69 03 (p=0 0014)  After hours calls decreased from 17 33 to 9 8 (p=0 00056) and the number of patients served increased from 7618 33 to 7767 90 (p=0 0073)  To adjust for the increasing patient population, we calculated the mean number of calls per week per 1000 residents  BH calls per 1000 patients increased from 5 44 to 8 67 (p=0 0018) and AH calls per 1000 patients decreased from 2 28 to 1 26 (p=0 00052)  Conclusion It was anticipated that increased stressors would negatively impact these residents? mental health  The significant increase in behavioral health phone requests suggests confirmation of this hypothesis  The disparity between business hours and after-hours phone calls may be due to heightened SNF-LTC staff awareness and/or change in the nature/severity of behavioral health decompensation","Posar, Steven Laurence, Reid, Anita, Heiser, Daniel","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.047671","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia;16(S7):e047671, 2020.; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia;16(S7):e047671, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8005,""

"Technology Enabled Clinical Care (TECC): Protocol for Prospective-Longitudinal-Cohort Study of Smartphone Augmented Mental Health Treatment","Even before COVID-19, there has been an urgent need to expand access to and quality of mental healthcare. This paper introduces an eight-week treatment protocol to realize that vision- Technology Enabled Clinical Care (TECC). TECC offers innovation in clinical assessment, monitoring, and interventions for mental health. TECC uses the mindLAMP app to enable digital phenotyping, clinical communication, and smartphone-based exercises that will augment in-person or telehealth-virtual visits. TECC exposes participants to an array of evidence-based treatments (CBT, DBT, ACT) introduced through clinical sessions and then practiced through interactive activities provided through a smartphone app called mindLAMP. TECC will test the feasibility of providing technology enabled mental health care within an outpatient clinic; explore the practicality for providing this care to individuals with Limited English Proficiency; track anxiety, depression and mood symptoms for participants in order to measure the effectiveness of the TECC design. The TECC study will assess the acceptability and efficacy of this model of care in 50 participants as compared to an age and gender matched cohort of patients presenting with similar clinical severity of depression, anxiety, or psychotic symptoms. Participants will be recruited from clinics in the metro Boston area. Aspects of TECC will be conducted in both Spanish and English, in order to ensure wide access to care for multiple populations. The results of the TECC study will be used to support or adapt this model of care and create training resources to ensure its dissemination. The study results will be posted on ClincialTrails.gov with primary outcomes related to changes in mood, anxiety, and stress and secondary related to engagement, alliance, and satisfaction. TECC combines new digital mental health technology with updated clinical protocols and workflows designed to ensure patients can benefit from innovation in digital mental health. Supporting multiple language, TECC is designed to ensure digital health equity and highlight how mobile health can bridge, not expand, gaps in care for underserved populations.  <AbstractText Label=""INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">PRR1-10.2196/23771.","Rauseo-Ricupero, Torous","https://doi.org/10.2196/23771","20201209","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8025,""

Thai students had the highest levels of anxiety and suicidal thoughts but the lowest levels of confidence in pandemic control and available resources of fighting COVID-19 among the four student groups. Factors associated with higher anxiety and suicidal thoughts differed across countries. Less perceived satisfactory support was associated with more suicidal thoughts among Indonesian and Thai students. Taiwanese students were more negatively affected by information gathered from the internet and from medical staff. Healthcare providers in Thailand may need to pay special attention to Thai university students given their high levels of anxiety and suicidal thoughts. In addition, healthcare providers should establish a good supporting system for university students as the results of this study indicate a negative association between support and suicidal thoughts.","Pramukti, Strong, Sitthimongkol, Setiawan, Pandin, Yen, Lin, Griffiths, Ko","https://doi.org/10.2196/24487","20201209","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8026,""
"Psychological distress in the face of a pandemic: An observational study characterizing the impact of COVID-19 on immigrant outpatient mental health","Undocumented immigrants have disproportionately suffered during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to factors including limited medical access and financial insecurity, which can exacerbate pandemic-associated distress. Psychological outcomes for immigrant outpatients were assessed after transition to telepsychiatry in March 2020. Mental health was assessed with Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) inventories, a novel coronavirus-specific survey, and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10+). Feedback on telepsychiatry sessions and access to non-clinical resources were also gathered, after which multivariable linear regression modeling identified psychosocial factors underlying changes in distress levels. 48.57% and 45.71% of participants reported worsened anxiety and depression levels due to the pandemic, respectively. From March to April, PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores significantly increased by 0.81 and 0.63 points, respectively. The average total psychological distress score was 23.8, with 60% of scores reflecting serious mental illness. Factors that most influenced K10+ scores included a pre-existing depressive disorder, food insecurity, and comfort during telepsychiatry visits. 93.75% of participants believed access to remote psychiatry helped their mental health during COVID-19. The negative impact of COVID-19 on mental health in vulnerable populations stems from medical and psychosocial factors such as pre-existing psychiatric conditions and unmet essential needs.","Serafini, Powell, Frere, Saali, Krystal, Kumar, Yashaswini, Hernandez, Moody, Aronson, Meah, Katz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113595","20201209","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Distress; Mental health; Telepsychiatry; Vulnerable populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8027,""
"Predictors of misconceptions, knowledge, attitudes, and practices of COVID-19 pandemic among a sample of Saudi population","This study intends to explore the predictors of misconceptions, knowledge, attitudes, and practices concerning the COVID-19 pandemic among a sample of the Saudi population and we also assessed their approaches toward its overall impact. This online cross-sectional survey was conducted at the Faculty of Medicine, Rabigh, King Abdulaziz University (KAU) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (SA). Participants were approached via social media (SM), and 2006 participants (953 [47.5%] females and 1053 [52.5%] males) were included in this study. SM was the leading source of information for 43.9% of the study participants. Most of the participants had various misconceptions such as &quot;females are more vulnerable to develop this infection, rinsing the nose with saline and sipping water every 15 minutes protects against Coronavirus, flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against this virus.&quot; About one-third of participants (31.7%) had self-reported disturbed social, mental, and psychological wellbeing due to the pandemic. Many participants became more religious during this pandemic. Two-thirds of the study participants (68.1%) had good knowledge scores. Attitudes were highly positive in 93.1%, and practice scores were adequate in 97.7% of the participants. Participants' educational status was a predictor of high knowledge scores. Male gender and divorced status were predictors of low practice scores, and aged 51-61 years, private-sector jobs, and student status were predictors of high practice scores. Being Saudi was a predictor of a positive attitude, while the male gender and divorced status were predictors of a negative attitude. Higher education was a predictor of good concepts, while the older age and businessmen were predictors of misconceptions. Overall, our study participants had good knowledge, positive attitudes, and good practices, but several myths were also prevalent. Being a PhD and a Saudi national predicted high knowledge scores and positive attitudes, respectively. A higher education level was a predictor of good concepts, and students, private-sector jobs, and aged 51-61 years were predictors of high practice scores. Study participants had good understanding of the effects of this pandemic.","Baig, Jameel, Alzahrani, Mirza, Gazzaz, Ahmad, Baig, Almurashi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243526","20201209","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8028,""
"Mental Health Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Effectiveness of a Daily Supportive Text Message (Text4Hope) Program at Six Weeks in Reducing Stress, Anxiety, and Depression in Subscribers","In addition to the obvious medical (physical) impact of COVID-19, threats to mental health, psychological safety, and well-being are evident. Provision of support for these challenges is complicated by the high number of people requiring support and the need to maintain physical distancing. This motivated us to launch Text4Hope, a daily supportive texting messaging program, in Canada to mitigate the negative mental health impacts of the pandemic amongst Canadians. This paper describes the changes in stress, anxiety, and depression levels after six weeks of exposure to daily supportive text messages. We used self-administered, online, empirically-supported questionnaires to assess demographic and clinical characteristics of subscribers. Perceived stress, anxiety, and depression were measured with the Perceived Stress Scale-10 Items (PSS-10), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale at baseline and sixth week time points. Moderate or high perceived stress, likely GAD and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were assessed using cut-off scores of PSS-10 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 14, GAD-7 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10, and PHQ-9 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10, respectively. After six-weeks into the program, 766 participants completed the questionnaires at both time points. At the sixth week time-point, there were statistically significant reductions in mean scores on the PSS-10 and GAD-7 scales, but not the PHQ-9 scale. Effect sizes were small overall. There were statistically significant reductions in the prevalence rates for moderate or high stress, likely GAD, and likely MDD for the group that completed both the baseline and sixth week assessments. The biggest reduction in mean scores and prevalence rates was for anxiety; 18.7% and 13.5% respectively. Text4Hope is a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible means for implementing a population-level psychological intervention. This service demonstrated significant reduction in anxiety and stress during the COVD-19 pandemic and could be used as a population-level mental health intervention during natural disasters and other emergencies. Limitations are discussed. The study protocol is approved by the Research and Ethics Board of the University of Alberta (Pro00086163).

"Is COVID-19 Associated With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder?","To assess the prevalence of and risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with COVID-19. We conducted a cohort study between March and May 2020 at the Lille University Hospital (France), including all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Psychological distress symptoms were measured 3 weeks after onset of COVID-19 symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-6 items (IES-6). The evaluation of PTSD symptoms using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) took place 1 month later. Bivariate analyses were performed to analyze the relationship between PCL-5 scores and the demographic and health variables. The significant variables were then introduced into a multivariable linear regression analysis to establish their relative contributions to the severity of PTSD symptoms. 180 patients were included in this study, and 138 patients completed the 2 evaluations. Among the 180 patients, 70.4% patients required hospitalization, and 30.7% were admitted to the intensive care unit. The prevalence of PTSD was 6.5%, and the predictive factors of PTSD included psychological distress at the onset of the illness and a stay in an intensive care unit. The prevalence of PTSD in patients with COVID-19 is not as high as that reported among patients during previous epidemics. Initial psychological responses were predictive of a PTSD diagnosis, even though most patients showing acute psychological distress (33.5% of the sample) improved in the following weeks. PTSD symptoms also increased following a stay in an intensive care unit. Future studies should assess the long-term consequences of COVID-19 on patients' mental health.","Horn, Wathelet, Fovet, Amad, Vuotto, Faure, Astier, NoÃƒÂ«l, Duhem, Vaiva, D'Hondt","https://doi.org/10.4088/JCP.20m13641","20201209","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8030,""
"COVID-19 information exposure in digital media and implications for employees in the health care sector: findings from an online survey","To estimate coronavirus disease 2019-related information consumption and related implications for health care professionals (medical and nonmedical personnel) during the pandemic. A cross-sectional on-line survey was distributed to employees of a major health care institution located in SÃƒÂ£o Paulo, Brazil between April 3 and April 10, 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The sample comprised 2,646 respondents. Most participants (44.4%) reported excessive or almost excessive access to information about the novel coronavirus and 67.6% reported having increased their average time spent on social media. When asked how frequently they consider it was easy to determine the reliability of information, &quot;sometimes&quot; corresponded to 43.2% of the answers in contrast to 14.6% responding &quot;always&quot;. Answers related to potential signs of information overload associated with the pandemic indicated that 31% of respondents felt stressed by the amount of information they had to keep up with almost every day or always. Overall, 80.0% of respondents reported having experienced at least one of the following symptoms: headache, eye twitching, restlessness or sleeping difficulty. The frequency of symptoms was higher among participants with a more negative information processing style regarding when dealing with large volumes of information relative to those with a positive information processing style. Likewise, symptoms were more frequently reported by participants who had increased their social media access relative to those reporting reduced access during the pandemic. Our survey provides a description of how health professionals consume COVID-19 related information during the pandemic, and suggests that excessive information exposure and high processing demands may impose psychological distress and affect mental health.","BazÃƒÂ¡n, Azevedo Neto, Dias, Salvatierra, Sanches, Lacerda, Amaro Junior, Kozasa, Balardin","https://doi.org/10.31744/einstein_journal/2020AO6127","20201209","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8031,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Self-Reported Health","The pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the countermeasures taken to protect the public are having a substantial effect on the health of the population. In Germany, nationwide protective measures to halt the spread of the virus were implemented in mid-March for 6 weeks. In May, the impact of the pandemic was assessed in the German National Cohort (NAKO). A total of 113 928 men and women aged 20 to 74 years at the time of the baseline examination conducted 1 to 5 years earlier (53%) answered, within a 30-day period, a follow-up questionnaire on SARS-CoV-2 test status, COVID-19- associated symptoms, and self-perceived health status. The self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test frequency among the probands was 4.6%, and 344 participants (0.3%) reported a positive test result. Depressive and anxiety-related symptoms increased relative to baseline only in participants under 60 years of age, particularly in young women. The rate of moderate to severe depressive symptoms increased from 6.4% to 8.8%. Perceived stress increased in all age groups and both sexes, especially in the young. The scores for mental state and self-rated health worsened in participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 compared with those who were not tested. In 32% of the participants, however, self-rated health improved. The COVID-19 pandemic and the protective measures during the first wave had effects on mental health and on self-rated general health.","Peters, Rospleszcz, Greiser, Dallavalle, Berger","https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.2020.0861","20201209","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8032,""
"Ethno-cultural disparities in mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study on the impact of exposure to the virus and COVID-19-related discrimination and stigma on mental health across ethno-cultural groups in Quebec (Canada)","Although social and structural inequalities associated with COVID-19 have been documented since the start of the pandemic, few studies have explored the association between pandemic-specific risk factors and the mental health of minority populations. We investigated the association of exposure to the virus, COVID-19-related discrimination and stigma with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, in a culturally diverse sample of adults in Quebec (Canada). A total of 3273 residents of the province of Quebec (49% aged 18-39 years, 57% women, 51% belonging to a minority ethno-cultural group) completed an online survey. We used linear and ordinal logistic regression to identify the relationship between COVID-19 experiences and mental health, and the moderating role of ethno-cultural identity. Mental health varied significantly based on socioeconomic status and ethno-cultural group, with those with lower incomes and Arab participants reporting higher psychological distress. Exposure to the virus, COVID-19-related discrimination, and stigma were associated with poorer mental health. Associations with mental health varied across ethno-cultural groups, with exposed and discriminated Black participants reporting higher mental distress. Findings indicate sociocultural inequalities in mental health related to COVID-19 in the Canadian context. COVID-19-related risk factors, including exposure, discrimination and stigma, jeopardise mental health. This burden is most noteworthy for the Black community. There is an urgent need for public health authorities and health professionals to advocate against the discrimination of racialised minorities, and ensure that mental health services are accessible and culturally sensitive during and in the aftermath of the pandemic.","Miconi, Li, Frounfelker, Santavicca, CÃƒÂ©nat, Venkatesh, Rousseau","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.146","20201209","Pandemic; discrimination and stigma; exposure to virus; mental health; sociocultural factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8033,""

"The Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Psychometric Properties of the Ethiopian Amharic Version","Fear is an adaptive response that alerts individuals to the presence of a danger or threat. However, in the context of the current novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the fear experienced could be intense because the number of victims of the virus is continuously increasing globally and is inducing severe mental health concerns. The seven-item Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) assesses the severity of fear related to COVID-19 and has already been validated in many languages. The present study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Amharic (Ethiopian) version of the FCV-19S. An online survey including the Amharic versions of the FCV-19S and the six-item UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS-6) was administered to 307 Amharic-speaking participants using convenience sampling. The participants' age ranged between 18 and 70Ã‚Â years. In the evaluation process, confirmatory factor analysis, Item Response Theory, concurrent validity, and reliabilities (Cronbach's alpha, McDonald's omega, Guttman's lambda, and composite reliability) of the Amharic version of the FCV-19S were performed. The uni-dimensional structure of the FCV-19S was confirmed and the Amharic version of the FCV-19S had strong psychometric properties. All reliability coefficients of the Amharic FCV-19S were satisfactory, with sound concurrent validity shown by significant and positive correlations with loneliness.

"Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of respiratory rehabilitation following intensive care unit discharge for COVID-19 survivors","Both physical and mental disorders may be exacerbated in patients with COVID-19 due to the experience of receiving intensive care; undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation, sedation, proning and paralysis. Pulmonary rehabilitation is aimed to improve dyspnoea, relieve anxiety and depression, reduce the incidence of related complications, as well as prevent and improve dysfunction. However, the impact of respiratory rehabilitation on discharged patients with COVID-19 is currently unclear, especially on patients who have been mechanically ventilated over 24 hours. Therefore, we aim to investigate the efficacy of respiratory rehabilitation programmes, initiated after discharge from the intensive care unit, on the physical and mental health and health-related quality of life in critical patients with COVID-19.

We will search the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, VIP information databases and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database. Additionally, ongoing trials in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov and ISRCTN registry will be searched as well. Studies in English or Chinese and from any country will be accepted regardless of study design. Two review authors will independently extract data and assess the quality of included studies. Continuous data are described as standard mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs. Dichotomous data from randomised controlled trials are described as risk ratio(RR) with 95% CIs; otherwise, it is described as odds ratio(OR) with 95% CIs.

"How primary healthcare in Iceland swiftly changed its strategy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic","To describe how the primary healthcare (PHC) in Iceland changed its strategy to handle the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive observational study. Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland. The Reykjavik area has a total of 233 000 inhabitants. The number and the mode of consultations carried out. Drug prescriptions and changes in the 10 most common diagnoses made in PHC. Laboratory tests including COVID-19 tests. Average numbers in March and April 2020 compared with the same months in 2018 and 2019. Pragmatic strategies and new tasks were rapidly applied to the clinical work to meet the foreseen healthcare needs caused by the pandemic. The number of daytime consultations increased by 35% or from 780 to 1051/1000 inhabitants (p&lt;0.001) during the study period. Telephone and web-based consultations increased by 127% (p&lt;0.001). The same tendency was observed in out-of-hours services. The number of consultations in maternity and well-child care decreased only by 4% (p=0.003). Changes were seen in the 10 most common diagnoses. Most noteworthy, apart from a high number of COVID-19 suspected disease, was that immunisation, depression, hypothyroidism and lumbago were not among the top 10 diagnoses during the epidemic period. The number of drug prescriptions increased by 10.3% (from 494 to 545 per 1000 inhabitants, p&lt;0.001). The number of prescriptions from telephone and web-based consultations rose by 55.6%. No changes were observed in antibiotics prescriptions. As the first point of contact in the COVID-19 pandemic, the PHC in Iceland managed to change its strategy swiftly while preserving traditional maternity and well-child care, indicating a very solid PHC with substantial flexibility in its organisation.","Sigurdsson, Blondal, Jonsson, Tomasdottir, Hrafnkelsson, Linnet, Sigurdsson","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043151","20201209","COVID-19; epidemiology; infectious diseases; organisation of health services; primary care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8044,""
"Impacts and interactions of COVID-19 response involvement, health-related behaviours, health literacy on anxiety, depression and health-related quality of life among healthcare workers: a cross-sectional study","We examined impacts and interactions of COVID-19 response involvement, health-related behaviours and health literacy (HL) on anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among healthcare workers (HCWs). A cross-sectional study was conducted. Data were collected 6 April to 19 April 2020 using online-based, self-administered questionnaires. 19 hospitals and health centres in Vietnam. 7 124 HCWs aged 21-60 years. The COVID-19 response-involved HCWs had higher anxiety likelihood (OR (95% CI)=4.41 (3.53 to 5.51)), higher depression likelihood (OR(95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI)=3.31 (2.71 to 4.05)) and lower HRQoL score (coefficient, b(95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI)=-2.14 (-2.89 to -1.38)), compared with uninvolved HCWs. Overall, HCWs who smoked or drank at unchanged/increased levels had higher likelihood of anxiety, depression and lower HRQoL scores; those with unchanged/healthier eating, unchanged/more physical activity and higher HL scores had lower likelihood of anxiety, depression and higher HRQoL scores. In comparison to uninvolved HCWs who smoked or drank at never/stopped/reduced levels, involved HCWs with unchanged/increased smoking or drinking had lower anxiety likelihood (OR(95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI)=0.34 (0.14 to 0.83)) or (OR(95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI)=0.26 (0.11 to 0.60)), and lower depression likelihood (OR(95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI)=0.33 (0.15 to 0.74)) or (OR(95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI)=0.24 (0.11 to 0.53)), respectively. In comparison with uninvolved HCWs who exercised at never/stopped/reduced levels, or with those in the lowest HL quartile, involved HCWs with unchanged/increased exercise or with one-quartile HL increment reported lower anxiety likelihood (OR(95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI)=0.50 (0.31 to 0.81)) or (OR(95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI)=0.57 (0.45 to 0.71)), lower depression likelihood (OR(95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI)=0.40 (0.27 to 0.61)) or (OR(95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI)=0.63 (0.52 to 0.76)), and higher HRQoL scores (b(95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI)=2.08 (0.58 to 3.58)), or (b(95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI)=1.10 (0.42 to 1.78)), respectively. Physical activity and higher HL were found to protect against anxiety and depression and were associated with higher HRQoL. Unexpectedly, smoking and drinking were also found to be coping behaviours. It is important to have strategic approaches that protect HCWs' mental health and HRQoL.","Tran, Nguyen, Pham, Nguyen, Nguyen, Ha, Phan, Dao, Nguyen, Trinh, Do, Nguyen, Nguyen, Nguyen, Tran, Tran, Duong, Pham, Nguyen, Vo, Do, Duong, Pham, Pham, Nguyen, Yang, Chao, Duong","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041394","20201209","anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; epidemiology; infection control; occupational &amp; industrial medicine; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8045,""

"Evaluation of Emotional (Depression) and Behavioral (Nutritional, Physical Activity, Sleep) Status of Turkish Adults during the Covid-19 Pandemic Period","Evaluate emotional (depression) and behavioral (nutritional behaviors, physical activity status, and sleep patterns) of Turkish adult individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Cross-sectional online survey. The participants filled out a questionnaire (developed by using Google Forms) that contained descriptive characteristics, nutritional behaviors, sleep patterns, physical activity status, anthropometric measurements, COVID-19-related level of knowledge, and the questions of the CES-Depression Scale through e-mail or social media (WhatsApp). Turkey. 120 adult individuals who completed an online survey between April and May 2020. It was determined that 29.1% of the individuals showed mild, 34.2% moderate, and 23.4% severe depression symptoms during the pandemic period. A significant relationship was found between gender, age and educational status, marital status, and depression levels of the individuals, respectively (Ãâ€¡2=35.292, Ãâ€¡2=103.46, Ãâ€¡2=24.524, Ãâ€¡2=86.208 p&lt;0.05). The top three foods consumed most during the pandemic period are tea and coffee (66.6%), pastry (e.g. cake, cookie) (56.4%), and desserts (49.6%). During the pandemic period, 42.5% of the individuals stated that they slept more and 40.2% stated that there was no change in their sleep patterns. Daily physical activity durations were determined as 8.25Ã‚Â±1.77 hours for sleep, 4.21Ã‚Â±2.68 hours for lying down, 5.42Ã‚Â±2.64 hours for sitting, and 6.16Ã‚Â±4.82 hours for standing activities.

"Autonomic balance determines the severity of COVID-19 courses","COVID-19 has left mankind desperately seeking how to manage dramatically rising infection rates associated with severe disease progressions. COVID-19 courses range from mild symptoms up to multiple organ failure and death, triggered by excessively high serum cytokine levels (IL 1ÃŽÂ², IL 6, TNF ÃŽÂ±, IL 8). The vagally driven cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) stops the action of nuclear factor ÃŽÂºB (NF-ÃŽÂºB), the transcriptional factor of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, well-balanced cytokine release depends on adequate vagal signaling. Coronaviruses replicate using NF-ÃŽÂºB transcriptional factor as well. By degrading the cytoplasmatic inhibitor of NF-ÃŽÂºB subunits (IÃŽÂºB), coronaviruses induce unrestricted NF-ÃŽÂºB expression accelerating both, virus replication and cytokine transcription.We hypothesize that CAP detriment due to depressed vagal tone critically determines the severity of COVID-19.","Leitzke, Stefanovic, Meyer, Schimpf, SchÃƒÂ¶nknecht","https://doi.org/10.1186/s42234-020-00058-0","20201209","COVID-19; Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway; Cytokine storm; Heart rate variability; NF-ÃŽÂºB pathway; Stimulation; Vagal nerve","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8048,""
"Transitioning to digital first line intervention - validation of a brief online screener for early identification of a suspected eating disorder: study protocol","Only one in four people with eating disorders seeks treatment, and of those who do seek treatment, 20% go on to experience a chronic course. Early intervention has been associated with better prognosis, with those seeking specialised intervention in the early stages of their illness more than twice as likely to achieve remission. Current screening measures typically require expert administration and are rarely validated across a spectrum of DSM-5 eating disorder presentations or for online use. In light of COVID-19 and increasing reliance on telehealth technologies in the intervention and delivery of mental health services, online assessments suitable for self-referral are likely to be the first step to seeking care. InsideOut Institute has developed a 6-item online screening tool for the purposes of identifying eating disorder risk and symptomatology, aimed specifically at increasing help-seeking behaviour in subsyndromal and early presentations. This study investigates the reliability and validity of the InsideOut Institute Screener (IOI-S), using a cross-sectional survey research design. Participants aged 14 and over will complete an extensive baseline survey battery for evaluation. 50% of participants will be randomly selected for one follow-up re-test of the IOI-S only, 2 weeks post initial testing. The IOI-S will be analysed for statistical reliability on two parameters: internal consistency and test re-test reliability, and for statistical validity on four parameters: concurrent validity, sensitivity and specificity, convergent and discriminant validity. The rapid and ongoing shift to digital intervention has highlighted gaps and opportunities in our pathways to care. Adequate screening for eating disorders is a major gap. This study aims to validate an online screening tool for use in telehealth early intervention, designed for users seeking information for a suspected eating disorder. The screener meets those at risk 'where they are' (i.e. online) and may improve timely referrals to relevant services. This is of particular salience as face-to-face healthcare and traditional frontline interventions are disrupted, and we are challenged to re-design our practices to deliver diagnostic and treatment services in highly adaptive digital contexts.","Bryant, Miskovic-Wheatley, Touyz, Crosby, Koreshe, Cao, Maguire","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-020-00339-8","20201209","COVID-19; Digital; Early intervention; Eating disorders; Psychometrics; Screening questionnaire; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8049,""

"COVID-19 worries and mental health: the moderating effect of age","Older age (60+ years) increases the risk of contracting and dying from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which might suggest worse mental health for those in this age range during the pandemic. Indeed, greater worry about COVID-19 is associated with poorer mental health. However, older age is generally associated with better emotional well-being, despite increased likelihood of negative events (e.g. death of a spouse) with age. This study examined whether age moderated the relation between COVID-19 worries and mental health. A national sample of U.S. adults (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°848; aged 18-85Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) completed an online survey from March 30 to April 5, 2020. The survey assessed anxiety, depression, general concern about COVID-19, perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19, social distancing, self-quarantining, current mood, health, and demographics. Older age was associated with better mental health (i.e. lower levels of anxiety and depression). Greater perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19 was related to higher anxiety. However, this effect was moderated by age. At younger ages (18-49Ã¢â‚¬â€°years), the positive association between perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19 and anxiety was significant, but the association was not significant at older ages (50+ years). Older age may buffer against the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. More research is necessary to understand the potential protective nature of age during the pandemic, as well as the recovery period.","Wilson, Lee, Shook","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2020.1856778","20201209","Anxiety; COVID-19; depression; well-being paradox","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8051,""
"The Bittersweet Effects of COVID-19 on Mental Health: Results of an Online Survey among a Sample of the Dutch Population Five Weeks after Relaxation of Lockdown Restrictions","Previous research shows that crises can have both negative and positive mental health effects on the population. The current study explored these effects in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic after relaxation of governmental measures. An online survey was administered among a representative sample of the Dutch population (<i>n</i> = 1519) in June 2020, ten weeks after the peak of COVID-19 had passed, and five weeks after restrictions were relaxed. Participants were asked about mental health, adverse events during COVID-19, and about any positive effects of the pandemic. Most participants (80%, <i>n</i> = 1207) reported no change in mental health since the COVID-19 pandemic. This was also the case among respondents who had experienced an adverse event. Protective factors of mental health were being male and high levels of positive mental well-being. Risk factors were emotional loneliness and the experience of adverse life events. Social loneliness was positively associated with stable mental health, stressing the importance of meaningful relationships. Note that 58% of participants reported positive effects of the pandemic, the most common of which were rest, working from home, and feeling more socially connected. In summary, 10 weeks after the start of the crisis, and 5 weeks after relaxation of the restrictions, most people remained stable during the crisis, and were even able to report positive effects.","Gijzen, Shields-Zeeman, Kleinjan, Kroon, van der Roest, Bolier, Smit, de Beurs","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17239073","20201209","COVID-19; lockdown; mental health; positive effects; stability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8052,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Women's Physical Activity Behavior and Mental Well-Being","A global pandemic caused by COVID-19 resulted in restrictions to daily living for Canadians, including social distancing and closure of recreation facilities and provincial parks. The objective of this study was to assess whether sex differences exist in physical activity and well-being since COVID-19 and to explore how barriers or facilitators to physical activity may explain these differences. Chi-square tests, independent t-tests and one-way ANOVAs were conducted to evaluate data provided by 1098 Canadians-215 men and 871 women. Women were significantly less physically active than men and reported more barriers and fewer facilitators to physical activity and experienced significantly more generalized anxiety than men. Women who were engaged in less physical activity due to COVID-19 reported significantly lower mental health scores, lower social, emotional and psychological well-being, and significantly higher generalized anxiety, while women who engaged in more physical activity had improved mental health scores. Given the challenges that women uniquely face due to restrictions, it is imperative to advocate and provide environmental opportunity and support for physical activity to reduce the mental duress women may be experiencing. Specific physical activity programming that is inclusive of lifestyle physical activity and can engage children is encouraged.","Nienhuis, Lesser","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17239036","20201209","2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19); anxiety; physical activity; well-being; womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8053,""

These measures-among which social distancing and contact restrictions were most prominent-may have an overall effect on people's psychological well-being. The present study seeks to examine whether lockdown measures affected people's well-being; anxiety; depressive symptoms during the lockdown and whether these effects could be explained by reduced satisfaction of the basic psychological needs of autonomy and relatedness. <i>N</i> = 1086 participants of different ages and educational levels from all over Germany reported strong declines in autonomy and well-being; small declines in relatedness satisfaction; moderate increases in anxiety and depressive symptoms. These effects were stronger for people with moderate to bad subjective overall health. Latent change modeling revealed that, especially, decreases in autonomy satisfaction led to stronger decreases in well-being as well as stronger increases in anxiety and depressive symptoms; whereas decreases in relatedness had much weaker effects. Our results imply differential effects depending on individual preconditions; but also more generally that peoples' need for autonomy was most strongly affected by the lockdown measures, which should be considered as important information in planning future lockdowns.","Schwinger, Trautner, KÃƒÂ¤rchner, Otterpohl","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17239083","20201209","Sars-CoV-2; anxiety; autonomy; basic psychological needs; depression; lockdown; mental health; pandemic; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8055,""

"Parental Social Isolation and Child Maltreatment Risk During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The social isolation and economic stress resulting from pandemic have the potential to exacerbate child abuse and neglect. Objective: This study examines the association of parentsâ€™ perceived social isolation and recent employment loss to risk for child maltreatment (neglect, verbal aggression, and physical punishment) in the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants and Setting: Participants (N = 283) were adults living in the U.S. who were parents of at least one child 0-12 years of age. Methods: Participants completed an online survey approximately 2 weeks after the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic. The survey asked about recent changes (i.e., in the past 2 weeks) to employment status, parenting behaviors, use of discipline, use of spanking, and depressive symptoms. Results: Parentsâ€™ perceived social isolation and recent employment loss were associated with self-report of physical and emotional neglect and verbal aggression against the child, even after statistically controlling for parental depressive symptoms, income, and sociodemographic factors. Parentsâ€™ perceived social isolation was associated with parental report of changes in discipline, specifically, using discipline and spanking more often in the past 2 weeks. Associations were robust to analyses that included two variables that assessed days spent social distancing and days spent in â€œlockdown.â€ Conclusions: Study results point to the need for mental health supports to parents and children to ameliorate the strain created by COVID-19.","Shawna J.

"Longitudinal Analysis of Short-term Changes in Relationship Conflict During COVID-19: A Risk and Resilience Perspective","This study uses a risk and resilience framework to examine short-term self-reported changes in relationship conflict early in the COVID-19 pandemic (March and April 2020). Longitudinal data from U.S. adults in a romantic relationship (N = 291) were collected via three waves of an online survey. Participants self-reported anxiety, depression, increased alcohol use, and dyadic coping since the pandemic. Relationship conflict variables included whether the participant reported that they and their partner â€œhad disagreements related to the Coronavirus,â€ â€œhad more disagreements than usual,â€ â€œhad more verbal fights than usual,â€ and â€œhad more physical fights than usualâ€ in the past 2 weeks. Analyses controlled for sociodemographic characteristics as well as days spent in lockdown and employment change due to COVID-19. Results indicated that couplesâ€™ disagreement and verbal fighting scores increased from Time 1 to Time 2, but disagreements related to COVID-19 and physical fighting did not. Couples with higher levels of dyadic coping reported fewer fights and disagreements on average. However, dyadic coping did not buffer participants from increases in relationship conflict. Increased alcohol use since the pandemic was positively associated with disagreements related to COVID-19, disagreement scores, and verbal fighting scores. More days spent in lockdown was associated with increases in disagreements related to COVID-19. The conditions created by COVID-19 may contribute to worsening relationship conflict, even among couples who start with high levels of dyadic coping.

"Perceived stress as mediator for longitudinal effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on wellbeing of parents and children","Dealing with COVID-19 lockdown may have negative effects on children, but at the same time might facilitate parent-child bonding. Perceived stress may influence the direction of these effects. Using a longitudinal twin design, we investigated how perceived stress influenced lockdown induced changes in wellbeing of parents and children. A total of 106 parents and 151 children (10-13-year-old) filled in questionnaires during lockdown and data were combined with data of previous years. We report a significant increase in parental negative feelings (anxiety, depression, hostility and interpersonal sensitivity). Longitudinal child measures showed a gradual decrease in internalizing and externalizing behavior, which seemed decelerated by the COVID-19 lockdown. Changes in parental negative feelings and childrenâ€™s externalizing behavior were mediated by perceived stress: higher scores prior to the lockdown were related to more stress during the lockdown, which in turn was associated with an increase in parental negative feelings and childrenâ€™sâ€™ externalizing behavior. Perceived stress in parents and children was associated with negative coping strategies. Additionally, childrenâ€™s stress levels were influenced by prior and current parental overreactivity. These results suggest that children in families with negative coping strategies and (a history of) parental overreactivity might be at risk for negative consequences of the lockdown.","Michelle Achterberg et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620C-79F-745","20200928","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Gene-environment Interaction; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; externalizing behavior; twin study; psychological symptoms; internalizing behavior; risk factors; lockdown; parental reactivity; perceived stress; development; wellbeing; covid-19; resilience","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-10","",8062,""
