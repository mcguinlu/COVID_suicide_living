"The COVID-related mental health load of neonatal healthcare professionals: a multicentre study in Italy","Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected healthcare professionals' lives. We investigated the potential mental health risk faced by healthcare professionals working in neonatal units in a multicentre cross-sectional observational study. Methods. We included all healthcare personnel of 7 level-3 and 6 level-2 neonatal units in Tuscany, Italy. We measured the level of physical exposure to COVID-19 risk, self-reported COVID-related stress, and mental health load outcomes (anxiety, depression, burnout, psychosomatic, and post-traumatic symptoms) via validated, self-administered, online questionnaires. Results. We analysed 314 complete answers. Scores above the clinical cutoff were reported by 91% of participants for anxious symptoms, 29% for post-traumatic symptoms, 13% for burnout, and 3% for depressive symptoms. Moreover, 50% of the participants reported at least one psychosomatic symptom. COVID-related stress (but not actual physical exposure) was significantly associated with all the measured mental health load outcomes, with a Risk Ratio of 3.33 (95% Confidence interval: 1.89, 5.85) for clinically relevant anxiety, 2.39 (1.69, 3.38) for post-traumatic symptoms, 1.79 (1.16, 2.75) for emotional exhaustion, and 2.51 (0.98, 6.44) for depression. Conclusions. Despite the low clinical impact of COVID-19 in neonatology, neonatal professionals are a specific population at risk for psychological consequences during the pandemic.","Luigi Gagliardi; Serena Grumi; Marzia Gentile; Roberta Cacciavellani; Giulia Placidi; Angelina Vaccaro; Claudia Maggi; Beatrice Gambi; Letizia Magi; Laura Crespin; Graziano Memmini; Marcello De Filippo; Elena Verucci; Liliana Malandra; Laura Mele; Angelo AzzarÃ ; Livio Provenzi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.23.21259414","20210702","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15563,""
"Coping under stress: Prefrontal control predicts stress burden during the COVID-19 crisis","Background: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has confronted millions of people around the world with an unprecedented stressor, affecting physical and mental health. Accumulating evidence suggests that emotional and cognitive self-regulation is particularly needed to effectively cope with stress. Therefore, we investigated the predictive value of affective and inhibitory prefrontal control for stress burden during the COVID-19 crisis. Method: Physical and mental health burden were assessed using an online survey, which was administered to 104 participants of an ongoing German at-risk birth cohort during the first wave in April 2020. Two follow-ups were carried out during the pandemic, one capturing the relaxation during summer and the other the beginning of the second wave of the crisis. Prefrontal activity during emotion regulation and inhibitory control were assessed prior to the COVID-19 crisis. Results: Increased inferior frontal gyrus activity during emotion regulation predicted lower stress burden at the beginning of the first and the second wave of the crisis. In contrast, inferior and medial frontal gyrus activity during inhibitory control predicted effective coping only during the summer, when infection rates decreased but stress burden remained unchanged. These findings remained significant when controlling for sociodemographic and clinical confounders such as stressful life events prior to the crisis or current psychopathology. Conclusions: We demonstrate that differential stress-buffering effects are predicted by the neural underpinnings of emotion regulation and cognitive regulation at different stages during the pandemic. These findings may inform future prevention strategies to foster stress coping in unforeseen situations.","Maximilian Monninger; Tania Maria Pollok; Pascal M Aggensteiner; Anna Kaiser; Iris Reinhard; Andrea Hermann; Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg; Daniel Brandeis; Tobias Banaschewski; Nathalie Elisabeth Holz","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.28.21259570","20210702","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15564,""
"The health impacts of a 4-month long community-wide COVID-19 lockdown: Findings from a prospective longitudinal study in the state of Victoria, Australia","Objectives. To determine health impacts during, and following, an extended community lockdown and COVID-19 outbreak in the Australian state of Victoria, compared with the rest of Australia. Methods. A national cohort of 898 working-age Australians enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study, completing surveys before, during, and after a 112-day community lockdown in Victoria (8 July - 27 October 2020). Outcomes included psychological distress, mental and physical health, work, social interactions and finances. Regression models examined health changes during and following lockdown. Results. The Victorian lockdown led to increased psychological distress. Health impacts coincided with greater social isolation and work loss. Following the extended lockdown, mental health, work and social interactions recovered to an extent whereby no significant long-lasting effects were identified in Victoria compared to the rest of Australia. Conclusion. The Victorian community lockdown had adverse health consequences, which reversed upon release from lockdown. Governments should weigh all potential health impacts of lockdown. Services and programs to reduce the negative impacts of lockdown may include increases in mental health care, encouraging safe social interactions and supports to maintain employment relationships.","Daniel Griffiths; Luke Sheehan; Dennis Petrie; Caryn van Vreden; Peter Whiteford; Alex Collie","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.28.21259672","20210702","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15565,""
"The Evolution of Young People's Mental Health during COVID-19: Evidence from four Low-and-Middle-Income-Countries","Background Though COVID-19 presents less risk to young people of serious morbidity or mortality, the resulting economic crisis has impacted their livelihoods. There is relatively little evidence on young people's mental health in Low-and-Middle-Income-Countries (LMICs) as the pandemic has progressed. Methods Two consecutive phone-surveys (August/October and November/December 2020) in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam interviewed around 9,000 participants of a 20-year cohort study who grew up in poverty (now aged 19 and 26). We investigate how young people's mental health has evolved in the four countries during the pandemic. Rates of (at least mild) anxiety (depression) measured by GAD-7 (PHQ-8) were compared across countries; between males/females, and food secure/food insecure households. Results Overall, rates of at least mild anxiety (depression) significantly decreased in all countries but Ethiopia as infection rates fell. However, young people in food insecure households report high rates of anxiety and depression and have not shown consistent improvements. Food insecure households are poorer, and have significantly more children (p<0.05) except in Ethiopia. Conclusions Food insecurity has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and is negatively associated with young people's mental health. Urgent support is needed for the most vulnerable.

"A cross-sectional study of the association between frequency of telecommuting and unhealthy dietary habits among Japanese workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, telecommuting has become a new way of working that has not only changed individuals' work, but also their health, lifestyle, family and community relationships. However, the impact of telecommuting on diet is not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between telecommuting frequency and unhealthy dietary habits among Japanese workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A total of 33,302 Japanese workers completed an Internet survey about telecommuting and dietary habits. Data from 13,468 office workers who telecommuted were analyzed. Telecommuting frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic was extracted from a questionnaire. The odds ratios (ORs) of four types of dietary habits, namely, skipping breakfast, solitary eating, lower meal frequency, and meal substitution associated with telecommuting frequency were estimated using multilevel logistic regression. Results: The multivariate OR of skipping breakfast was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.03-1.29, p=0.013) for participants who telecommuted in excess of four days per week compared to those who rarely telecommuted. Similarly, the multivariate OR of solitary eating, lower meal frequency and meal substitution were 1.44 (95%CI: 1.28-1.63, p<0.001), 2.39 (95%CI: 1.66-3.44, p<0.001), and 1.26 (95%CI: 1.04-1.51, p=0.015) for those who telecommuted in excess of four days per week compared to those who rarely telecommuted. There was a statistically significant increase in the dose-response trend in ORs of solitary eating (p for trend <0.001), lower meal frequency (p for trend <0.001), and meal substitution (p for trend =0.001) with increasing telecommuting frequency. Conclusion: Increasing telecommuting frequency was associated with an increasing number of unhealthy dietary habits in Japanese workers. Telecommuting during the COVID-19 pandemic, together with other social changes such as refraining from going out and socializing, is having a significant impact on workers' daily lives and behaviors. This study suggests that in addition to challenges related to physical activity, loneliness, and mental health, telecommuters may also be developing unhealthy dietary habits, indicating the need for strategies to help telecommuters manage their nutrition and diet.","Yoshiko Kubo; Tomohiro Ishimaru; Ayako Hino; Masako Nagata; Kazunori Ikegami; Seiichiro Tateishi; Mayumi Tsuji; Shinya Matsuda; Yoshihisa Fujino","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.28.21259558","20210701","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15567,""
"Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on posttraumatic stress in patients with psychiatric illness","The present study aimed to examine the prevalence of posttraumatic stress response in reaction to the COVID-19, including posttraumatic-stress-disorder-like symptoms (PTSD-like symptoms) and depressive symptoms, among patients with pre-existing psychiatric illness. The socio-demographic and psychological correlates of PTSD-like symptoms were also examined. A total of 193 participants were recruited. More than 45% of the respondents reported significant PTSD-like symptoms related to the COVID-19; this group of patients also had a high level of pandemic-related depressive symptoms. High level of PTSD-like symptoms were predicted by rumination on concerns about the outbreak of COVID-19 and feeling of social isolation. They were also associated with hypervigilance to cues related to the pandemic. Our results suggested that the pandemic had taken a psychological toll on people living with psychiatric illness. Further research is needed to understand the development and mechanism of traumatic stress reaction in response to a prolonged infectious disease outbreak among this vulnerable population. Clinical attention is also called to mitigate the psychiatric sequalae of the pandemic in this vulnerable group of people.","Ting, Wong, Liu, Leung, Ng","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114065","20210701","COVID-19; Pandemic; People with psychiatric illness; Posttraumatic stress; Psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15568,""
"COVID-19 and mental well-being of nurses in a tertiary facility in Kenya","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a global health emergency which has been shown to pose a great challenge to mental health, well-being and resilience of healthcare workers, especially nurses. Little is known on the impact of COVID-19 among nurses in sub-Saharan Africa. A cross sectional study was carried out between August and November 2020 among nurses recruited from the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi. The survey questionnaire consisted of six components- demographic and work title characteristics, information regarding care of COVID-19 patients, symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, distress and burnout, measured using standardized questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health disorders. Of 255 nurses, 171 (67.1%) consented to complete the survey. The median age of the participants was 33.47 years, 70.2% were females and 60.8% were married. More than half, 64.9% were frontline workers directly engaged in COVID-19 care. Only 1.8% reported a prior history or diagnosis of any mental health disorder. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, distress, and burnout were reported in 45.9%, 48.2%, 37.0%, 28.8% and 47.9% of all nurses. Frontline nurses reported experiencing more moderate to severe symptoms of depression, distress and burnout. Furthermore, females reported more burnout as compared to males. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that after adjustment, working in the frontlines was an independent risk variable for depression and burnout. This is one of the few studies looking at mental health outcomes among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya. Similar to other studies from around the world, nurses directly involved with COVID-19 patients reported higher rates of mental health symptoms. Burnout threatens to exacerbate the pre-existing severe nursing workforce shortage in low-resource settings. Cost-effective and feasible mitigating strategies, geared to low-middle income countries, are urgently needed to help cope with mental health symptoms during such a pandemic.","Ali, Shah, Talib","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254074","20210701","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15569,""
"Disparities in Learning Mode Access Among K-12 Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic, by Race/Ethnicity, Geography, and Grade Level - United States, September 2020-April 2021","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, schools across the United States began transitioning to virtual learning during spring 2020. However, schools' learning modes varied during the 2020-21 school year across states as schools transitioned at differing times back to in-person learning, in part reflecting updated CDC guidance. Reduced access to in-person learning is associated with poorer learning outcomes and adverse mental health and behavioral effects in children (1-3). Data on the learning modes available in 1,200 U.S. public school districts (representing 46% of kindergarten through grade 12 [K-12] public school enrollment) from all 50 states and the District of Columbia during September 2020-April 2021 were matched with National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) demographic data. Learning mode access was assessed for K-12 students during the COVID-19 pandemic, over time and by student race/ethnicity, geography, and grade level group. Across all assessed racial/ethnic groups, prevalence of virtual-only learning showed more variability during September-December 2020 but declined steadily from January to April 2021. During January-April 2021, access to full-time in-person learning for non-Hispanic White students increased by 36.6 percentage points (from 38.0% to 74.6%), compared with 31.1 percentage points for non-Hispanic Black students (from 32.3% to 63.4%), 23.0 percentage points for Hispanic students (from 35.9% to 58.9%) and 30.6 percentage points for students of other races/ethnicities (from 26.3% to 56.9%). In January 2021, 39% of students in grades K-5 had access to full-time in-person learning compared with 33% of students in grades 6-8 and 30% of students in grades 9-12. Disparities in full-time in-person learning by race/ethnicity existed across school levels and by geographic region and state. These disparities underscore the importance of prioritizing equitable access to this learning mode for the 2021-22 school year. To increase equitable access to full-time in-person learning for the 2021-22 school year, school leaders should focus on providing safety-optimized in-person learning options across grade levels. CDC's K-12 operational strategy presents a pathway for schools to safely provide in-person learning through implementing recommended prevention strategies, increasing vaccination rates for teachers and older students with a focus on vaccine equity, and reducing community transmission (4).","Oster, Jack, Halloran, Schoof, McLeod, Yang, Roche, Roche","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7026e2","20210701","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15570,""
"Symptoms of Depression, Anxiety, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Suicidal Ideation Among State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Public Health Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic - United States, March-April 2021","Increases in mental health conditions have been documented among the general population and health care workers since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (1-3). Public health workers might be at similar risk for negative mental health consequences because of the prolonged demand for responding to the pandemic and for implementing an unprecedented vaccination campaign. The extent of mental health conditions among public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, is uncertain. A 2014 survey estimated that there were nearly 250,000 state and local public health workers in the United States (4). To evaluate mental health conditions among these workers, a nonprobability-based online survey was conducted during March 29-April 16, 2021, to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidal ideation among public health workers in state, tribal, local, and territorial public health departments. Among 26,174 respondents, 53.0% reported symptoms of at least one mental health condition in the preceding 2 weeks, including depression (32.0%), anxiety (30.3%), PTSD (36.8%), or suicidal ideation (8.4%). The highest prevalence of symptoms of a mental health condition was among respondents aged Ã¢â€°Â¤29 years (rangeÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 13.6%-47.4%) and transgender or nonbinary persons (i.e., those who identified as neither male nor female) of all ages (rangeÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 30.4%-65.5%). Public health workers who reported being unable to take time off from work were more likely to report adverse mental health symptoms. Severity of symptoms increased with increasing weekly work hours and percentage of work time dedicated to COVID-19 response activities. Implementing prevention and control practices that eliminate, reduce, and manage factors that cause or contribute to public health workers' poor mental health might improve mental health outcomes during emergencies.","Bryant-Genevier, Rao, Lopes-Cardozo, Kone, Rose, Thomas, Orquiola, Lynfield, Shah, Freeman, Becker, Williams, Gould, Tiesman, Lloyd, Hill, Byrkit","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7026e1","20210701","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15571,""

The article reports on the qualitative portion of a mixed-methods study, which included 56 HCPs who work in a large mental healthcare facility in Ontario. Witnessing the impact of the pandemic restrictions on patients was a significant source of stress for HCPs. HCPs recommended strategies, such as learning new therapeutic modalities and participating in the redesign of health services as key strategies to support them during the pandemic as these would promote patient well-being. Lastly, the pandemic provided opportunities for HCPs to deepen their understanding of other professions. This awareness was viewed as a strength that could support interprofessional collaboration and enhance health services redesign.

"Predictors of negative psychosocial and health behavior impact of COVID-19 among young adults","Given the global impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on mental and physical health, we examined young adults' changes in mental health, intimate relationship quality, alcohol use and weight-related behaviors during COVID-19 and their correlates (depressive symptoms, resilience, social context and COVID-19-related factors). We analyzed data from a longitudinal study of 1082 young adults across six metropolitan areas (MageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°24.76Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.70; 51.8% female; 73.6% White and 12.5% Hispanic), using multivariate linear regressions for continuous outcomes (magnitude of mental health impact) and logistic regressions for categorical outcomes (decreased relationship quality, physical activity and nutrition and increased alcohol use and sedentary behavior). Of five negative mental health impacts assessed, participants reported experiencing an average of 3.54 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.46), experiencing more correlated with increased childcare responsibilities and lower resilience. Additionally, 23.6% of those in relationships experienced negative relationship impact, 41.3% increased alcohol use, 47.2% decreased physical activity, 74.0% were more sedentary and 34.7% experienced poorer nutrition, all of which was predicted by greater depressive symptoms. Additionally, lower resilience predicted negative relationship impact and poorer nutrition and social context/roles correlated with various outcomes (e.g. relationships and alcohol use).

"Debate: Coping and resilience in the time of COVID-19 and structural inequities","The hardships associated with COVID-19 have highlighted the importance of coping and resilience, and many mental health providers and organizations have responded by promoting the use of individual and familial coping tools. While individually oriented techniques benefit many, they can also disadvantage populations struggling the most. They exact a cost by placing a higher burden on those with fewer resources and thus risk widening structural inequities. Since community-level interventions can also enhance resiliency and are cheaper and more sustainable, more effort should be put into developing and deploying them. At a time in which hardship is widespread, parents are overwhelmed by multiple demands, structural inequities are rampant, and demand for services outpaces capacity, the mental health field must prioritize more equitable methods of assisting large numbers of children and families.","Zilberstein","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12484","20210701","Resilience; communities; coping: individualism; families: structural inequities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15580,""
"Medium-term changes in patients with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to social distancing measures and impaired medical care of chronic neurological diseases, including epilepsy, which may have adversely affected well-being and quality of life of patients with epilepsy (PWE). The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the levels of anxiety, depression, somnolence, and quality of life using validated scales in PWE in real-life clinical practice. Self-administered scales of anxiety disorders (GAD-7), depression (NDDI-E), somnolence (Epworth Sleepiness Scale; ESS), and quality of life (QOLIE-31-P) in PWE treated in a Refractory Epilepsy Unit were longitudinally analyzed. Data were collected before the beginning (December 2019 - March 2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (September 2020-January 2021). 158 patients (85 from the first round and 73 from the second round) 45.0Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 17.3Ã‚Â years of age, 43.2% women, epilepsy duration 23.0Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 14.9Ã‚Â years, number of antiepileptic drugs 2.1Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 1.4, completed the survey.

"Insomnia and sleep quality in healthcare workers fighting against COVID-19: a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to significant- ly affect the mental health of healthcare workers, who stand in the frontline of this crisis. Insomnia is often related to exposure to stressful situations, such as the current health crisis, as well as other mental disorders, physical conditions and work-related problems. The objectives of this systematic review were: 1) to examine the impact of the current health pandemic produced by COVID-19 on insomnia and sleep quality of health professionals, and 2) to identify risk factors associated with insomnia. After a literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, 18 relevant studies were identified. The prevalence of insomnia estimated by random effects meta-analysis was 38% (95%CI= 37 to 39%), being slightly higher in women (29%, 95%CI= 27% to 30%) than in men (24%, 95%CI= 21 to 27%). The main risk factor associated with insomnia was working in a high-risk environment, followed by female sex and having a lower educational level. The high figures of self-reported insomnia and poor sleep quality observed indicate the need to develop interventions aimed at mitigating and caring for the mental health of healthcare workers fighting against this pandemic.","Serrano-Ripoll, Zamanillo-Campos, Castro, Fiol-de Roque, Ricci-Cabello","https://www.google.com/search?q=Insomnia+and+sleep+quality+in+healthcare+workers+fighting+against+COVID-19:+a+systematic+review+of+the+literature+and+meta-analysis.","20210701","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15583,""

"COVID-19 stressors, wellbeing and health behaviours: a cross-sectional study","Following the implementation of pandemic response measures, concerns arose regarding the impact for population health and wellbeing. This study reports findings from a survey (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2510) conducted in Warwickshire (UK) during August and September 2020, and for the first time investigates behaviours which may worsen or mitigate the association between COVID-19-related stressors and wellbeing. Increased stressors were associated with lower mental wellbeing and higher loneliness. Participants with a mental health condition reported lower wellbeing, as did younger groups, women and participants not in employment. To cope with restrictions, more participants engaged in healthier behaviours over unhealthy behaviours, and relaxing reduced the association between stressors and poor wellbeing. Some participants reported increasing alcohol and unhealthy dietary behaviours to cope with restrictions, however, these behaviours did not mitigate the impact of COVID-19 stressors and were instead negatively associated with wellbeing. Around half of participants helped neighbours during the pandemic, a behaviour positively associated with wellbeing particularly among older adults. These findings contribute understanding about how various positive and negative health behaviours may mitigate or worsen the impact of COVID-19 on wellbeing, and how public health interventions may effectively target behaviours and groups in similar populations.","Bell, Smith, van de Venter, Shuttleworth, Wilson, Lycett","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab241","20210701","behaviour; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15585,""
"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on otolaryngologists: Should we be concerned?","Physicians on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic are at increased risk of contracting the disease. Otolaryngologists are amongst the high-risk practitioners, as they are in close proximity to patient's upper airway, which may induce their psychological stress. A cross-sectional survey study, conducted among otolaryngologists in Saudi Arabia from June 11 to June 22. Survey consisted of sociodemographic questionnaire, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Available otolaryngologists with no history of mental health problems were included. A <i>P</i>-value lower than .05 was considered statistically significant. The study included 129 participants; 63.6% men and 36.4% women. 81.4% of participants were living with family, 57.4% living with either a child or an elderly family member. Nearly 7.8% of participants had dysfunctional COVID-19 anxiety and 75.2% had COVID-19-related depression symptoms ranging from minimal to severe. Obsession and dysfunctional thinking regarding COVID-19 were found in 26.4% of participants. Single otolaryngologists had significantly higher CAS (<i>P</i> = .025), OCS (<i>P</i> = .048), and PHQ-9 (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) scores. Participants who lived with children or elderly individuals had significantly higher OCS scores (<i>P</i> = .005). When comparing job ranks, residents had significantly higher scores for the CAS (<i>P</i> = .016) and PHQ-9 (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). COVID-19 has a considerable psychological impact on otolaryngologists. Specifically, the young and single who have less social support. This indicates the importance of psychological support to this group. Additional thorough studies should explore the psychological impact of COVID-19 in this field as it may carry devastating long-term consequences if left unattended.

"Exposure of second hand smoke in women and children: A narrative review","Second-hand smoke is a neglected public health issue. Every year 1.2 million people die due to this exposure. Second-hand smoke is also related to various other diseases like cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases, low birth weight, maternal depression, etc. The purpose of this review is to look over various studies and to gain an understanding of existing research about second-hand smoke and its adverse effects. In addition, we tried to identify the barriers behind creating a smoke-free environment at home and successful strategies employed and suggestion given in various studies. A comprehensive search of the recent literature related to Second-hand smoke was undertaken using electronic databases like MEDLINE, PUBMED, Google Scholar, and Research gate. Keyword searches were conducted for publications published since 2004 or later on Second-hand smoke exposure in pregnant women. Prevalence of SHS among pregnant women ranged from 24% 92%. Lack of knowledge, absence of comprehensive smoking ban, low status of women was among the main contributing factors. Community awareness and counseling by primary health-care physician was found to be successful strategies. There are various cultural and social barriers behind a smoke-free home for pregnant women. Interventional approaches like focused counseling by primary care physicians can help to overcome this issue. There is a need for behavioral interventions and community awareness to be done in this aspect.","Sharma, Khapre","https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1397_20","20210701","<CopyrightInformation>Copyright: Ã‚Â© 2021 Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN=""Y""><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Sharma</LastName><ForeName>Twinkle</ForeName><Initials>T</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Community and Family Medicine, AIIMS Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN=""Y""><LastName>Khapre</LastName><ForeName>Meenakshi</ForeName><Initials>M</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Community and Family Medicine, AIIMS Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI=""D016428"">Journal Article</PublicationType><PublicationType UI=""D016454"">Review</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType=""Electronic""><Year>2021</Year><Month>05</Month><Day>31</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>India</Country><MedlineTA>J Family Med Prim Care</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101610082</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2249-4863</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><KeywordList Owner=""NOTNLM""><Keyword MajorTopicYN=""N"">COVID-19; pregnancy; second-hand smoke; tobacco smokeCOVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15588,""

"Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Psychological Distress Associated With the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","<b>Background</b>: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with various negative psychological consequences. This is a challenge for the society as regular psychological services cannot be offered to the same extent as before the pandemic. In addition to the requirement of social distancing, there is a need to adjust psychological treatment components like exposure to avoid increasing the spread of the infection. Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) has an established evidence base for a range of psychiatric problems and has been suggested as one possible approach to deal with the situation. This study aimed to conduct a randomized controlled pilot trial during the summer of 2020 with a broad focus on psychological distress and a treatment approach that tailors the intervention based on symptom profile and preferences. <b>Methods</b>: Following the advertisement and interview, we included 52 participants with elevated levels of psychological distress. They were randomly allocated to either a 7-week-long individually tailored ICBT (<i>n</i> = 26) or a wait-list control condition (<i>n</i> = 26). Measures of depression and quality of life were used as primary outcomes. We also included secondary outcome measures of anxiety, insomnia, trauma, stress, anger, and alcohol use. For screening, we used the CoRonavIruS Health Impact Survey (CRISIS). <b>Results</b>: Overall moderate to large between-group effects were found at post-treatment in favor of the treatment on measures of both depression [Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); Cohens <i>d</i> = 0.63; Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9): <i>d</i> = 0.62] and anxiety [Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7-item scale (GAD-7); <i>d</i> = 0.82]. This was also observed for stress symptoms [Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14); <i>d</i> = 1.04]. No effects were seen on measures of quality of life, insomnia, symptoms of post-traumatic stress, and anger. There was an effect on alcohol use [Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT); <i>d</i> = 0.54], which was not of clinical relevance. <b>Conclusion</b>: Individually tailored ICBT shows initial promise as a way to reduce psychological problems in association with the COVID-19 pandemic. A possible limitation was that the trial was conducted when the effects of the pandemic were decreasing and when fewer people were affected by the restrictions (e.g., the summer of 2020).","Aminoff, SellÃƒÂ©n, SÃƒÂ¶rliden, Ludvigsson, Berg, Andersson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.684540","20210701","COVID-19; anxiety; controlled trial; depression; internet-based cognitive behavior therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15590,""
"Psychosocial Impact of Cancer Care Disruptions in Women With Breast Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions in cancer care, and preliminary research suggests that these disruptions are associated with increased levels of psychosocial distress among cancer survivors. The purpose of this study was to offer a descriptive report of the psychosocial functioning, perceived risk and fear of cancer progression, and COVID-19 pandemic impact and experiences in a unique, high-risk patient cohort: breast cancer survivors whose cancer treatment was delayed and/or changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional study included 50 women with dual carcinoma <i>in situ</i>, lobular carcinoma <i>in situ</i>, or invasive breast cancer whose cancer surgery was postponed due to the pandemic. As they awaited delayed surgery or shortly after they received delayed surgery, participants completed questionnaires on psychosocial functioning (depression, anxiety, sleep, and quality of life), their perceived risk and fear of cancer progression, patient-provider communication about disruptions in their care, personal impact of the pandemic, worry/threat about COVID-19, and COVID-19 symptoms/diagnoses. Descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations were computed among continuous study variables. Independent samples <i>t</i>-tests explored group differences in psychosocial functioning between survivors who were still awaiting delayed surgery and those who had recently received it. <b>Results:</b> Overall, the sample denied that the pandemic seriously negatively impacted their finances or resource access and reported low-to-moderate levels of psychosocial distress and fear about COVID-19. Twenty-six percent had clinically significant levels of fear of cancer progression, with levels comparable to other recent work. About a third were still awaiting delayed cancer surgery and this group reported lower satisfaction with communication from oncology providers but overall did not seem to report more psychosocial difficulties than those who already had surgery. <b>Conclusion:</b> Shortly before or after primary breast cancer surgery that was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this sample of survivors appears to be generally managing well psychosocially. However, many psychosocial difficulties (e.g., fear of cancer recurrence/progression) typically have an onset after the completion of treatment, therefore, research should continue to follow this cohort of cancer survivors as the pandemic's direct impact on their care likely increases their risk for these difficulties later in survivorship.","Soriano, Perndorfer, Otto, Fenech, Siegel, Dickson-Witmer, Clements, Laurenceau","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.662339","20210701","COVID-19; breast cancer; cancer survivorship; fear of cancer progression; fear of cancer recurrence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15591,""

The CINL scale was found to have two dimensions: frequency and comprehension, as well as good reliability and validity. A formal study explored the mediating effect of cognitive flexibility on the relationship between CINL and mental health. The results showed that CINL positively predicted mental health when it was mediated by cognitive flexibility.

"Problematic Use of Alcohol and Online Gaming as Coping Strategies During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mini Review","The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has dramatically changed our daily lives and activities, including those originally intended to serve for leisure and pleasure. Drinking and online gaming became coping behaviors used to rescue ourselves from the stress and restricted lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, frequent drinking and gaming can result in the pathological consequences of addiction. Those affected use the stimuli not to obtain pleasure, but rather to avoid the displeasure induced by stress and previous use, often unsuccessfully. This review aims to provide an overview of recent longitudinal cohort studies on alcohol and gaming use during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to analyze how the pandemic has affected alcohol and gaming use. There was a substantial risk of alcohol and online gaming overuse during the lockdown, which may depend on the pandemic's duration or overuse patterns. Previous studies have shown that increased alcohol consumption and online gaming are associated with heightened stress and anxiety levels caused by social isolation/quarantine. Over time, frequent or excessive alcohol consumption and gaming could lead to an increased risk of more serious mental health problems. Every effort should be made to mitigate mental health problems and ensure adequate adaptation to these exceptional circumstances. Therefore, it would be helpful to encourage physical activity, social interaction, and collaboration to facilitate psychological and physical health.","Xu, Park, Kang, Choi, Koo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.685964","20210701","COVID-19; addiction; alcohol; coping; online gaming; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15594,""
"Compulsive Hoarding Symptoms and the Role of Mindfulness Skills During Social Distancing for the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Exploratory Survey","People reporting compulsive hoarding symptoms (CHS) have lower mindfulness skills than those without such symptoms.

The quarantine imposed to contain the COVID-19 spread had a negative impact on daily habits and healthy behaviors (including social interactions). An increased attachment to objects might be one of the under-recognized psychological consequences of these difficult times, yet no study focused on CHS. Through an online survey in men who were on quarantine during the pandemic, this exploratory survey examined the prevalence of men reporting CHS during this period and explored the role of mindfulness skills on CHS controlling for anxious-depressive/stress symptoms. Forty-three men from the general population completed the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R), Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21). Twenty-eight percent reported CHS. No differences on the scores of the questionnaires emerged between men with and without CHS, except on CAMS-R Attention scores. In a logistic regression analysis lower CAMS-R Attention scores predicted CHS (ÃŽÂ² = -0.34, <i>p</i> = 0.03). This is the first, yet preliminary investigation on CHS during quarantine. The prevalence of CHS appears higher than the rates (4%) reported in the last years before the COVID-19 outbreak. Perhaps people showed more intense hoarding tendencies during quarantine/social distancing, and this pattern should be monitored. Larger samples, longitudinal designs and clinician-rated instruments are needed to support or not our findings.","Marazziti, Pozza, Mucci, Dettore","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.634454","20210701","COVID-19 pandemic; behavioral addiction; compulsive hoarding; coronavirus; mindfulness; obsessive - compulsive disorder; social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15595,""
"Depressive State in the Emergency Department During COVID-19: A National Cross-Sectional Survey in China","Chinese emergency department (ED) staff encountered significant mental stress while fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We sought to investigate the prevalence and associated factors for depressive symptoms among ED staff (including physicians, nurses, allied health, and auxiliary ED staff). A cross-sectional national survey of ED staff who were on duty and participated in combating the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted March 1-15, 2020. A total of 6,588 emergency medical personnel from 1,060 hospitals responded to this survey. A majority of respondents scored above 10 points on the PHQ-9 standardized test, which is associated with depressive symptoms. Those aged 31-45, those working in the COVID-19 isolation unit, and those with relatives Ã¢â€°Â¤ 16 or Ã¢â€°Â¥70 years old at home all had statistically significant associations with scoring &gt;10 points. Depressive symptoms among Chinese emergency medical staff were likely quite common during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforce the importance of targeted ED staff support during future outbreaks.","Liu, Han, Shen, Zhu, Wang, Liang, He, Xie, Wei, Wu, Zhao, Liu, Liu, Guo, Nie, Cao, Lu, Fang, Lu, Wu, Zhao, Han, Zhang, Chang, Xu, Ma, Si, Qi, Peng, Chai, Cao, Jiang, Yin, Wang, Zhan, Huang, Deng, Song, Yang, Wu, Ding, Zheng, Qian, Huang, Lin, Xu, Zhang, Hu, Dou, Zhang, Tian, Yao, Walline, Zhu, Xu, Li, Yu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.566990","20210701","COVID-19; China; PHQ-9; depression; emergency medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15596,""
"The Right to Mental Health in Yemen: A Distressed and Ignored Foundation for Peace","Mental health issues are all too common consequences of conflict and atrocity crimes, often causing upwards of one-quarter of the postconflict, post-atrocity population to suffer from physical and mental sequelae that linger long after weapons have been silenced. After more than six years of ongoing conflict, Yemen's already weak health care system is on the brink of collapse, and population resilience has been severely stressed by indiscriminate attacks, airstrikes, torture, food insecurity, unemployment, cholera, and now the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper examines Yemen's responsibilities regarding the right to mental health and details the few actions the government has taken to date toward fulfilling this right. It also presents the current status of mental health care in Yemen, discussing some of the barriers to accessing the available care, as well as alternative models of mental health support being used by the population. In light of the pandemic presently facing the world, the paper also discusses COVID-19's impact on Yemen, detailing its further degrading effects on the country's health care system and people's mental health. Finally, the paper highlights the importance of addressing mental health in furtherance of the peace process.","Alhariri, Mcnally, Knuckey","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Right+to+Mental+Health+in+Yemen:+A+Distressed+and+Ignored+Foundation+for+Peace.","20210701","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15597,""
"Sexual functioning during the lockdown period in India: An online survey","This study aimed to evaluate the impact of lockdown on sexual functioning in India. In addition, impact of lockdown on relationship with the partner and mental health was evaluated. An online survey was conducted using changes in sexual functioning questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire-4, and a self-designed questionnaire. The mean age of the participants was 41.5 (standard deviation: 11.2; range: 22-77; median: 39.5) years, with the majority being males 385 (85.6%). The participants reported that lockdown led to reduction in the frequency of sexual intercourse and also touching the partner (fondling, caressing, touching, or kissing) when not indulging in sexual intercourse. Majority of the participants reported improvement in the overall relationship, communication with the partner, and interpersonal conflicts. About two-fifths of the participants reported engaging in sexual intercourse more than twice a week or more. About one-fifth screened positive for psychiatric morbidity, with 14.2% screened positive for anxiety, 14.8% screened positive for depression and 8.7% screened positive for both. In both genders, presence of depression and anxiety were associated with lower sexual functioning in all the domains. Lockdown led to a reduction in the frequency of sexual intercourse, and reduction in the frequency of intimacy in the form of fondling, caressing, touching, or kissing partner when not doing sexual intercourse. However, lockdown led to the improvement in overall relationship and communication with the partners and a reduction in interpersonal conflicts.","Grover, Vaishnav, Tripathi, Rao, Avasthi, Dalal, Mehra, Sahoo, Manohar, Chandran, Kumar, Sharma, Rao","https://doi.org/10.4103/psychiatry.IndianJPsychiatry_860_20","20210701","COVID-19; lockdown; sexual dysfunction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15598,""
"Healthcare use during COVID-19 and the effect on psychological distress in patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disorders in the Netherlands: a cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic caused a massive shift in the focus of healthcare. Such changes could have affected health status and mental health in vulnerable patient groups. We aimed to investigate whether patients with chronic pulmonary and cardiac diseases had experienced high levels of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. A cross-sectional study. COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in healthcare use, health status and psychological distress were investigated among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and congestive heart failure (CHF), using an online nationwide survey. 680 patients completed the survey. COPD was the most often reported diagnosis 334 (49%), followed by congestive heart failure 219 (32%) and PF 44 (7%). There were 79 (12%) patients with primary diagnosis 'other' than chronic cardiopulmonary disease, who also completed this survey. Psychological distress was assessed via the DASS-21 score (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale). Moreover, specific worries and anxieties regarding COVID-19 were explored. The frequency of contact with healthcare professionals changed in 52%. Changes in treatment were reported in 52%. Deterioration in health status was self-reported in 39%. Moderate to extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety and stress was observed in 25.8%, 28.5% and 14%, respectively. Over 70% reported specific worries and anxieties, such as about their own health and fear of being alone. Both the deterioration in health status and increased levels of anxiety were significantly (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.006) associated with changes in treatment. Exploratory analyses indicated that lack of social support may further increase anxiety. Healthcare use changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. It was associated with a decrease in health status, and increased psychological stress among patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disorders. Provision of healthcare should be more sensitive to the mental health needs of these patients during subsequent COVID-19 waves.","Pouwels, Simons, Theunissen, Peters, Schoenmaekers, Bekkers, van den Beuken-van Everdingen","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046883","20210701","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; mental health; palliative care; quality in health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15599,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on change in sleep patterns in an exploratory, cross-sectional online sample of 79 countries","To describe changes in sleep patterns during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, develop profiles according to these patterns, and assess sociodemographic, economic, COVID-19 related, and sleep and mental health factors associated with these profiles. A 25-minute online survey was distributed worldwide through social media from 5/21/2020 to 7/1/2020. Participants reported sociodemographic/economic information, the impact of the pandemic on major life domains, insomnia and depressive symptoms, and changes in sleep midpoint, time-in-bed, total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and nightmare and nap frequency from prior to during the pandemic. Sleep pattern changes were subjected to latent profile analysis. The identified profiles were compared to one another on all aforementioned factors using probit regression analyses. The sample of 991 participants (ages: 18-80 years; 72.5% women; 60.3% residing outside of the United States) reported significantly delayed sleep midpoint, reductions in TST and SE, and increases in nightmares and naps. Over half reported significant insomnia symptoms, and almost two-thirds reported significant depressive symptoms. Latent profile analysis revealed 4 sleep pattern change profiles that were significantly differentiated by pre-pandemic sleep patterns, gender, and various COVID-19-related impacts on daily living such as severity of change in routines, and family stress and discord. In an international online sample, poor sleep and depressive symptoms were widespread, and negative shifts in sleep patterns from pre-pandemic patterns were common. Differences in sleep pattern response to the COVID-19 crisis suggest potential and early targets for behavioral sleep health interventions.","Petrov, Pituch, Kasraeian, Jiao, Mattingly, Hasanaj, Youngstedt, Buman, Epstein","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2021.05.007","20210701","Coronavirus; Depression; Gender differences; Insomnia severity; Latent profile analysis; Quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15600,""
"The effects of COVID-19 fear and anxiety on symptom severity, sleep quality, and mood in patients with fibromyalgia: a pilot study","During the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals faced psychological stress caused by fear and anxiety due to the high transmission and mortality rate of the disease, the social isolation, economic problems, and difficulties in reaching health services. Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic centralized pain sensitivity disorder. Psychological, physical and/or autoimmune stressors were found to increase FM symptoms. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the COVID-19 fear and anxiety level, and to examine their effect on disease severity, sleep quality, and mood in FM patients compared to control group. This pilot study conducted as a cross-sectional study, and included 62 participants. Participants were divided into two groups: FM patient group (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°31) and control group (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 31). Symptom severity, sleep quality, and mood were determined using the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR), Pitsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. In order to evaluate the level of COVID-19 fear and anxiety, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) were used compared to control group. FIQR, PSQI, HAD-A, HAD-D, FCV-19S and CAS scores were significantly higher in the FM group (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). A positive significant correlation was found between FCV-19S and CAS results and FIQR, PSQI, and HAD-anx results in FM patients (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). This pilot study showed that, the individuals with FM can be more affected by psychological stress, and this situation negatively affects the symptom severity, sleep quality, and mood in FM patients, so these patients should be closely monitored in terms of psychological stressors and their effects during pandemics. More studies with more participants are necessary to describe the challenges lived by fibromyalgia population.","Cankurtaran, Tezel, Ercan, Yildiz, Akyuz","https://doi.org/10.1186/s42358-021-00200-9","20210701","COVID-19; Coronavirus anxiety scale; Fear of COVID-19 scale; Fibromyalgia; Symptom severity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15601,""
"ReCOV: recovery and rehabilitation during and after COVID-19 - a study protocol of a longitudinal observational study on patients, next of kin and health care staff","The knowledge of the long-term consequences of covid-19 is limited. In patients, symptoms such as fatigue, decreased physical, psychological, and cognitive function, and nutritional problems have been reported. How the disease has affected next of kin, as well as staff involved in the care of patients with covid-19, is also largely unknown. The overall aim of this study is therefore three-fold: (1) to describe and evaluate predictors of patient recovery, the type of rehabilitation received and patients' experiences of specialized rehabilitation following COVID-19 infection; (2) to study how next of kin experienced the hospital care of their relative and their experiences of the psychosocial support they received as well as their psychological wellbeing; (3) to describe experiences of caring for patients with COVID-19 and evaluate psychological wellbeing, coping mechanisms and predictors for development of psychological distress over time in health care staff. This observational longitudinal study consists of three cohorts; patients, next of kin, and health care staff. The assessments for the patients consist of physical tests (lung function, muscle strength, physical capacity) and questionnaires (communication and swallowing, nutritional status, hearing, activities of daily living, physical activity, fatigue, cognition) longitudinally at 3, 6 and 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. Patient records auditing (care, rehabilitation) will be done retrospectively at 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. Patients (3, 6 and 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months), next of kin (6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months) and health care staff (baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months) will receive questionnaires regarding, health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety, sleeping disorders, and post-traumatic stress. Staff will also answer questionnaires about burnout and coping strategies. Interviews will be conducted in all three cohorts. This study will be able to answer different research questions from a quantitative and qualitative perspective, by describing and evaluating long-term consequences and their associations with recovery, as well as exploring patients', next of kins' and staffs' views and experiences of the disease and its consequences. This will form a base for a deeper and better understanding of the consequences of the disease from different perspectives as well as helping the society to better prepare for a future pandemic.","Rydwik, Anmyr, Regardt, McAllister, Zarenoe, Ãƒâ€¦kerman, Orrevall, BragesjÃƒÂ¶, Dahl, Kemani, Nordstrand, Ekman, HolmstrÃƒÂ¶m, Nygren-Bonnier","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13102-021-00299-9","20210701","Infection; Physical function; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15602,""

"Quality of life, physical activity and burnout syndrome during online learning period in Brazilian university students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cluster analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic caused several changes in the teaching-learning process, as it abruptly replaced the conventional classes into online classes despite social distancing requirements. Such changes may be associated with several mental health problems and negatively affect the quality of life and academic performance of university students. We performed a cluster analysis in a large sample of Brazilian undergraduate students, considering sociodemographic data, physical activity frequency, study areas, Burnout Syndrome (BS), Quality of Life (QoL) and perception of online learning (OL) during COVID-19 pandemic. Seven hundred and three students (between 17 and 62Ã‚Â years, from 67 higher education institutions) participated in the study. We identified three different profiles of students regarding psychological aspects and OL perception. The first profile, called as the 'Low QoL' group was composed of younger students, mainly females, with higher frequency of psychological disorders (as evidenced by the self-report of depression and/or anxiety), in addition to higher Burnout scores, lower QoL and worse OL perception. The second profile called 'Intermediate QoL' comprised participants with an average age of 45Ã‚Â years, with a greater number of men, married, with kids and working in addition to studying. They presented better OL scores than the 'Low QoL' group. The third profile called 'Better QoL' comprised students with higher scores in all domains of QoL and better OL perception, with greater frequency of physical activity and lower BS scores. Students from Health courses showed higher scores for general QoL, and also for the psychological and environmental domains in relation to the other areas. Besides, students of the Exact Sciences courses showed higher scores on all OL perception items in comparison to the other courses. Our results provide insights regarding the mental health profile of undergraduate students, allowing educational managers to outline specific coping strategies to assist students during the pandemic.","Azzi, Melo, Neto, Castelo, Andrade, Pereira","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1944656","20210701","Burnout syndrome; COVID-19 outbreak; online learning; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-02","",15604,""
