"A qualitative exploration of the perspectives of international medical students residing in university hostels amid COVID-19 pandemic lockdown","Background COVID-19 pandemic has portentously frightened the existence of life all over the world. The lockdown approach was adopted as a containment strategy as the disease itself has manifested severe social, economic, and psychiatric implications. Objectives To explore the perception and preparedness of international medical students residing in university hostels amid the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Design A semi-structured interview guide was developed in this qualitative study design. All the interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and then analyzed for thematic contents by standard content analysis framework. Setting Interviews were conducted in university hostels in Punjab, Pakistan. Participants A total of 11 international medical students were interviewed face-to-face through the purposive sampling technique to obtain in-depth individual viewpoints. Results The thematic content analysis yielded five major themes: Familiarity with COVID-19, Perceptions and attitudes towards COVID-19, Preparedness for safety against COVID-19, Barriers to lifestyle, and Psychological perspectives. A better general perception and preparedness among international medical students regarding COVID-19 was found. Good knowledge regarding the overview of COVID-19; adequate preventive approaches such as social distancing, use of masks, gloves, and sanitizers; and compliance with the lockdown measures were reported by the respondents. The pertinent issue raised by the respondents is the disturbance in normal routine due to distortion in social life and isolation that may cause psychological stress. Conclusions The findings from this study lighten the peoples perspectives that help the government to prepare public health strategies based on population-focused approaches. The present study demonstrates the respondents opinion on COVID-19 management by personal hygiene, social distancing, and complying with the lockdown measures. Furthermore, it demands that timely and evidence-based teaching-learning techniques should be adopted for students engagement which ensures mental health and self-motivation as well. Therefore, they can utilize their time productively which could have a long-term effect on their careers and healthcare services.","Sitaram Khadka; Muhammad Usman; Mohammad Saleem; Moshin Ali; Huma Rasheed; Santoshi Giri; Hafiz Asad Saeed; Ravi Prasad Gupta; Yogesh Bajgain; Janak Shahi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.02.21261480","20210805","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16846,""
"Multiple-time measurements of multidimensional psychiatric states from immediately before the COVID-19 pandemic to one year later: A longitudinal online survey of the Japanese population","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly affected the mental health of both infected and uninfected people. Although most psychiatric disorders have highly overlapping genetic and pathogenic backgrounds, most studies investigating the impact of the pandemic have examined only single psychiatric disorders. It is necessary to examine longitudinal trajectories of factors that modulate psychiatric states across multiple dimensions. 2274 Japanese citizens participated in online surveys presented in December 2019 (before the pandemic), August 2020, Dec 2020, and April 2021. These surveys included nine questionnaires on psychiatric symptoms, such as depression and anxiety. Multi-dimensional psychiatric time series data were then decomposed into four principal components. We used generalized linear models to identify modulating factors for effects of the pandemic on these components. The four principal components can be interpreted as general psychiatric burden, social withdrawal, alcohol-related problems, and depression/anxiety. Principal components associated with general psychiatric burden and depression/anxiety peaked during the initial phase of the pandemic. They were further exacerbated by the economic burden of the pandemic. In contrast, principal components associated with social withdrawal showed a delayed peak, with human relationships as an important risk modulating factor. In addition, being elderly and female were risk factors shared across all components. Our results show that COVID-19 has imposed a large and varied burden on the Japanese population since the commencement of the pandemic. Although components related to the general psychiatric burden remained elevated, peak intensities differed between components related to depression/anxiety and those related to social anxiety. These results underline the importance of using flexible monitoring and mitigation strategies for mental problems, according to the phase of the pandemic.","Taiki Oka; Takatomi Kubo; Nao Kobayashi; Fumiya Nakai; Yuka Miyake; Toshitaka Hamamura; Masaru Honjo; Hiroyuki Toda; Shuken Boku; Tetsufumi Kanazawa; Masanori Nagamine; Aurelio Cortese; Minoru Takebayashi; Mitsuo Kawato; Toshinori Chiba","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.01.21261309","20210805","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16847,""
"What can internet users' behaviours reveal about the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic? A systematic review","At the end of 2019, an acute infectious pneumonia (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, China, and subsequently spread around the world starting a pandemic. Globally, to date, there have been &gt;118 million confirmed cases, including &gt;2 million deaths. In this context, it has been shown that the psychological impact of the pandemic is important and that it can be associated with an increase in internet searches related to fear, anxiety, depression, as well as protective behaviours, health knowledge and even maladaptive behaviours. This is a systematic review. This review aims to collect, analyse and synthesise available evidence on novel data streams for surveillance purposes and/or their potential for capturing the public reaction to epidemic outbreaks, particularly focusing on mental health effects and emotions. At the end of the screening process, 19 articles were included in this systematic review. Our results show that the COVID-19 pandemic had a great impact on internet searches for mental health of entire populations, which manifests itself in a significant increase of depressed, anxious and stressed internet users' emotions. Novel data streams can support public health experts and policymakers in establishing priorities and setting up long-term strategies to mitigate symptoms and tackle mental health disorders.","Gianfredi, Provenzano, Santangelo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.06.024","20210805","Baidu; COVID-19; Google trends; Mental health; Novel data stream; Systematic review; Twitter; Weibo; YouTube","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16848,""
"Predicting COVID-19-related anxiety: The role of obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions, anxiety sensitivity, and body vigilance","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), first detected in December of 2019 and declared a global pandemic in March of 2020, continues to pose a serious threat to public health and safety worldwide. Many individuals report anxiety in response to this threat, and at high levels, such anxiety can result in adverse mental health outcomes and maladaptive behavioral responses that have consequences for the health of communities more broadly. Predictors of excessive anxiety in response to COVID-19 are understudied. Accordingly, the present study examined psychological factors that predict more intense COVID-19-related anxiety. 438 community members completed measures assessing COVID-19-related anxiety as well as psychological variables hypothesized to predict anxious responding to the threat of COVID-19. As expected, obsessive-compulsive symptoms related to contamination, the fear of arousal-related body sensations (i.e., anxiety sensitivity), and body vigilance each predicted more severe anxiety related to the pandemic. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms related to responsibility for causing harm also emerged as a predictor. Study limitations and implications are discussed.","Ojalehto, Abramowitz, Hellberg, Butcher, Buchholz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102460","20210805","Anxiety sensitivity; Body vigilance; COVID-19-related anxiety; Obsessive-compulsive symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16849,""
"Trends in psychological distress and COVID-19 incidence across 15 US metropolitan statistical areas in 2020","The United States experienced three surges of COVID-19 community infection since the World Health Organization declared the pandemic on March 11, 2020. The prevalence of psychological distress among U.S. adults increased from 11Ã‚Â % in 2019 to 35.9Ã‚Â % in April 2020 when New York City become the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Analyzing 21 waves of the Household Pulse Survey data collected between April 2020 and December 2020, this study aimed to examine the distress level in the 15 most populated metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our study found that, as the pandemic swept from East to South and soared in the West, 39.9%-52.3Ã‚Â % U.S. adults living in these 15 metropolitan areas reported symptoms of psychological distress. The highest distress levels were found within the Western areas including Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario (52.3Ã‚Â % in July 2020, 95Ã‚Â % CI: 44.9%-59.6Ã‚Â %) and Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim (49.9Ã‚Â % in December 2020, 95Ã‚Â % CI: 44.5%-55.4Ã‚Â %). The lowest distress level was observed in Washington-Arlington-Alexandria ranging from 29.1Ã‚Â % in May 2020 to 39.9Ã‚Â % in November 2020. COVID-19 and its complex ecology of social and economic stressors have engaged high levels of sustained psychological distress.

"Long-acting buprenorphine injectables: Opportunity to improve opioid use disorder treatment among rural populations","The opioid epidemic continues with escalating overdose deaths only exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, despite having efficacious medication treatments for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Most persons with OUD remain undiagnosed, without ever receiving MOUD, and even those who initiate MOUD, retention is infrequently longer than 6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months (Williams et al., 2019). Treatment access remains particularly problematic in rural areas (Ghertner, 2019). There are two new injectable long-acting buprenorphine formulations (LAB) that were recently approved in the United States and abroad (Lofwall et al., 2018, Walsh et al., 2017, Haight et al., 2019). They hold promise to improve treatment access and retention and may be particularly attractive during a pandemic in order to minimize provider and pharmacy contacts (Roberts et al., 2020) and help improve access to care in rural areas. There are several ongoing evaluations of these LAB injectables in large multi-site randomized clinical trials sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse in settings with special populations that exist in both urban and rural settings. Understanding the potential clinical benefits of these new LAB medications, with particular attention to how they can address unmet treatment needs within the care continuum is essential to successful implementation in the complex healthcare system.","Lofwall, Fanucchi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106756","20210805","Buprenorphine; Long-acting injectables; Opioid Use Disorder; Treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16851,""
"Anxious temperament and cyberchondria as mediated by fear of COVID-19 infection: A cross-sectional study","This study's main goal was to evaluate the association between anxious temperament and the fear of COVID-19-related self-infection and infection in loved ones (family members, friends, relatives) and cyberchondria. The sample consisted of 499 men and women aged between 18 and 72 who were gathered from the general population via an online recruitment platform. A numerical rating scale comprising 11 degrees of fear was used to assess participants' COVID-19-related fear, and affective temperaments were evaluated using Akiskal's Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A) scales. Cyberchondria was assessed using McElroy and Shevlin's Cyberchondria Severity Scale (CSS). Small to medium positive correlations were found between depressive, cyclothymic, irritable and anxious temperaments and cyberchondria and between depressive and anxious temperaments and COVID-19 fears. However, no correlation was observed between the hyperthymic temperament and cyberchondria. Cyberchondria positively correlated with both COVID-19 fears scales, though the correlation coefficients were medium. Based on the results of linear regression analysis, only anxious temperament and COVID-19 fear of self-infection were significant predictors of cyberchondria. The analysis also revealed a significant indirect effect of anxious temperament on cyberchondria through fear of COVID-19 self-infection as a mediator between anxious temperament and cyberchondria.","Oniszczenko","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255750","20210805","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16852,""
"Primary care-based screening and management of depression amongst heavy drinking patients: Interim secondary outcomes of a three-country quasi-experimental study in Latin America","Implementation of evidence-based care for heavy drinking and depression remains low in global health systems. We tested the impact of providing community support, training, and clinical packages of varied intensity on depression screening and management for heavy drinking patients in Latin American primary healthcare. Quasi-experimental study involving 58 primary healthcare units in Colombia, Mexico and Peru randomized to receive: (1) usual care (control); (2) training using a brief clinical package; (3) community support plus training using a brief clinical package; (4) community support plus training using a standard clinical package. Outcomes were proportion of: (1) heavy drinking patients screened for depression; (2) screen-positive patients receiving appropriate support; (3) all consulting patients screened for depression, irrespective of drinking status. 550/615 identified heavy drinkers were screened for depression (89.4%). 147/230 patients screening positive for depression received appropriate support (64%). Amongst identified heavy drinkers, adjusting for country, sex, age and provider profession, provision of community support and training had no impact on depression activity rates. Intensity of clinical package also did not affect delivery rates, with comparable performance for brief and standard versions. However, amongst all consulting patients, training providers resulted in significantly higher rates of alcohol measurement and in turn higher depression screening rates; 2.7 times higher compared to those not trained. Training using a brief clinical package increased depression screening rates in Latin American primary healthcare.

"Mental health during the first wave of COVID-19 in Canada, the USA, Brazil and Italy","The mental health (MH) burden on healthcare practitioners (HCPs) is emerging as a significant cost of the pandemic, although few studies have compared the MH of HCPs in different countries. A link to an online survey was posted in the Spring of 2020 which included questions regarding perceived impact of the pandemic; current MH symptom severity and impairment was evaluated using validated scales. Overall, 1315 individuals (74% female, mean age: 42.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.4) in Canada, the United States, Brazil and Italy completed the survey. Nearly 26% met diagnostic thresholds for GAD and MDD; Italian respondents reported the lowest rates of disorder. Except for Canada, non-HCPs in each country reported higher symptom severity than HCPs. Amongst the HCPs, Canadian HCPs reported the highest rates of anxiety and depression as well as increases in alcohol and cannabis use, lower levels of perceived emotional support and more worry about themselves or their loved ones contracting COVID-19. Despite key infrastructural and COVID-19 mortality differences between the countries, the MH effects appeared to be quite similar. HCPs, with the exception of Canada, reported less impact on their mental health compared to the general population, suggesting resilience in the face of adversity.Key pointsRates of current mental health disorders were similar across Canada, the USA and Brazil but lower in Italy, yet much higher than pre-pandemic ratesNon-Healthcare Practitioners (HCPs) reported significantly higher severity on all MH scales in the overall sample.

"Experience of and Worry About Discrimination, Social Media Use, and Depression Among Asians in the US During COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Survey Study","The outbreak of COVID-19 has spurred increasing anti-Asian racism and xenophobia in the United States, which might be detrimental to the psychological well-being of Asian people. We studied three discrimination-related variables, including experience of discrimination, worry about discrimination, and racism-related social media use during COVID-19 among Asians in the United States. We examined how the three variables were related to depression, and how the association between racism-related social media use and depression was moderated by personal experience of and worry about racial discrimination. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. A total of 209 people (Mage = 33.69, SD = 11.31; 45.93% female) who identified themselves as Asian and were residing in the United States were included in the study. The results indicated that experience of discrimination (ÃŽÂ² = .33, P = .001) and racism-related social media use (ÃŽÂ² = .14, P = .045) were positively associated with depressive symptoms. Worry about discrimination (ÃŽÂ² = .13, P = .14) was not associated with depression. Worry about discrimination moderated the relationship between racism-related social media use and depression (ÃŽÂ² = -.25, P = .003), such that the positive relationship was found among those who had a low and medium level of worry. The present study provided preliminary evidence that experience of discrimination during COVID-19 was a risk factor of depressive symptoms among Asian people in the United States. Meanwhile, racism-related social media use was found to be negatively associated with the welling of US Asians, and the relationship between social media use and depression was significantly moderated by worry about discrimination. It is critical to develop accessible programs to help US Asians cope with racial discrimination both in real lives and on social media during this unprecedented health crisis, especially among those who haven't been mentally prepared for such challenges.","Pan, Yang, Tsai, Dong","https://doi.org/10.2196/29024","20210805","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16855,""
"Provider perspectives on delivering dialectical behavior therapy via telehealth during COVID-19 in the Department of Veterans Affairs","Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based psychotherapy (EBP) for repeated suicidal and nonsuicidal self-injury and Borderline Personality Disorder. There has been little research on the effectiveness or implementation of DBT via telehealth. However, literature has demonstrated that other EBPs delivered via telehealth are just as effective as in person. DBT differs from these EBPs in complexity, inclusion of group sessions, length of treatment, and focus on individuals at high risk for suicide. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused mental health care services across the country and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to transition to telehealth to reduce infection risk for patients and providers. This transition offered an opportunity to learn about implementing DBT via telehealth on a national scale. We conducted a survey of DBT team points of contact in VA (<i>N</i> = 32) to gather information about how DBT via telehealth was being implemented, challenges and solutions, and provider perceptions. The majority reported that their site continued offering the modes of DBT via telehealth that they had offered in person. The predominant types of challenges in transitioning to telehealth were related to technology on the provider and patient side. Despite challenges, most providers reported their experience was better than expected and had positive perceptions of patient acceptability. Skills group was the more difficult mode to provide via telehealth. Providers endorsed needing additional tools (e.g., means to get diary card data electronically). Multiple benefits of DBT via telehealth were identified, such as addressing barriers to care including distance, transportation issues, and caregiving and work responsibilities.

"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices Toward SARS-COV-2 Infection in the United Arab Emirates Population: An Online Community-Based Cross-Sectional Survey","Population's preventive practices and self-isolation is determinantal in the prevention and mitigation. This study explored the adult population's knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 in UAE between the 4th and 14th of April 2020. The study was a community-based, cross-sectional study using a self-administered electronic questionnaire covering five different aspects: demographics, knowledge, practice, attitude, source, and trust of information, and a patient health questionnaire (PHQ-2) for depression screening. Results were analyzed using frequencies, cross-tabulation, and regression analysis. A total of 1,867 people responded to the survey. The mean age of participants was 36.0 years S.D. 10.8. Males were 19.3% and female (80.7%). Knowledge was significantly better in people with higher educational levels (B 0.17, <i>P-value</i> &lt; 0.001), good preventive practice (B 0.12, <i>P-value</i> &lt; 0.001), and higher perceived risk scores (B 0.053, <i>P-value</i> = 0.025). The best practice scores were shown by participants with older age (B 0.097, <i>P-value</i> &lt; 0.05), with good knowledge (B 0.086, <i>P-value</i> &lt; 0.05), were of non-UAE nationalities (B -0.08, <i>P-value</i> &lt; 0.05), with jobs that cannot be practiced from home, military and health care employees (B -0.104, <i>P-value</i> &lt; 0.05), had a personal history of contact with COVID-19 patients (B 0.053, <i>P-value</i> &lt; 0.05), higher educational levels (B 0.052, <i>P-value</i> &lt; 0.05), and a positive attitude toward taking a vaccine (B 0.088, <i>P-value</i> &lt; 0.05). Depression risk was significantly higher in men, non-UAE nationals, in those with lower knowledge scores, and younger ages. The most followed practices were staying home, handwashing, avoiding social gatherings, limiting three people per vehicle, and avoiding public transportation. The least practiced measures were covering the face while sneezing or coughing and wearing masks. Although staying home was reported by 92.5% of participants, 22.6% mentioned that they were visited by more than two people and visited others in 18.4% during the last week. Social media was the source of information for 82.1% of the participants and most trusted doctors and healthcare providers. Depression risk was present in 18.9% of the participants, and most respondents (89%) agreed that SARS-COV-2 infection would be finally be successfully controlled. An encouraging finding is the willingness of two-third of the participants (64.5%) to take the COVID-19 vaccine and if it was developed, although it was very early in the pandemic. Only 14.6% said they would not take the vaccine, and 20.9% were not sure. The obtained results on knowledge and practices, although satisfactory, could be insufficient to prevent this pandemic from being contained. Therefore, we recommend the intensification of awareness programs and good practices. In addition, mental health is an area worth further studies.","Alremeithi, Alghefli, Almadhani, Baynouna AlKetbi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.687628","20210805","SARS-CoV-2 infection; attitude; knowledge; practices; preventive measures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16858,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Lifestyles and Quality of Life of Women With Fertility Problems: A Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has implied worldwide the imposition of confinement measures and mobility restrictions, to a greater or lesser extent. It has also meant the closure of some public medical services such as reproductive care. This situation may have impacted the health-related behaviour and quality of life of women with fertility problems. <b>Objective:</b> The objective of this study was to analyse the effects of confinement and the suspension of reproductive medical care on the lifestyle (diet, physical exercise, and smoking habits), anxiety and depression, and quality of life of infertile women by comparing their pre- and post-confinement situations. <b>Methods:</b> We carried out a cross-sectional, internet-based study. Information was collected on these women's adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MEDAS questionnaire), physical exercise (IPAQ-SF), anxiety and depression (HADS), and quality of life related to fertility (FertiQol) before, during, and after confinement. The survey was conducted between 1 September and 28 October 2020. <b>Results:</b> A total of 85 women participated. There had been a significant increase in anxiety and depression levels (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and an increase in tobacco consumption among female smokers during confinement vs. pre-confinement (62.5% had increased their consumption). The participants had also increased the mean number of hours they spent sitting (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). There had also been an increase in vigorous and moderate exercise levels by 40 and 30%, respectively (<i>P</i> = 0.004). However, no differences were observed in these patients' eating habits as a result of confinement (<i>P</i> = 0.416). When the reproduction service was resumed, the participants showed higher anxiety level scores (<i>P</i> = 0.001) with respect to the pre-confinement situation as well as lower mean FertiQol scale score (<i>P</i> = 0.008). <b>Conclusions:</b> Confinement had increased anxiety and depression levels among these infertile women as well as tobacco use among the participants who were smokers.

"Factors Associated With Preference of Psychological Intervention and Mental Status Among Chinese Teachers During Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Large Cross-Sectional Survey","<b>Aims:</b> The authors sought to explore the psychological distress of teachers during COVID-19 pandemic and their preference for psychological intervention. The overarching goal was to gain insight on how to build an effective psychological support system for teachers during and after the pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> The mental health condition of teachers (<i>N</i> = 18,521) was assessed online by using a questionnaire consisting of standard instruments PHQ-15, GAD-7, PHQ-2, PC-PTSD, and additional questions about sleep disturbance, suicidality and preference of psychological intervention methods. <b>Results:</b> 35.5% of Chinese teachers reported sleep disturbance, 25.3% complained somatic discomfort, 17.7% had anxiety symptoms, 4.0% had depression, 2.8% had self-injury or suicidal thoughts. Women are more likely to have somatic symptoms, sleep disturbance and depression. There were age differences for anxiety, somatic symptoms and suicidal thoughts. High percentages of university teachers reported moderate to severe anxiety, somatic symptoms, depression and sleep disturbance. The most preferred psychological intervention is the self-practice of stress management skills (<i>N</i> = 11,477, 62.0%). Teachers with moderate and severe symptoms are more likely in need of hotline and online counseling and those with serious suicidal thoughts are three times more likely to use a telephone hotline. <b>Conclusions:</b> During the COVID-19 outbreak, the major reported psychological distresses among Chinese teachers are anxiety, sleep disturbance and somatic symptoms. There were gender, age and school setting differences. Females, teachers over 45 years old and those who work at universities tend to be more vulnerable. Different teachers chose different interventions, mostly based on the severity of their symptoms.","Lizhi, Peng, Wanhong, Shengmei, Lingjiang, Li, Xiaoping, Weihui","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.704010","20210805","COVID-19; anxiety; mental health; psychological intervention; sleep disturbance; teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16860,""
"The Impact of the SARS-COV-2 Pandemic on the Mental Health and Employment Decisions of Medical Students in North China","<b>Background:</b> The outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) has led to long periods of social isolation for individuals across the world. Although medical students generally have a high prevalence of mental health problems, they have received less attention than other groups concerning the impact of SARS-COV-2. Therefore, the present study investigated the mental health status, risk factors, and protective factors for mental health problems in medical students in North China during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> A WeChat-based survey, which included the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 and measures of social demographics, was performed twice. Risk and protective factors were identified by binary logistic regression analysis. <b>Results:</b> A total of 702 effective questionnaires were collected in two separate surveys. In total, 24.55% of medical students were suffering anxiety to different degrees of severity, 13.18% were suffering depression in the first survey, and 3.71% wanted to give up working in primary medical care during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic in the second survey. In contrast, during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, a risk factor for anxiety and depression was gender which is male, while being knowledgeable about the SARS-COV-2 pandemic and having a lower academic burden were both protective factors. <b>Conclusions:</b> Measures are required to prevent increases in mental health problems in medical students. Our findings suggest that increasing knowledge about the SARS-COV-2 pandemic and reducing academic burden in medical students is extremely important during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic.","Gao, Jiao, Bi, Huang, Wang, Zhang, Fang, Han, Fan, Wang, Lv, Li, Hu, Zhang, Qiao, Zhao, Li, Xiao, Chang, Bai","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.641138","20210805","SARS-CoV-2; academic burden; anxiety; medical career; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16861,""
"Emergent Crisis of COVID-19 Pandemic: Mental Health Challenges and Opportunities","Mental health is a fundamental human right and is part of the well-being of society. The public health burden of mental health disorders affects people's social and economic status around the world. Coronavirus's (COVID-19) negative impact on the economy and mental health worldwide is concerning. This is a worldwide emergency, and there is an urgent need for research about this topic to prevent long-lasting adverse effects on the population. Unpreparedness and inconsistencies in guidelines, lockdowns, containment strategies, unemployment, financial losses, physical distancing, isolation, chaos, and uncertainty are among factors that lead to a rise in emotional distress, anxiety, and depression. Governments' decisions affect the socioeconomic status of a country and the psychological well-being of the people. COVID-19 pandemic exposed disparities in multiple mental health care systems by having adverse mental health effects in people with pre-existing mental health disorders and previously healthy individuals. Aggregation of concurrent or cumulative comorbid risk factors for COVID-19 disease and its psychosocial sequelae could provide invaluable information for the public health stakeholders. This review aims to address the burden and the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenges and opportunities facing mental health systems, and proposes new strategies to improve the mental health outcomes in the post-COVID era.","Radfar, Ferreira, Sosa, Filip","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.631008","20210805","COVID-19; economic crisis; mental health; mental health services; pandemic; policy development; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16862,""
"Prevalence and Predictors of Prolonged Cognitive and Psychological Symptoms Following COVID-19 in the United States","Little is known regarding the prevalence and predictors of prolonged cognitive and psychological symptoms of COVID-19 among community-dwellers. We aimed to quantitatively measure self-reported metrics of fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and sleep and identify factors associated with these metrics among United States residents with or without COVID-19. We solicited 1000 adult United States residents for an online survey conducted February 3-5, 2021 utilizing a commercial crowdsourcing community research platform. The platform curates eligible participants to approximate United States demographics by age, sex, and race proportions. COVID-19 was diagnosed by laboratory testing and/or by exposure to a known positive contact with subsequent typical symptoms. Prolonged COVID-19 was self-reported and coded for those with symptoms Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1 month following initial diagnosis. The primary outcomes were NIH PROMIS/Neuro-QoL short-form T-scores for fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and sleep compared among those with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms, COVID-19 without prolonged symptoms and COVID-19 negative subjects. Multivariable backwards step-wise logistic regression models were constructed to predict abnormal Neuro-QoL metrics. Among 999 respondents, the average age was 45 years (range 18-84), 49% were male, 76 (7.6%) had a history of COVID-19 and 19/76 (25%) COVID-19 positive participants reported prolonged symptoms lasting a median of 4 months (range 1-13). Prolonged COVID-19 participants were more often younger, female, Hispanic, and had a history of depression/mood/thought disorder (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). They experienced significantly higher rates of unemployment and financial insecurity, and their symptoms created greater interference with work and household activities compared to other COVID-19 status groups (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). After adjusting for demographics, past medical history and stressor covariates in multivariable logistic regression analysis, COVID-19 status was independently predictive of worse Neuro-QoL cognitive dysfunction scores (adjusted OR 11.52, 95% CI 1.01-2.28, <i>P</i> = 0.047), but there were no significant differences in quantitative measures of anxiety, depression, fatigue, or sleep. Prolonged symptoms occurred in 25% of COVID-19 positive participants, and NeuroQoL cognitive dysfunction scores were significantly worse among COVID-19 positive subjects, even after accounting for demographic and stressor covariates. Fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep scores did not differ between COVID-19 positive and negative respondents.","Frontera, Lewis, Melmed, Lin, Kondziella, Helbok, Yaghi, Meropol, Wisniewski, Balcer, Galetta","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2021.690383","20210805","COVID-19; Community Dwellers; cognitive; long-hauler; post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection; stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16863,""
"Mental Well-Being and Self-Efficacy of Healthcare Workers in Saudi Arabia During the COVID-19 Pandemic","To assess mental well-being (MW), self-efficacy (SE), and their predictors among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analytical cross-sectional study recruited 1046 HCWs by cluster random sampling technique. Socio-demographic, health, and occupational characteristics were collected for all participants. The WHO five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) were used to assess MW and SE of the participants, respectively. The binary logistic regression model was fit to the dependent (outcomes), namely mental well-being and self-efficacy, and independent other variables (predictors). Out of all participants (n=1046), 27.2% had negative MW scores, and 36.6% had low SE scores. The mean scores of both MW and SE were in the normal levels (16.7Ã‚Â±5.90 and 31.5Ã‚Â±6.63 out of 25 and 40, respectively). Younger and older ages, irregular exercise, nursing professions, history of anxiety and/or depression, lesser years of experience, and longer daily working hours were found to be the main predictors of negative MW and low SE, among study participants. Mental well-being (MW) and self-efficacy (SE) of the HCWs in Saudi Arabia are satisfactory but attention should be paid towards supporting the vulnerable groups for promoting the resilience of HCWs during the battle against the current pandemic.","Abo-Ali, Al-Rubaki, Lubbad, Nchoukati, Alqahtani, Albraim, Ghareeb, Al-Haffashi, Alghamdi, Zaytoun","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S320421","20210805","COVID-19; Saudi Arabia; healthcare workers; mental well-being; predictors; self-efficacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16864,""
"Stress-related emotional and behavioural impact following the first COVID-19 outbreak peak","The COVID-19 pandemic poses multiple psychologically stressful challenges and is associated with an increased risk for mental illness. Previous studies have focused on the psychopathological symptoms associated with the outbreak peak. Here, we examined the behavioural and mental-health impact of the pandemic in Israel using an online survey, during the six weeks encompassing the end of the first outbreak and the beginning of the second. We used clinically validated instruments to assess anxiety- and depression-related emotional distress, symptoms, and coping strategies, as well as questions designed to specifically assess COVID-19-related concerns. Higher emotional burden was associated with being female, younger, unemployed, living in high socioeconomic status localities, having prior medical conditions, encountering more people, and experiencing physiological symptoms. Our findings highlight the environmental context and its importance in understanding individual ability to cope with the long-term stressful challenges of the pandemic.","Benjamin, Kuperman, Eren, Rotkopf, Amitai, Rossman, Shilo, Meir, Keshet, Nuttman-Shwartz, Segal, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01219-6","20210805","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16865,""
"Deep graph neural network-based prediction of acute suicidal ideation in young adults","Precise remote evaluation of both suicide risk and psychiatric disorders is critical for suicide prevention as well as for psychiatric well-being. Using questionnaires is an alternative to labor-intensive diagnostic interviews in a large general population, but previous models for predicting suicide attempts suffered from low sensitivity. We developed and validated a deep graph neural network model that increased the prediction sensitivity of suicide risk in young adults (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°17,482 for training; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14,238 for testing) using multi-dimensional questionnaires and suicidal ideation within 2Ã‚Â weeks as the prediction target. The best model achieved a sensitivity of 76.3%, specificity of 83.4%, and an area under curve of 0.878 (95% confidence interval, 0.855-0.899). We demonstrated that multi-dimensional deep features covering depression, anxiety, resilience, self-esteem, and clinico-demographic information contribute to the prediction of suicidal ideation. Our model might be useful for the remote evaluation of suicide risk in the general population of young adults for specific situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Choi, Kim, Kim, Jeon, Kim, Jang, Jeong","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95102-7","20210805","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16866,""
"COVID-19 restrictions and age-specific mental health-US probability-based panel evidence","Social distancing, self-isolation, quarantining, and lockdowns arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have been common restrictions as governments have attempted to limit the rapid virus transmission. In this study, we identified drivers of adverse mental and behavioral health during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether factors such as social isolation and various restrictions serve as additional stressors for different age groups. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted on a unique dataset based on a national probability-based survey dedicated to understanding the impact of COVID-19 in the U.S., which includes 19 questions on the individual impact of restrictions, bans, and closures. The analysis used a moderate distress scale built on five questions related to mental health for 3,646 respondents. The mental health of young adults (18-34 years old) was the most affected by restrictions, while that of older adults (&gt;55 years old) was less affected. In addition, demographic and health characteristics associated with differences in mental health varied by age group. The findings in this analysis highlight the differential mental health needs of different age groups and point to the marked necessity for differentiated and targeted responses to the mental health effects of COVID-19 by age group.","Sojli, Tham, Bryant, McAleer","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01537-x","20210805","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16867,""

"Adolescentsâ€™ symptoms of anxiety and depression before and during the Covid-19 outbreak â€“ A prospective population-based study of teenagers in Norway","Background Lockdown policies related to the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic has potential negative consequences for mental health in youths. Methods Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed in 3 572 adolescents, age 13 to 16 using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-10), in a representative longitudinal survey of Norwegian youths between February 2019 (T1) and June 2020 (T2). Predictors for symptom change were analysed with linear mixed-effects models. Findings Overall, clinical levels of anxiety and depression increased slightly from 5.5% at T1 to 6.3% at T2; Chi square 224.4 (df = 1), p<.001. However, the observed change was driven by the increase in age between assessments. Being a girl, having pre-existing mental health problems, and living in a single-parent household at T1, predicted higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms at T2 (p<.001). Living in a single-parent household was associated with a significant increase in symptoms, also when age was controlled for (p<.001). Living in a poor family however, or having a history of maltreatment, was associated with a significantly lower increase in symptoms (p<.001). Interpretation Anxiety and depressive symptoms increased slightly in Norwegian youths between 2019 and 2020, but this change seemed to be driven by increase in age rather than pandemic-related measures. Symptom levels were unevenly distributed across demographic groups both before and during the pandemic outbreak, indicating that health disparities persist for adolescents in risk groups during a pandemic . Health inequities related to living conditions need to be addressed in future action plans, and intensified measures to mitigate inequities are needed. Funding The study was funded by the Norwegian Directorate for Children, Adolescents and Family affairs (Bufdir).","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanepe.2021.100093","20210601","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-06","",16872,""
