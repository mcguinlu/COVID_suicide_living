"The effectiveness of virtual cognitive-behavioral group therapy on anxiety, stress, and fatigue in Coronavirus Intensive Care Unit nurses","BACKGROUND: Managing the anxiety, stress, and fatigue of health care workers is of particular importance in improving health services. In nurses, there are stressful attitudes toward the prevalence of COVID-19, which has significant effects on patient care. The study aimed study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual cognitive-behavioral group therapy on anxiety, stress, and fatigue in nurses of the COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study was performed with pretest/post-test design with a control group. The study population consisted of nurses of Sina Hospital in Tehran, Iran. The study sample consisted of 40 nurses working in this hospital who were selected by the available sampling method and 20 people were randomly assigned to the experimental group and 20 to the control group. The experimental group participated for 10 sessions in virtual group therapy sessions through Adobe Connect software, while the control group did not receive any intervention. Data collection tools were Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), Expanded Nursing Stress Scale (ENSS), and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) which were completed electronically by participants. The collected data were analyzed by multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) with SPSS software version 21 (IBM;Armonk, NY, USA). RESULTS: The results showed that there was a significant difference between the mean scores of the experimental and control groups in the post-test, and cognitive-behavioral therapy significantly reduced anxiety, stress, and fatigue in the COVID-19 intensive care unit nurses (P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive-behavioral group therapy reduced anxiety, stress, and fatigue in nurses working in intensive care units with COVID-19.

"Mental Health Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Ontario's Youth: A Cross-Sectional Study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health and wellbeing of Ontario's youth. Our study investigated the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on the pediatric population of Ontario, using a survey derived from the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) system to identify children who may benefit from seeking professional help. Our cross-sectional study examined the potential risk factors that contributed to worsening mental health and wellbeing in children, including changes in sleep patterns, appetite, and physical activity levels, as well as the diagnosis of a family member with COVID-19. Our study found that 24%, 9.4%, and 15.5% of participants exhibited symptoms of depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), respectively, according to the RCADS system. Furthermore, there were significant associations between the presence of symptoms and the diagnosis of a family member with COVID-19 or a frontline worker in the family. This suggests a need to create interventions to support the families of frontline workers and those directly affected by a COVID-19 diagnosis.","Hamid, M. A.; Qureshi, A.

"Masculinity Barriers to Ever Completing Colorectal Cancer Screening among American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, and White Men (Ages 45â€“75)","Disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality among White, Black, and American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) men are attributable to differences in early detection screening. Determining how masculinity barriers influence CRC screening completion is critical for cancer prevention and control. To determine whether masculinity barriers to medical care are associated with lower rates of ever completing CRC screening, a survey-based study was employed from December 2020â€“January 2021 among 435 White, Black, and AIAN men (aged 45â€“75) who resided in the US. Logistic regression models were fit to four Masculinity Barriers to Medical Care subscales predicting ever completing CRC screening. For all men, being strong was associated with 54% decreased odds of CRC screening completion (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.94);each unit increase in negative attitudes toward medical professionals and exams decreased the odds of ever completing CRC screening by 57% (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.86). Black men who scored higher on negativity toward medical professionals and exams had decreased odds of ever screening. Consideration of masculinity in future population-based and intervention research is critical for increasing menâ€™s participation in CRC screening, with more salience for Black men.","Rogers, Charles R.; Perdue, David G.; Boucher, Kenneth, Korous, Kevin M.; Brooks, Ellen, Petersen, Ethan, Inadomi, John M.; Tuuhetaufa, Fa, Levant, Ronald F.; Paskett, Electra D.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19053071","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(5):3071, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28582,""
"A Fire Revealing Coastal Norwayâ€™s Wildlandâ€“Urban Interface Challenges and Possible Low-Cost Sustainable Solutions","The Calluna vulgaris L. that dominated coastal heathlands of Western Europe were for millennia managed by regular burning cycles for improved grazing. Most places in Norway this practice has, however, been neglected over the last 5â€“7 decades, resulting in accumulation of above ground biomass including degenerated Calluna and successional fire-prone species, e.g., native juniper (Juniperus communis) and exotic blacklisted Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). Today, in dry periods, the heathland represents a fire threat to the increasing number of homes in the wildlandâ€“urban interface (WUI), as exemplified by the June 2021 Sotra Island WUI fire. The fire burned 700 ha of encroached heathlands, destroyed three buildings, and threatened settlements. In the present study, the Sotra fire was investigated to understand the fire development and analyse possible risk reducing measures. Photographic material obtained during the fire, weather conditions prior to and during the fire, involved fire fuel, fire spread mechanisms, firefighting response, and possible consequences under slightly changed circumstances were analysed. Compared to previous fires in coastal Norway, the Sotra fire represents a step change in fire development including, e.g., pyrocumulus-like clouds, fire whirls, and fire spread 270 m across a fjord. Preventive measures based on the local context are analysed, including engaging voluntary communities to remove fire-prone fuel, e.g., juniper and Sitka, to create defensible space. Moreover, strategic fire breaks in the terrain, e.g., well-managed heathland strengthening existing fuel breaks, e.g., lakes, cultivated fields, naked rock, and roads, are recommended. Mechanical cutting is suggested as a short-term measure while fenceless grazing may represent a long-term solution to prevent regrowth. During a period of record high energy prices, this may provide free of charge firewood and make way for future local food production, in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, while reducing the fire risk.","Log, Torgrim, Gjedrem, Anna Marie","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19053038","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(5):3038, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28583,""

The aim of this study was to assess whether loneliness mediates the relationship between perceived stress and the severity of depressive symptoms in the studied sample of parents. This cross-sectional study involved 39 parents of autistic children and 45 parents of non-autistic children. They completed a set of tests: a survey on sociodemographic and clinical data and psychometric questionnaires, i.e., Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI), De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJGLS), and Perceived Stress Questionnaire (KPS). A rise in external and intrapsychic stress, independently, was linked to a rise in the severity of depressive symptoms. The severity of depression, loneliness and stress was higher among parents of autistic children compared with parents of non-autistic children. Intrapsychic stress exhibited an indirect effect through loneliness on the worsening of depressive symptoms.","Kasper, Sipowicz, Pietras, Tadeusz, Podlecka, Marlena, Mokros, Lukasz","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19053019","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(5):3019, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28584,""
"Understanding the Economic Value and Impacts on Informal Carers of People Living with Mental Health Conditions","Informal carers play a vital role in supporting people living with mental health conditions, but comparatively little is known about the economic value of caring. This study undertook an online survey of adult informal carers supporting adults with mental health conditions to better understand the impacts of caring on carer quality of life, levels of loneliness, finances and employment, as well as estimate the economic value of time spent caring. In total, 712 carers participated in the multi-national survey between August 2019 and April 2020. A total of 17% were male, with a mean age of 53, and 68% supported a child living with a mental health condition. A total of 56% of care recipients were male, with a mean age of 37. Adverse impacts on quality of life, loneliness and personal finances were greatest in carers living with care recipients. Overall mean weekly hours of care were 43.42, rising to 65.41 for carers living with care recipients. Mean weekly costs of care per carer ranged from â‚¬660 to â‚¬2223 depending on living arrangements. Annual costs ranged between â‚¬34,960 and â‚¬125,412, depending on living arrangements and valuation method.

"Barriers and Facilitators to Mental Health Help-Seeking among Young Adults in Saudi Arabia: A Qualitative Study","While young Saudi adults are reportedly prone to experiencing a variety of mental health problems, they tend to delay seeking mental health support. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators of seeking mental health support among young adults in Saudi Arabia. A qualitative research design was implemented using semi-structured interviews with 12 young adult participants in Saudi Arabia, recruited through social media platforms, and the interviews were then analyzed using thematic analysis. Two major themes emerged: barriers that impede the process of mental health help-seeking and facilitators that assist individuals in seeking mental health support. The barriers included public stigma and lack of awareness, unprofessional mental health practitioners, lack of accessibility to services and information, unsupportive families, intrapersonal dilemmas, and misconceptions based on religious beliefs. Facilitators of help-seeking included increasing societal and family awareness, promoting the accessibility of services, enhancing sources of external support, personal motivation to change, and online therapy. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of promoting mental health literacy among the Saudi public, particularly with regard to young adults and their unique mental health needs. Exploring facilitators and barriers may also assist mental health providers in developing tailored mental health campaigns and interventions directed at young adults.","Noorwali, Robena, Almotairy, Sarah, Akhder, Raneem, Ghadi, Mahmoud, Sharif, Loujain, Alasmee, Nofaa, Mahsoon, Alaa, Hafez, Duaa","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052848","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(5):2848, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28586,""

This cross-sectional study was based on 277 participants, i.e., patients with current major depressive episode (MDE), n = 104, and participants without current MDE, n = 173. Participants answered the Malay QIDS-SR16 and were administered the validated Malay Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) for DSM-IV-TR. Factor analysis was used to determine construct validity, alpha statistic for internal consistency, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for concurrent validity with MINI to determine the optimal threshold to identify MDE. Data analysis provided evidence for the unidimensionality of the Malay QIDS-SR16 with good internal consistency (Cronbachâ€™s a = 0.88). Based on ROC analysis, the questionnaire demonstrated good validity with a robust area under the curve of 0.916 (p &lt; 0.000, 95% CI 0.884â€“0.948).

"An Internet-Based Multi-Approach Intervention Targeting University Students Suffering from Psychological Problems: Design, Implementation, and Evaluation","Despite the widespread prevalence of mental health problems, most psychological distress remains untreated. Internet-based psychological interventions can be an essential tool for increasing treatment availability and accessibility. The main objective of the MindBlooming project is to design and implement an innovative Internet-based multi-approach treatment for university students suffering from psychological or physical problems. The intervention will focus on symptoms of depression, anxiety, sleep problems, self-destructive thoughts, job- and study-related stress and burnout, and chronic pain. It will be based on different approaches, primarily psychoeducation, Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment (CBT), and third-wave CBT. At the end of the treatment, user satisfaction and usability will be assessed. In addition, two further aims will be evaluating the treatment efficacy through a randomized controlled trial and tuning a predictive model through Machine Learning techniques. The intervention consists of a 7-week treatment on two problematic areas according to each studentsâ€™ personal needs, identified through an initial assessment. Besides the treatment assigned following the initial screening, participants will also be assigned to a different module to improve their relational skills. The treatment, which can be accessed through a mobile app, consists of psychoeducational videos followed by related exercises.

This pilot study sought to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of an innovative application of an already established health-promotion interventionâ€”Happy Older Latinos are Active (HOLA)â€”among this marginalized population. Eighteen self-identified Latino men with an undetectable HIV viral load and documented risk of cardiometabolic disease participated in this study. Although the attrition rate of 22% was higher than expected, participants attended 77% of the sessions and almost 95% of the virtual walks. Participants reported high satisfaction with the intervention, as evident by self-report quantitative (CSQ-8;M = 31, SD = 1.5) and qualitative metrics. Participants appreciated bonding with the community health worker and their peers to reduce social isolation. Results indicate that the HOLA intervention is an innovative way of delivering a health promotion intervention adapted to meet the diverse needs and circumstances of OLLWH, is feasible and acceptable, and has the potential to have positive effects on the health of OLLWH.","Jimenez, Daniel E.; Weinstein, Elliott R.; Batsis, John A.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052667","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(5):2667, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28589,""

Meta-analyzing the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) revealed a preliminary random effect of 1.399 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.272â€“1.527, suggesting highly effective treatment of IA/IGD. After adjusting for the confounding risks of age, publication year, type of subjects, and type of study, this study revealed that combining pharmacotherapy with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or multi-level counseling (MLC) was the most effective treatment option. Using a scale of time spent online or a severity of IA symptoms scale was a more effective measurement, with p-values = 0.006 and 0.002, respectively. IA/IGD patients with comorbid depression showed worse outcomes than youth with another comorbidity. The corresponding model goodness-of-fit indices were t2 = 1.188;I2-Residual = 89.74%;and Adjusted-R2 = 16.10%. This systematic review indicates that pharmacotherapy combined with CBT or MLC might be an effective therapeutic strategy for youth with gaming disorder.","Chang, Chuan-Hsin, Chang, Yue-Cune, Yang, Luke, Ruu-Fen, Tzang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052612","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(5):2612, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28590,""
"Impact of Natural Disasters on Mental Health: A Cross-Sectional Study Based on the 2014 China Family Panel Survey","Mental health problems are a leading cause of disability in both developed and developing countries, and the consequences of mental health disorders for individuals, families, and society as a whole could be severe and costly. To supplement relevant research and provide insightful policy suggestions to families, government and societies, this study investigates the nexus between natural disasters and mental health for middle-aged and older adults in rural China. Based on data of 8721 observations from the 2014 China Family Panel Studies, we estimate the effects of natural disasters on mental health using ordinary least squares and propensity score matching. Our findings suggest that natural disasters have a significant negative effect on middle-aged and older adultsâ€™ mental health in the case of rural China. This effect is heterogeneous depending on individualsâ€™ education level and their agricultural production status. Finally, individualsâ€™ happiness and life satisfaction are shown to be the potential mechanism through which the effect of natural disasters on mental health operates.","Zhang, Rui, Zhang, Yunzhi, Dai, Zhe","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19052511","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(5):2511, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28591,""

"Whine and dust: coping during the pandemic using companioning autoethnographic art-based research (Special Issue: Art-based research in health and well-being during the pandemic)","As collaborators from different nationalities, genders, cultural backgrounds, occupations and age cohorts, in this article the researchers present an account of our art-based research during the COVID-19 pandemic. The project employed art practice as a way to deal with the noxious effects of isolation on our mental health and well-being during the many prolonged lockdowns in Melbourne, Australia. With reference to Warren Lett's concept of companioning, in our ongoing companioning dialogue through poetry and paintings, together with a final song, the researchers explore our psychological struggles. This contribution can be read in several ways: as an example of our research into art practice, as an artistic companioning dialogue between two writers and friends trying to make sense of and survive isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and finally, as an offer, an invitation to explore art as a cathartic and coping process in a companioning process, which the researchers have termed companioning autoethnography.","D..rner Alvarez, J.

"Social distancing without emotional distancing? (Special Issue: Art-based research in health and well-being during the pandemic)","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every aspect of society and no more so than in educational applications of theatre for children in schools. This article explores the complexities of what applied theatre/drama offer the young to think critically and develop empathetic human relationships crucial to sound mental health. The article's authors reaffirm ways in which applied theatre/drama and TIE have contributed to healthy social development through contributions to the Personal, Social and Health Education curriculum. Cited are recent projects with compromised praxis in the face of the pandemic. Identified is a shift in educational priorities that are returning to traditional approaches in place of wider heuristic social education. Consequent moves to online teaching and imposition of social distancing has led to concerning levels of social distancing potentially impacting negatively on mental health of the young.

"Experiences of care for self-harm in the emergency department: the perspectives of patients, carers and practitioners","Emergency departments are often the point of entry to the healthcare system for people who self-harm, and these individuals are at high risk of further self-harm and suicide in the post-discharge period. These settings therefore provide a critical opportunity for intervention. However, many studies have identified that the experiences of patients, carers and the emergency department staff themselves is often suboptimal. In this editorial we summarise one such study, by O'Keeffe and colleagues, and consider strategies for improving the experiences of patients and their carers when presenting to the emergency department. We also reiterate the need for wider systemic change in attitudes and approaches towards people who self-harm that are pervasive across the healthcare system and beyond.","Robinson, Jo, Bailey, Eleanor","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.35","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28595,""
"Do PROs Tell the Whole Story? Differential Outcomes Based on Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) Versus Performance-Based Metrics (PBM) on Cognition for Patients Receiving Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T Cell Therapy","Introduction: As the use of CAR-T cell therapy grows, there is an increased need to understand its impact on the patient experience, especially symptom burden and cognitive function. While the immediate side-effects of CAR-T therapy have been reported, our study aims to describe the longitudinal impact of CAR-T therapy on patients' quality of life (QoL), including patient-reported cognitive function and performance-based cognition, which are not well understood. Methods: Patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing CAR-T therapy were prospectively recruited from two academic centers. The primary endpoint was feasibility of completing longitudinal PRO assessments and PBM of cognition. NIH PROMIS measures assessed physical, mental, cognitive, and social health. PROMIS measures use the t-score metric, where 50 is the average in the U.S. population and a 5 point (0.5 SD) change was considered clinically meaningful. The NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery measured 6 constructs of cognition, scored on the t-score metric (10 point = 1SD, change considered clinically meaningful). Exploratory analyses described change from baseline. PROMIS measures were completed at baseline, 7 and 14 days, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (mo) after CAR-T. The Toolbox was assessed at baseline, 1 month, and 12 months. Due to COVID restrictions on in person research, the Toolbox could not be assessed for the first 13 patients. Results: From 8/2020 to 6/2021, 28 patients have been enrolled. Baseline, day 7, day 14, 1 mo, 3 mo, and 6 mo data were available in 27, 20, 21, 23, 15 (10 not yet reached), and 9 (16 not yet reached) patients, respectively. The mean age was 57 years (range 27-78);44% were female. Race distribution was: Caucasian 75%, Asian 8%, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 4% and other race 8%;21% were Hispanic ethnicity. Patients received CAR-T for diagnoses of NHL (75%), MM (17%), and ALL (13%). CRS was seen in 86% (all grade 1-2), neurotoxicity (ICANS) in 34% (grade 1-2: N=5 and grade &gt; 3: N=5). PROMIS questionnaires were completed in &gt;70% of patients across all timepoints with current follow-up;thus it was feasible to collect these data at frequent intervals after CAR-T. Mean baseline PROMIS t-scores (N=27) were similar to the average US population in all domains (fatigue: 53, sleep: 52, pain: 52, anxiety: 53, depression: 49) except for decreased physical function (44) among patients (Fig 1a-b). Physical function, fatigue, and pain interference worsened during the first month but returned to baseline by month 3 (Fig 1a-b). PBM of cognition (NIH Toolbox) were assessed at baseline in 15 pts and 1 mo in 8 patients (4 incomplete, 3 not reached timepoint). The toolbox requires in-person administration and takes 35 minutes, but has been completed in 75% of evaluable patients. At baseline, the mean total composite score was 65 th percentile and t-score was 57;mean fluid composite score was 50 th percentile and t-score was 50;mean crystallized composite score was 69 th percentile and t-score was 58 (fluid composite score measures ability to reason, crystallized composite score measures accrual of knowledge over time, Weintraub et al Neurology 2013). Little change in scores was seen in language domains and some increase (not clinically significant) was seen in constructs on attention, executive function, and episodic memory. While not significant, a trend towards worsening working memory and processing speed and a trend towards worsening t-scores for all composite scores was seen (Figure 1c). 2 patients with neurotoxicity grade 3 and available baseline and 1-mo Toolboxes were noted to have decreases in all composite scores (clinically significant in 1). Patients did not self-report changes in cognitive function over 6 months (Fig 1d). Conclusion: This study reports early data from longitudinal neurocognitive assessments and PROs in patients undergoing CAR-T. It is feasible for patients undergoing CAR-T to complete PROMIS surveys (PROs) and NIH cognitive Toolboxes (performance-based test). Early and frequent PRO surveys captured initial worsening in hysical function, fatigue, and pain interference that returned to baseline by month 3. There was no change in patient-reported cognitive function over time, but using PBM cognition testing, we noted a trend towards worsening cognition in some domains. Continued patient accrual and longer follow up will allow assessment of degree and persistence of worsened PBM cognition associated with CAR-T.

"Primary and secondary care approach to paediatric mental health conditions: a novel model of care","The enforced isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in mental health issues and severity of presentations to emergency departments in Ireland. Long waiting lists for both Psychology and Psychiatry are further impacting on childrenâ€™s mental well-being. We proposed the creation of a â€˜Happiness Toolkitâ€™ that can be given to children on presentation to their primary or secondary care provider with a mental health issue. The toolkit is comprised of six evidence-based techniques that are proven to boost self-esteem, develop resilience and promote positive mental health. A leaflet detailing the practices along with a physical â€˜boxâ€™ that the children must make were created. This resource may therefore provide immediate support to those children that may endure long waiting periods, sometimes greater than a year and a half, for referral to tertiary services. Our toolkit allows children and their families to engage in positive mental health practices that may prevent regression during this waiting period and lead to improved mental health or cessation of symptoms.","Power, Edmond, Taaffe, Sarah, McLoughlin, Patricia, Sharif, Farhana","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2021-001285","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Paediatrics Open; 6(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28597,""
"Cross-sectional study on knowledge, attitude and prevalence of domestic violence among women in Kaduna, north-western Nigeria","BackgroundDomestic violence is a global issue of public health concern with detrimental effects on womenâ€™s physical, mental and social well-being. There is a paucity of community-based studies assessing the knowledge and attitude of women towards domestic violence in Nigeria.ObjectiveTo assess knowledge, attitudes, prevalence and associated factors of domestic violence among women in a community in Kaduna, Nigeria.DesignA descriptive cross-sectional study.SettingA selected community in Kaduna South Local Government Area in Kaduna State.ParticipantsIn total, 170 women aged 15â€“49 years participated in the study.Primary and secondary outcome measuresThe outcomes were knowledge, attitude and prevalence of domestic violence.ResultsThe mean age of the respondents was 28.7+7.9 years. A total of 113 (66.5%) respondents had high level of knowledge about domestic violence with 114 (67.1%) having non-tolerant attitudes towards domestic violence. The lifetime prevalence and 12-month prevalence of domestic violence were 47.1% and 35.3%, respectively. The results of logistic regression identified the educational status of women as a significant predictor of knowledge of domestic violence (adjusted OR (aOR)=0.32;95% CI 0.15 to 0.68), while marital status (aOR=0.21;95% CI 0.05 to 0.96), occupation of women (aOR=2.49;95% CI 1.13 to 5.49), their tolerance of wife beating (aOR=0.33;95% CI 0.15 to 0.72) and their partnersâ€™ consumption habit of alcohol/substance use (aOR=7.91;95% CI 3.09 to 20.27) were identified as significant predictors of the womenâ€™s experience of domestic violence.ConclusionDomestic violence was relatively high among women. Though a majority had high level of knowledge about domestic violence, a significant third had tolerant attitudes towards it. Appropriate health interventions need to be implemented by governmental and relevant stakeholders to target negative attitudes and address associated factors of domestic violence against women.","Awawu Grace, Nmadu, Abubakar, Jafaru, Dahiru, Tukur, Istifanus Anekoson, Joshua, Nwankwo, Bilkisu, Mohammed-Durosinlorun, Amina","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051626","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Open; 12(3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28598,""

"Training and re-certification of crew for the ""new normal"" in the cruise tourism industry: a Caribbean regional perspective","Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the need for training and re-certification of crew for the pandemic-related new normal and for a more sustainable cruise tourism industry. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative method was adopted for this study using a case study research design. The target group was technical and hospitality workers. The semi-structured interview guide was administered through Google Forms, and eight respondents were selected using a purposive sampling technique. Findings The study revealed that job losses have occurred among Caribbean nationals, and this is influencing lifestyle practices and family spending power. Further, many workers experienced confinement onboard because of the pandemic, which gave rise to mental health issues. Given this, re-certification and training of technical and hospitality staff in mental wellness is viewed as important in the context of the pandemic-related new normal. Practical implications This study points to relevant training to deal with the pandemic now and in the future. The article has some implications for maritime training institutions that may need to reassess their curriculum to meet future challenges. Social implications Stakeholders of crew shipping companies, agencies and businesses can gain a greater appreciation of the safety measures needed to protect passengers as well as crew.

"Does group size and blending matter? Impact of a digital mental health game implemented with refugees in various settings","Purpose&gt;There is an urgent need to upscale accessible mental health (MH) interventions that address barriers to care among Syrian refugee adolescents. The Happy Helping Hand (HH) is an innovative, cognitive behavioral digital game designed to improve MH for adolescents across digital divides. This study aims to examine the impact of HH implemented among Syrian refugees who varied according to group size and face-to-face (F2F) versus digital contact.Design/methodology/approach&gt;This mixed-methods study took place in Central Beqaa, Lebanon, from September 2020 to February 2021. Nine groups of Syrian displaced adolescents (n = 125) aged 13â€“17 years (Mage = 13.6 years) were recruited from an education center, two orphanages and one informal settlement to participate in the ten-session HH program. The WHO-Five-Well-being Index (WHO5) is a validated measure used to evaluate HH impact on MH at baseline and directly postintervention.Findings&gt;Significant improvements were seen in WHO5 scores in F2F and digital settings from baseline to follow-up. At baseline, 28% reported normal well-being, which increased to 99% after HH participation. WHO5 scores changed from M = 59.4 at baseline, indicating depression, to M = 77.3 at follow-up, indicating normal well-being. Smaller groups with more F2F contact reported greater improvements in mean WHO5 than larger groups with less F2F contact. The greatest aggregate change in well-being was achieved when HH was implemented digitally in bigger groups.Originality/value&gt;Study results indicate that the HH game can improve well-being and MH for Syrian refugees.

"Teenage well-being-a virtual support group","The pandemic in 2020 and measures to control the COVID-19 virus led to many teenagers and Young People(YP) isolated from their friends, through shielding and extended home schooling. It has affected their mental health and wellbeing, with an increasing demand upon mental health services (BMJ 2021, Miller et al 2020, Jeffery et al 2021). In the Thames Valley we look after approx 200 YP with haemoglobinopathy disorders, a third between the ages of 13 & 18 years. A low prevalence area, a very wide geographical spread, making access to specialist services challenging. Access to technology and virtual connections, and a newly appointed psychologist led us to look at provision of an online wellbeing support group for teenagers. Aims: To invite teenagers between 13-18 years to a weekly 'drop in' group, where they would be able to access strategies and resources to support with varying aspects of well-being, as well as the opportunity to ask questions, in a safe supportive environment. Method: The group initially ran on a weekly basis for one hour at the end of the school day, led by 2 specialist nurses and a clinical psychologist. We covered subjects such as: stress, anxiety, low mood, fatigue, as well as more media related content like vaccinations and navigating social media. We used the Zoom platform, but then moved to Microsoft Teams, as this was the Trust's preferred platform. Our YP and their parents were contacted and asked if they would like to join and then they would be sent an invite via email. A reminder was also sent the day before the next meeting. Parents would be included in any email communication and resources;however, they were not encouraged to join the meeting. Meeting etiquette and ground rules were explained at the beginning of the meeting and with each new attendee, in order to establish trust and inclusion. Following the meeting, a summary and any material used was circulated to the whole group. Results: 13 meetings January- November 2021 (Initially weekly, however we changed to monthly over the summer as demand dropped off). Subjects covered include: COVID-19 & dealing with anxiety, stress, Low mood/dealing with sadness, Vaccine safety, fatigue, returning to school, Paintalking to people about your diagnosis.Attendance was variable - with the maximum being 6 young people. A short survey was circulated to try and identify what was working, what needed to change and to have input from the YP on content. As a result of this feedback, we moved to a different day of the week and a later session time. Summary: small numbers YP would regularly attend, parents commented they looked forward to this group, which we took to be a sign of success. Other attendees, joined sporadically on 1 or more occasions. We found the YP to be engaged. Most were happy to say hello and introduce themselves on camera but would then prefer the camera off. We didn't have anyone comment on difficulties with access, many used their smartphone devices. Session preapration was time consuming, but as we progressed, we became more efficient at re-using material and needing less 'team brief' time as we understood how the sessions ran.

"Rights of Persons with Schizophrenia-Spectrum Disorders-A Tough Challenge for Psychiatric Medical Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic","In this article the authors discuss the rights of one of the most vulnerable groups during a time of limited access to ordinary healthcare resulting from the COVID pandemic, namely, those with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (PSSDs). In the first part, the authors investigate international human rights law to highlight the most relevant rights and their legal basis. The authors conclude that the most significant are: the right to freedom of discrimination;the right to mental health care;the right to rehabilitation;the right to the least intrusive treatment based on the will of the disabled person;the prohibition of discriminatory denial of healthcare;and the right to be treated like other ill persons. In the second part of the article, the authors review the circumstances resulting from the COVID pandemic and attempt to propose solutions for the conflict between the rights of PSSDs and the obligation of the state. The conclusion of this legal investigation is that because of the 'state-capability' model of obligations indicated by CRPD, the most relevant for PSSDs rights is the principle of non-discrimination because of disability. This principle cannot be limited or derogated. On the other hand, this research indicates that the right to autonomous will of the PSSD patient has been the least respected during the current pandemic.","Pachnik, C.; Rotuski, G.","https://doi.org/10.1093/jhuman/huab014","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Human Rights Practice;: 15, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28604,""
"Keep Movin' On in Trinidad and Tobago: the complexities of COVID-19 on dance and dance education","The COVID-19 pandemic entered Trinidad and Tobago on 12 March 2020. We immediately went into lockdown and borders were officially closed to all travellers, including nationals. The Prime Minister, Dr. Keith Rowley, cancelled Carnival for 2021 on 28 September 2020. This was devastating news for a culture and economy dependent on the celebrations. The pandemic took a toll on the mental health and well-being of everybody, but the arts were particularly struck hard. How did this impact the sector of dance in the community and in education? What are some ways that people still engaged online with dance in education and in performance? Through a mixed-method approach, this paper reflects on the cultural aspects of dance in Trinidad and Tobago and how the pandemic altered ways of dance education, social engagement, and technology.

"Health pandemic in the era of (mis)information: Examining the utility of using victim narrative and social endorsement of user-generated content to reduce panic buying in the uS","Panic buying frequently occurs in health pandemics, disturbing both the market and people's lives. The situation is exacerbated by the easy spread of misinformation online. With a web-based experiment, the present study examined how user-generated anti-panic buying messages online could be leveraged to combat panic buying. It was found that user comments discussing how panic buying affects the lives of less advantaged social groups on social media, as well as high social endorsement of the comment, significantly reduced readers' derogation of the comment, thereby increasing negative attitudes toward panic buying and lowering intention to engage in it. The message format (narrative vs. non-narrative), however, did not influence the amount of impact it had on participants' attitude and purchase intentions. The findings contribute to research on message-based and heuristic-based persuasion processes in reading reactance-inducing messages online and guide the design of persuasive messages to reduce panic buying during health pandemics.

"Impact of telemedicine on retention in Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) treatment with buprenorphine in the times of COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective chart review","This study reviewed the impact of telemedicine on treatment retention in Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) with buprenorphine treatment program during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Electronic health records of active patients in MOUD with buprenorphine treatment program were reviewed from July 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020. Data were divided into four groups of 3-months' time points to calculate and compare treatment retention in the baseline, pre-COVID, and in-COVID groups. The percentage of treatment retention with a 95% confidence interval was calculated using University of California San Franciso- Clinical and Translational Science Institute (UCSF-CTSI) sample size calculator tool. This study presents data suggesting that telemedicine is efficacious in retaining patients in MOUD. Telemedicine is an alternative to face-to-face treatment delivery for MOUD with buprenorphine treatment. It should be available to provide services after the pandemic as well.

"Mental health providers' telehealth education prior to and following implementation: A COVID-19 rapid response survey","Mental health providers' usage of telehealth modalities saw an exponential increase in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Some experts have suggested that it takes considerable time, education, consultation, and/or supervision to develop the new technology-based competencies. Education is required to understand not just the technologies, but the practices (e.g., ethical, legal, safety planning), differences from face-to-face care, and workflows. Given the need for rapid transition due to COVID-19, it is unclear how providers prepared for the integration of telehealth with their traditional practices. As such, the purpose of the present study was to examine mental health providers' educational activities prior to and post telehealth implementation. Four hundred and four practicing providers (i.e., psychologists, counselors, therapists, social workers) were assessed via an online researcher-created survey. Results indicated significant increases in telehealth usage following COVID-19, with videoconferencing being the most common modality used. Although approximately 74% of surveyed providers sought telehealth education prior to usage, approximately 26% did not. In supplement of anything learned prior, approximately 61% indicated pursuing additional education post implementation. Taken together, a significant portion of providers can be viewed as having gained information that guided ethical, legal, and safe clinical services. Nevertheless, with consideration of the breadth and duration of the educational activities pursued, many providers would likely still benefit from additional education to foster a more complete understanding of the new telehealth competencies. Details regarding usage and educational activities are discussed. Application of information is outlined. Findings can help provide direction for additional educational efforts for providers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement The study suggests that surveyed mental health providers exhibited significant increases in use of telehealth modalities following the spread of COVID-19. As new competencies, the use of telehealth methods requires specialized education to develop both knowledge and skill. Such expertise is essential due to the unique factors of telehealth utilization, including how the technology can require modification of one's clinical practice when compared to face-to-face care. Although many surveyed providers indicated seeking education prior to and post telehealth implementation, a portion provided responses suggesting that they could benefit from additional education to ensure the highest levels of competency, and thus care. Additional education should focus on both knowledge and applied skill development.

"Telemental health uptake in an outpatient clinic for veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic and assessment of patient and provider attitudes","This study aimed to (a) describe the process of rapid uptake of telemental health in an outpatient mental health clinic for veterans and their family members during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and (b) present patient and provider attitudes about telemental health. Virtual visit (video and phone) trends for this clinic are described over the 8 weeks pre- and post-COVID-19 closure. As part of a quality improvement initiative over a subsequent 2-week period, 147 patient visits (127 unique individuals), and 24 mental health providers who were part of a multidisciplinary team were eligible to complete an anonymous self-report satisfaction survey immediately after a telehealth session. Prior to the COVID-19 closure, the clinic averaged 112.75 completed visits per week, with virtual visits accounting for less than 5% of all appointments. In the second month after closure, the clinic averaged 153.75 completed visits per week (36.36% increase in volume), with virtual visits accounting for 100% of visits (42% phone, 58% video). The proportion of video compared to telephone visits increased pre to postclosure. The no-show rate significantly decreased pre to postclosure (10.87% vs. 15.01%, resp., chi2 = 17.81, p &lt; .001). Patient and provider satisfaction with telemental health were high. Prospectively, most patients (83.56%) expressed preference for televisits-only or televisits combined with in-person visits. Patients and providers were satisfied with telemental health. Convenience was an oft-cited advantage by both patients and providers. Telemental health may represent a cost-effective solution to mental health care access during and beyond COVID-19.

"Canadian adolescents' mental health and substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Associations with COVID-19 stressors","There have been significant concerns regarding the mental health impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to isolation, anxiety around the pandemic, and increased conflict in the home. The purpose of this study was to examine the rates of mental health symptoms of clinical concern and substance use, and to assess which COVID-19 related stressors were predictors of these symptoms and substance use in a large Canadian sample of adolescents, with comparisons across genders. Participants (N = 809, Mage = 15.67, SD = 1.37) identified as a girl (56.2%), boy (38.7%), or trans/nonbinary individuals (TNBI;5.1%) and were recruited via social media to complete an online survey. A high proportion of adolescents reported symptoms of clinical concern for depression (51%), anxiety (39%), and posttraumatic stress disorder (45%). Other mental health problems ranged from 9% to 20%. Adolescents were mainly concerned with the health of family members and vulnerable populations, as well as the increased family stress at home during COVID-19. Rates of substance use were higher than expected, with over 50% of youth engaging in some form of substance use in the past 90 days, and almost 20% engaging in substance use at least once a week. TNBI and girls reported higher rates of mental health problems compared to boys. Family stress due to confinement and violence at home predicted higher mental health symptoms, but not substance use problems. Increased rates of mental health problems and substance use necessitate targeted supports that encourage positive coping amidst the additional stresses of COVID-19.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an additional factorinfluencing mental health during this unpredictable time. In the Warsawpaediatric CF centre, increased level of stress, anxiety and more depressivesymptoms were observed in patients with CF and their parents. Over time,more children required psychiatric consultations and some of them wereprescribed pharmacological treatment. In many families, conflicts aroseand the financial situation deteriorated. There were no formal guidelineson psychological care during a pandemic. Active participation in Europeangroups of specialists working with patients with CF, such as the ECFSEuropean Psychosocial Special Interest Group and ECFS Mental HealthWorking Group, allowed us share experiences and practices with other CFcentres and implement new ideas in our centre.Results: Different actions and interventions were undertaken bypsychologists:1.

"Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the level of distress in patients with breast cancer","Goals: In a very short period of time, during the first wave of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) became a great threat worldwide in terms of health, as well as social and economic aspects. From the beginning of the outbreak, patients with cancer were considered a high-risk population with regard to the COVID- 19 infection. Epidemiological measures imposed during the pandemic, such as social distancing and lockdowns, additionally burdened patients with cancer. Psychological distress is common in such patients. The prevalence of distress in patients with breast cancer ranges approximately 20â€“40%. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the level of distress among patients with breast cancer in Croatia, during extreme epidemiological measures. We also sought to examine whether disease or socio-demographic characteristics were predictors for distress. Methods: A total of 545 patients with breast cancer were approached to participate in the study;201 patients completed the questionnaire with disease and socio-demographic characteristics. All patients were actively receiving systemic oncological treatment (neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or metastatic setting), with disease stages ranging Iâ€“IV. The level of distress was measured using the Distress Thermometer with a cut-off value of 4, followed by a problem list. The study was conducted from April 20, 2020 to May 24, 2020, while all extreme epidemiological measures (lockdown and strict social distancing) were ongoing and equally applied to all regions in Croatia. Results: High distress level was reported in 54.2% of patients. The most prominent problems were worry, fatigue, sleep, nervousness, fear, and child care. Highly distressed patients had more practical problems (child care, housing, and work/school) and emotional problems (depression, fear, nervousness, sadness, worry, and loss of interest for usual activities), than those in the low distress group. None of the socio-demographic or disease characteristics of the patients were linked to the level of distress. Conclusion(s): Even in a country with a favorable epidemiological situation, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, every second patient with breast cancer had a high level of distress. COVID-19- induced distress should be promptly addressed and additional psychological and social support, targeting specific practical and emotional problems, should be provided for those patients.

"How American college students understand social resilience and navigate towards the future during covid and the movement for racial justice","The COVID-19 pandemic and crisis around racial injustice have generated compounded macro-level stressors for American society that negatively impact mental health and wellbeing. We contribute to understanding the impact of these crises by examining the process of developing social resilience, which we conceptualize as a temporally-embedded process of sense-making through which actors activate a sense of dignity, agency, and hope in the face of challenges to sustain wellbeing based on available resources. We interviewed 80 college students (aged 18â€“23) living in the American Northeast and Midwest before (September 2019â€“February 2020) and during (Juneâ€“July 2020) the pandemic to analyze how they make sense of crises, respond to challenges, and project themselves into the future. We compare â€œprivilegedâ€ upper-middle class youth who have families with more resources to buffer themselves against growing uncertainty, with â€œless privilegedâ€ youth from lower-middle and working-class families. Efforts to achieve a sense of dignity, agency, and hope amidst widespread uncertainty illuminate opportunities and constraints in the process of building social resilience, which take different temporal forms across the two class groups given their experiences and resources.","Sanchez, Mari, Lamont, MichÃ¨le, Zilberstein, Shira","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.114890","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Science & Medicine;: 114890, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28613,""
"Personality, gender, and age resilience to the mental health effects of COVID-19","Rationale. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on different population cohorts and which personality traits affected individual's coping responses can help identify strategies to promote self-directed behaviours, thereby enhancing and maintaining individual's mental well-being. Objective Using longitudinal data for the UK, we examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individualsâ€™ mental well-being, focusing on age, gender, and personality traits as possible modifiers. Methods We explore the longitudinal nature of the data using individual fixed effects models, which implicitly control for unobserved time-invariant individual-level characteristics. Our sample is an unbalanced panel consisting of 373,555 person-years observations, observed from 2009 until June 2020. Results The negative impacts of the first months of the pandemic period are found to be larger for young adults (aged 16â€“25 years) and vary by personality traits. The increase in psychological distress symptoms is more pronounced for individuals who score higher in neuroticism, extroversion, and openness to experience. Indeed, for introverted young people, recent events may have actually brought a sense of calm. Other findings indicate that worsening in the psychological distress level occurs alongside with increased feelings of loneliness. Conclusions Our findings support the theoretical knowledge that different people have different psychological and behaviour responses and personality concepts can be used when studying individual's adaptive behaviour in critical situations such as COVID-19. Our results indicate the necessity of public health programmes to assist distressed young individuals.","Staneva, Anita, Carmignani, Fabrizio, Rohde, Nicholas","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.114884","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Science & Medicine;: 114884, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28614,""

"Pause, re-think, go virtual â€¦ Pandemic adaptations from 20 diverse mental health promotion intervention projects across Canada","The Government of Canada's Mental Health Promotion Innovation Fund (MHP-IF) is a platform for learning across diverse projects, facilitated by a knowledge hub. MHP-IF projects were getting underway before the COVID-19 pandemic escalated in 2020 and dramatically shifted their circumstances and activities. Using storytelling methods, this study explored 20 project experiences during the first year of the pandemic, including how and why assumptions, plans, and activities were adapted;early signals about what was working well or not;and how adaptations influenced equity, access, and cultural safety. Project teams generally navigated through four stages: pausing, re-thinking, adapting, and settling into adjustments. Within and across these stages, projects addressed similar processes, including meeting fundamental needs of participants and project teams, managing unanticipated benefits, and engaging with online formats.

"Resuming Social Contact After Months of Contact Restrictions: Social Traits Moderate Associations Between Changes in Social Contact and Well-Being","Humans possess a need for social contact. Satisfaction of this need benefits well-being, whereas deprivation is detrimental. However, how much contact people desire is not universal, and evidence is mixed on individual differences in the association between contact and well-being. This preregistered longitudinal study (N = 190) examined changes in social contact and well-being (life satisfaction, depressivity/anxiety) during pervasive contact restrictions, which exceed lab-based social deprivation. We analyzed how changes in personal and indirect contact and well-being during the first COVID-19 lockdown varied with social traits (e.g., affiliation, extraversion). Results showed that affiliation motive, need to be alone, and social anxiety moderated the resumption of personal contact under loosened restrictions as well as associated changes in life satisfaction and depressivity/anxiety.

"Acute COVID-19 severity and mental health morbidity trajectories in patient populations of six nations: an observational study","Long-term mental and physical health consequences of COVID-19 (long COVID) are a persistent public health concern. Little is still known about the long-term mental health of non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with varying illness severities. Our aim was to assess the prevalence of adverse mental health symptoms among individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in the general population by acute infection severity up to 16 months after diagnosis. This observational follow-up study included seven prospectively planned cohorts across six countries (Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the UK). Participants were recruited from March 27, 2020, to Aug 13, 2021. Individuals aged 18 years or older were eligible to participate. In a cross-sectional analysis, we contrasted symptom prevalence of depression, anxiety, COVID-19-related distress, and poor sleep quality (screened with validated mental health instruments) among individuals with and without a diagnosis of COVID-19 at entry, 0-16 months from diagnosis. In a cohort analysis, we further used repeated measures to estimate the change in mental health symptoms before and after COVID-19 diagnosis. The analytical cohort consisted of 247Ã¢â‚¬Ë†249 individuals, 9979 (4Ã‚Â·0%) of whom were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. Mean follow-up was 5Ã‚Â·65 months (SD 4Ã‚Â·26). Participants diagnosed with COVID-19 presented overall with a higher prevalence of symptoms of depression (prevalence ratio [PR] 1Ã‚Â·18 [95% CI 1Ã‚Â·03-1Ã‚Â·36]) and poorer sleep quality (1Ã‚Â·13 [1Ã‚Â·03-1Ã‚Â·24]) but not symptoms of anxiety (0Ã‚Â·97 [0Ã‚Â·91-1Ã‚Â·03]) or COVID-19-related distress (1Ã‚Â·05 [0Ã‚Â·93-1Ã‚Â·20]) compared with individuals without a COVID-19 diagnosis. Although the prevalence of depression and COVID-19-related distress attenuated with time, individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 but never bedridden due to their illness were consistently at lower risk of depression (PR 0Ã‚Â·83 [95% CI 0Ã‚Â·75-0Ã‚Â·91]) and anxiety (0Ã‚Â·77 [0Ã‚Â·63-0Ã‚Â·94]) than those not diagnosed with COVID-19, whereas patients who were bedridden for more than 7 days were persistently at higher risk of symptoms of depression (PR 1Ã‚Â·61 [95% CI 1Ã‚Â·27-2Ã‚Â·05]) and anxiety (1Ã‚Â·43 [1Ã‚Â·26-1Ã‚Â·63]) than those not diagnosed throughout the study period. Severe acute COVID-19 illness-indicated by extended time bedridden-is associated with long-term mental morbidity among recovering individuals in the general population. These findings call for increased vigilance of adverse mental health development among patients with a severe acute disease phase of COVID-19.

"[Persistent fatigue symptoms following COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers: risk factors and impact on quality of life]","Employees from medical and nursing professions are at increased risk for aÃ‚Â SARS-CoVÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 infection and thus more frequently affected by COVID-19 sequelae. Previous studies have identified post-viral fatigue as the most common sequelae. The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors and effects induced by clinically relevant fatigue symptoms following aÃ‚Â COVID-19 infection of healthcare workers. In the spring of 2021, 4315 insured members of the Statutory Accident Insurance and Prevention in the Health and Welfare Service were contacted for aÃ‚Â written survey on their COVID-19 disease in 2020 and its sequelae. Information on Symptoms of acute infection, disease sequelae, and potential risk factors were collected, as well as the physical and mental health status after SARS-CoVÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2 infection. The general fatigue scale of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) was used as fatigue screening. Regression analyses and multivariate analyses of variance were calculated for data analysis. Of the respondents, 10.7% showed severe fatigue symptoms. Identified risk factors for clinical fatigue symptoms included preexisting mental and respiratory conditions and severity of acute infection. Furthermore, severe long-/post-COVID fatigue was associated with higher psychological distress, lower health-related quality of life, and more frequent incapacity to work. Severe long-/post-COVID fatigue is associated with aÃ‚Â high level of distress, which requires specific rehabilitation approaches and poses aÃ‚Â challenge to the social insurance agencies and accident insurers to develop appropriate rehabilitation concepts. HINTERGRUND UND ZIEL: Durch ihre TÃƒÂ¤tigkeit sind Menschen aus medizinisch-pflegerischen Berufen einem erhÃƒÂ¶hten Risiko fÃƒÂ¼r eine SARS-CoV-2-Infektion ausgesetzt und dadurch ÃƒÂ¶fter von Krankheitsfolgen betroffen. In bisherigen Studien wurde als hÃƒÂ¤ufigste Krankheitsfolge die postvirale Fatigue (ErschÃƒÂ¶pfungssyndrom nach viraler Infektion) identifiziert. Das Ziel der Studie war die Untersuchung von Risikofaktoren fÃƒÂ¼r anhaltende Fatiguesymptome infolge einer COVID-19-Infektion und deren Auswirkungen bei BeschÃƒÂ¤ftigten im Gesundheitswesen. Im FrÃƒÂ¼hjahr 2021 wurden 4315 Versicherte der Berufsgenossenschaft fÃƒÂ¼r Gesundheitsdienst und Wohlfahrtspflege (BGW) fÃƒÂ¼r eine schriftliche Befragung zu ihrer COVID-19-Erkrankung im Jahr 2020 und den Krankheitsfolgen angeschrieben. Dabei wurden Symptome der Akutinfektion, Krankheitsfolgen, mÃƒÂ¶gliche Risikofaktoren sowie der kÃƒÂ¶rperliche und psychische Gesundheitszustand nach der SARS-CoV-2-Infektion erhoben. Als Fatiguescreening wurde die Skala Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Allgemeine ErschÃƒÂ¶pfungÃ¢â‚¬Å“ des Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) eingesetzt. Zur Datenanalyse wurden Regressionsanalysen und multivariate Varianzanalysen berechnet. 10,7Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% der Befragten wiesen schwere Fatiguewerte auf. Als Risikofaktoren fÃƒÂ¼r eine klinische Fatiguesymptomatik konnten u.Ã¢â‚¬Â¯a. Vorerkrankungen der Psyche und Atemwege sowie die Schwere der Akutinfektion identifiziert werden. Weiterhin war eine schwere LongÃ¢â‚¬â€˜/Post-COVID-Fatigue mit einer hÃƒÂ¶heren psychischen Belastung, einer niedrigeren gesundheitsbezogenen LebensqualitÃƒÂ¤t sowie mit einer hÃƒÂ¤ufigeren ArbeitsunfÃƒÂ¤higkeit assoziiert.

"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on anhedonia, reward exposure and responsiveness, and sleep in college students","<b>Objective:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic's effects on college student mental health and its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Although necessary, physical distancing abruptly restricts interaction with environmental rewards and disrupts sleep patterns, both of which may contribute to psychological symptoms (eg, depression and anhedonia). This study explored differences in psychological symptoms, reward exposure and responsiveness, and sleep before versus during the pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Eighty-seven college students completed baseline questionnaires and a one-week daily diary paradigm. The sample was divided into two groups based on data collection before (pre-) or after (post-COVID-19) implementation of state-wide COVID-19 physical distancing measures. <b>Results:</b> Findings highlight higher anhedonia, decrements in exposure to social, professional, and exercise related rewards, lower aniticipatory reward responsiveness, and lower sleep efficiency among college students during the initial months of the pandemic. <b>Conclusions:</b> Findings suggest anhedonia, reward system functioning, and sleep may be important targets to mitigate against college student mental health sequelae during COVID-19.","Wieman, Fields, Arditte Hall, MacDonald, Liverant","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2022.2047705","20220317","Anhedonia; COVID-19; reward exposure; reward responsiveness; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28635,""
"Mental and physical health among students at a private university that held in-person classes during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have serious negative consequences on mental and physical health, which may disproportionally affect young adults. The aim of this study was to understand short-term impacts on a population of students at a college that held in-person classes during the pandemic. This study was conducted at a moderately-sized private university in the southeastern United States where approximately 75% of students were enrolled in undergraduate degree programs and 25% in graduate degree programs. A survey was created to assess anxiety and depression symptoms, psychotherapeutic medication use, healthy living, and coping skills. Links to the electronic form were distributed to students via email in Spring 2020 and Fall 2020. Participation was completely voluntary and responses were collected anonymously. The rate of anxiety symptoms in the study cohort was higher than the national average (31%) and increased between Spring 2020 (39%) and Fall 2020 (50%). Rates of psychotherapeutic medication use also rose, with benzodiazepine use increasing from 6% to 11% and antidepressant use increasing from 16% to 20%. Compared to the national average, fewer students in the study cohort rated their overall health as ""good"" or better (72-76% vs. 82%). Physical exercise, nutrition, and alcohol use worsened between Spring and Fall 2020. Problem-focused engagement was associated with significantly fewer anxiety and depression symptoms. Demographic factors such as gender, race, and sexual orientation interacted with several outcomes studied. Students at a private university that held in-person classes during the COVID-19 pandemic reported high rates of anxiety that increased between Spring and Fall 2020. Self-reported physical health was below average in Spring 2020 but improved in Fall 2020. Appropriate identification and management of the effects of pandemic-related stressors is critical during this uncertain time.

"Coping with COVID-19: a snapshot of college student mental health, coping, and expectancies during stay-at-home orders","The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted people's lives around the world, including college students. This cross-sectional study aimed to 1) describe psychological distress, coping, and expectancies of undergraduates during COVID-19 ""stay-at-home"" orders and 2) examine the associations among these variables. Midwestern US undergraduates (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°186) completed measures of psychological distress, coping behaviors, and expectancies in March-April 2020 during the initial round of ""stay-at-home"" orders. Students engaged in approach coping and disease prevention behaviors and had low expectations for contracting COVID-19. Most students reported clinically significant depression or anxiety. Adherence to disease prevention behaviors was associated with less stress but more anxiety. Positive expectancies and approach coping were associated with less distress. Avoidance coping was associated with more distress. This study describes the toll that COVID-19 has had on college students. Continued attention to the mental health of college students during the pandemic is imperative.","Shanahan, Fischer, Rogers, Rand","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2022.2039670","20220317","COVID-19; anxiety; coping; depression; hope","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28639,""
"Intersected discrimination through the lens of COVID-19: The case example of Christian minority in Iraq","Compelling evidence proved that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) disproportionately affects minorities. The goal of the present study was to explore the effects of intersected discrimination and discrimination types on COVID-19, mental health, and cognition. A sample of 542 Iraqis, 55.7% females, age ranged from 18 to 73, with (<i>M</i> = 31.16, <i>SD</i> = 9.77). 48.7% were Muslims, and 51.3% were Christians (<i>N</i> = 278). We used measures for COVID-19 stressors, executive functions, intersected discrimination (gender discrimination, social groups-based discrimination, sexual orientation discrimination, and genocidal discrimination), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, status and death, existential anxieties, and health. We conducted independent samples <i>t</i> test between Muslims and Christians. We conducted hierarchical regression analyses using the Christian minority subsample to see if intersected discrimination is predictive of COVID-19 hospitalization. We conducted two-path analyses, one with intersected discrimination as an independent variable and the second with the different discrimination types as independent variables. Intersected discrimination predicted COVID-19 hospitalization. The primary discrimination type for Christians was genocidal discrimination. Christians had higher existential anxiety about status and death than Muslims. Intersected discrimination and discrimination types had a significant association with mental health, health, and cognition variables, with intersected discrimination, had a higher impact than each. Existential anxiety about the person's social and economic status was the critical outcome of intersected discrimination that trickles down to other variables. COVID-19 stressors had significant effects on depression, PTSD, generalized anxiety, and Status existential annihilation anxiety (EAA). COVID-19 hospitalization and stressors are associated with inhibition and working memory deficits. We discussed the conceptual and clinical implications of the results.

"Usual source of primary care and preventive care measures in the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide cross-sectional study in Japan","To assess multiple preventive care measures and to examine their associations with having a usual source of primary care and primary care performance during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Nationwide cross-sectional study. Japanese general adult population. 1757 adult residents. Fourteen preventive care measures aggregated the overall screening, immunisation and counselling composites. Depression screening, zoster vaccination and tetanus vaccination had low implementation rates even among participants with a usual source of primary care. After adjustment for possible confounders, having a usual source of primary care was positively associated with all preventive care composites. Primary care performance assessed by the Japanese version of Primary Care Assessment Tool Short Form was also dose dependently associated with an increase in all composites. Results of the sensitivity analyses using a different calculation of preventive care composite were similar to those of the primary analyses. Receipt of primary care, particularly high-quality primary care, contributed to increased preventive care utilisation even during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the rate of mental health screening in primary care was at a very low level. Therefore, addressing mental health issues should be a major challenge for primary care providers during and after the pandemic.","Aoki, Fujinuma, Matsushima","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057418","20220317","COVID-19; preventive medicine; primary care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28641,""
"Survivorship of Patients After Long Intensive Care Stay With Exploration and Experience in a New Zealand Cohort (SPLIT ENZ): Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study","Post Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) was defined by the Society of Critical Care Medicine in 2012 with subsequent international research highlighting poor long-term outcomes; reduced quality of life; and impairments, for survivors of critical illness. To date, there has been no published research on the long-term outcomes of survivors of critical illness in New Zealand. The aim of this study is to explore long-term outcomes after critical illness in New Zealand. The primary objectives are to describe and quantify symptoms and disability, explore possible risk factors, and to identify unmet needs in survivors of critical illness. This will be a mixed methods study with 2 components. First, a prospective cohort study of approximately 100 participants with critical illness will be followed up at 1, 6, and 12 months after hospital discharge. The primary outcome will be disability assessed using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale 2.0. Secondary outcomes will focus on mental health using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact of Events Scale-revised, cognitive function using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment-BLIND), and health-related quality of life using the European Quality of Life-Five Dimension-Five Level. The second element of the study will use qualitative grounded theory methods to explore participants experiences of recovery and highlight unmet needs. This study was approved by the New Zealand Northern A Health and Disability Ethics Committee on August 16, 2021 (21/NTA/107), and has been registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry on October 5, 2021. SPLIT ENZ is due to start recruitment in early 2022, aiming to enroll 125 patients over 2 years. Data collection is estimated to be completed by 2024-2025 and will be published once all data are available for reporting. Although international research has identified the prevalence of PICS and the extent of disability in survivors of critical illness, there is no published research in New Zealand. Research in this field is particularly pressing in the context of COVID-19, an illness that may include PICS in its sequelae.

"Prevalence and associated factors of depression and anxiety symptoms among college students: a systematic review and meta-analysis","To evaluate the global prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among college students and potential associated factors. PubMed and Web of Science were searched from their inception to March 28, 2021. Random-effects models were used to calculate the pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore potential heterogeneity. Egger's and Begg's test were used to assess publication bias. A total of 64 studies with 100,187 individuals were included in the present meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among college students was 33.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 29.3%-37.8%) and 39.0% (95% CI, 34.6%-43.4%), respectively. The highest prevalence of depression symptoms was found in Africa region (40.1%, 95% CI 12.3-67.9%), lower middle-income countries (42.5%, 95% CI 28.6-56.3%), and medical college students (39.4%, 95% CI 29.3-49.6%). For the prevalence of anxiety symptoms, the highest was observed in North America (48.3%, 95% CI 37.4-59.2%), lower middle-income countries (54.2%, 95% CI 35.0-73.4%), medical college students (47.1%, 95% CI 35.1-59.1%) and identified by Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (49.1%, 95% CI 31.0-43.0%). Besides, the prevalence of depression symptoms (35.9%, 95% CI 20.2-51.7%) and anxiety symptoms (40.7%, 95% CI 39.5-42.0%) was higher in studies conducted after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on oral health and psychosocial factors","The objective of this study was to investigate oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in times of the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine a possible association to psychosocial factors like psychological stress and symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders. Secondary research questions were whether people changed oral hygiene regimens during the COVID-19 pandemic and to what extent dental symptoms existed and developed compared to pre-pandemic. For this cross-sectional study a survey has been conceptualized to determine OHRQoL, stress, depression and anxiety and their specific confounders in a German cohort. Validated questionnaires as OHIP-G14, PHQ-Stress and PHQ-4 have been implemented. Altogether 1178 participants completed the survey between May and August 2020. The overall OHIP-G14 sum score of 4.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.5 indicated good OHRQoL. 21% of the participants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°248) reported toothache, 23% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°270) mucosal problems, 31% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°356) hypersensitivity of the teeth and 27% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°305) myofacial pain. The PHQ-Stress score (4.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.5) demonstrated a mild severity of stress. Depression and anxiety level has been mild to moderate (PHQ-4 score: 2.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.6). 38% of the participants stated subjectively greater emotional burden compared to pre-pandemic. Statistically significant differences exist for OHRQoL, stress, anxiety and depression levels between participants with greater, equal or less emotional burden compared to pre-pandemic. COVID-19 history and aggravated levels of depression, anxiety, and stress seem to associate with lower OHRQoL. Psychosocial consequences during pandemic times and their association to oral health should be further investigated.","Ciardo, Simon, Sonnenschein, BÃƒÂ¼sch, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-07907-9","20220317","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28645,""
"Comparing population-level mental health of UK workers before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal study using Understanding Society","The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected workers' mental health. We investigated changes in UK workers' mental health by industry, socioeconomic class and occupation and differential effects by UK country of residence, gender and age. We used representative Understanding Society data from 6474 adults (41Ã¢â‚¬â€°207 observations) in paid employment who participated in pre-pandemic (2017-2020) and at least one COVID-19 survey. The outcome was General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) caseness (score: Ã¢â€°Â¥4). Exposures were industry, socioeconomic class and occupation and are examined separately. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to estimate relative (OR) and absolute (%) increases in distress before and during pandemic. Differential effects were investigated for UK countries of residence (non-England/England), gender (male/female) and age (younger/older) using three-way interaction effects. GHQ-12 caseness increased in relative terms most for 'professional, scientific and technical' (OR: 3.15, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 2.17 to 4.59) industry in the pandemic versus pre-pandemic period. Absolute risk increased most in 'hospitality' (+11.4%). For socioeconomic class, 'small employers/self-employed' were most affected in relative and absolute terms (OR: 3.24, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 2.28 to 4.63; +10.3%). Across occupations, 'sales and customer service' (OR: 3.01, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.61 to 5.62; +10.7%) had the greatest increase. Analysis with three-way interactions showed considerable gender differences, while for UK country of residence and age results are mixed. GHQ-12 caseness increases during the pandemic were concentrated among 'professional and technical' and 'hospitality' industries and 'small employers/self-employed' and 'sales and customers service' workers. Female workers often exhibited greater differences in risk by industry and occupation. Policies supporting these industries and groups are needed.","Kromydas, Green, Craig, Katikireddi, Leyland, Niedzwiedz, Pearce, Thomson, Demou","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-218561","20220317","COVID-19; longitudinal studies; mental health; occupational health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28646,""

"Psychological distress among elderly surgical patients who had their surgery postponed during the COVID-19 pandemic","Many institutions withheld elective lists and triaged surgeries during the peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, older surgical patients have had to wait for rescheduled dates in a long waitlist. This study aimed to identify the psychological impact in these patients when they returned for surgery. This was a cross-sectional study which included 153 patients aged Ã¢â€°Â¥ 65Ã¢â‚¬â€°years undergoing elective surgery. Trained interviewers recruited and assessed psychological status pre-operatively with two validated questionnaires - Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Specific questions were asked about their postponed surgeries, appetite and fear. A total of 36 out of 153 (23.5%) patients had their procedures deferred during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Postponed cases were significantly based on the nature of surgery (p = 0.002), cancer diagnosis (p = 0.006) and surgical specialty (p = 0.023). Median HADS scores were higher for patients who were postponed (2.00 versus 4.00 for anxiety, p = 0.180 and 0.00 versus 1.00 for depression, p = 0.424) although no statistical significance was shown. In the whole study population, anxiety was a significant predictor for depression and vice versa (p &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) with other predictive risk factors for anxiety that were age Ã¢â€°Â¥ 85 years old (odds ratio [OR] 6.14, p = 0.018), female (OR 2.41, p = 0.024), cancer (OR 2.19, p = 0.039) and major surgery (OR 2.39, p = 0.023). Similarly, older patients Ã¢â€°Â¥ 85 years old (OR 10.44, p = 0.003) and female (OR 6.07, p = 0.006) had higher risk for depression. Both anxiety and depression were significant risks for loss of appetite (p = 0.005 and 0.001). Lastly, the fear of disease progression due to rescheduling was more frequent in cancer patients (p = 0.035). The mental health and disease burden of older surgical patients should be taken into careful consideration when cases need to be postponed in our healthcare system.","Loh, Chaw, Foong, Ramasamy, Zaki, Kuppusamy, Ong, See, Khor","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13741-022-00242-7","20220317","COVID-19; Depression; Elderly; Elective surgical procedures; Psychological distress, Anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28648,""
"A Call to Use the Multicomponent Exercise Tai Chi to Improve Recovery From COVID-19 and Long COVID","Approximately 10% of all COVID patients develop long COVID symptoms, which may persist from 1 month up to longer than 1 year. Long COVID may affect any organ/system and manifest in a broad range of symptoms such as shortness of breath, post-exercise malaise, cognitive decline, chronic fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, musculoskeletal pain and deterioration of mental health. In this context, health institutions struggle with resources to keep up with the prolonged rehabilitation for the increasing number of individuals affected by long COVID. Tai Chi is a multicomponent rehabilitation approach comprising correct breathing technique, balance and neuromuscular training as well as stress- and emotional management. In addition, practicing Tai Chi elicits the relaxation response and balances the autonomic nervous system thus regulating respiration, heart rate, blood pressure and vitality in general. Moreover, Tai Chi has been shown to increase lung capacity, improve cognitive status and mental health, and thereby even the quality of life in diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Hence, we advocate Tai Chi as potent and suitable rehabilitation tool for post-COVID-19-affected individuals.","Castro, Kierkegaard, Zeitelhofer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.827645","20220317","COVID-19; Tai Chi; chronic fatigue; mental health; multicomponent rehabilitation; quality of life; relaxation response","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28649,""

"The Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Daily Activities, Cognitions, and Stress in a Lonely and Distressed Population: Temporal Dynamic Network Analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown measures impacted mental health worldwide. However, the temporal dynamics of causal factors that modulate mental health during lockdown are not well understood. We aimed to understand how a COVID-19 lockdown changes the temporal dynamics of loneliness and other factors affecting mental health. This is the first study that compares network characteristics between lockdown stages to prioritize mental health intervention targets. We combined ecological momentary assessments with wrist-worn motion tracking to investigate the mechanism and changes in network centrality of symptoms and behaviors before and during lockdown. A total of 258 participants who reported at least mild loneliness and distress were assessed 8 times a day for 7 consecutive days over a 213-day period from August 8, 2020, through March 9, 2021, in Germany, covering a ""no-lockdown"" and a ""lockdown"" stage. COVID-19-related worry, information-seeking, perceived restriction, and loneliness were assessed by digital visual analog scales ranging from 0 to 100. Social activity was assessed on a 7-point Likert scale, while physical activity was recorded from wrist-worn actigraphy devices. We built a multilevel vector autoregressive model to estimate dynamic networks. To compare network characteristics between a no-lockdown stage and a lockdown stage, we performed permutation tests. During lockdown, loneliness had the highest impact within the network, as indicated by its centrality index (ie, an index to identify variables that have a strong influence on the other variables). Moreover, during lockdown, the centrality of loneliness significantly increased. Physical activity contributed to a decrease in loneliness amid the lockdown stage. The COVID-19 lockdown increased the central role of loneliness in triggering stress-related behaviors and cognition. Our study indicates that loneliness should be prioritized in mental health interventions during lockdown. Moreover, physical activity can serve as a buffer for loneliness amid social restrictions.","Haucke, Heinz, Liu, Heinzel","https://doi.org/10.2196/32598","20220317","COVID-19; EMA; cognition; digital health; ecological momentary assessment; emotional well-being; epidemic; lockdown measures; loneliness; mHealth; mental health; mlVAR; mobile apps; mood inertia; multilevel vector autoregressive model; network characteristics; network comparison; network model; outbreak; pandemic; permutation testing; protective factors; psychological response; risk; smartphone apps; stress; stressors; temporal dynamic network","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-18","",28651,""
