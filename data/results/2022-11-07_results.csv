"Quality of life questionnaires validate a remote approach to ophthalmic management of primary SjÃƒÂ¶gren's syndrome","Those with underlying autoimmune conditions were met with unparalleled challenges and were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, we aimed to measure the impact of the pandemic on symptoms and the health and vision related quality of life (HR-QoL, VR-QoL) in patients with Primary SjÃƒÂ¶gren's Syndrome (pSS). Nineteen (55.9%) participants returned questionnaires for analysis, (17 female and 2 male, 61.6Ã‚Â yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.9). There was no significant change in participants HR-QoL or VR-QoL, indicating that those with pSS remained resilient with regard to their physical and mental health throughout the pandemic. Furthermore, QoL was maintained despite 73.7% of participants having had outpatient appointments cancelled, delayed or rescheduled. Participants reported a lower QoL and feeling tenser in the COV19-QoL (3.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.4 and 3.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.3) representing feelings of apprehension and stress felt amongst the general population since the pandemic. Overall, and in spite of the concern caused by the COVID-19 pandemic for patients with autoimmune diseases, the health and well-being of patients with pSS remained stable. These findings strongly support the use of validated HR and VR-QoL questionnaires as an adjunct to the telemedicine consultation when assessing patients with pSS, offering an alternative to face-to-face consultations in post-pandemic era.","Greenan, Pilson, NÃƒÂ­ Gabhann-Dromgoole, Murphy","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-23676-x","20221106","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-07","",40345,""
"Moral Obligation to Follow Anti-COVID-19 Measures Strengthens the Mental Health Cost of Pandemic Fatigue","Background: It has been observed that people became gradually exhausted about the COVID-19-related information and preventive measures as the pandemic unfolds. This phenomenon is known as pandemic fatigue. Not only is pandemic fatigue averse to the prevention of COVID-19, a small but increasing number of studies have also found that it is related to poor mental health. This study extended this line of research by examining a novel yet understudied idea that moral obligation, a crucial motivation that drives people to follow the preventive measures, would amplify the association between pandemic fatigue and mental health problems. Methods: Participants were 937 Hong Kong parents (88% mothers, 62.4% aged 31â€“40 years). They participated in an online survey reporting on pandemic fatigue, moral obligation, and mental health problems (i.e., depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress). Results: Findings of moderation model analyses showed that higher levels of pandemic fatigues and moral obligation were related to more mental health problems. Importantly, these links were moderated by moral obligation, with those who felt more morally obliged to follow the preventive measures reporting poorer mental health than those who felt less morally obliged to do so. Limitations: The study was cross-sectional, which constrains the deduction of causality. Participants were only recruited from Hong Kong and females were over representative, thus limiting the generalizability of the findings. Conclusions: People who experience pandemic fatigue while feeling more morally obliged to follow the anti-COVID-19 measures are at greater risk of mental health problems. These populations need more support from practitioners.","Jian-Bin Li et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01A9-194-9F0","20221104","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; covid-19; self-determination theory; morality; mental fatigue; mental distress","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-07","",40346,""
