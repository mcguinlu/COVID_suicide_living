"Evaluating the Anxiety and Depression Status of Prostate Cancer Patients whose Operations were Postponed due to the COVID-19 Pandemic","In this study, we aimed to evaluate the anxiety and depression status of prostate cancer (PCa) patients whose planned operations in the urology clinic of our hospital, which is serving as a pandemic hospital in Turkey have been postponed due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. This survey study was conducted at urology clinic of Ankara City Hospital between March 1 and June 1, 2020 and included 24 male patients who agreed to answer the questionnaires (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI] I and II and Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]). Demographical and clinical data (age, time since diagnosis, total serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, risk groups according to the D'Amico classification system, smoking, alcohol habitus, major surgical history, and comorbidities) of the patients were collected from hospital software. The mean STAI-I score of the patients (46.7 Ã‚Â± 1.4 [44-49]) was significantly higher than their STAI-II score (41.7 Ã‚Â± 2.4 [39-47]) (p &lt; 0.001). The negative correlation between the decrease in age and STAI-I score was found to be statistically significant (r = 0.439, p &lt; 0.05). The mean BDI score of the patients was 4.3 Ã‚Â± 3.2 (0-13), which was compatible with mild depression. There was no statistically significant difference between the time elapsed from diagnosis, PSA levels, smoking and alcohol habitus, major surgical history and comorbidity status, and STAI-I, STAI-II, and BDI scores (p &gt; 0.05). Prostate cancer patients with postponed operations should be guided properly in order to manage their anxiety status especially young patients.","Kizilkan, Senel, Ozercan, Balci, Eroglu, Aktas, Bulut, Ozden, Tuncel","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14278","20210429","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Postponed operations; Prostate cancer","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13274,""
"Determinants of worry using the SARS-CoV-19 worry (CoV-Wo) scale among United States residents","We sought to develop a brief Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2-related worry (CoV-Wo) scale to understand COVID-19-related worry among adults in the United States. We also aimed to model key determinants of worry in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. A total of 806 participants completed an online survey in late March 2020. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses assessed scale structure. Factor analysis stratified by depression was used to assess measurement invariance. Linear regression models examined COVID-19-related worry determinants. The CoV-Wo scale exhibited good reliability (ÃŽÂ±Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.80) and a two-factor structure: health (ÃŽÂ±Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.83) and resources (ÃŽÂ±Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.71). The full scale and both subscales were higher among participants who stopped working due to COVID-19 and those with depression. Perception of quality medical care if infected with COVID-19 was associated with reduced worry. The CoV-Wo scale is a low burden assessment of COVID-19-related worry, that captures common worries in domains affected by COVID-19 and can be used to develop psychosocial resources.","Dayton, Schneider, Strickland, Latkin","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22577","20210429","community psychology; coronavirus; economic status; employment; food security; mental health; socioeconomic factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13275,""
"Lifestyle changes associated with COVID-19 quarantine among young Saudi women: A prospective study","Negative lifestyle behaviors are associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes from coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study aimed to assess lifestyle changes affecting weight, sleep, mental health, physical activity, and dietary habits prospectively from before COVID-19 to during lockdown. A total of 297 Saudi women, aged 19-30 years (mean age, 20.7 Ã‚Â± 1.4 years), were interviewed at two time points, before and during the quarantine. The data collected included anthropometrics, sociodemographic data, clinical history, food frequency questionnaire responses, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores, Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) responses, and Perceived Stress Scale measures. In addition, during quarantine, COVID-19 and nutrition-related information and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores were collected. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the indicators of weight gain and loss from before COVID-19 (baseline) until during lockdown. Although approximately half of the participants did not report a weight change, 30% revealed weight loss and 18%, weight gain. The variables associated with increased weight gain were self-quarantine since COVID-19 started (OR: 5.17, 95% CI: 1.57-17.01, p = 0.007), age (OR: 1.53, 1.03-2.28, p = 0.04), and stress at baseline and during lockdown (OR: 1.15, 1.03-1.29, p = 0.01; OR: 1.10, 1.01-1.19, p = 0.03, respectively). The variables associated with a reduced risk of weight gain were the GPAQ score during lockdown (OR: 0.16, 0.04-0.66, p = 0.01), coffee consumption (OR: 0.36, 0.19-0.67, p = 0.01), and total sleep time (OR: 0.70, 0.51-0.97, p = 0.03). While most young Saudi women experienced no weight change during the COVID-19 lockdown, one-third lost weight and a significant proportion gained weight. Factors associated with weight, such as stress, sleep hours, physical activity, and coffee consumption, highlight the need to carefully consider those at risk during future circumstances that may require lockdowns. These factors could also aid in implementing policies for future lockdowns and support those most at risk of gaining weight.","Al-Musharaf, Aljuraiban, Bogis, Alnafisah, Aldhwayan, Tahrani","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250625","20210429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13276,""
"COVID-19 pandemic effect on female sexual function","To determine the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on female sexual functions among Turkish women. The present study was performed by using the previous study data that was conducted before the pandemic to detect female sexual function by using questionnaires. Comparison of Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores in women during and before the pandemic. Participants were asked to fill questionnaire forms again. FSFI scores of the participants were higher before the pandemic, however, this finding was not statistically significant (21.8 vs 21.0, p = 0.27). BAI and BDI scores with high scores accompanied by anxiety and depression were found statistically significantly higher in the study (11.2 vs 13.3, p &lt; 0.01; 10.0 vs 13.7, p &lt; 0.01; respectively). BAI scores had a negative correlation with FSFI scores, however, BDI scores had not a significant correlation with FSFI scores in the present study (p &lt; 0.01, correlation coefficient = -0.302; p = 0.07; correlation coefficient = -0.183; respectively).

"Structural distress: experiences of moral distress related to structural stigma during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has taken aÃ‚Â significant toll on the health of structurally vulnerable patient populations as well as healthcare workers. The concepts of structural stigma and moral distress are important and interrelated, yet rarely explored or researched in medical education. Structural stigma refers to how discrimination towards certain groups is enacted through policy and practice. Moral distress describes the tension and conflict that health workers experience when they are unable to fulfil their duties due to circumstances outside of their control. In this study, the authors explored how resident physicians perceive moral distress in relation to structural stigma. An improved understanding of such experiences may provide insights into how to prepare future physicians to improve health equity. Utilizing constructivist grounded theory methodology, 22Ã‚Â participants from across Canada including 17Ã‚Â resident physicians from diverse specialties and 5Ã‚Â faculty members were recruited for semi-structured interviews from April-June 2020. Data were analyzed using constant comparative analysis. Results describe aÃ‚Â distinctive form of moral distress called structural distress, which centers upon the experience of powerlessness leading resident physicians to go above and beyond the call of duty, potentially worsening their psychological well-being. Faculty play aÃ‚Â buffering role in mitigating the impact of structural distress by role modeling vulnerability and involving residents in policy decisions. These findings provide unique insights into teaching and learning about the care of structurally vulnerable populations and faculty's role related to resident advocacy and decision-making. The concept of structural distress may provide the foundation for future research into the intersection between resident well-being and training related to health equity.","Sukhera, Kulkarni, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40037-021-00663-y","20210429","COVID-19; Marginalized populations; Moral distress; Professional identity formation; Stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13278,""
"Subjective cognitive failures and their psychological correlates in a large Italian sample during quarantine/self-isolation for COVID-19","The quarantine/self-isolation measures implemented to retard the spread of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may negatively affect the mental health of the population. The present study aimed to explore the impact of the psychological symptoms on the occurrence of cognitive failures in a large sample of home-dwelling Italian individuals during quarantine/self-isolation for COVID-19. We employed an online questionnaire using a virtual platform of Google Moduli. The questionnaire included an assessment of cognitive failures evaluated byÃ‚Â the Perceived Memory and Attentional Failures Questionnaire (PerMAFaQ) and of resilience, coping style, depression, anger, and anxiety. The online questionnaire was completed by 4175 participants revealing that about 30% of participants complained of cognitive failures at least sometimes during quarantine/self-isolation, whereas some respondents reported very frequent cognitive failures. Moreover, resilience was found to mediate the relationships between depressive and anger symptoms and cognitive failures. Although no difference was found on PerMAFaQ among smart-workers, non-smart-workers, and those currently not at work, people not working at the moment complainedÃ‚Â of more frequent cognitive failures. These findings indicate the need to implement psychological support intervention, particularly for vulnerable groups, to reduce anxiety, depression, and anger, and of psychoeducational interventions to enhance resilience reducing possible long-term cognitive consequences of the quarantine.","Santangelo, Baldassarre, Barbaro, Cavallo, Cropano, Maggi, Nappo, Trojano, Raimo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05268-1","20210429","Anger; COVID-19; Cognitive failures; Depression; Quarantine; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13279,""
"Caregiver Perceptions of Children's Psychological Well-being During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Understanding youth well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic can help appropriately allocate resources and inform policies to support youth. To examine caregiver-reported changes in the psychological well-being of their children 3 to 4 months after the start of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, and to examine the association of caregiver-reported COVID-19 exposure and family stressors with caregiver perceptions of child psychological well-being. This survey study used an anonymous survey distributed via email from June 24 to July 15, 2020, to 350Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 families of students attending public schools in Chicago, Illinois. The a priori hypotheses were that caregivers would report worsening in child psychological well-being during the closure period compared with preclosure and that exposure to COVID-19-related stressors would be associated with a higher probability of worsening child psychological well-being. Data were analyzed from September 10, 2020, to March 15, 2021. Outcomes were 7 mental health concerns and 5 positive adjustment characteristics reported by caregivers using a retrospective pre-post design. COVID-19 exposure and family stressors were also reported by caregivers. Among 350Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 families invited to participate, 32Ã¢â‚¬Â¯217 caregivers (10Ã¢â‚¬Â¯827 [39.3%] White, 8320 [30.2%] Latinx, 6168 [22.4%] Black; 2223 [8.1%] with multiple or other races/ethnicities) completed the survey on behalf of 49Ã¢â‚¬Â¯397 children in prekindergarten through 12th grade. Child-specific outcomes were reported for 40Ã¢â‚¬Â¯723 to 40Ã¢â‚¬Â¯852 children depending on the specific question. The frequency of caregiver endorsement of youth mental health concerns ranged from 0.1 percentage point (suicidal ideation or self-harm, reported by 191 caregivers [0.5%] preclosure vs 246 caregivers [0.6%] during closure; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) to 28.3 percentage points (loneliness, reported by 1452 caregivers [3.6%] preclosure vs 13Ã¢â‚¬Â¯019 caregivers [31.9%] during closure; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) higher after the end of in-person instruction compared with preclosure. Frequency of caregiver endorsement of youth positive adjustment characteristics ranged from -13.4 percentage points (plans for the future, reported by 18Ã¢â‚¬Â¯114 caregivers [44.3%] preclosure vs 12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯601 caregivers [30.9%] during closure; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) to -30.9 percentage points (positive peer relationships, reported by 24Ã¢â‚¬Â¯666 caregivers [60.4%] preclosure vs 19Ã¢â‚¬Â¯130 caregivers [46.8%] during closure; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) lower after the end of in-person instruction. Significant differences in COVID-19 exposure were observed across racial/ethnic (F3,27Ã¢â‚¬Â¯534Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°614.8; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and household income strata (F5,27Ã¢â‚¬Â¯506Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°842.0; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). After accounting for covariates, all mental health concerns increased in probability (eg, angry: odds ratio, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.48-1.62]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and all the positive adjustment characteristics decreased in probability (eg, hopeful or positive: odds ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.84-0.92]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) as COVID-19 exposure and family stressors increased. In this survey study of caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 and resulting exposure to stress were associated with worse youth psychological well-being, demonstrating the need for a comprehensive public health approach that prioritizes children's well-being and draws broad public attention to the mental health needs of youth.","Raviv, Warren, Washburn, Kanaley, Eihentale, Goldenthal, Russo, Martin, Lombard, Tully, Fox, Gupta","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.11103","20210429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13280,""
"The emotional impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in women facing infertility","People facing infertility are inevitably affected by COVID-19 pandemic, having to delay their parental projects. This study aimed to explore the emotional impact (depression and anxiety symptoms and perceived stress) of the COVID-19 pandemic in Portuguese women pursuing assisted reproductive technology (ART). Results showed 67.4% of participants were in confinement but were dealing with it in a reasonably positive way. Women who continued to work at their workplace presented significantly higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than those who stayed at home. No significant differences were found regarding depression and anxiety symptoms scores when comparing the current sample with an infertility reference sample and a community sample. Depressive and anxiety symptoms remained stable, but there was a significant decrease in perceived stress over the eight-week period. Although these findings do not suggest a worsening of psychological difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health professionals should be attentive to patients' long-term psychological consequences. It may be helpful to provide additional psychological support to women when restarting their ART treatments.","Galhardo, Carolino, Monteiro, Cunha","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1922721","20210429","Covid-19 pandemic; Infertility; emotional impact; fertility treatment suspension","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13281,""

"Well-being and sleep in stressful times of the COVID-19 pandemic: Relations to worrying and different coping strategies","The present study examined the relationships between emotional well-being (positive and negative affect), sleep-related variables (sleep quality, sleep duration, and change in sleep quality and duration compared to weeks before lockdown), and worrying about coronavirus disease (COVID-19) challenges during the beginning of the outbreak in Europe. In addition, four different coping strategies were investigated. The study was conducted in Germany with data from 665 participants (53.8% female; 18-73 years), who completed an online questionnaire in April 2020. The results revealed that COVID-19 worry was associated with impaired well-being and sleep. Meaning- and problem-focused coping were the most frequently used coping strategies, and showed positive associations with well-being and sleep. Social and avoidance coping were associated with decreased well-being and worse sleep outcomes. Three coping strategies showed moderating effects. People who worried more showed higher levels of positive affect when they used problem-focused coping compared to those who did not. Similarly, highly worried participants showed lower levels of negative affect when they reported using meaning-focused coping more often. In contrast, social coping increased the risk of high negative affect levels in worried participants. In conclusion, problem-focused and meaning-focused coping strategies seemed to be most effective in coping with COVID-19 challenges. This article is protected by copyright.

"Are opioid receptor antagonists adequate for &quot;Opioid&quot; overdose in a changing reality?","Deaths due to opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) continue to rise despite intense regulatory and professional actions. COVID-19 has only worsened this situation.<sup>1</sup> An opioid receptor antagonist (ORA) such as naloxone is the most common intervention for OIRD. However, with increasing overdose from highly potent illicit opioids and polysubstance abuse, appraisal of the adequacy of ORA seems warranted and timely. OIRD results from the binding of an excess number of agonist molecules to opioid receptors. Mechanistically, it makes sense to reverse this by displacing agonist molecules by administering an ORA. But realistically, the trend to higher-potency agonists and polysubstance abuse diminishes the effectiveness of this approach. We are left facing a crisis without a solution. For the increasingly common OIRD from highly potent illicit agonists and polysubstance overdose, ORAs are correspondingly less effective. Alternatives are needed-soon.","Peppin, Pergolizzi, Dahan, Raffa","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpt.13320","20210429","adverse effect; naloxone; opioid antagonist; opioid overdose; polysubstance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13285,""

The purpose of this study was to assess the psychological and lifestyle impact of the pandemic on Australian adolescents, using an online survey, administered during the outbreak. Self-report surveys were administered online to a sample of 760 Australian adolescents aged 12-18Ã‚Â years assessing impact on a range of domains including behaviour, education, relationships, lifestyle factors (exercise, technology use, and sleep), and mental health outcomes (psychological distress, loneliness, health anxiety and well-being). Results showed that three quarters of the sample experienced a worsening in mental health, since the pandemic began, with negative impacts reported on learning, friendships and family relationships. There were also high higher levels of sleep disturbance, psychological distress and health anxiety, relative to normative samples. Effects on mental health were worse among those who reported a previous diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety relative to those without no such history. Adolescents are already vulnerable to the onset of mental illness at this developmental stage, and the current research underscores the need to find rapid and accessible ways to support adolescent mental health during times of crisis.","Li, Beames, Newby, Maston, Christensen, Werner-Seidler","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01790-x","20210429","Adolescent health; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Pandemic; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13289,""
"Investigation on the Influencing Factors of Mental Health of Healthcare Workers for Aid in Hubei during the Outbreak of COVID-19","This study aimed to determine the factors that were related to the psychological health status of healthcare workers aid for Hubei after the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 1260 participants completed the Self-Rating Scale of Sleep (SRSS), the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), and the 9-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) via the online questionnaires, and their related experiences with COVID-19 were collected. The average SRSS score of all participants (25.13 Ã‚Â± 6.41) indicated a mild sleep problem, and the factors that influenced their sleep were the respondent's gender, whether they had patients who died under their care, their history of psychosis and whether their family members were infected with COVID-19. The average GAD-7 score of all participants (12.37 Ã‚Â± 4.89) indicated a moderate anxiety level. The main factors that influenced anxiety were the respondent's gender, years of work, history of psychosis, self-perceived health status, and whether their family members were infected with COVID-19. The average PHQ-9 score of all participants (8.90 Ã‚Â± 5.42) indicated a mild depression level. The primary factors that influenced depression were whether the respondent had nursed/treated severely ill patients in Hubei and whether they had a history of psychosis. During the outbreak of COVID-19, the symptoms of anxiety were prominent among healthcare workers in Hubei. Moreover, male workers, those whose patients died during treatment, those with a history of anxiety disorders and those whose family members were infected with COVID-19 reported more serious problems. Therefore, this particular group of healthcare workers needs to be monitored and provided with tailored psychological support.","Zhou, Du, Diao, OuYang, Kankanam Pathiranage","https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxab001","20210429","psychology; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13290,""
"A Flexible Transoral Robot Towards COVID-19 Swab Sampling","There are high risks of infection for surgeons during the face-to-face COVID-19 swab sampling due to the novel coronavirus's infectivity. To address this issue, we propose a flexible transoral robot with a teleoperated configuration for swab sampling. The robot comprises a flexible manipulator, an endoscope with a monitor, and a master device. A 3-prismatic-universal (3-PU) flexible parallel mechanism with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) is used to realize the manipulator's movements. The flexibility of the manipulator improves the safety of testees. Besides, the master device is similar to the manipulator in structure. It is easy to use for operators. Under the guidance of the vision from the endoscope, the surgeon can operate the master device to control the swab's motion attached to the manipulator for sampling. In this paper, the robotic system, the workspace, and the operation procedure are described in detail. The tongue depressor, which is used to prevent the tongue's interference during the sampling, is also tested. The accuracy of the manipulator under visual guidance is validated intuitively. Finally, the experiment on a human phantom is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the robot preliminarily.","Li, Gu, Xiao, Lim, Duan, Ren","https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2021.612167","20210429","COVID-19; Flexible parallel mechanism; Flexible robot; medical robotics; sampling robot; surgical robotics; swab sampling; transoral robot","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13291,""
"Inclusive Finance, Environmental Regulation, and Public Health in China: Lessons for the COVID-19 Pandemic","The slow-down of the Chinese economy and the depression in the global economy during the COVID-19 show that governments should provide stimulus packages. These policies should be inclusive in terms of financial gains. Using the panel data of 30 regions in China from 2006 to 2016, this paper uses the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator to analyze the impact of inclusive finance on public health. The results show that inclusive finance has a significant positive effect on public health. The performance of the eastern region is significantly better than that of the central and western regions. When we consider the combined effect of environmental regulation, the improvement effect of inclusive finance on public health is still significant, and the coefficient increases in the eastern region. Similarly, there is also a significant improvement effect in the central and western regions. Our findings reveal that environmental regulation promotes the beneficial effect of inclusive finance. Therefore, it is important to improve the inclusive financial development mechanism and enhance environmental regulation intensity for solving public health issues. Lessons related to the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed.","Liu, Guo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.662166","20210429","COVID-19; PPML estimator; environmental regulation; inclusive finance; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13292,""
"A Follow-Up Investigation of Mental Health Among Discharged COVID-19 Patients in Wuhan, China","<b>Objective:</b> To understand the mental health status and its risk factors among discharged COVID-19 patients during the first month of centralized quarantine and the subsequent home isolation. <b>Methods:</b> The scales of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to measure the symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, and depression in 782 COVID-19 patients during the first month of centralized quarantine (March 16 to 26, 2020) and then during home isolation (April 3 to 10, 2020). <b>Results:</b> During the centralized quarantine, the prevalence rates of insomnia, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were 44.37, 31.59, and 27.62%, respectively, and those during the home isolation decreased significantly at 27.11, 17.26, and 16.11%, respectively. In both waves, women showed a higher prevalence of symptoms of poor mental health compared to men, and middle-aged (40-59 years old) and elderly (Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years old) showed a higher risk of symptoms of poor mental health compared to the younger. In addition, the severity of COVID-19 revealed no significant relationship to symptoms of poor mental health, whereas, the interaction analysis revealed that those with other underlying diseases showed more symptoms of poor mental health during the centralized quarantine and a greater decrease during the follow-up home isolation. <b>Conclusion:</b> The discharged COVID-19 patients suffered from mental health problems such as, insomnia, depression, and anxiety, and this was especially so for women, the middle-aged and elderly, and those with underlying diseases, but along with the rehabilitation and the environmental change from centralized quarantine to home isolation, all the mental symptoms were significantly alleviated.

"Cognitive reappraisal and self-compassion as emotion regulation strategies for parents during COVID-19: An online randomized controlled trial","Parenting during pandemic restrictions places extreme demands on everyday family life, leading to increased stress levels for parents and distressed parent-child interactions. This RCT aimed to investigate whether cognitive reappraisal and self-compassion are helpful emotion regulation (ER) strategies to reduce individual and parental stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online intervention for parents was developed focusing on the application of ER strategies to pandemic requirements of families. A sample of 265 parents were randomly assigned to either cognitive reappraisal (CR; <i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 88), self-compassion (SC; <i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 90) or wait-list control (WLC; <i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 87) group. Interventions included two video sessions (day 1 and day 3) and three email reminders to transfer the application of ER strategies to daily family life (days 2, 4, 5). Parents' perceived individual stress and parental stress were assessed at baseline (T0), at T1 prior to the booster session on day 3, and at T2 (7Ã‚Â days after baseline). Significant decreases from T0 to T2 emerged for both primary stress outcomes in both intervention groups. Individual stress significantly decreased in CR compared to WLC at T2, but not compared to SC. No timeÃ‚Â Ãƒâ€”Ã‚Â group interactions for parental stress were found. However, mediation analyses suggested that parental stress was indirectly decreased via reductions in individual stress for CR compared to WLC at both time points. COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic to affect family life. Cognitive reappraisal as a brief online intervention can ease acute stress and strengthen the mental health of parents in acute crises.","Preuss, Capito, van Eickels, Zemp, Kolar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100388","20210429","Emotion regulation; Lockdown; Pandemic; Parenting; Stress reduction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13294,""
"Burnout syndrome in medical oncologists during the COVID-19 pandemic: Argentinian national survey","Burnout (BO) syndrome is a condition that results in physical and mental distress. The current COVID-19 pandemic is strongly affecting the mental health of the general population. We aimed to assess the incidence of BO among medical oncologists and determine factors associated with burnout levels during the current pandemic. A digital survey was created for this study. The Spanish-validated version of Maslach BO Inventory was incorporated to define BO. Social and demographic information was analysed to remove duplicated answers. A total of 188 Argentinian medical oncologists from 16 cities participated in the survey. The median age of the participants was 43 years (IQR 38-50) and a similar distribution between male and female was observed. At the time of the survey, Argentina was in the third month of strict lockdown. Most of the participants practiced in both public and private practice facilities (55.3%) and the majority reported more than 10 years of experience (53.2%). Twenty-five percent (43) of subjects reported high levels of DP, 39.9% (75) reported high levels of EE and 53.7% (101) reported low levels of PA. BO Maslach criteria were fulfilled by 14.9% (28). We compared this result with other burnout assessment tools. Using the Gil-Monte and Neira tool, BO-associated domains were altered in 77.1%, 42% and 42% for EE, DP, and PA domains, respectively. Concomitantly, under Neira assessment a domain impairment was appreciated in 77.1%, 76% and 54% respectively. BO criteria were met by 30.3% (57) according to Gil-Monte and 47.9% (90) to Neira. BO is a multifaceted issue with a negative impact on physicians, patients, and institutions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, BO criteria was met in a considerable proportion of survey respondents using MBI, and Peiro and Neiro tools and younger age, use of antidepressants and psychological medications and income reduction arose as statistically significant factors after multivariate analysis.","Guercovich, Piazzioni, Waisberg, MandÃƒÂ³, Angel","https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2021.1213","20210429","COVID-19; burnout; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13295,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on People Suffering with Epilepsy","Epilepsy is one of the most common problems in neurology clinical practice and currently we are in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. The coronavirus pandemic is an epidemiological and psychological crisis, which is likely to affect persons with epilepsy. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients with epilepsy and effects on their mental health. This was a cross-sectional web-based survey carried out at the department of Neurology at a tertiary care hospital. A questionnaire was designed in the local language using Google Forms to assess basic knowledge regarding epilepsy, coronavirus, effects of COVID-19 and lockdown on epileptic patients and also effects on their mental health. The link to the online survey was distributed via WhatsApp messenger to epilepsy patients. One hundred fifty-six cases were enrolled with 69.1% were below 34 years of age and male: female ratio was 1.2:1. Only 34.3% of the participants were employed and 50% of patients had an income of less than Rs. 3000 per month. Of the patients enrolled, 20.5% reported the &quot;devil&quot; and superstitions as a cause of epilepsy and only 10% of patients thought that tantric (holy priest) could treat the disease better than doctors. 53.8% of patients worried about getting COVID-19 and could not stop thoughts about being infected by coronavirus bothering them. 30.3% patients had increased seizure frequency during COVID-19 pandemic, of which the most common reason was that they forgot to take regular antiepileptic drugs (22.7%) or they had faced difficulty in obtaining medicine due to lockdown (12.1%). During the pandemic, 17% of patients reported depression symptoms and another 21% reported anxiety symptoms. The current COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected patients with epilepsy and increased seizure frequency, depression, anxiety, unemployment, and financial difficulty in obtaining medication.","Sureka, Gaur, Gupta","https://doi.org/10.4103/aian.AIAN_623_20","20210429","Anxiety; COVID-19; depression; epilepsy; seizure; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13296,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and well-being of UK healthcare workers","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant psychological impact on healthcare workers (HCWs). There is an urgent need to understand the risk and protective factors associated with poor mental well-being of UK HCWs working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Shortly after the April 2020 UK COVID-19 peak 2773 HCWs completed a survey containing measures of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and stress, as well as questions around potential predictors such as roles, COVID-19 risk perception and workplace-related factors. Respondents were classified as high or low symptomatic on each scale and logistic regression revealed factors associated with severe psychiatric symptoms. Change in well-being from pre- to during COVID-19 was also quantified. Nearlya third of HCWs reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression, and the number reporting very high symptoms was more than quadruple that pre-COVID-19. Several controllable factors were associated with the most severe level of psychiatric symptoms: insufficient personal protective equipment availability, workplace preparation, training and communication, and higher workload. Being female, 'front line', previous psychiatric diagnoses, traumatic events, and being an allied HCW or manager were also significantly associated with severe psychiatric symptoms. Sharing stress, resilience and ethical support for treatment decisions were significantly associated with low psychiatric symptoms. Front-line workers showed greater worsening of mental health compared with non-front-line HCWs. Poor mental well-being was prevalent during the COVID-19 response, however, controllable factors associated with severe psychiatric symptoms are available to be targeted to reduce the detrimental impact of COVID-19 and other pandemics on HCW mental health.","Gilleen, Santaolalla, Valdearenas, Salice, FustÃƒÂ©","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.42","20210429","COVID19; NHS; healthcare; healthcare worker; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13297,""
"Consultant psychiatrists's experience of the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on mental health services in Ireland","The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide threatening human health. To reduce transmission, a 'lockdown' was introduced in Ireland between March-May 2020. The aim of this study is to capture the experiences of Consultant Psychiatrists during lockdown and their perception of it's impact on Mental Health Services. A questionnaire designed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists was adapted and circulated to Consultant members of the College of Psychiatrists following the easing of restrictions. The questionnaire assessed the perceived impact on referral rates, mental health act provision, availability of Information Technology (IT), consultant well-being and availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Thematic analysis was employed to analyse free-text sections. Response rate was 32% (N=197/623). Consultants reported an initial decrease/significant decrease in referrals in the first month of lockdown (68%, N=95/140) followed by an increase/significant increase in the second month for both new (83%, N=100/137) and previously attending patients (65%, N=88/136). Social isolation and reduced face-to-face mental health supports were among the main reasons identified. The needs of children and older adults were highlighted. Most consultants (76%, N=98/129) felt their working day was affected and their well-being reduced (52%, N=61/119). The majority felt IT equipment availability was inadequate (67%, N=88/132). Main themes identified from free-text sections were service management, relationship between patients and healthcare service and effects on consultants' lives. The COVID19 pandemic has placed increased pressure on service provision and consultant wellness.

"Assessment of depression, anxiety and stress levels in the Ecuadorian general population during social isolation due to the COVID-19 outbreak: a cross-sectional study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic with serious consequences that have led to the implementation of unprecedented social isolation measures. At the early stages of the pandemic, Ecuador was one of the most affected countries in Latin America. The objective of this study was to assess the levels of depression, anxiety and stress in the Ecuadorian general population during the social isolation period due to COVID-19. A web-based survey consisting of 31 short-answer and multiple-choice questions was administered to the general population from April 22-May 3, 2020. Mental health status was assessed through the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21) questionnaire. Ordinal logistic analyses were used to identify potential risk factors associated with the severity of mental health issues. A total of 626 individuals were included. Most of them were females (60.5%), and their mean age was 29.6 Ã‚Â± 11.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. Approximately 17.7% of the respondents had moderate to very severe levels of depression, 30.7% had similar levels of anxiety, and 14.2% experienced stress. Female sex, younger age, student status, and having a relative diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Ordinal regression models showed that being a student was a risk factor for having more severe levels of depression (OR = 3.67; 95% CI = 2.56-5.26, p: 0.0001), anxiety (OR= 1.86; 95% CI= 1.35-2.55, p: 0.0001), and stress (OR = 2.17; 95% CI= 1.47-3.19, p: 0.0001). Having a relative with COVID-19 was also found to be a risk factor only for depression (OR= 1.70; 95% CI= 1.03-2.80, p: 0.036) and anxiety (OR = 2.17; 95% CI= 1.35-3.47, p: 0.001). Additionally, male sex, Ã‚Â older age, and having more children were found to be protective factors for the three conditions.

"Immediate psychological outcomes associated with COVID-19 pandemic in frontline physicians: a cross-sectional study in Egypt","The mental health of frontline healthcare workers is influenced by the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. This adversely affects their clinical performance and productivity. Therefore, it is important to recognize levels of anxiety, depression and identify the contributing factors. A cross-sectional study recruited physicians working at frontline positions in university teaching and isolation hospitals in the Mid Delta Region of Egypt from April to May 2020. Data was collected through an electronic online survey. Anxiety and depression levels were assessed using General Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire -Ã¢â‚¬â€°9 respectively. The study included 237 physicians, their mean age was 38.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and 58% of them were males. Overall, 78.9% and 43.8% of all participated physicians reported symptoms of anxiety and depression. 85% of respondents had children with a significant increase in the risk of anxiety (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20.2). This study revealed that poor sleep quality, being a resident physician, disrupted social life, and stigma exposure due to COVID-19, were significant mediating factors for the observed anxiety (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.53,3.28,0.18,1.56 respectively) and depressive symptoms (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.51,1.39,0.56,1.9 respectively).

"Fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality in patients undergoing haemodialysis","Patients undergoing haemodialysis may experience troubling symptoms such as fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality, which may affect their quality of life. The main objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality among patients receiving haemodialysis during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and to explore the contributing predictors. A cross-sectional and descriptive correlational design using Qualtrics software was performed. Data were collected using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the predictors that were associated with fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality. Of the 123 patients undergoing haemodialysis who participated, 53.7% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°66) reported fatigue, 43.9% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°54) reported anxiety, 33.3% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°41) reported depression and 56.9% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°70) reported poor sleep. Fatigue, anxiety and sleep quality (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05) were significantly associated with being female, and whether family members or relatives were suspected or confirmed with COVID-19. Logistic regression showed that being within the age group 31-40, having a secondary education level, anxiety, depression and sleep quality were the main predictors affecting the fatigue group. Fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality are significant problems for patients receiving haemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate interventions to monitor and reduce fatigue, psychological problems and sleep quality amongst these patients are needed. This can help to strengthen preparations for responding to possible future outbreaks or pandemics of infectious diseases for patients receiving haemodialysis.","Al Naamani, Gormley, Noble, Santin, Al Maqbali","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-021-02349-3","20210429","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Fatigue; Haemodialysis; Sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13301,""
"The Role of Event-Related Rumination and Perceived Social Support on Psychological Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from Greater Daegu Region in South Korea","Research on psychological distress from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has increased significantly, but the factors that can exacerbate or mitigate such distress have remained underexplored. To address the research gap, this study examined whether two types of rumination and perceived social support predict psychological distress during the pandemic. Participants were recruited from communities of the greater Daegu area (n=316) where the first massive outbreak in South Korea occurred and most residents underwent substantial disruption of daily life. They completed self-report questionnaires that included measures of psychological distress, event-related rumination, and social support. The hierarchical regression analysis showed that maladaptive intrusive rumination and perceived social support predicted increases and decreases in psychological distress, respectively, even when subjective severity of COVID-19-related experiences was controlled. Putatively adaptive type of rumination (i.e., deliberate rumination) was not a significant predictor concurrently. This is among the early endeavors to comprehensively understand risk and protective factors associated with an effective coping strategy against the COVID-19 crisis. Our results indicate that intrusive rumination aggravates but social support mitigates psychological distress during the pandemic, indicating that we can better adapt by differently attending to recent experiences and maintaining perceived social support.","Kang, Kim","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2020.0455","20210429","COVID-19; Intrusive rumination; Mental health; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13302,""
"Taking Risks to Feel Excitement: Detailed Personality Profile and Genetic Associations","This study mapped the personality and genetics of risky excitement-seekers focusing on skydiving behavior. We compared 298 skydivers to 298 demographically matched controls across the NEO Personality Inventory-3 domains, facets and 240 items. The most significant item-level effects were aggregated into a poly-item score of skydiving-associated personality markers (SPM; Study 1), where higher scores describe individuals who enjoy risky situations but have no self-control issues. The SPM score was associated with greater physical activity, higher rate of traumatic injuries and better mental health in a sample of 3,558 adults (Study 2). From genetic perspective, we associated skydiving behavior with 19 candidate variants that have previously been linked to excitement-seeking (Study 1). Polymorphisms in the SERT gene were the strongest predictors of skydiving, but the FDR-adjusted p-values were non-significant. In Study 2, we predicted SPM and E5: Excitement-seeking from risk-taking polygenic scores (PGS), using publicly available summary data from genome-wide association studies. While E5: Excitement-seeking was most strongly predicted by general risk tolerance and risky behaviorsâ€™ PGSs, SPM was most strongly associated with the adventurousness PGS. Phenotypic and PGS associations suggest that skydiving is a specific â€” perhaps more functional â€” form of excitement-seeking, which may nevertheless lead to physical injuries.","Liisi Ausmees et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623D-385-343","20210430","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; polygenic scores; skydiving; risk-taking; five-factor model; excitement-seeking","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13303,""
"Mental health literacy: a focus on daily life context for population health measurement","Background A core purpose of mental health literacy is to enable everyone from all walks of life to manage and maintain wellbeing in daily life. However, mental health literacy in daily life context is not adequately captured by existing measures due to a prevailing focus on â€˜mental disorder literacyâ€™. We developed three measures of mental health literacy in terms of knowledge, and attitudes that may evoke the use of this knowledge, of signs and actions in everyday life when mental health is affected by depression, anxiety and stress. Construct validation was performed to examine the suitability of these measures for population health surveillance. Methods In October 2019 Public Health England, funded by the UK government, launched a digital resource, Every Mind Matters, aimed at improving mental health literacy in the general population and empowering action around daily life stress and anxiety, mood, and sleep. Baseline data for evaluating Every Mind Matters was collected via an online survey of the general public (n = 3262 adults). For construct validation, we investigated dimensionality and hypotheses of logical associations with mental health literacy. Results Structural validation results lend credence to our claim that the primary influence on item responses to the three measures is mental health literacy. These responses show logical associations with knowledge about sleep hygiene, attitudes indicative of stigma towards mental health, and some indirect experience with mental health difficulties. Item response theory information plots showed that total scale scores are sensitive to a wide range of individual differences in mental health literacy. This means the three knowledge and attitudes measures can be administered to a diverse group of people for early screening purposes or to evaluate the impact of public mental health interventions. Conclusions To monitor societal changes in mental health literacy, population surveillance will need measures that tap into lay knowledge and attitudes about mental health in the context of everyday life using non-technical language of the general public. More contextually informed data are needed to construct sound measurement for steering empirical debates about mental health literacy in societies with high- and low-resource healthcare systems.","Kia-Chong Chua et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F0-56A-EF9","20210430","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; common mental disorders; mental health literacy; population survey","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","",13304,""
