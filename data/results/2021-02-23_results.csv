"Factors influencing self-harm thoughts and self-harm behaviours over the first 45 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: a longitudinal analysis of 48,446 adults","Background There is concern that the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath will result in excess suicides by increasing known risk factors such as self-harm. However, evidence on how pandemic-related risk factors contribute to changes in these outcomes is lacking. Aims We sought to examine how different adverse experiences and worries about adversity brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic contribute to changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours over the first 45 weeks of the pandemic. Method Data from 48,446 UK adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed across the first 45 weeks (1 April to 7 February 2021) of the pandemic. Fixed effects regressions explored associations between weekly within-person variation in five categories of adversity experiences and adversity worries with changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours across age groups (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, and 60+ years). Results More adverse experiences were more strongly related to outcomes than worries. Specific categories of worries and adversities had stronger associations with outcomes than others. The largest contributing factor to increases in both self-harm thoughts (odds ratio (OR) range = 3.38 to 4.00) and behaviours (OR range = 3.72 to 6.82) was physical or psychological abuse amongst all ages. Having had COVID-19 and financial worries were associated with increased likelihood of both outcomes, the latter being more consistently associated with outcomes than actual financial adversity. Conclusions These findings suggest that a significant portion of UK adults may be at increased risk for self-harm thoughts and behaviours during the pandemic, which is concerning given the link between self-harm and suicide. Policies currently place to protect and reassure citizens may be insufficient in assuaging fears and anxieties. Given the likelihood that as time goes on, the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic will accumulate, policy makers can begin adapting a variety of existing evidence-based suicide prevention strategies and other social policies to help mitigate its consequences.","Elise Paul; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.19.21252050","20210222","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",10989,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Psychological Distress of Medical Students in Japan: Cross-sectional Survey Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected medical education. However, little data are available about medical students' distress during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide details on how medical students have been affected by the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 717 medical students participated in the web-based survey. The survey included questions about how the participants' mental status had changed from before to after the Japanese nationwide state of emergency (SOE). RESULTS: Out of 717 medical students, 473 (66.0%) participated in the study. In total, 29.8% (141/473) of the students reported concerns about the shift toward online education, mostly because they thought online education would be ineffective compared with in-person learning. The participants' subjective mental health status significantly worsened after the SOE was lifted (P<.001). Those who had concerns about a shift toward online education had higher odds of having generalized anxiety and being depressed (odds ratio [OR] 1.97, 95% CI 1.19-3.28) as did those who said they would request food aid (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.16-3.44) and mental health care resources (OR 3.56, 95% CI 2.07-6.15). CONCLUSIONS: Given our findings, the sudden shift to online education might have overwhelmed medical students. Thus, we recommend that educators inform learners that online learning is not inferior to in-person learning, which could attenuate potential depression and anxiety.","Nishimura, Yoshito; Ochi, Kanako; Tokumasu, Kazuki; Obika, Mikako; Hagiya, Hideharu; Kataoka, Hitomi; Otsuka, Fumio","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/25232","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(2): e25232, 2021 Feb 18.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(2): e25232, 2021 Feb 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",10990,""

"Levels and factors of social and physical distancing based on the Theory of Planned Behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic among Chinese adults","Social and physical distancing is important in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and it impacts people's financial/social well-being tremendously. This study tested the application of the Theory of Planned Behaviors (TPB) to three types of social/physical distancing indicators (i.e., the number of close physical contacts on a single day in public venues, the frequencies of avoiding social gathering, and the levels of physical distancing in public venues). A population-based random telephone survey interviewed 300 Hong Kong Chinese adults in April 2020 when gatherings involving >4 people were banned. The participants on average made 15.3 close physical contacts (<1.5 m and for >3 min) in a day (5.0 in public transportation). About 80% practiced social distancing (avoided/reduced social gatherings) and physical distancing in public spaces (e.g., avoidance of going out, visiting crowded places, and gatherings of >4 people) but only 35.4% avoided using public transportations. Positive but not negative attitudes (inconvenience and lack of necessity), perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm were significantly associated with the three social/physical distancing outcomes. The data suggest that the levels of social/physical distancing were relatively high in the Hong Kong general population, and it, in general, supports the application of TPB to understand factors of social distancing for preventing COVID-19. Health promotion should take the findings into account. Furthermore, cross-cultural and time-series studies are warranted to compare the levels of social/physical distancing across countries and further explore their effectiveness in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yu, Yanqiu; Lau, Joseph Tak Fai; Lau, Mason M C","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibaa146","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Transl Behav Med;2021 Feb 18.; Publication details: Transl Behav Med;2021 Feb 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",10992,""
"Clinicians' Perceptions of Rapid Scale-up of Telehealth Services in Outpatient Mental Health Treatment","Background: Little is known about specialty mental health and/or substance use disorder (MH/SUD) clinicians' experiences transitioning from in-person to telehealth care, to treat a diagnostically diverse population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Survey of outpatient MH/SUD clinicians (psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, psychologists, and licensed clinical social workers; N = 107) at a psychiatric hospital. Clinician satisfaction and experiences using telehealth across a variety of services (individual, group or family therapy, initial assessments, evaluation and management, and neuropsychological assessment) were assessed using a mixed-methods approach. Results: Across services, a majority agreed/strongly agreed that telehealth provided an opportunity to build rapport with patients (67-88%) and they could treat their patients' needs well (71-88%). The interest in continuing to use telehealth when in-person visits resume varied by type of service provided (50-71%). Group therapy and initial assessment were lowest (50% and 51%, respectively). Clinicians noted telehealth improved access to care for patients with logistical barriers, competing demands, mobility difficulties, and medical concerns; but was more challenging to care for patients with certain psychiatric characteristics (e.g., psychosis, paranoia, catatonia, high distractibility, and avoidance), high symptom severity, or who needed to improve social skills. Telehealth influenced the therapeutic process (e.g., observations of family dynamic, increased patient/clinician therapeutic alliance). Discussion and Conclusions: MH/SUD clinicians who quickly transitioned to telehealth care during the pandemic were largely satisfied with telehealth, but also identified challenges related to specific patient characteristics, or types of MH/SUD services. These observations warrant additional study to better delineate the role for an expanded use of telehealth postpandemic.","Sugarman, Dawn E; Horvitz, Lisa E; Greenfield, Shelly F; Busch, Alisa B","https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0481","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Telemed J E Health;2021 Feb 18.; Publication details: Telemed J E Health;2021 Feb 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",10993,""

"The Effects of the Health System Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic on Chronic Disease Management: A Narrative Review","Background: Individuals with chronic conditions require ongoing disease management to reduce risks of adverse health outcomes  During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care for non-COVID-19 cases was affected due to the reallocation of resources towards urgent care for COVID-19 patients, resulting in inadequate ongoing care for chronic conditions  Methods: A keyword search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Scopus for English language articles published between January 2020 and January 2021  Findings: During the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person care for individuals with chronic conditions have decreased due to government restriction of elective and non-urgent healthcare visits, greater instilled fear over potential COVID-19 exposure during in-person visits, and higher utilization rates of telemedicine compared to the pre-COVID-19 period  Potential benefits of a virtual-care framework during the pandemic include more effective routine disease monitoring, improved patient satisfaction, and increased treatment compliance and follow-up rates  However, more needs to be done to ensure timely and effective access to telemedicine, particularly for individuals with lower digital literacy  Capitation primary care models have been proposed as a more financially-robust approach during the COVID-19 pandemic than fee-for-service primary care models;however, the interplay between different primary models and the health outcomes is still poorly understood and warrants further investigation  Shortages of medication used to manage chronic conditions were also observed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic due to global supply chain disruptions  Finally, patients with chronic conditions faced lifestyle disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in physical activity, sleep, stress, and mental health, which need to be better addressed  Interpretation: Overall, this review elucidates the disproportionately greater barriers to primary and specialty care that patients with chronic diseases face during the COVID-19 pandemic and emphasizes the urgent need for better chronic disease management strategies moving forward","Kendzerska, Tetyana, Zhu, David T.; Gershon, Andrea S.; Edwards, Jodi D.; Peixoto, Cayden, Robillard, Rebecca, Kendall, Claire E.","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S293471","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Risk Management and Healthcare Policy;14:575-584, 2021.; Publication details: Risk Management and Healthcare Policy;14:575-584, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11005,""

"Indirect acute effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and mental health in the UK: a population-based study","Summary Background There are concerns that the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK might have worsened physical and mental health, and reduced use of health services  However, the scale of the problem is unquantified, impeding development of effective mitigations  We aimed to ascertain what has happened to general practice contacts for acute physical and mental health outcomes during the pandemic  Methods Using de-identified electronic health records from the Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) Aurum (covering 13% of the UK population), between 2017 and 2020, we calculated weekly primary care contacts for selected acute physical and mental health conditions: anxiety, depression, self-harm (fatal and non-fatal), severe mental illness, eating disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, acute alcohol-related events, asthma exacerbation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, acute cardiovascular events (cerebrovascular accident, heart failure, myocardial infarction, transient ischaemic attacks, unstable angina, and venous thromboembolism), and diabetic emergency  Primary care contacts included remote and face-to-face consultations, diagnoses from hospital discharge letters, and secondary care referrals, and conditions were identified through primary care records for diagnoses, symptoms, and prescribing  Our overall study population included individuals aged 11 years or older who had at least 1 year of registration with practices contributing to CPRD Aurum in the specified period, but denominator populations varied depending on the condition being analysed  We used an interrupted time-series analysis to formally quantify changes in conditions after the introduction of population-wide restrictions (defined as March 29, 2020) compared with the period before their introduction (defined as Jan 1, 2017 to March 7, 2020), with data excluded for an adjustment-to-restrictions period (March 8â€“28)  Findings The overall population included 9 863 903 individuals on Jan 1, 2017, and increased to 10 226 939 by Jan 1, 2020  Primary care contacts for almost all conditions dropped considerably after the introduction of population-wide restrictions  The largest reductions were observed for contacts for diabetic emergencies (odds ratio 0Â·35 [95% CI 0Â·25â€“0Â·50]), depression (0Â·53 [0Â·52â€“0Â·53]), and self-harm (0Â·56 [0Â·54â€“0Â·58])  In the interrupted time-series analysis, with the exception of acute alcohol-related events (0Â·98 [0Â·89â€“1Â·10]), there was evidence of a reduction in contacts for all conditions (anxiety 0Â·67 [0Â·66â€“0Â·67], eating disorders 0Â·62 [0Â·59â€“0Â·66], obsessive-compulsive disorder [0Â·69 [0Â·64â€“0Â·74]], self-harm 0Â·56 [0Â·54â€“0Â·58], severe mental illness 0Â·80 [0Â·78â€“0Â·83], stroke 0Â·59 [0Â·56â€“0Â·62], transient ischaemic attack 0Â·63 [0Â·58â€“0Â·67], heart failure 0Â·62 [0Â·60â€“0Â·64], myocardial infarction 0Â·72 [0Â·68â€“0Â·77], unstable angina 0Â·72 [0Â·60â€“0Â·87], venous thromboembolism 0Â·94 [0Â·90â€“0Â·99], and asthma exacerbation 0Â·88 [0Â·86â€“0Â·90])  By July, 2020, except for unstable angina and acute alcohol-related events, contacts for all conditions had not recovered to pre-lockdown levels  Interpretation There were substantial reductions in primary care contacts for acute physical and mental conditions following the introduction of restrictions, with limited recovery by July, 2020  Further research is needed to ascertain whether these reductions reflect changes in disease frequency or missed opportunities for care  Maintaining health-care access should be a key priority in future public health planning, including further restrictions  The conditions we studied are sufficiently severe that any unmet need will have substantial ramifications for the people with the conditions as well as health-care provision  Funding Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowship, Health Data Research UK","Mansfield, Kathryn E.; Mathur, Rohini, Tazare, John, Henderson, Alasdair D.; Mulick, Amy R.; Carreira, Helena, Matthews, Anthony A.; Bidulka, Patrick, Gayle, Alicia, Forbes, Harriet, Cook, Sarah, Wong, Angel Y.

"Understanding Concerns, Sentiments and Disparities of Population Groups During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study Based on Large-Scale Twitter Mining","Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, its far-reaching impacts have been globally witnessed across all aspects of human life, such as health, economy, politics and education. Such widely penetrating impacts cast significant and profound burdens on all population groups, incurring varied concerns and sentiments among them. This study aims to discern the concerns, sentiments and disparities of various population groups during the COVID-19 pandemic through a cross-sectional study conducted via large-scale Twitter mining. The study conducted in this work consists of three steps: first, tweets posted during the pandemic are collected and preprocessed on a large scale; then the key population attributes, concerns, sentiments and emotions are extracted via a collection of natural language processing procedures; at last, multiple analyses are conducted to reveal concerns, sentiments and disparities of population groups during the pandemic. Overall, this study implements a quick, effective and economical approach for analyzing population-level disparities during public health events. The source code developed in this study is released for free public use at https://github.com/cyzhang87/EmulatedQuestionnaireOnTwitter. 1,015,655 original English tweets posted between August 7 to 12, 2020, were acquired and analyzed to obtain the following results. Organizations are significantly more concerned about COVID-19 (OR=3.48 (95%CI: 3.39-3.58)) and have more 'Fear' and 'Depression' emotions than individuals. Females are less concerned about COVID-19 (OR=0.73 (95%CI: 0.71-0.75)) and have less 'Fear' and 'Depression' emotions than males. Among all age groups (below eighteen, nineteen to twenty-nine, thirty to thirty-nine, and above forty years old), the attention ORs of COVID-19, 'Fear' and 'Depression' increase significantly with age. It is worth noting that not all females pay less attention to COVID-19 than males. In the age group of above forty years old, females are more concerned than males, especially in the economic and education topics. Besides, males above forty and below eighteen years old are the least positive. Lastly, in all sentiment analyses, the sentiment polarities over political topics are always the lowest among the five concern topics across all population groups. Through large-scale Twitter mining, this study reveals that meaningful differences regarding concerns and sentiments on COVID-19 related topics exist among population groups during the study period. Therefore, specialized and varied attention and supports are in need for different population groups. In addition, the efficient analysis method implemented by our publicly released code can be utilized to dynamically track the evolution of each population group during the pandemic or any other major events for better informed public health research and intervention.","Zhang, Xu, Li, Hu","https://doi.org/10.2196/26482","20210222","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11033,""
"A nationwide evaluation of the prevalence of and risk factors associated with anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms during the return-to-work period of coronavirus disease 2019 in China","To evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors associated with anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms during the return-to-work period of coronavirus disease 2019 in China. The authors conducted a large-scale, nationwide, multicenter, cross-sectional study in China. A population-based quota and snowball sampling were designed to recruit a representative sample. Online questionnaires and telephone reviews were used to collect characteristics and assess psychological and sleep problems. Anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms were measured by the generalized anxiety disorder-7, patient health questionnaire-9, and insomnia severity index tools. A total of 42,000 participants were recruited from 15 centers, and 36,795 valid questionnaires were received. Generally, 18.3, 14.9, and 17.9% of the participants had anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms, respectively, and 2.2-2.7% had severe symptoms.

Living in Hubei Province (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.304, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.242) was a common risk factor for anxiety and insomnia symptoms. Working as frontline medical staff (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.150) was another risk factor for anxiety symptoms. The health education rate of the samples reached 98.9%. However, the psychological intervention rate was only 16.2%, and 2.5% received targeted interventions. An increasing number of people might have psychological and sleep problems. However, the current psychological interventions are not sufficient.

"Factors Influencing Depression and Mental Distress Related to COVID-19 Among University Students in China: Online Cross-sectional Mediation Study","The COVID-19 epidemic may elevate mental distress and depressive symptoms in various populations in China. This study investigates the levels of depression and mental distress due to COVID-19, and the associations between cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial factors, and depression and mental distress due to COVID-19 among university students in China. A large-scale online cross-sectional study (16 cities in 13 provinces) was conducted among university students from February 1 to 10, 2020, in China; 23,863 valid questionnaires were returned. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to assess depression. Structural equation modeling was performed to test mediation and suppression effects. Of the 23,863 participants, 47.1% (n=11,235) reported high or very high levels of one or more types of mental distress due to COVID-19; 39.1% (n=9326) showed mild to severe depression. Mental distress due to COVID-19 was positively associated with depression. All but one factor (perceived infection risks, perceived chance of controlling the epidemic, staying at home, contacted people from Wuhan, and perceived discrimination) were significantly associated with mental distress due to COVID-19 and depression. Mental distress due to COVID-19 partially mediated and suppressed the associations between some of the studied factors and depression (effect size of 6.0%-79.5%). Both mental distress due to COVID-19 and depression were prevalent among university students in China; the former may have increased the prevalence of the latter. The studied cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial factors related to COVID-19 may directly or indirectly (via mental distress due to COVID-19) affect depression. Interventions to modify such factors may reduce mental distress and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Yu, She, Luo, Xin, Li, Wang, Ma, Tao, Zhang, Zhao, Li, Hu, Zhang, Gu, Lin, Wang, Cai, Wang, You, Hu, Lau","https://doi.org/10.2196/22705","20210222","COVID-19; China; depression; mediation; mental distress; online survey; psychological responses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11035,""
"Creating a Silver Linings Playbook","The intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic has tested the mettle of political, healthcare and public health leaders over the past year. Amid the unfolding events, healthcare leaders, including many nurses, have been pivoting, innovating, collaborating, safeguarding, inspiring and navigating - all the while informing the creation of an effective playbook to wage a counterassault for all of us. Despite all efforts, this previously unseen opponent has been unrelenting. Having been in the eye of the storm during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, my memories of the events remain vivid. It was a time rife with uncertainty and fear, forcing the creation of a playbook on the basis of the best evidence and common sense but without the benefit of a precedent. Over the course of several months, our leadership was challenged by efforts to contain the virus and mitigate the very real possibility of a globally emerging pandemic. However, SARS was but a microcosm of the present situation. The COVID-19 pandemic is not like any other crisis we have experienced in our collective lifetime. We can only imagine the toll of this pandemic when it is finally over. It will be measured in terms of post-pandemic posttraumatic stress disorder, deaths from COVID-19 and delayed care, and deaths by suicide among healthcare workers and citizens; in the end, it will not be trivial. Those contributing to the COVID-19 playbook have given their all, and we should be eternally grateful to every single one of them.","Nagle","https://doi.org/10.12927/cjnl.2021.26426","20210222","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11036,""
"Living with the risk of being infected: COPD patients' experiences during the coronavirus pandemic","To explore the existential significance of living with the risk of being infected with coronavirus in patients with COPD. Distancing measures aim to break the coronavirus transmission chains. Physical separation from social networks, and social isolation, are correlated with anxiety and depression. People with a chronic obstructive lung disease are particularly vulnerable due to the increased risk of a serious course of illness, so therefore many of them choose self-isolation to protect themselves from COVID-19. A qualitative exploratory study using individual semi-structured interviews. From June to September 2020, 13 participants were recruited through advertisements on Facebook as a convenience sample for semi-structured individual interviews. The interviews took place through virtual platforms or in physical meetings. Data were analysed using Ricoeur's phenomenological approach, involving naÃƒÂ¯ve reading, a structural analysis, and a critical interpretation strategy. The study has been reported in line with COREQ guidelines. Findings Living with the threat of being infected with coronavirus has greatly affected everyday life for patients with COPD. The nagging fear of coronavirus as a death threat was a dominant feeling, together with anxiety, loneliness and hope. With self-isolation followed concerns of being forgotten and thoughts of the future, balancing between fearing the worst, and hoping the best. Patients with moderate to severe COPD feel compelled to self-isolate, as they fear dying from COVID-19. The study revealed a need for proactive contact with health professionals to calm the patients' feelings of deprivation, loneliness, hopelessness and anxiety. Information about the patient's perspective may be used to develop targeted interventions aimed at giving adequate information, supporting hope, implementing digital or virtual solutions to keep in contact, and avoid the feeling of being alone and forgotten during a pandemic crisis.","Askov Mousing, SÃƒÂ¸rensen","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15727","20210222","COPD; Coronavirus; Covid-19; fear; hope; patient perspective; qualitative interview; self-isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11037,""
"Manifestations and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in neuroinflammatory diseases","To report initial results of a planned multicenter year-long prospective study examining the risk and impact of COVID-19 among persons with neuroinflammatory disorders (NID), particularly multiple sclerosis (MS). In April 2020, we deployed online questionnaires to individuals in their home environment to assess the prevalence and potential risk factors of suspected COVID-19 in persons with NID (PwNID) and change in their neurological care. Our cohort included 1115 participants (630 NID, 98% MS; 485 reference) as of 30 April 2020. 202 (18%) participants, residing in areas with high COVID-19 case prevalence, met the April 2020 CDC symptom criteria for suspected COVID-19, but only 4% of all participants received testing given testing shortages. Among all participants, those with suspected COVID-19 were younger, more racially diverse, and reported more depression and liver disease. PwNID had the same rate of suspected COVID-19 as the reference group. Early changes in disease management included telemedicine visits in 21% and treatment changes in 9% of PwNID. After adjusting for potential confounders, increasing neurological disability was associated with a greater likelihood of suspected COVID-19 (OR<sub>adj</sub> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.45, 1.17-1.84).

"GESTACOVID project: psychological and perinatal effects in Spanish pregnant women subjected to confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and confinement with movement restriction measures were applied in Spain. Postnatal mental disorders are common but frequently undiagnosed, being a risk period to develop anxiety and depression symptoms. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of confinement as depressive and anxiety symptoms in pregnant women (PrW) and puerperal women (PuW) mental health, as well as obstetric and perinatal outcomes during this period. The self-administered survey consists of a total of 28 questions, the first 16 providing contextual information and the following ones corresponding to the GHQ-12 that has been evaluated in a binomial form. A logistic regression model has been used to assess whether the contextual variables acted as a protective or risk factor and its fitting has been represented by a receiver operating curve. Of the 754 PrW interviewed, 58.22% were screened positive. Confinement time for these was 54.93Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.75Ã‚Â days. The risk factors that were identified after the refinement have been to have a worse general state of health, to be sadder and to be more nervous. Among the protectors have been found to have a higher Apgar 10 score and induction of labor. The area under the adjusted regression adjustment curve was 0.8056. Our results show a high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms with strict confinement measures.

"Face Mask Wearing Behaviors, Depressive Symptoms, and Health Beliefs Among Older People During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 100 countries. Despite the global shortage of face masks, the public has adopted universal mask wearing as a preventive measure in many Asian countries. The COVID-19 mortality rate is higher among older people, who may find that wearing a face mask protects their physical health but jeopardizes their mental health. This study aimed to explore the associations between depressive symptoms, health beliefs, and face mask wearing behaviors among older people. By means of an online survey conducted between March and April 2020, we assessed depressive symptoms, health beliefs regarding COVID-19, and face mask use and reuse among community-dwelling older people. General linear models were employed to explore the associations among these variables. Of the 355 valid participants, 25.6% experienced depressive symptoms. Health beliefs regarding the perceived severity of disease (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and perceived efficacy of practicing preventive measures (<i>p</i> = 0.005) were positively associated with face mask use. Those who reused face masks (<i>p</i> = 0.008) had a stronger belief in disease severity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), had poorer cues to preventive measures (<i>p</i> = 0.002), and were more likely to experience depressive symptoms. Mask reuse was significantly associated with depression only among those who perceived the disease as serious (<i>p</i> = 0.025) and those who had poorer cues to preventive measures (<i>p</i> = 0.004). In conclusion, health beliefs regarding perceived severity and efficacy contributed to more frequent face mask use, which was unrelated to depressive symptoms. Older people who had a stronger belief in disease severity had less adequate cues to preventive measures and reused face masks experienced greater depressive symptoms. A moderation effect of health beliefs (i.e., disease severity and cues to preventive measures) on face mask reuse and depression was observed.","Kwan, Lee, Cheung, Lam","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.590936","20210222","COVID-19; depressive symptoms; face mask wearing behaviors; health beliefs; older people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11043,""

"Identification and Management of COVID-19 Related Child and Adolescent Mental Health Problems: A Multi-Tier Intervention Model","Nepal is a low and medium-income country (LMIC), situated in South-east Asia, with a population of 29 million, of which, 40-50% are children and adolescents. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the lives of people around the world, including Nepal. The child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) needs and services in Nepal have a significant gap. CAMH in Nepal suffers from lack of specialized training in this field as well as scarcity of human resources and services. There is only one full-time child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) out-patient clinic in the country. Some recent activities have focused on CAMH in Nepal but the COVID-19 pandemic has produced new challenges. Access to mental health services for children and adolescents (C&amp;A) across Nepal has been adversely affected. Factors such as closure of schools, confinement at home, lockdown, transportation problems, uncertainty, loss of usual routine and fear of infection have affected the mental health of C&amp;A. This has highlighted a need to build capacity of available local human resources, enhance community support, teach measures of coping with stress and improve CAMH service delivery by strengthening the referral system, but these have to be addressed overcoming problems of travel restrictions and limited resources. To address these needs, online platform can be a suitable approach. With this view, a multi-tier CAMH intervention model was developed, which utilizes online platform for training mental health professionals across Nepal, who would then facilitate sessions for C&amp;A, teachers, parents and caregivers; and link them to CAMH services locally, and remotely through teleconsultation. This started as a pilot from June 2020 and will continue till end of February 2021, with the aim to reach 40,000 C&amp;A, parents, teachers and caregivers. As of Nov 2020, this model has been used to successfully conduct 1,415 sessions, with 28,597 population reached. Among them, 16,571 are C&amp;A and 12,026 are parents, teachers and caregivers, across all 7 provinces of Nepal.

"Impact of the recreational use of virtual reality on physical and mental wellbeing during the Covid-19 lockdown","The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about significant changes to most aspects of our lives. As a result of the quarantine enforced by governments and authorities worldwide, people had to suddenly adapt their daily routines, including work, study, diet, leisure and fitness activities to the new circumstances. A growing body of research indicates that the engagement with virtual reality (VR) activities can have a positive impact on users' mental and physical wellbeing. This study aims to evaluate the impact of VR activities on users under lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. An online survey was carried out to investigate the recreational use of VR during the lockdown period and to gather users' opinions on its impact on their physical and mental health. Non-parametric tests were used to evaluate the statistical significance of the responses provided by the 646 participants. The results of the survey show that VR use has significantly increased during the lockdown period for most participants, who expressed overwhelmingly positive opinions on the impact of VR activities on their mental and physical wellbeing. Strikingly, self-reported intensity of physical activity was considerably more strenuous in VR users than in console users. Given the current uncertainty as to the duration and course of the pandemic, as well as the possibility of intermittent lockdown in the upcoming years, the outcomes of this study could have a significant impact towards the development and deployment of VR-based strategies aimed at helping the population cope with prolonged social distancing, with particular regards to vulnerable individuals.","Siani, Marley","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12553-021-00528-8","20210222","Coronavirus; Covid-19; Fitness; Lockdown; Mental health; VR; Virtual reality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11046,""
"Self-Perceived Mental Health Status, Digital Activity, and Physical Distancing in the Context of Lockdown Versus Not-in-Lockdown Measures in Italy and Croatia: Cross-Sectional Study in the Early Ascending Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic in March 2020","The novelty of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is that it is occurring in a globalized society enhanced by digital capabilities. Our aim was to analyze the psychological and emotional states of participants in different pandemic-related contexts, with a focus on their digital and physical distancing behaviors. The online survey was applied during the ascending phase of the pandemic in March 2020 in two neighboring EU countries: Italy and Croatia. The study subjects involved four groups, two directly affected by epidemiological measures and two serving as controls-(1) participants from Italy who were in lockdown (Italy group), (2) participants from Croatia who were not in lockdown but who were in direct contact with an infected person and underwent epidemiological measures (CRO-contact group), (3) participants from Croatia who were in an analogous situation but not near the same infected person (CRO-no contact group), and (4) participants from Croatia who were not aware of any infected person (CRO-unrelated group). The survey consisted of validated scales of psychological and emotional states, and custom-made questionnaires on the digital (online) and physical (off-line) behavior of the participants. The Italy group in lockdown had higher self-perceived scores for depression, stress, post-traumatic intrusion, and avoidance, as well as the highest digital activity and physical distancing than the not-in-lockdown Croatian groups. The insight into the extent of online activities and off-line isolation allowed for the introduction of Digital Activity and Physical Distancing Scores. Self-perceived post-traumatic avoidance was higher in both the Italy and CRO-contact groups than the control CRO-no contact and CRO-unrelated groups, and higher avoidance correlated with higher Digital Activity and Physical Distancing Scores. Being in direct contact with the infected person, the CRO-contact group had no other alterations than unexpectedly lower post-traumatic hyperarousal when compared with the Italy group. The Italy group in lockdown demonstrated higher self-perceived psychological toll together with higher digital activity and physical distancing than Croatian groups not in lockdown, even when compared with the affected CRO-contact group. The study outcomes suggest that the general emergency measures influenced citizens in lockdown more than exposure to the virus through direct contact with an infected person.","KopilaÃ…Â¡, Hasratian, Martinelli, IvkiÃ„â€¡, BrajkoviÃ„â€¡, GajoviÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.621633","20210222","avoidance; depression; digital society; intrusion; pandemic (COVID-19); stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11047,""

For circus artists, the transposition of the work space to a home environment is not possible, which creates novel stressors that could lead to the exacerbation and escalation of mental health issues. The purpose of this study is to develop, implement and evaluate a holistic interventional program based on the socio-ecological model of resilience and operationalized through physical literacy. This will be a prospective longitudinal study with a retrospective comparison to data from a similar student cohort pre-pandemic. Interventions were designed using a population-specific, participant-based developmental model within a knowledge translation framework. The interventional program includes group webinars, small group information sessions, and one-on-one Zoom meetings, in addition to the distribution of electronic educational materials. The interventions will holistically provide psychological, physical, social, technical, artistic, and creative supports. Resources will be deployed throughout the closure period and through recovery, as transitions to return to training after prolonged hiatus will magnify known psychological and physical difficulties. Repeated, longitudinal assessment of students will be utilized to track changes over time at key transitions in the pandemic and school year and will be compared to a pre-pandemic school year. The framework for this program will be translatable to other performing arts and high-performance contexts. The program has implications for the mental health and overall wellbeing of artists and for cultural and economic recovery of the industry.","Stuckey, Richard, Decker, Aubertin, Kriellaars","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.577882","20210222","circus arts; human performance; physical literacy; psychological distress; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11048,""
"Influencing Factors of Psychological Well-Being of the Non-designated Hospital Staff in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> Recent studies report that hospital staff at the forefront of caring for COVID-19 patients experience increased psychological distress. To effectively manage the outbreak of COVID-19, China established COVID-19 designated and non-designated hospitals. To date, few studies have examined the impacts of COVID-19 on psychological health of staff working at non-designated hospitals. This study is to explore factors affecting psychological health of non-designated hospital staff in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Data were collected through an online questionnaire between February and March 2020. The questionnaire consists of General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-20), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), sociodemographic characteristics, employment history, health status, and contact history of COVID-19. The questionnaire was distributed through hospital WeChat groups and work colleague referrals. A total of 470 non-designated hospital staff members completed the questionnaire. Multiple Linear Regression analysis was used to interpret the associations among social support, coping styles, sociodemographic factors, job roles, and psychological status. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0. <b>Results:</b> The non-designated hospital staff differed significantly in anxiety and depression subscores of the GHQ-20 by their job roles, levels of social support, and history of mental disorders. Staff with medical job roles, good self-reported health status, no previous mental disorders, adequate social support, and positive coping styles scored lower in GHQ-20 total score, which indicated healthier psychological status. <b>Conclusions:</b> The results indicate that history of mental health disorders, non-medical job roles, and inadequate social support are associated with greater psychological distress. Personalized support should be provided to those who are vulnerable and in need of social and psychological support.","Yao, Lyu, Ma, Champ, Xiong, Li, Li, Mu, Hu, Gao, Jia","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.591026","20210222","COVID-19; coping style; non-designated hospital staff; psychological well-being; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11049,""
"The Relationship Between Mental Toughness, Job Loss, and Mental Health Issues During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Concerns toward public well-being and mental health are increasing considering the COVID-19 pandemic's global societal and individual impact. The present study builds on the current body of COVID-19 literature by examining the role of mental toughness (MT) in predicting negative affective states (depression, anxiety and stress) during the pandemic. The study also examined the effects of changes in employment on mental health and MT. Participants (<i>N</i> = 723) completed a battery of questionnaires including the <i>Mental Toughness Questionnaire 48-item, The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory</i>, and the <i>Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 items</i>. Participants reported relatively higher levels of depression, stress and anxiety in comparison to pre-COVID-19 samples from previous research, with respondents who had lost their jobs during the pandemic reporting higher levels of negative affective states. Despite this, mentally tough individuals appeared to report lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Moreover, moderation analyses identified some interaction between MT and employment status when predicting depression, anxiety and stress. Our findings suggest that MT may have some utility in reducing the adverse mental health effects of the pandemic on individuals, however, further longitudinal research is needed to support these implications.","Mojtahedi, Dagnall, Denovan, Clough, Hull, Canning, Lilley, Papageorgiou","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.607246","20210222","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; mental toughness; stress; unemployment (effects of)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11050,""
"Women pay the price of COVID-19 more than men","The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented event with wide-ranging implications. Given that households are at the center of major changes affecting the entire world, the <i>Review of Economics of the Household</i> is publishing a series of issues on COVID-19 and the economics of the household. Here we review eight articles documenting the enormous costs of the COVID containment policies, in particular the school closures that ensued. Individuals paid a heavy cost in terms of disruption in their attachment to the labor force. Children could not go to school and parents were forced to provide extra childcare and spend significant amounts of time helping children continue to learn, while possibly working from home. Domestic violence became more common. These changes have often been traumatic, to the detriment of the well-being and mental health of large numbers of people. Women have paid a higher price than men, as many of the studies demonstrate. Our conclusion calls for policy-makers to prepare for the post-traumatic period: many households will need help.","Croda, Grossbard","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11150-021-09549-8","20210222","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11051,""

"Impact of Lockdown on the Attitude of University Students in South India-A Cross-Sectional Observational Study","The whole world is under the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic which has put all nations in a unique lockdown situation to contain the disease. Though the environment got ameliorated with low pollution levels, this unexpected lockdown has taken a toll on humans' mental health. As the effects of lockdown can affect college students due to fear, anxiety and stress, this study intends to assess the attitude of the university students. An online questionnaire survey comprising 15 questions was conducted among four South Indian state university students. Their responses were recorded through Google Forms. The submitted responses were analysed using SPSS software version 17. In total, 1241 responses were recorded from university students belonging to various faculties. Though 43% considered this lockdown as a convenient break, 60% could not focus on their studies. The importance of renewing relationships was felt by 47%, and 83% tried to learn a new skill. Students from Tamil Nadu were looking forward towards a brighter future after the lockdown. This survey conducted in the early days of lockdown indicated that the university students were not anxious about the long-term effects of the pandemic but showed a decline in their academic performance.","John, P John","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12663-020-01501-0","20210222","Attitude; COVID-19; Coping; Lockdown; University students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11053,""
"Changes in emotions and worries during the Covid-19 pandemic: an online-survey with children and adults with and without mental health conditions","The novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has spread quickly worldwide with dramatic consequences on our daily lives. Adverse psychosocial consequences of Covid-19 might be particularly severe for children and adolescents, parents of young children and people with mental health conditions (mhc), who are more prone to the experience of psychosocial stress and who are more dependent on the access to professional psychosocial support. The present survey therefore aimed to explore perceived stress and the emotional responses of children and adolescents as well as adults with and without mhc during the social restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The survey gathered information about 284 children and adolescent (parent-on-child-reports) and 456 adults (including 284 parents, self-reports). The participants were allocated to four groups: children and adolescents with mhc, children and adolescent without mhc, adults with mhc and adults without mhc. The survey included general questions about socio-demographic characteristics and mental health status, the CoRonavIruSHealth Impact Survey and the Perceived Stress Scale (only data on adults). Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for comparing the emotional responses during the Covid-19 pandemic with emotions before the Covid-19 pandemic. Independent sample t-test were used to compare the level of perceived stress between the adult groups, linear regression analyses were conducted to examine which variables predicted perceived stress during the Covid-19 restrictions. An increase to the worse during the Covid-19 restrictions was observed for most emotions and worries in all four groups (children and adolescents with mhc, children and adolescents without mhc, adults with mhc, adults without mhc). Contrary to our expectations, a greater number of emotions worsened significantly for children and adolescents as well as adults without mhc as compared to those with mhc. We found higher perceived stress in parents as compared to adults without children in the same household and in adults with mhc as compared to those without mhc. Covid-19-related social restrictions and potential health risks seem to affect emotions and perceived stress in children, adolescents and adults. Especially, Covid-19 seems to be have worsened the mental well-being of children and adolescent and their families, who were mentally healthy before the Covid-19 pandemic.","Rothe, Buse, Uhlmann, Bluschke, Roessner","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-021-00363-9","20210222","Crisis; Family; Lockdown; Psychosocial stress; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11054,""
"Relation of severe COVID-19 to polypharmacy and prescribing of psychotropic drugs: the REACT-SCOT case-control study","The objective of this study was to investigate the relation of severe COVID-19 to prior drug prescribing. Severe cases were defined by entry to critical care or fatal outcome. For this matched case-control study (REACT-SCOT), all 4251 cases of severe COVID-19 in Scotland since the start of the epidemic were matched for age, sex and primary care practice to 36,738 controls from the population register. Records were linked to hospital discharges since June 2015 and dispensed prescriptions issued in primary care during the last 240 days. Severe COVID-19 was strongly associated with the number of non-cardiovascular drug classes dispensed. This association was strongest in those not resident in a care home, in whom the rate ratio (95% CI) associated with dispensing of 12 or more drug classes versus none was 10.8 (8.8, 13.3), and in those without any of the conditions designated as conferring increased risk of COVID-19. Of 17 drug classes postulated at the start of the epidemic to be &quot;medications compromising COVID&quot;, all were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 and these associations were present in those without any of the designated risk conditions. The fraction of cases in the population attributable to exposure to these drug classes was 38%. The largest effect was for antipsychotic agents: rate ratio 4.18 (3.42, 5.11). Other drug classes with large effects included proton pump inhibitors (rate ratio 2.20 (1.72, 2.83) for = 2 defined daily doses/day), opioids (3.66 (2.68, 5.01) for = 50 mg morphine equivalent/day) and gabapentinoids. These associations persisted after adjusting for covariates and were stronger with recent than with non-recent exposure. Severe COVID-19 is associated with polypharmacy and with drugs that cause sedation, respiratory depression, or dyskinesia; have anticholinergic effects; or affect the gastrointestinal system. These associations are not easily explained by co-morbidity. Measures to reduce the burden of mortality and morbidity from COVID-19 should include reinforcing existing guidance on reducing overprescribing of these drug classes and limiting inappropriate polypharmacy.

"The psychological effects of COVID-19 spread in young Canadian adults","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) not only threatens physical health but also psychological well-being. As a result of the pandemic, increased mental health burdens have been recorded in young adults around the world. We sought to understand the association of stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic with symptoms of psychological and emotional distress in young Canadian adults. Questionnaire respondents were asked about the extent to which they were personally impacted by COVID-19, and symptoms related to depression, anxiety, post-traumatic disorder, and emotional distress. Of 84 respondents, most identified as female (74%; 62/84). Overall, 61% (51/84) reported experiencing symptoms of psychological distress related to depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); specifically, 43% (36/84) reported anxiety-related symptoms, 33% (28/84) reported depression-related symptoms, and 6% (5/84) reported PTSD-related symptoms. Individuals with family in settings high risk for COVID-19 infection and individuals who received government aid with a reduction in income were 4.30-fold and 2.80-fold more likely, respectively, to experience symptoms of psychological distress (95% CI 1.31-14.14; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.013 and 95% CI 1.08-7.25; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.038, respectively).

We demonstrate a necessity to focus on alleviating the mental health burdens and contributing stressors within young Canadian adults. Though the mental health burdens are currently exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, they may persist after the pandemic ends if left unaddressed.","Gill, Du, Khan, Karimi, Sabharwal, Agarwal","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020988878","20210222","SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; distress; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11056,""
"Effect of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Pandemic and Lockdown on Body Weight, Maladaptive Eating Habits, Anxiety, and Depression in a Bariatric Surgery Waiting List Cohort","On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a &quot;public health emergency of international concern.&quot; The primary aim of the study was to evaluate weight and food habit changes during COVID-19 outbreak. The secondary endpoint was to explore the psychological factors, arising during the pandemic, influencing weight and dietary variations. A survey composed of four different items was conducted by telephone interview: (1) anthropometric data and type of procedure, (2) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), (3) maladaptive eating behaviors, and (4) personal feelings moved by the COVID-19 spread and lockdown. Fifty-six patients were enrolled. No significant changes in weight, BMI, and maladaptive eating habits were observed. A significant reduction in the anxiety index score was observed. In 17.8% of cases, a change in obesity class was reported, and among these patients, a substantial modification in bariatric procedures was planned (60%). This study showed no effect on weight and BMI nor on rates of maladaptive eating habits associated with quarantine/social isolation among severely obese individuals waiting for the bariatric surgery. At the end of lockdown, a considerable proportion of patients modified their initial obesity class, and in selected cases, it could represent a criteria for rearrangement of the planned bariatric procedure. In obese patients, the lockdown and social distancing generated a reduction of fear of confronting and being negatively judged by others. This psychological aspect was assessed with the reduction of the HADS score.","Albert, Losurdo, Leschiutta, Macchi, Samardzic, Casaganda, de Manzini, Palmisano","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-021-05257-5","20210221","Bariatric surgery, SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Maladaptive eating habits","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11057,""

"SUICIDE AS AN INDICATOR OF THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH IN UKRAINE (INCLUDING PERIOD OF COVID-19)","The aim: This article aims to analyze the rates of suicide as an indicator of public mental health, to consider the suicidal map of the territory of Ukraine (including to check the manifestation of such a territorial characteristic as the Albanian paradox); calculate the price of suicide for the socio-economic development of the Ukrainian state, consider the risks of suicide that have arisen as social and criminological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: The study is based on the analytical materials of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the WHO; the information and analytical data of the GeneralProsecutor's Office of Ukraine, the State Statistics Service of Ukraine and sectoral statistics for the period of 2015-2019, etc. The article is based on dialectical, analytical, synthetic, comparative, statistical, cartographic, and sociological methods of research and the method of potential demography. The theoretical basis of the article is specialized literature on medicine, suicidology, law, sociology, and cartography. Results: In Ukraine, the death rate from suicide in recent years averages 1.1% of the total number of deaths. The rate of suicide decline in Ukraine has slowed significantly over the past five years, which is an alarming symptom. There are almost strict proportions between male and female suicide (men commit four out of five suicides). The level of self-harm per 100,000 population of Ukraine remains almost stable, indicating a severe demographic crisis in Ukraine. Women in Ukraine are less likely to commit suicide than in European countries. In Ukraine in recent years, contrary to European trends, suicide has dominated among the elderly aged 65+. The number of years of potential life loss for male and female suicides in Ukraine is 103 thousand, and the number of working years is almost 100 thousand. The losses for Ukraine from the unlived life of those who died as a result of suicide in 2019 are almost USD 341 billion. Conclusions: In 2019, suicides accounted for almost 21% of deaths from external causes among Ukraine's population. The most intense suicidal situation is observed in the central part of the country's geographical map along the imaginary vertical axis &quot;North-South&quot; (Kherson, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhia, Kirovohrad, Sumy, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv regions).

"Refuting the myth of a â€˜tsunamiâ€™ of mental ill-health in populations affected by COVID-19: Evidence that response to the pandemic is heterogenous, not homogeneous","Background: The current study argues that population prevalence estimates for mental health disorders, or changes in mean scores over time, may not adequately reflect the heterogeneity in mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic within the population. Methods: The COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study is a longitudinal, nationally representative, online survey of UK adults. The current study analysed data from its first three waves of data collection: Wave 1 (March 2020, N=2025), Wave 2 (April 2020, N=1406) and Wave 3 (July 2020, N=1166). Anxiety-depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (a composite measure of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7) and COVID-19 related PTSD with the International Trauma Questionnaire. Changes in mental health outcomes were modelled across the three waves. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify subgroups of individuals with different trajectories of change in anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Latent class membership was regressed on baseline characteristics. Results: Overall prevalence of anxiety-depression remained stable, while COVID-19 PTSD reduced between Waves 2 and 3. Heterogeneity in mental health response was found, and hypothesised classes reflecting (i) stability, (ii) improvement, and (iii) deterioration in mental health were identified. Psychological factors were most likely to differentiate the improving, deteriorating and high-stable classes from the low-stable mental health trajectories. Conclusions: A low-stable profile characterised by little-to-no psychological distress (â€˜resilientâ€™ class) was the most common trajectory for both anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Monitoring these trajectories is necessary moving forward, in particular for the ~30% of individuals with increasing anxiety-depression levels.","Mark Shevlin et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A1-896-FBA","20210223","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; longitudinal; latent class growth analysis; covid-19; general popualtion; posttraumatic stress; mental health; depression; anxiety","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-23","",11060,""
