"Drug synergy of combinatory treatment with remdesivir and the repurposed drugs fluoxetine and itraconazole effectively impairs SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro","The SARS-COV-2 pandemic and the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) urgently calls for efficient and safe antiviral treatment strategies. A straightforward approach to speed up drug development at lower costs is drug repurposing. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting the host- SARS-CoV-2 interface via repurposing of clinically licensed drugs and evaluated their use in combinatory treatments with virus- and host-directed drugs. We tested the antiviral potential of repurposing the antifungal itraconazole and the antidepressant fluoxetine on the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in the polarized Calu-3 cell culture model and evaluated the added benefit of a combinatory use of these host-directed drugs with remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase. Drug treatments were well-tolerated and potent impaired viral replication was observed with all drug treatments. Importantly, both itraconazole-remdesivir and fluoxetine-remdesivir combinations inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles > 90% and displayed synergistic effects in commonly used reference models for drug interaction. Itraconazole-Remdesivir and Fluoxetine-Remdesivir combinations are promising therapeutic options to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe progression of COVID-19.","Ursula Rescher; Sebastian Schloer; Linda Brunotte; Angeles Mecate-Zambrano; Shuyu Zheng; Jing Tang; Stephan Ludwig","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342410","20201016","","bioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-17","",6097,""

"COVID-19: social isolation and optimism in sport","The purpose of this discussion is to explore communicative strategies that sport practitioners can implement during this unprecedented time of social isolation as a result of COVID-19  The goal of this discussion is to frame COVID-19 social isolation mandates as opportunities for coaches and sport practitioners to maintain mental health by revisiting their commitment to their players, to their teams, and to the industry of sport  Social isolation is a fundamental safety step that can limit the spread of COVID-19  However, research links prolonged social isolation with adverse health consequences including depression, poor sleep quality, impaired executive function, accelerated cognitive decline, and increased levels of anxiety  The social isolation that COVID-19 has thrust upon the world, including the sport industry, presents a paradox: Can social isolation manifest optimism in sport?

"COVID-19-RELATED ARDS PHENOTYPES AND PROGRESSION BETWEEN THEM: A CASE REPORT","SESSION TITLE: Fellows' COVID-19 SESSION TYPE: Fellow Case Reports PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: Since January 20th, 2020 when the first case of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in the United States [1], there have been several reports of the disease caused by the virus known as COVID19  In the recent literature there have been descriptions of two different phenotypes of the virus presentation among hospitalized patients and particularly those requiring mechanical ventilation  These phenotypes, known as â€œL typeâ€ and â€œH typeâ€, report what appear to be two distinct presentations with drastically different management which a patient can transition between [2]  We present a case of a patient with confirmed COVID19 who progressed through both phenotypes during his treatment consistent with these theorized phenotypes  CASE PRESENTATION: A 40 year old male presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and cough  Medical and social history was unremarkable  Workup initially showed patchy bilateral infiltrates, negative procalcitonin, fever of 103, and sats of 93% on 4L  The patientâ€™s respiratory status quickly degraded and he required mechanical ventilation  He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR  Initially the patient had subpleural ground glass opacities and low peep requirements before stress index became &gt;1  He developed dyssynchrony and required more peep causing higher pressure with worse compliance  Standard supportive care for ARDS was followed  After several days the peak and plateau pressures continued to be elevated  The patient was started on nitric oxide and flolan with paralytics  He returned to a high compliance state and was ultimately extubated and discharged  DISCUSSION: There are two phenotypes with COVID-19 ARDS  The first, L-type, has high compliance, low V/Q ratio, and low lung recruitability  It has been theorized that viral infection leads to interstitial edema with vasoplegia accounting for the severe hypoxemia  This leads to increased minute volume and a more negative intrathoracic pressure with little dyspnea  The increased negative intrathoracic pressure and high tidal volumes likely lead to edema due to inflammation and increased lung permeability  This leads to dependent atelectasis and increased work of breathing  It is unclear if this is from the virus itself versus and/or high-stress ventilation  The second, H-type, has decreased compliance and high recruitability  One of the crucial things to prevent progression from L to H type is controlling work of breathing  In community hospital settings this is hard to monitor  The patient's dyssynchrony caused a significantly negative intrathoracic pressure and resulted in a form of patient-self inflicted lung injury that caused the transition from L to H phenotype  Once this was controlled with paralytics, the patient returned to L-type and recovered  CONCLUSIONS: Control of the work of breathing in a patient with COVID-19 ARDS is critical in preventing progression between L and H phenotypes  Reference #1: 1  Holshue LH, DeBolt C, Lindquist S, et al  First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States  N Engl J Med  2020;382:929-936  Reference #2: 2  Gattinoni DC, Caironi P, Busana M, et al  COVID-19 pneumonia: different respiratory treatment for different phenotypes?

Participants  were  enrolled  into:  home-based  exercise  during  the  confinement  (HBE group, n = 34), physically inactive during (PIDC group, n = 28), and before the confinement (PIBC group, n = 27). The depression, anxiety, and stress scale - Short Form, the Pittsburgh sleep quality index, the Eating Attitudes Test, and the quality of life questionnaire were used to assess var-iables. The covariance analysis (covariable - gender) was used to compare variables among the groups. The effect size was calculated by Cohen ""d"" (ESd). The HBE group presented a better quality of life compared to both PIDC (p = 0.002, ESd = 1.26) and PIBC (p = 0.008, ESd = 1.00) groups. Anxiety (p = 0.004, ESd = 0.96), depression (p = 0.02, ESd = 0.65) and stress (p = 0.02, ESd = 0.72) were significantly higher in the PIDC group when compared to HBE group. Self-reported sleep quality was better in the HBE group than in both other groups (p < 0.05).

Methods A structured questionnaire was used to conduct a questionnaire survey of the research subjects through an online platform. The public mental health status was assessed using the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90). Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze related influencing factors. Results The survey included 1 078 eligible questionnaires, of which 252 (23.38%) were positive on the SCL-90 scale. For each SCL-90 factor, the highest positive rate was anxiety (41.28%), followed by horror (35.16%), and depression (33.21%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that from Hubei (OR=1.64, P=0.014), male (OR=1.37, P=0.036), medical related occupations or professions (OR=1.57, P=0.008), and high concern over the epidemic (OR=2.19, P=0.013) and known people with suspected or confirmed cases (OR=2.75, P<0.001) were risk factors influencing public mental health. Conclusion The mental health problems of the population during the epidemic of COVID-19 were serious, especially in Hubei.

"Poor appetite and overeating reported by adults in Australia during the coronavirus-19 disease pandemic: a population-based study","OBJECTIVE: As a result of the coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Australia adopted emergency measures on 22 March 2020. This study reports the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on appetite and overeating in Australian adults during the first month of emergency measures. DESIGN: This study reports analysis of data from the population-based, self-completed survey. The main outcome measure was an item from the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 asking: 'Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating?'. Data on sociodemographic factors, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations with poor appetite or overeating. SETTING: An anonymous online survey available from 3 April to 2 May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 13 829 Australian residents aged 18 years or over. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating in the past 2 weeks was 53Â·6 %, with 11Â·6 % (95 % CI 10Â·6, 12Â·6) of the cohort reporting poor appetite or overeating nearly every day. High levels of anxiety, concern about contracting COVID-19, being in lockdown with children and reporting a severe impact of the lockdown were associated with increased odds of poor appetite or overeating. CONCLUSIONS: Given the widespread prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating, universal public health interventions to address emotion-focused or situational eating during periods of lockdown may be appropriate.","Owen, A J; Tran, T; Hammarberg, K; Kirkman, M; Fisher, Jrw","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1368980020003833","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Public Health Nutr;: 1-7, 2020 Sep 25.; Publication details: Public Health Nutr;: 1-7, 2020 Sep 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-17","",6140,""
"Mental Health Practitioners' Immediate Practical Response During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Questionnaire Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased psychological distress, signaling the need for increased mental health services in the context of stay-at-home policies. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize how mental health practitioners have changed their practices during the pandemic. The authors hypothesize that mental health practitioners would increase tele-mental health services and that certain provider types would be better able to adapt to tele-mental health than others. METHODS: The study surveyed 903 practitioners, primarily psychologists/doctoral-level (Psych/DL) providers, social workers/master's-level (SW/ML) providers, and neuropsychologists employed in academic medical centers or private practices. Differences among providers were examined using Bonferroni-adjusted chi-square tests and one-way Bonferroni-adjusted analyses of covariance. RESULTS: The majority of the 903 mental health practitioners surveyed rapidly adjusted their practices, predominantly by shifting to tele-mental health appointments (n=729, 80.82%). Whereas 80.44% (n=625) were not using tele-mental health in December 2019, only 22.07% (n=188) were not by late March or early April 2020. Only 2.11% (n=19) reported no COVID-19-related practice adjustments. Two-thirds (596/888, 67.10%) reported providing additional therapeutic services specifically to treat COVID-19-related concerns. Neuropsychologists were less likely and Psych/DL providers and SW/ML providers were more likely than expected to transition to tele-mental health (P<.001). Trainees saw fewer patients (P=.01) and worked remotely more than licensed practitioners (P=.03). Despite lower rates of information technology service access (P<.001), private practice providers reported less difficulty implementing tele-mental health than providers in other settings (P<.001). Overall, the majority (530/889, 59.62%) were interested in continuing to provide tele-mental health services in the future. CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of mental health providers in this study made practice adjustments in response to COVID-19, predominantly by rapidly transitioning to tele-mental health services. Although the majority reported providing additional therapeutic services specifically to treat COVID-19-related concerns, only a small subset endorsed offering such services to medical providers. This has implications for future practical directions, as frontline workers may begin to seek mental health treatment related to the pandemic. Despite differences in tele-mental health uptake based on provider characteristics, the majority were interested in continuing to provide such services in the future. This may help to expand clinical services to those in need via tele-mental health beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Reilly, Shannon E; Zane, Katherine L; McCuddy, William T; Soulliard, Zachary A; Scarisbrick, David M; Miller, Liv E; Mahoney Iii, James J","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21237","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;7(9): e21237, 2020 Oct 01.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;7(9): e21237, 2020 Oct 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-17","",6141,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms Among University Students: Prospective Cohort Survey Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with common mental health problems. However, evidence for the association between fear of COVID-19 and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine if fear of negative events affects Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores in the context of a COVID-19-fear-invoking environment. METHODS: All participants were medical university students and voluntarily completed three surveys via smartphone or computer. Survey 1 was conducted on February 8, 2020, following a 2-week-long quarantine period without classes; survey 2 was conducted on March 25, 2020, when participants had been taking online courses for 2 weeks; and survey 3 was conducted on April 28, 2020, when no new cases had been reported for 2 weeks. The surveys comprised the Y-BOCS and the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS); additional items included questions on demographics (age, gender, only child vs siblings, enrollment year, major), knowledge of COVID-19, and level of fear pertaining to COVID-19. RESULTS: In survey 1, 11.3% of participants (1519/13,478) scored &#8805;16 on the Y-BOCS (defined as possible OCD). In surveys 2 and 3, 3.6% (305/8162) and 3.5% (305/8511) of participants had scores indicative of possible OCD, respectively. The Y-BOCS score, anxiety level, quarantine level, and intensity of fear were significantly lower at surveys 2 and 3 than at survey 1 (P<.001 for all). Compared to those with a lower Y-BOCS score (<16), participants with possible OCD expressed greater intensity of fear and had higher SAS standard scores (P<.001). The regression linear analysis indicated that intensity of fear was positively correlated to the rate of possible OCD and the average total scores for the Y-BOCS in each survey (P<.001 for all). Multiple regressions showed that those with a higher intensity of fear, a higher anxiety level, of male gender, with sibling(s), and majoring in a nonmedicine discipline had a greater chance of having a higher Y-BOCS score in all surveys. These results were redemonstrated in the 5827 participants who completed both surveys 1 and 2 and in the 4006 participants who completed all three surveys. Furthermore, in matched participants, the Y-BOCS score was negatively correlated to changes in intensity of fear (r=0.74 for survey 2, P<.001; r=0.63 for survey 3, P=.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that fear of COVID-19 was associated with a greater Y-BOCS score, suggesting that an environment (COVID-19 pandemic) Ã— psychology (fear and/or anxiety) interaction might be involved in OCD and that a fear of negative events might play a role in the etiology of OCD.","Ji, Guangjun; Wei, Wenjun; Yue, Kai-Chen; Li, Heng; Shi, Li-Jing; Ma, Jian-Dong; He, Chen-Yang; Zhou, Sheng-Sheng; Zhao, Zongya; Lou, Tao; Cheng, Jie; Yang, Shi-Chang; Hu, Xian-Zhang","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21915","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(9): e21915, 2020 09 30.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(9): e21915, 2020 09 30.; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Health Surveys; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Students/psychology; Students/statistics & numerical data; Universities; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety/epidemiology; Anxiety/psychology; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/psychology; Pandemics; Prospective Studies; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-17","",6142,""
"Pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes; A rapid literature review to explain COVID-19 behaviours","COVID-19 spread rapidly causing widescale loss of life and economic devastation. Efforts to contain it have resulted in measures such as closing of borders and restrictions around travel, social activities and attending places of worship. We conducted this rapid review to systematically examine, synthesize, and critically appraise the available evidence on the relationship between pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes. The methods were compliant with the PRISMA guidelines. The review was preregistered with PROSPERO (Registration #: CRD42020181576). A literature search was conducted from January 2010 to April 2020 using ProQuest, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, SAGE Journals, and CINAHL. Of 3844 articles identified, we included 11 quantitative articles in the final synthesis, representing data from 32,Â 049 individual respondents from eight countries. We identified three pandemics (COVID-19, MERS-CoV, Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09) as well as several psychological outcomes including anxiety, mental distress, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anger. We also identified several behaviours during pandemics and categorized them into protective, preparedness, and perverse behaviours. The review showed that even though there is limited evidence regarding pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes, the current findings showed that the psychological outcomes significantly impacted on the adoption of the pandemic-related behaviours. Given the negative effects of psychological outcomes on behaviours, we recommend that mental health professionals should promote mental health support to people exhibiting psychological distress resulting from similar events in the future. Also, we recommend that future research should test the hypothesized effects of pandemics and psychological outcomes on behaviour change.","Usher, Kim; Jackson, Debra; Durkin, Joanne; Gyamfi, Naomi; Bhullar, Navjot","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/inm.12790","","Country: AU; AUSTRÃLIA; AUSTRALIA; AUSTRALIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Nurs;2020 Aug 29.; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Nurs;2020 Aug 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-17","",6143,""
"Social Media Exposure and College Students' Mental Health During the Outbreak of COVID-19: The Mediating Role of Rumination and the Moderating Role of Mindfulness","In response to reports of people experiencing varying levels of anxiety and depression during the outbreak of COVID-19, researchers have argued that exposure to related information on social media is a salient contributing factor. Based on the integrated model of ruminative response style and the diathesis-stress model, it has been suggested that incorporating rumination and mindfulness may elucidate the potential mechanism underlying the aforementioned association. This study aimed to examine the mediating role of rumination and the moderating role of mindfulness in the association between social media exposure (SME) to COVID-19 information and psychological distress. The results from online questionnaire responses of 439 college students from two universities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, showed that rumination mediated the association between SME and psychological distress. Furthermore, mindfulness was revealed as a protective factor that buffered the adverse effect of SME on psychological distress through rumination. These findings advance a better understanding of the formation process of psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide insights regarding effective interventions for adverse mental health consequences in college students.","Hong, Wei; Liu, Ru-De; Ding, Yi; Fu, Xinchen; Zhen, Rui; Sheng, Xiaotian","https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0387","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw;2020 Oct 12.; Publication details: Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw;2020 Oct 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-17","",6144,""
"The mediation role of sleep quality in the association between the incidence of unhealthy movement behaviors during the COVID-19 quarantine and mental health","BACKGROUND: Our aim was to investigate the mediating role of worsening sleep quality in the association of the incidence of physical inactivity, high TV-viewing, and high computer/tablet use with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety. METHODS: Data of 45,161 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior survey, conducted between April 24th and May 24th (2020), were used. Participants reported physical inactivity (PI; <150Â min/week), high TV-viewing (TV; &#8805;4Â h/day), and high computer/tablet use (PC; &#8805;4Â h/day) before and during COVID-19 quarantine (exposures). For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without the risk behavior before quarantine. Changes in sleep quality during the quarantine period (maintained/got better or worsened) were treated as a mediator. Elevated frequencies of feelings of loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety (feel worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period were the study outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, skin color, previous diagnosis of depression, and adherence to quarantine. Mediation models were created using the Karlson Holm Breen method. RESULTS: The incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use were associated with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety feelings. Worsening sleep quality partly mediated the association of the incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use with loneliness (PI:30.9%; TV:19.6%; PC: 30.5%), sadness (PI:29.8%; TV:29.3%; PC: 39.1%), and anxiety (PI:21.9%; TV:30.0%; PC:38.5%). CONCLUSION: The association of the incidence of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors with mental health indicators is partly mediated by worsening sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine.","Werneck, AndrÃ© O; Silva, Danilo R; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Lima, Margareth G; Souza-JÃºnior, Paulo R B; Azevedo, Luiz O; Barros, Marilisa B A; Szwarcwald, CÃ©lia L","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.09.021","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Sleep Med;76: 10-15, 2020 Sep 25.; Publication details: Sleep Med;76: 10-15, 2020 Sep 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-17","",6145,""
"Gibt es ein Post-COVID-Syndrom?; [Is there a post-COVID syndrome?]","For critically ill COVID-19Â patients surviving the acute phase of the disease could possibly only mean having overcome the first stage of aÂ long and challenging path. Physical, cognitive and psychological consequences seem to be realistic; however, do residual symptoms in patients who have returned to microbiological normalization constitute aÂ post-COVID syndrome and which symptoms are principally possible in this context and are able to cause such aÂ syndrome? It is no novelty that critically ill patients often still sustain functional limitations over aÂ long period after discharge from hospital, in many cases even over many years. In most cases of COVID-19 it is too early for the diagnosis of a post-COVID syndrome. For this the symptoms would have to have lasted over a period of at least 6 months; therefore, only a post-infection fatigue can currently be spoken of. On top of this, even if patients recover physically they could be at particular risk of suffering from long-term mental health problems or perceive aÂ reduced quality of life. Such findings exist not only after ARDS as many intensive care unit patients sustain long-term disorders, which is also known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). To sum up, there is sufficient evidence for the possible existence of aÂ post-COVID syndrome or for the justification to correspondingly designate these possible sequelae with persisting symptoms in this way. In any case, all efforts that enable aÂ complete functional recovery and aÂ return to aÂ life after corona are justified.","Lamprecht, Bernd","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10405-020-00347-0","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Pneumologe (Berl);: 1-4, 2020 Oct 08.; Publication details: Pneumologe (Berl);: 1-4, 2020 Oct 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-17","",6146,""
"Factors associated with mental health outcomes across healthcare settings in Oman during COVID-19: frontline versus non-frontline healthcare workers","OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess and compare demographic and psychological factors and sleep status of frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in relation to non-frontline HCWs. DESIGN, SETTINGS, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOMES: This cross-sectional study was conducted from 8 April 2020 to 17 April 2020 using an online survey across varied healthcare settings in Oman accruing 1139 HCWs.The primary and secondary outcomes were mental health status and sociodemographic data, respectively. Mental health status was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and insomnia was evaluated by the Insomnia Severity Index. Samples were categorised into the frontline and non-frontline groups. &#967;2 and t-tests were used to compare groups by demographic data. The Mantel-Haenszel OR was used to compare groups by mental health outcomes adjusted by all sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: This study included 1139 HCWs working in Oman. While working during the pandemic period, a total of 368 (32.3%), 388 (34.1%), 271 (23.8%) and 211 (18.5%) respondents were reported to have depression, anxiety, stress and insomnia, respectively. HCWs in the frontline group were 1.5 times more likely to report anxiety (OR=1.557, p=0.004), stress (OR=1.506, p=0.016) and insomnia (OR=1.586, p=0.013) as compared with those in the non-frontline group. No significant differences in depression status were found between the frontline and non-frontline groups (p=0.201). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the differential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on different grades of HCWs. This study suggests that frontline HCWs are disproportionally affected compared to non-frontline HCWs, with managing sleep-wake cycles and anxiety symptoms being highly endorsed among frontline HCWs. As psychosocial interventions are likely to be constrained owing to the pandemic, mental healthcare must first be directed to frontline HCWs.","Alshekaili, Muna; Hassan, Walid; Al Said, Nazik; Al Sulaimani, Fatima; Jayapal, Sathish Kumar; Al-Mawali, Adhra; Chan, Moon Fai; Mahadevan, Sangeetha; Al-Adawi, Samir","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042030","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;10(10): e042030, 2020 Oct 10.; Publication details: BMJ Open;10(10): e042030, 2020 Oct 10.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-17","",6147,""
