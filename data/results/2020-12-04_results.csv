"Psychological screening and tracking of athletes and the potential for digital mental health solutions in a hybrid model of care: A mini review","There is a persistent need for mental ill-health prevention and intervention among 'at-risk' and vulnerable subpopulations. Major disruptions to humanity such as the COVID-19 pandemic present an opportunity for a better understanding of the experience of stressors and vulnerability. Faster and better ways of psychological screening and tracking are more generally required in response to the increased demand upon mental health care services. The argument that mental and physical health should be considered together as part of a biopsychosocial approach is garnering acceptance in elite athlete literature. However, the sporting population are unique in that there is an existing stigma of mental health, an under-recognition of mental ill-health as well as engagement difficulties which have hindered research, prevention and intervention efforts. To summarize and evaluate the literature on athletes' increased vulnerability to mental ill-health, and digital mental health solutions as a complement to prevention and intervention. To show relationships between athlete mental health problems and resilience as well as digital mental health screening and tracking and faster and better treatment algorithms. Mini review. Consensus statements and systematic reviews indicated that elite athletes have comparable rates of mental ill-health prevalence as the general population. However, peculiar subgroups require disentangling. Innovative expansion of data collection and analytics is required to respond to engagement issues and advance research and treatment programs in the process. Digital platforms, machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence are useful for mental health screening and tracking in various subpopulations. It is necessary to determine appropriate conditions for algorithms for utilization in recommendations. Partnered with real-time automation and machine learning models, valid and reliable behavior sensing and digital mental health screening and tracking tools have the potential to drive a consolidated, measurable and balanced risk assessment and management strategy for the prevention and intervention of the sequelae of mental ill-health. Athletes are an 'at-risk' subpopulation for mental health problems. However, a subgroup of high-level athletes displayed a resilience which helps them to positively adjust after a period of 'overwhelming' stress. Further consideration of stress and adjustments in brief screening tools is recommended to validate this finding. There is an unrealized potential for broadening the scope of mental health especially symptom and disorder interpretation. Digital platforms for psychological screening and tracking have been widely utilized among general populations but there is yet to be an eminent athlete version. Sport in combination with mental health education should address the barriers to seeking help by increasing awareness of the range of mental ill-health through to positive functioning. A hybrid model of care is recommended, combining traditional face-to-face approaches along with innovative and evaluated digital technologies that may be utilized in prevention and early intervention strategies.","Balcombe, De Leo","https://doi.org/10.2196/22755","20201203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-04","",7801,""
"Factors associated with fears due to COVID-19: A scleroderma patient-centered intervention network (SPIN) COVID-19 cohort study","No studies have examined factors associated with fear in any group of people vulnerable during COVID-19 due to pre-existing medical conditions. To investigate factors associated with fear of consequences of COVID-19 among people living with a pre-existing medical condition, the autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma), including country. Pre-COVID-19 data from the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network (SPIN) Cohort were linked to COVID-19 data collected in April 2020. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess factors associated with continuous scores of the 10-item COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire for Chronic Medical Conditions, controlling for pre-COVID-19 anxiety symptoms. Compared to France (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯156), COVID-19 Fear scores among participants from the United Kingdom (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯50) were 0.12 SD (95% CI 0.03 to 0.21) higher; scores for Canada (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯97) and the United States (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯128) were higher, but not statistically significant. Greater interference of breathing problems was associated with higher fears due to COVID-19 (Standardized regression coefficientÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.23). Participants with higher financial resources adequacy scores had lower COVID-19 Fear scores (Standardized coefficientÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.18, 95% CI -0.28 to -0.09). Fears due to COVID-19 were associated with clinical and functional vulnerabilities in this chronically ill population. This suggests that interventions may benefit from addressing specific clinical issues that apply to specific populations. Financial resources, health policies and political influences may also be important. The needs of people living with chronic illness during a pandemic may differ depending on the social and political context in which they live.","Wu, Kwakkenbos, Henry, Carrier, Gagarine, Harb, Bourgeault, Tao, Carboni-JimÃƒÂ©nez, Negeri, Patten, Bartlett, Mouthon, Varga, Benedetti, Thombs, FortunÃƒÂ©, Gietzen, Guillot, Lewis, Richard, SauvÃƒÂ©, Welling, Fligelstone, Gottesman, Leite, PÃƒÂ©rez, Baron, Malcarne, Mayes, Nielson, Riggs, Assassi, Ells, van den Ende, Frech, Harel, Hinchcliff, Hudson, Johnson, Larche, Nguyen, Pope, Rannou, Reyna, Schouffoer, Suarez-Almazor, Agard, Albert, Bernstein, Berthier, Bissonnette, Bruns, Carreira, Chaigne, Chung, Correia, Denton, Domsic, Dunne, Dunogue, Farge-Bancel, Fortin, Gordon, Granel-Rey, Hatron, Herrick, Hoa, Jones, Fernandes, Kafaja, Khalidi, Launay, Manning, Marie, Martin, Mekinian, Melchor, Nikpour, Olagne, Proudman, RÃƒÂ©gent, RiviÃƒÂ¨re, Robinson, Rodriguez, Roux, Sobanski, Steen, Sutton, Thorne, Wilcox, Ayala, Carboni-JimÃƒÂ©nez, Gagarine, Nordlund, ÃƒËœstbÃƒÂ¸, Rice, Turner, Culos-Reed, Dyas, El-Baalbaki, Hebblethwaite, Bustamante, Duchek, Ellis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110314","20201203","Anxiety; COVID-19; Chronic medical condition; Fear; Mental health; Scleroderma; Systemic sclerosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-04","",7802,""
"When helping hurts: COVID-19 critical incident involvement and resource depletion in health care workers","A focus on helping others is generally lauded, particularly in medicine, but in the context of a pandemic when health care professionals are facing increased risk, loss, and trauma, this focus can potentially be detrimental. In this study, we sought to (a) examine if health care workers intensely involved in the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are experiencing negative psychological and emotional outcomes, and (b) investigate if helping related factors (prosocial motivation and perceived prosocial impact) exacerbate and mitigate relationships to negative outcomes in a crisis situation. Using data collected from doctors and nurses before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine the relationship between intensity of involvement in the COVID-19 pandemic response and emotional exhaustion and depression, as well as the moderating effects of prosocial motivation and perceived prosocial impact. Data was collected at three time points (T1 and T2 prepandemic, and T3 during COVID-19), with prosocial motivation and controls collected at T1/T2 and predictors and outcomes collected during the pandemic. We find that intensity of involvement does associate with emotional exhaustion at work and that higher prosocial motivation exacerbates this relationship. Supplemental analyses suggest that the exposure to self-dimension of involvement is positively associated with emotional exhaustion and depression. Understanding the roles of prosocial motivation and prosocial impact in managing regulatory resources has important ramifications for health care workers on the frontlines of health crises responses, as these resources are necessary to manage the associated trauma.

"COVID-19 is Having A Destructive Impact On Healthcare Workers' Mental Wellbeing","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may aggravate workplace conditions that impact healthcare workers' mental health. However, it can also place other stresses on workers outside of their work. This study determines the effect of COVID-19 on symptoms of negative and positive mental health and the workforce's experience with various sources of support. Effect modification by demographic variables was also studied. A cross-sectional survey study, conducted between April 2nd and May 4th 2020 (2 waves), led to a convenience sample of 4509 healthcare workers in Flanders (Belgium), including paramedics (40.6%), nurses (33.4%), doctors (13.4%) and management staff (12.2%). About three in four were employed in university and acute hospitals (29.6%), primary care practices (25.7%), residential care centers (21.3%) or care sites for disabled and mental healthcare. In each of the two waves, participants were asked how frequently (on a scale of 0 to 10) they experienced positive and negative mental health symptoms during normal circumstances and during last week, referred to as before and during COVID-19, respectively. These symptoms were stress, hypervigilance, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, unable to relax, fear, irregular lifestyle, flashback, difficulty concentrating, feeling unhappy and dejected, failing to recognize their own emotional response, doubting knowledge and skills, and feeling uncomfortable within the team. Associations between COVID-19 and mental health symptoms were estimated by cumulative logit models and reported as odds ratios. The needed support was our secondary outcome and was reported as the degree to which healthcare workers relied on sources of support and how they experienced them. All symptoms were significantly more pronounced during versus before COVID-19. For hypervigilance there was a twelvefold odds (OR 12.24, 95% CI 11.11-13.49) during versus before COVID-19. Positive professional symptoms such as the feeling that one can make a difference were less frequently experienced. The association between COVID-19 and mental health was generally strongest for the age group 30-49 years, females, nurses, and residential care centers. Healthcare workers reported to rely on support from relatives and peers. A considerable proportion, respectively 18% and 27%, reported the need for professional guidance from psychologists and more support from their leadership. The toll of the crisis has been heavy on healthcare workers. Those who carry leadership positions at an organizational or system level should take this opportunity to develop targeted strategies to mitigate key stressors of healthcare workers' mental wellbeing.","Vanhaecht, Seys, Bruyneel, Cox, Kaesemans, Cloet, Van den Broeck, Cools, De Witte, Lowet, Hellings, Bilsen, Lemmens, Claes","https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzaa158","20201203","COVID-19; Corona; Mental health; Pandemic; Professions; Workforce and workload","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-04","",7804,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the wellbeing of Irish Men's Shed members","COVID-19 disproportionately affects males especially those who are older and more socio-economically disadvantaged. This study assessed wellbeing outcomes among men's shed members (Shedders) in Ireland at baseline (T1), 3 (T2), 6 (T3) and 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months (T4) in response to a 10-week health promotion program 'Sheds for Life' (SFL). Two cohorts participated in SFL commencing in March and September 2019. This study compares the T3 findings from one cohort carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic [COVID cohort (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°185)] with T3 findings from a comparator cohort [pre-COVID cohort (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°195)], completed pre-COVID-19. Questionnaires assessing wellbeing [life satisfaction, mental health, loneliness, physical activity (PA), self-rated health and other lifestyle measures] were analyzed in both cohorts T1, T2 and T3. Self-rated Health and life satisfaction decreased in the COVID cohort at T3 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), while loneliness scores increased (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0005). Higher loneliness scores were correlated with lower health ratings, life satisfaction and PA during COVID-19 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Days PA decreased in the COVID cluster at T3 from T2 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) with those in urban areas reporting lower activity levels than rural areas (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Those sufficiently active at baseline managed to maintain PA during COVID-19 while those not meeting guidelines were more likely to report decreases (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Shedders experiencing COVID-19 restrictions are at an increased risk of poorer wellbeing and increased levels of loneliness. Support and guidance are needed to safely encourage this cohort back into men's sheds, settings that protect against loneliness and positively promote health and wellbeing. Lay summary The COVID-19 pandemic will have wide-reaching implications on wellbeing, particularly on those who are older and more vulnerable. Evidence also suggests that COVID-19 disproportionately affects males. This study aimed to understand the impact that COVID-19 has had on men in the setting of Men's Sheds in Ireland. Two cohorts of men who were participating in a 10-week health and wellbeing program (Sheds for Life) at different stages were followed over time. At 6 months follow-up the first Cohort had not experienced COVID-19 whereas the second cohort was actively experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic. We measured wellbeing using questionnaires, comparing both groups of men for differences. We found that the men who were experiencing COVID-19 had lower self-rated health, physical activity and life satisfaction as well as higher rates of loneliness, with those who were more lonely reporting lower wellbeing scores. We also found that men in rural areas were more physically active during COVID-19 and that those were not active were more likely to become more inactive during COVID-19. This study suggests that support and guidance is needed to safely encourage this cohort back into Men's Sheds, settings that protect against loneliness and positively promote health and wellbeing.","McGrath, Murphy, Richardson","https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daaa113","20201203","COVID19; gender; loneliness; menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health; physical activity; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-04","",7805,""
"A rapid review of home-based activities that can promote mental wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health measures such as isolation, quarantine, and social distancing are needed. Some of these measures can adversely affect mental health. Activities that can be performed at home may mitigate these consequences and improve overall mental well-being. In this study, home-based activities that have potential beneficial effects on mental health were examined. A rapid review was conducted based on a search of the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PyscINFO, Global Health, epistemonikos.org, covid19reviews.org, and eppi.ioe.ac.uk/covid19_map_v13.html. Eligible studies include randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies published between 1/1/2000 and 28/05/2020 and that examined the impact of various activities on mental health outcomes in low-resource settings and contexts that lead to social isolation. Studies of activities that require mental health professionals or that could not be done at home were excluded. Two review authors performed title/abstract screening. At the full-text review stage, 25% of the potentially eligible studies were reviewed in full by two review authors; the rest were reviewed by one review author. Risk of bias assessment and data extraction were performed by one review author and checked by a second review author. The main outcome assessed was change or differences in mental health as expressed in Cohen's d; analysis was conducted following the synthesis without meta-analysis guidelines (SWiM). PROSPERO registration: CRD42020186082. Of 1,236 unique records identified, 160 were reviewed in full, resulting in 16 included studies. The included studies reported on the beneficial effects of exercise, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, and listening to relaxing music. One study reported on the association between solitary religious activities and post traumatic stress disorder symptoms. While most of the included studies examined activities in group settings, particularly among individuals in prisons, the activities were described as something that can be performed at home and alone. All included studies were assessed to be at risk of bias in one or more of the bias domains examined. There is some evidence that certain home-based activities can promote mental wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Guidelines are needed to help optimize benefits while minimizing potential risks when performing these activities.","Puyat, Ahmad, Avina-Galindo, Kazanjian, Gupta, Ellis, Ashe, Vila-Rodriguez, Halli, Salmon, Vigo, Almeida, De Bono","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243125","20201203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-04","",7806,""

Their psychological status may be affected by eHealth literacy due to home isolation during this rampant pandemic. This is a web-based cross-sectional survey conducted on the JD Health platform which resulted in 15,000 respondents having participated in this survey. The eHealth Literacy Questionnaire (EHLQ), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were used. Pearson correlation was used to analyze the relationship between eHealth literacy and depression, insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder. The score of eHealth literacy was 48.88Ã‚Â±8.46; and 11.4%, 6.8%, and 20.1% of respondents experienced moderate to severe depression, insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder. eHealth literacy negatively correlated to depression (r=-0.331), insomnia (r=-0.366), and post-traumatic stress disorder (r=-0.320). eHealth literacy is closely related to psychological status.

"British Thoracic Society survey of rehabilitation to support recovery of the post-COVID-19 population","A proportion of those recovering from COVID-19 are likely to have significant and ongoing symptoms, functional impairment and psychological disturbances. There is an immediate need to develop a safe and efficient discharge process and recovery programme. Established rehabilitation programmes are well placed to deliver a programme for this group but will most likely need to be adapted for the post-COVID-19 population. The purpose of this survey was to rapidly identify the components of a post-COVID-19 rehabilitation assessment and elements of a successful rehabilitation programme that would be required to deliver a comprehensive service for those post-COVID-19 to inform service delivery. A survey comprising a series of closed questions and a free-text comment box allowing for a qualitative analysis. Online survey. Multiprofessional clinicians across specialties were invited to take part. 1031 participants responded from a broad range of specialties. There was overwhelming support for an early posthospital discharge recovery programme to advise patients about the management of fatigue (95% agreed/strongly agreed), breathlessness (94%) and mood disturbances (including symptoms of anxiety and depression, 92%). At the time point of 6-8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks, an assessment was considered important, focusing on a broad range of possible symptoms and supporting a return to work. Recommendations for the intervention described a holistic programme focusing on symptom management, return of function and return to employment. The free-text comments added depth to the survey and the need 'not to reinvent the wheel' but rather adapt well-established rehabilitation services to individually tailor needs-based care with continued learning for service development.

"The first psychiatric pandemic: Encephalitis lethargica, 1917-27","Finding a link between COVID-19 and subsequent psychiatric symptoms has resulted in renewed interest in the psychiatric sequelae of pandemics. The first such instance was apparently the encephalitis lethargica pandemic which arose around the time of the First World War, moving in the shadow of a repiratory virus pandemic. The epidemic of encephalitis lethargica (EL), or Von Economo's Disease, in the years 1917-27 was the first pandemic involving the central nervous system. It moved in some places in parallel with the Great Flu Pandemic but does not seem to have been caused by it. Unlike the coronavirus, pandemic EL affected children heavily, leading often to bizarre changes in character and personality. It often left sequelae lasting for decades in the form of postencephalitic Parkinsonism (PEP). Unlike the coronavirus, it had a high mortality of around 20 percent. Although encephalitis lethargica involved a number of systems, psychiatric morbidity was most prominent and entailed severe depression, mania, catatonia and psychosis. It ended without therapeutic or public-health measures; today, sporadic cases of EL continue to be reported. The hypothesis is that we can derive from the EL psychiatric pandemic certain lessons that might be useful in studying tardive COVID symptoms today.","Shorter","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110420","20201203","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-04","",7811,""
"Health Care Workers' Mental Health and Quality of Life During COVID-19: Results From a Mid-Pandemic, National Survey","The authors sought to quantify the rates of psychological distress among health care workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify job-related and personal risk and protective factors. From April 1 to April 28, 2020, the authors conducted a national survey advertised via e-mail lists, social media, and direct e-mail. Participants were self-selecting, U.S.-based volunteers. Scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Disorder-7, Primary Care Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Screen, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-C were used. The relationships between personal resilience and risk factors, work culture and stressors and supports, and COVID-19-related events were examined. Of 1,685 participants (76% female, 88% White), 31% (404 of 1,311) endorsed mild anxiety, and 33% (427 of 1,311) clinically meaningful anxiety; 29% (393 of 1,341) reported mild depressive symptoms, and 17% (233 of 1,341) moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 5% (64 of 1,326) endorsed suicidal ideation; and 14% (184 of 1,300) screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder. Pediatric HCWs reported greater anxiety than did others. HCWs' mental health history increased risk for anxiety (odds ratio [OR]=2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.09-3.70) and depression (OR=3.49, 95% CI=2.47-4.94), as did barriers to working, which were associated with moderate to severe anxiety (OR=2.50, 95% CI=1.80-3.48) and moderate depressive symptoms (OR=2.15, 95% CI=1.45-3.21) (p&lt;0.001 for all comparisons).

"Longitudinal changes in mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a range of negative social and economic effects that may contribute to a rise in mental health problems. In this observational population-based study, we examined longitudinal changes in the prevalence of mental health problems from before to during the COVID-19 crisis and identified subgroups that are psychologically vulnerable during the pandemic. Participants (N = 14 393; observations = 48 486) were adults drawn from wave 9 (2017-2019) of the nationally representative United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) and followed-up across three waves of assessment in April, May, and June 2020. Mental health problems were assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The population prevalence of mental health problems (GHQ-12 score Ã¢Â©Â¾3) increased by 13.5 percentage points from 24.3% in 2017-2019 to 37.8% in April 2020 and remained elevated in May (34.7%) and June (31.9%) 2020. All sociodemographic groups examined showed statistically significant increases in mental health problems in April 2020. The increase was largest among those aged 18-34 years (18.6 percentage points, 95% CI 14.3-22.9%), followed by females and high-income and education groups. Levels of mental health problems subsequently declined between April and June 2020 but remained significantly above pre-COVID-19 levels. Additional analyses showed that the rise in mental health problems observed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was unlikely to be due to seasonality or year-to-year variation. This study suggests that a pronounced and prolonged deterioration in mental health occurred as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in the UK between April and June 2020.","Daly, Sutin, Robinson","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720004432","20201203","COVID-19; Coronavirus infection; longitudinal research; mental health; nationally representative study; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-04","",7813,""
