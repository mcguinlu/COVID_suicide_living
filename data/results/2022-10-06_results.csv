"Evaluation of primary allied healthcare in patients recovering from COVID-19: first results after six months follow-up in a Dutch nationwide prospective cohort study","Objectives: To report the recovery of patients receiving primary allied healthcare after a COVID-19 infection at a six-month follow-up, and to explore which patient characteristics are associated with the changes in outcomes between the baseline and six-month follow-up. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Allied healthcare in Dutch primary care. Participants: 1,452 adult patients recovering from COVID-19 and receiving treatment from one or more primary care allied health professional(s) (i.e., dietitian, exercise therapist, occupational therapist, physical therapist and/or speech and language therapist). Results: For participation (USER-P range 0 to 100), estimated mean differences of at least 2.3 points were observed after six months. For HRQoL (EQ-VAS range 0 to 100), the mean increase was 12.31 at six months. Furthermore, significant improvements were found for fatigue (FSS range 1 to 7): the mean decrease was -0.7 at six months. For physical functioning (PROMIS-PF range 13.8 to 61.3), the mean increase was 5.9 at six months. Mean differences of -0.8 for anxiety (HADS range 0 to 21), and -1.5 for depression (HADS range 0 to 21), were found after six months. A better baseline score, hospital admission and male sex were associated with a positive change in score between the baseline and six-month follow-up, whereas age, BMI, comorbidities and smoking status were not associated with mean changes in any outcome measure. Conclusions: Patients recovering from COVID-19 who receive primary allied healthcare make progress in recovery, but still experience many limitations in their daily activities after six months. Our findings provide reference values to healthcare providers and healthcare policy-makers regarding what to expect from the recovery of patients who received health care from one or more primary care allied health professionals.

"Impact on the mental health of undergraduate students and their parents at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic","It is very likely that if a child is anxious, stressed or depressed, someone at home is also anxious, stressed or depressed. That is why the objective was to determine the association between the mental health of parents according to that of undergraduated students in a Peruvian population during the first wave of COVID-19. An analytical, multicenter, cross-sectional research was carried out, where parents and children were surveyed with the DASS-21 scale, making crosses and adjusting for some other variables. Of the 1832 students and 1832 heads of family surveyed, according to having a severe presentation, 35% of the parents had stress (p&lt;0.001) and 25% had depression (p&lt;0.001), if their children had severe stress, anxiety or depression, respectively. If the head of the family presented moderate/severe depression it was associated with their children having depression or anxiety;the father of the family having moderate/severe anxiety was associated with the children also having depression or anxiety and the heads of the family presenting moderate/severe stress had an association with the children having anxiety and stress (up to here all values p&lt;0.002);as well as, that the heads of the household were women (p=0.034). An evident association was found between the mental health problems of the children and those of their parents, which should alert us to the fact that there are entire households with mental problems, and that they are related to the pathologies they suffer from.","Mejia, C.

"The Psychological Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic on the General Population of Oman: A National Community-based Study","Introduction: Despite evidence that that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in general poses unprecedented risks, it is unclear to what extent these consequences have affected the mental health of the general population. This study aims to evaluate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the general population in Oman and to associate the physical health status and psychological impact. Methods: A cross-sectional online anonymous survey in which 831 adults from Oman's general population were randomly sampled as per the inclusion criteria. The medical research and ethics commission approved the project. Data were collected after obtaining informed consent from the study participants. The criteria of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders was used to measure the psychological impact. Results: Among 831 respondents in this study, only 4.2 % and 14.9 % of total participants reported depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. There is a statistically significant difference in psychological scores between males and females at the p &lt; .05 level: F (1, 829) = 16.03, p &lt; .001. As a result of this discovery, it appears that women are mentally affected by the pandemic. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic has had a severe impact on the general population's psychological health in Oman. This survey found that the global health crisis has a psychological impact on most of the adult population, regardless of their age. As a result, early detection, urgent medical intervention, and counseling are required.

"Ginkgo biloba in the relief of neurological symptoms after COVID-19","COVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, multi-organ, with a wide spectrum of symptoms, the most common being pneumonia with fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. There are more and more reports of persistent long-term effects, especially after acute disease. Regardless of the way the virus enters the brain, it attacks neurons, contributing to neurological complications. The main symptoms of the central and peripheral nervous system are dizziness and headaches, impaired consciousness, sometimes acute ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhages, loss of taste and smell, visual disturbances, neuralgia and skeletal muscle damage. After recovery, patients experience symptoms such as persistent fatigue, diffuse muscle aches, symptoms of depression, non-renewable sleep, tinnitus, and erectile dysfunction. Early intervention and supportive care at the end of the acute phase of COVID-19 could alleviate the symptoms of the disease as well as prevent their long-term consequences. Taking into account plant raw materials, the standardized extract of Ginkgo leaves (Ginkgo biloba) may be useful at various stages of the disease: it prevents the penetration of the virus into the host cells, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antithrombotic properties, and above all, it is the only plant material with proven neuroprotective and neuroregulatory properties, widely used in the treatment of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other diseases and disorders related to the nervous system.","Matlawska, I.","https://doi.org/10.25121/PF.2022.23.1.23","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Postepy Fitoterapii; 1:23-32, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38700,""

"Relationship between mental health and physical activity among fourth grade students in Shanghai","[Background] Students in early adolescence have a high incidence of mental health problems. Studies have found an association between physical activity and mental health in adults, but the association among children and adolescents is not clear. [Objective] This study investigates the relationship between mental health and physical activity among students in early adolescence, aiming to provide evidence for the prevention and control of mental problems among students in this stage. [Methods] By using stratified cluster random sampling method, a questionnaire survey was conducted among 859 fourth grade students from 12 elementary schools in 3 urban and 3 suburban areas in Shanghai. The survey included students' general information, the total and mental health problems, and physical activity time, and calculated the total and dimensional (emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, and prosocial behaviors) positive rates of mental health and the daily moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity time. Chi-square test was used to compare the differences in mental health status among students with different family economic, educational backgrounds and family relationships. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the associations between mental health problems and physical activity. [Results] The total positive rate of mental health problems among the participants was 10.7%, and the rate of boys was higher than that of girls (13.4% vs. 8.0%, X 2=6.58, P &lt; 0.05). The dimensional positive rates from high to low were peer problems (22.9%), hyperactivity (15.8%), emotional symptoms (9.0%), conduct problems (7.6%), and social impairment (5.2%). The median time[M (P25, P75)] of daily moderate-tovigorous-intensity physical activity of the students was 76.9 (8.4, 107.1) min;48.7% of the students spent less than 60 min on moderateto-vigorous-intensity physical activities per day, and the proportion in boys (52.2%) was higher than that in girls (45.1%) (X 2=4.36, P &lt; 0.05). The rank-sum test results showed that the daily time of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity was correlated with the positive rate of emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, and total mental health problems (P &lt; 0.05). The chi-square test results showed that the factors such as mother's education level, father's and mother's monthly income, and family relationships were related to the positive rate of total mental health problems (P &lt; 0.05). The logistic regression analysis results showed that spending less than 60 min on moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activities per day was associated to reporting hyperactivity, total mental health problems, and social impairment, and the ORs (95%CI) were 1.633 (1.095-2.436), 2.811 (1.676-4.714), and 2.307 (1.153-4.618) respectively. [Conclusion] Among the fourth grade students in Shanghai, the positive rate of boys' mental health problems is higher than that of girls', and the overall rate of peer problems is high. Nearly half of the students spend less than 60 min on moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activities per day. Doing moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity for less than 60 min per day is possibly associated to the positive rate of students' mental health problems.","Sun, LiJing, Zhang, Zhe, Zhou, YueFang, Zhou, XinYi, Luo, ChunYan","https://doi.org/10.13213/j.cnki.jeom.2020.20280","","Database: GIM; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Environmental & Occupational Medicine; 37(12):1162-1169, 2020.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38702,""
"State of mind and dependence on physical activity in university students during confinement by COVID-19","The main objective of this study was to analyze the state of mind and the level of dependence on physical exercise of university students in the confinement stage, and their interrelationship between them, based on sex, whether they currently practice federated sports and the level of concern towards the problems created by COVID-19 worldwide. The study included 177 university students (133 men and 44 women) of Physical Activity and Sports Sciences from the Pontifical University of Salamanca with a mean age of 20.85 (+or- 2.83) years and a decrease in physical activity practice 73.5% in the first two weeks of confinement. The instruments used to assess these constructs were the Exercise Dependence Scale-Revised (EDS-R) and the short version of the Profile Mood States (POMS). The results show that there is a significant positive correlation between the level of dependence on physical exercise and Tension, Anger, Fatigue and Depressed State and a negative correlation with Vigor and Friendship.

"Agriculture and fisheries support policies in Algeria - a strategic prospective towards sustainable food security 2035","Covid-19 and the Ukrainian crisis have put the question of the ""food emergency"" back on everyone's agenda. If the need to ensure food security is unanimous in Algeria, this is however not the case for the future orientation of public policies in this area. This work attempts to contribute to this debate through a strategic prospective analysis to 2035 identifying new orientations for policies to support agricultural and fisheries production systems. It demonstrates that it is necessary, in order to better prepare for these ""long and short time"" challenges, to act now and to go further ""than instead of"" marginal adjustments. Also, these new policies must accompany ""a double paradigm shift"" that of the food model and the agricultural and fisheries production systems. The establishment of a cross-cutting food security policy in Algeria therefore appears to be essential to promote and succeed in this new dynamic.","Ferroukhi, S.

The aim of this study was to investigate the perceived challenges caused by COVID-19 outbreak in students of medical sciences. Materials and Methods: A qualitative study was carried out based on conventional qualitative content analysis following Graneheim and Lundman from December 2020 to February 2021. The participants were 17 students of medical sciences and data gathering was done through semistructured interviews. Results: Data analyses revealed 5 categories and 12 subcategories. The extracted categories were perceived fear of contracting coronavirus, social limitation, changes in education, neglecting health protocols, and worrying news and information overload. Conclusions: The findings indicated that students of medical sciences had been facing challenges and the COVID-19 had affected the psychological, social, and academic functioning of the health-care students. It is important to take measures to improve their mental health. These measures can prevent medical complications in these students, especially during clinical internship.","Baghcheghi, Nayereh, Koohestani, Hamid, Karimy, Mahmood, Keshavarzi, Mohammad, Ghorbani, Ali","https://doi.org/10.4103/ijnmr.ijnmr_205_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research; 27(5):406-412, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38705,""
"Quality of life and concerns of parkinson's disease patients and their caregivers during COVID-19 pandemic: An indian study","Objectives: Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have suffered during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, with worsening of both motor and nonmotor symptoms. We conducted this study to evaluate the quality of life (QoL) and concerns of PD patients and their caregivers. Methods: The study was conducted in mixed method, where the baseline data was taken by face-to-face interview during the unlock phase of December 2020 to March 2021, when there was no lockdown. This included demography, Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stage, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8 (PDQ-8), and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire for Carer (PDQ-Carer). During the second wave of COVID-19 (Aprilâ€“June 2021), telephonic interview was conducted using Depression, Anxiety Stress Scale- 21 Items (DASS-21), PDQ-8, PDQ-Carer, and open-ended questions regarding their concerns. Results: Compared with the baseline data, PDQ-8 and PDQ-Carer scores showed significant worsening during the second wave. DASS-21 scores had significant correlation with PDQ-Carer and PDQ-8 scores. Female patients reported poorer QoL. Caregivers of non-vaccinated patients had worse PDQ-Carer Strain scores. There was no significant association between worsening of motor symptoms and PDQ-8 and PDQ-Carer scores. More than 80% patients and 70% caregivers reported anxiety and depression. Their concerns were regarding difficulties due to social isolation, restriction of activity, and financial constraints. Additionally, there were worries about patient care, vaccination, and recurrence of the wave. Conclusions: The QoL of both patients and their caregivers were affected by the pandemic. A significant proportion had anxiety and depression, and this correlated with QoL. There were some important concerns on various aspects of the pandemic.","Banerjee, Sourav, Mukherjee, Adreesh, Bhattacharyya, Bidisha, Mohanakumar, Kochupurackal, Biswas, Atanu","https://doi.org/10.4103/aian.aian_905_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology; 25(4):676-682, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38706,""
"Effect of a Robotic Pet on Social and Physical Frailty in Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial","The current randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of a robotic pet on social and physical frailty in community-dwelling older adults. The intervention group (n = 107) received a robotic pet and the control group (n = 113) received usual care following hospital discharge. Social and physical frailty were measured using the Questionnaire to Define Social Frailty Status and the FRAIL questionnaire. Cognitive function and depression were assessed using the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire and Geriatric Depression Scale, respectively. Continuous outcomes were compared between groups using t tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests, as appropriate. Categorical outcomes were compared between groups using chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests, as appropriate. Main findings showed the robotic pet positively impacted cognitive status in participants who reported they enjoyed engaging with their pet. This finding supported the theoretical premise of the current study that greater engagement with the robotic pet would yield greater improvement in study outcomes.

"How facial masks alter the interaction of gaze direction, head orientation, and emotion recognition","The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the way we interact with each other: mandatory mask-wearing obscures facial information that is crucial for emotion recognition. Whereas the influence of wearing a mask on emotion recognition has been repeatedly investigated, little is known about the impact on interaction effects among emotional signals and other social signals. Therefore, the current study sought to explore how gaze direction, head orientation, and emotional expression interact with respect to emotion perception, and how these interactions are altered by wearing a face mask. In two online experiments, we presented face stimuli from the Radboud Faces Database displaying different facial expressions (anger, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness), gaze directions (â€“13Â°, 0Â°, 13Â°), and head orientations (â€“45Â°, 0Â°, 45Â°) â€“ either without (Experiment 1) or with mask (Experiment 2). Participants categorized the displayed emotional expressions. Not surprisingly, masks impaired emotion recognition. Surprisingly, without the mask, emotion recognition was unaffected by averted head orientations and only slightly affected by gaze direction. The mask strongly interfered with this ability. The mask increased the influence of head orientation and gaze direction, in particular for the emotions that were poorly recognized with mask. The results suggest that in case of uncertainty due to ambiguity or absence of signals we seem to unconsciously factor in extraneous information.","Thomas, Lea, von Castell, Christoph, Hecht, Heiko","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2022.937939","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in Neuroscience;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38708,""
"Assessing Teaching Compassion, Work Engagement and Compassion Fatigue Among Teachers During the Pandemic","Introduction: Teachersâ€™ mental health is an imperative aspect in ensuring their appropriate cognition, behaviors and perception. Studies have reported mixed results on work engagement and compassion fatigue among employees in different time and cultures. This study assesses and examines the correlation between Chinese teachersâ€™ work engagement and compassion fatigue during the pandemic. Methods: An online questionnaire was designed through a Chinese data collection platform (Credamo), and the sample of 3147 teachers in Zhejiang province (China) completed the survey online. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) was used to measure teachersâ€™ work engagement (WE), while the Professional Quality of Life Scale version 5 (ProQoL-5) was used to measure teachersâ€™ compassion fatigue (CF). SPSS 25, PROCESS Macro of SPSS, and JASP were used to analyze the data. Results: The results indicated a negative correlation between teachersâ€™ work engagement and compassion fatigue in general, while particularly, vigor, dedication, and absorption negatively correlated with burnout (r = - 0.370, r = - 0.243, and r = - 0.220 respectively), but positively correlating with secondary traumatic stress (r = 0.489, r = 0.343, and r = 0.319). Discussion: Teachersâ€™ working experience positively correlates with their work engagement but negatively correlates with their compassion fatigue. Conclusion: Teachersâ€™ work engagement (ie, dedication) is important in reducing compassion fatigue and maintaining compassion satisfaction.","Fute, A.; Sun, B.; Oubibi, M.","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S383292","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychology Research and Behavior Management; 15:2561-2571, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38709,""

"The impact of long-term conditions on disability-free life expectancy: a systematic review","Although leading causes of death are regularly reported, there is disagreement on which long-term conditions (LTCs) reduce disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) the most. We aimed to estimate increases in DFLE associated with elimination of a range of LTCs. This is a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing the effects of LTCs on health expectancy (HE). MEDLINE, Embase, HMIC, Science Citation Index, and Social Science Citation Index were systematically searched for studies published in English from July 2007 to July 2020 with updated searches from inception to April 8, 2021. LTCs considered included: arthritis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease including stroke and peripheral vascular disease, respiratory disease, visual and hearing impairment, dementia, cognitive impairment, depression, cancer, and comorbidity. Studies were included if they estimated HE outcomes (disability-free, active or healthy life expectancy) at age 50 or older for individuals with and without the LTC. Study selection and quality assessment were undertaken by teams of independent reviewers. Meta-analysis was feasible if three or more studies assessed the impact of the same LTC on the same HE at the same age using comparable methods, with narrative syntheses for the remaining studies. Studies reporting Years of Life Lost (YLL), Years of Life with Disability (YLD) and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs = YLL+YLD) were included but reported separately as incomparable with other HE outcomes (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020196049). Searches returned 6072 unique records, yielding 404 eligible for full text retrieval from which 30 DFLE-related and 7 DALY-related were eligible for inclusion. Thirteen studies reported a single condition, and 17 studies reported on more than one condition (two to nine LTCs). Only seven studies examined the impact of comorbidities. Random effects meta-analyses were feasible for a subgroup of studies examining diabetes (four studies) or respiratory diseases (three studies) on DFLE. From pooled results, individuals at age 65 without diabetes gain on average 2.28 years disability-free compared to those with diabetes (95% CI: 0.57-3.99, p&lt;0.01, I2 = 96.7%), whilst individuals without respiratory diseases gain on average 1.47 years compared to those with respiratory diseases (95% CI: 0.77-2.17, p&lt;0.01, I2 = 79.8%). Eliminating diabetes, stroke, hypertension or arthritis would result in compression of disability. Of the seven longitudinal studies assessing the impact of multiple LTCs, three found that stroke had the greatest effect on DFLE for both genders. This study is the first to systematically quantify the impact of LTCs on both HE and LE at a global level, to assess potential compression of disability. Diabetes, stroke, hypertension and arthritis had a greater effect on DFLE than LE and so elimination would result in compression of disability. Guidelines for reporting HE outcomes would assist data synthesis in the future, which would in turn aid public health policy.","Lourida, I.; Bennett, H.

"Doing family while poor: agentic hopelessness as lived knowledge","What does â€˜doing family while poorâ€™ teach us about agency, resilience and care under COVID-19? Set against a dual backdrop of increasing economic hardships and expanding inequalities, and in light of a shifting perspective in poverty and family studies, we employ David Morganâ€™s family practices approach to study the lived realities of family life through the perspective of everyday relationships. Our research, led by a team comprised of academics and activists who themselves endure poverty, is set to allow people experiencing poverty to document their everyday lives. In their journals we identify a form of social awareness to the politics of poverty, which consist of negative emotions emanating from oneâ€™s daily struggles against the harsh reality of inequality, yet do not lead to paralysis and inaction. We dub this state agentic hopelessness.","Kaplan, Dana, Levy, Gal, Buzhish-Sasson, Helly, Biton, Avigail, Kohan-Benlulu, Riki","https://doi.org/10.1332/204674321X16474246365913","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Families, Relationships and Societies; 11(2):208-208â€“226, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38713,""
"Association of loneliness and social network size in adulthood with childhood maltreatment: Analyses of a population-based and a clinical sample","BackgroundPerceived loneliness and objective social network size are related but distinct factors, which negatively affect mental health and are prevalent in patients who have experienced childhood maltreatment (CM), for example, patients with persistent depressive disorder (PDD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD). This cross-diagnostic study investigated whether loneliness, social network size, or both are associated with self-reported CM.MethodsLoneliness and social network size were assessed in a population-based sample at two time points (Study 1, NÂ =Â 509), and a clinical group of patients with PDD or BPD (Study 2, NÂ =Â 190) using the UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Social Network Index. Further measures were the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and standard depression rating scales. Linear regression analyses were applied to compare associations of loneliness or social network size with CM. Multiple mediation analyses were used to test the relative importance of loneliness and social network size in the relationship between CM and depressive symptoms.ResultsIn both studies, loneliness showed a stronger association than social network size with CM. This was particularly marked for emotional neglect and emotional abuse. Loneliness but not social network size mediated the relationship between CM and depressive symptoms.ConclusionsLoneliness is particularly associated with self-reported CM, and in this respect distinct from the social network size. Our results underline the importance of differentiating both psychosocial constructs and suggest focusing on perceived loneliness and its etiological underpinnings by mechanism-based psychosocial interventions.","Reinhard, Matthias A.; Rek, Stephanie V.; Nenov-Matt, Tabea, Barton, Barbara B.; Dewald-Kaufmann, Julia, Merz, Katharina, Musil, Richard, Jobst, Andrea, Brakemeier, Eva-Lotta, Bertsch, Katja, Padberg, Frank","https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2313","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Psychiatry; 65(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38714,""
"Psychometric evaluation of the Mental Health Quality of Life (MHQoL) instrument in seven European countries","Introduction To make efficient use of available resources, decision-makers in healthcare may assess the costs and (health) benefits of health interventions. For interventions aimed at improving mental health capturing the full health benefits is an important challenge. The Mental Health Quality of Life (MHQoL) instrument was recently developed to meet this challenge. Evaluating the pyschometric properties of this instrument in different contexts remains important. Methods A psychometric evaluation of the MHQoL was performed using existing international, cross-sectional data with 7155 respondents from seven European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, The Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom). Reliability was examined by calculating Cronbachâ€™s alpha, a measure of internal consistency of the seven MHQoL dimensions, and by examining the association of the MHQoL sum scores with the MHQoL-VAS scores. Construct validity was examined by calculating Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficients between the MHQoL sum scores and EQ-5D index scores, EQ-VAS scores, EQ-5D anxiety/depression dimension scores, ICECAP-A index scores and PHQ-4 sum scores. Results The MHQoL was found to have good internal consistency for all seven countries. The MHQoL sum score and the MHQoL-VAS had a high correlation. Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficients were moderate to very high for all outcomes. Conclusion Our results, based on data gathered in seven European countries, suggest that the MHQoL shows favourable psychometrical characteristics. While further validation remains important, the MHQoL may be a useful instrument in measuring mental health-related quality of life in the Western European context.","Enzing, Joost J.; FrÃ©dÃ©rique, C.

"Centering equity and lived experience: implementing a community-based research grant on cannabis and mental health","Background Mental health research in Canada is not only underfunded but there remains an inequitable distribution of funding to address unmet needs especially in clinical and applied research. In 2018, the legalization of cannabis for non-medical use in Canada sparked the need to examine the relationship between cannabis use and mental health. The federal government allocated $10 M over 5 years to the Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC), a pan-Canadian health organization funded at armâ€™s length by the federal government. Methods In 2020, the MHCC implemented an innovative community-based research (CBR) program to investigate this relationship among priority populations including people who use cannabis and live with mental illness, First Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis, two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and/or queer (2SLGBTQ+) individuals, and racialized populations. Extensive consultations, a scoping review and an environmental scan set the research agenda. Key program components included a review committee with representation from diverse priority populations, extensive proposal-writing support for applicants, and capacity bridging workshops for the 14 funded projects. Results Of the 14 funded research projects, 6 focus on and are led by Indigenous communities, 5 focus on other equity-seeking populations, and 9 explore the perceived patterns, influence and effects of use including benefits and harms. Lessons learned include the importance of a health equity lens and diverse sources of knowledge setting the CBR research agenda. In addition to capacity bridging that promote equitable roles among knowledge co-producers as well as the critical role of organizational support in increasing research productivity, especially in the area of mental health and cannabis use where there is a need for more applied research. Conclusion Centering equity and lived and living experience strengthened the rationale for investments and ensured user-led evidence generation and utilization â€“ a key public health gain. Organizational support for proposal development and capacity bridging yields significant value that can be replicated in future CBR initiatives.","Obegu, Pamela, Armstrong, Julia, Bartram, Mary","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-022-01722-4","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal for Equity in Health; 21:1-5, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38716,""

"A qualitative exploration of Ugandan mental health care workersâ€™ perspectives and experiences on sexual and reproductive health of people living with mental illness in Uganda","Background People with Mental Illness experience vast sexual and reproductive health challenges due to the affected mental health. Globally, prevalence of mental illness is on the rise with subsequent increase in the number of people with sexual and reproductive challenges warranting urgent public health intervention. However, information on the perceptions and experiences of mental health workers, the key health care providers for this population is generally lacking yet itâ€™s essential for formulation of appropriate policies and public health interventions. Aim To explore Ugandan mental health care workerâ€™s perspectives and experiences on the sexual and reproductive health of people living with mental illness in Uganda in order to generate recommendations to the ministry of health on how it can be improved. Materials and methods Qualitative study design was employed with utilization of phone call semi-structured in-depth interviews to collect data from 14 mental health workers from Ugandaâ€™s National mental referral hospital, Butabika. Purposive sampling and convenience recruitment was done and the collected data was analyzed using Thematic content analysis. Results Four themes were generated which included people with Mental illness having normal sexual needs, mental illness effect on sexuality and relationships, practices for safeguarding sexuality of people with mental illness and the barriers encountered in the provision of sexual and reproductive health services at a mental hospital. Conclusion People with mental illness experience a multitude of sexual and reproductive health challenges that need public health interventions. However, the integration of sexual and reproductive health services in a mental hospital are not yet successful making people with mental illness to remain with unaddressed health challenges. Policies should therefore be developed and implemented to ensure successful integration of sexual and reproductive health at all mental health service care provision points.","Tumwakire, Emily, Hofmeister, Arnd, Yahaya, Gavamukulya","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14128-2","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMC Public Health; 22:1-12, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38718,""
"Provider perceptions of availability, accessibility, and adequacy of health and behavioral services for Latino immigrants in Philadelphia: a qualitative study","Objective Latino populations in the United States are disproportionately affected by substance use, HIV/AIDS, violence, and mental health issues (SAVAME). A growing body of evidence demonstrates the syndemic nature of SAVAME and the need for integrated strategies to reduce their impact. This study sought to understand the network of SAVAME services for Latino immigrants in Philadelphia to inform future interventions for SAVAME prevention and mitigation. Methodology Key informant interviews (N = 30) were conducted with providers working in Latino-serving organizations providing SAVAME services. Interviews were analyzed using thematic coding and grounded theory. Results Latino-serving providers perceived a large need for, and important limitations in the availability, accessibility, and adequacy of SAVAME services for Latino immigrants. Gaps were seen as especially acute for mental health and substance use services, partly because of insufficient funding for these services. Latino immigrantsâ€™ lack of health insurance, immigration status, limited English proficiency (LEP), stigma surrounding SAVAME issues, and limited knowledge of available services were identified as significant barriers preventing access to services. Providers noted that scarcity of well-trained, culturally competent, and ethnically concordant providers reduced the adequacy of SAVAME services for Latino immigrant clients. The small size, low levels of infrastructure, and limited capacity were reported as additional factors limiting the ability of many Latino-serving organizations to adopt a syndemic approach in the prevention and treatment of SAVAME services. Conclusions The results call for changes in the structure of funding streams and communitywide strategies to foster collaboration across SAVAME providers working with Latino immigrant clients.","Martinez-Donate, Ana P.; Dsouza, Nishita, Cuellar, Sierra, Connor, Gabrielle, Zumaeta-Castillo, Claudia, Lazo-Elizondo, Mariana, Yamasaki, Yoshiaki, Perez, Cristina, Carroll-Scott, Amy, Martinez, Omar, Elizabeth McGhee, Hassrick","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14066-z","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMC Public Health; 22:1-15, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38719,""
"Study protocol of a randomized controlled trial evaluating home treatment with peer support for acute mental health crises (HoPe)","Background Home treatment (HT) is a treatment modality for patients with severe mental illness (SMI) in acute mental crises. It is frequently considered equivalent to psychiatric inpatient treatment in terms of treatment outcome. Peer Support (PS) means that people with lived experience of a mental illness are trained to support others on their way towards recovery. While PS is growing in international importance and despite a growing number of studies supporting its benefits, it is still not comprehensively implemented into routine care. The HoPe (Home Treatment with Peer Support) study investigates a combination of both â€“ HT and PS â€“ to provide further evidence for a recovery-oriented treatment of psychiatric patients. Methods In our randomized controlled trial (RCT), HT with PS is compared with HT without PS within a network of eight psychiatric clinical centers from the North, South and East of Germany. We investigate the effects of a combination of both approaches with respect to the prevention of relapse/recurrence defined as first hospitalization after randomization (primary outcome), disease severity, general functioning, self-efficacy, psychosocial health, stigma resistance, recovery support, and service satisfaction (secondary outcomes). A sample of 286 patients will be assessed at baseline after admission to HT care (data point t0) and randomized into the intervention (HT + PS) and control arm (HT). Follow-Up assessments will be conducted 2, 6 and 12 months after admission (resulting in three further data points, t1 to t3) and will be analyzed via intention-to-treat approach. Discussion This study may determine the positive effects of PS added to HT, prove additional evidence for the efficacy of PS and thereby facilitate its further implementation into psychiatric settings. The aim is to improve quality of mental health care and patientsâ€™ recovery as well as to reduce the risk of relapses and hospitalizations for patients with SMI.

Regression analyses revealed that COVID-19 impact positively predicted and parent-teacher joining negatively predicted mental health concerns among children and families, concurrently and longitudinally. Furthermore, there was a positive relationship between caregiversâ€™ perceptions of teachersâ€™ social awareness and justice practices and mental health symptoms for children in 2020. Parent-teacher joining longitudinally moderated the relationship between COVID-19 impact and caregiversâ€™ mental health concerns. This study provides implications regarding sociocultural resilience factors that should be considered in schools amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Understanding Stress and Coping Among Women of Color in the United States in the Age of COVID-19","This study was conducted to identify processes of coping with COVID-19 and determine their impact on emotional well-being for women of color in the United States. Data were collected from 368 women between May and July 2020 using an online survey guided by the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, which included an assessment of COVID-19 stressors, Brief Encounter Psychosocial Instrument (BEPSI), 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WCQ), and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Over half of the women were depressed (59.0%) and felt ill (69.3%) from the stress of COVID-19. Planful problem solving (M = 4.58, SD = 2.70) was the primary way to cope with COVID-19. A small, positive correlation existed between COVID-19 stressors and depressive symptoms (r = 0.27, p &lt; .001). COVID-19 had a significant impact on the increase of stress (MI = 0.53, p &lt; .001) and depressive symptoms (MI = 5.90, p &lt; .001) as well as the decrease of resilience (MD = 2.17, p &lt; .001) for women of color in the United States. These results can be translated into actionable care plans for clinicians and public health professionals that inform the development of tailored, culturally appropriate, equitable, and gender-specific mental health care for women of color in the age of COVID-19.

"Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Bereavement-Related Major Depressive Disorder in Japan: A Systematic Case Report","Bereavement-related major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common disorder with both mental and physical effects. Specific psychotherapies for bereavement-related MDD remain unavailable in Japan despite its relatively high prevalence. Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a treatment with established efficacy for MDD, including bereavement-related MDD. There are, however, few studies of IPT for MDD and none at all for bereavement-related MDD in Japan. The efficacy of IPT for bereavement-related MDD needs confirmation in Japanese culture because the expression of emotions during the grieving and mourning process varies across cultures, and the Japanese-specific cultural custom exists of maintaining a relationship with the deceased in the afterlife mainly via a Buddhist memorial tablet, altar, and grave. We present a case study describing the therapist's adaptation of IPT to Japanese culture to treat bereavement-related MDD in a Japanese man with insufficient response to pharmacotherapy who had suddenly lost his mother to heart disease. His mother's death and a dispute with his father both appeared to have contributed to his sustained bereavement-related MDD. The 16-session treatment course for depressive symptoms was monitored using the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Treatment was scheduled weekly, but some sessions unavoidably took place fortnightly because they were conducted in person during the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient's MDD severity continually decreased, functional disability gradually recovered from the beginning until the 3-month follow-up, and the interpersonal relationships with his deceased mother, his wife, colleague, and father changed after IPT. Case studies are inherently limited, but IPT, in consideration of Japanese cultural characteristics for bereavement-related MDD, can be potentially effective in Japan.

"The Influence of Occupational Therapy on College Studentsâ€™ Home Physical Exercise Behavior and Mental Health Status under the Artificial Intelligence Technology","The core of occupational therapy is to help patients with mental illness recover their social work, give play to their self-worth, obtain financial resources, and improve their self-confidence. Occupational therapy can help patients relieve symptoms and restore social function, reduce disease recurrence, and improve the reemployment rate and the overall health level of patients. In order to deeply excavate the inner connection between the mental health status and physical exercise status of college students, the physical exercise behavior of college students during home isolation is studied. First, the â€œphysical exercise behavior questionnaireâ€ and â€œsymptom self-assessment scaleâ€ were used to investigate the physical exercise behavior and mental health status of college students. Second, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, independent sample t-test, and variance analysis were carried out on the survey results using mathematical statistics methods and big data technology. The survey results show high reliability, and the Cronbachâ€™s a coefficients were all greater than 0.9. There was a positive correlation between physical exercise methods and mental health in general, and the difference in the degree of exercise is significantly different from the mental health of students (p&lt;0.05). With the increase of exercise intensity, the score of â€œsymptom self-assessment scaleâ€ first decreased and then increased, and the exercise intensity of medium and high intensity showed the best psychological state. And the correlation dimension of depression was the highest. This indicated that the students who liked family physical exercise were less likely to suffer from depression. In addition, depression was the most relevant dimension with self demand physical exercise, and interpersonal sensitivity was the most relevant dimension with social expansion physical exercise. The conclusion shows that the more active the students participate in family physical exercise, the healthier their mental state is. Occupational therapy has obvious curative effect on depression, which can improve patientsâ€™ negative symptoms, their living ability, and social function. Meanwhile, analyzing data through big data technology reduces human workload and improves data processing efficiency and accuracy. The scheme proposed here provides some ideas for the application of big data technology in occupational therapy.","Song, Chao, Sha, G.

"The role of religious coping to overcome mental distress and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic: An integrative review","This article aims to investigate how religious coping can help religious believers overcome mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. An integrative review was conducted by searching databases (PubMed/Medline, Springer, Elsevier, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, SciELO and Google Scholar) between 2020 and 2021 for articles using the following keywords: â€œReligious coping and COVID-19,â€ â€œReligion, mental health, and COVID-19,â€ and â€œReligiosity, spirituality, and COVID-19.â€ A total of twenty articles were selected for review. The result shows that religious faith might help individuals to calm their minds in times of crisis and severe illness. Some of the spiritual approaches suggested to combat COVID-19 might be effective. Positive religious coping, intrinsic religiousness, and faith in God were associated with lower anxiety and a greater positive outcome, whereas negative religious coping and distrust in God resulted in the opposite.

"Grief and Bereavement in the Latino/a Community: A Literature Synthesis and Directions for Future Research","Introduction: Bereavement and grief are social phenomena influenced by a multitude of cultural factors. Prior studies of bereavement adjustment have primarily focused on bereaved survivors who identify racially as white;knowledge of the experience of grief and bereavement among racial/ethnic and other minority groups, particularly among Latino/a groups, in the United States is limited. Objective: The purpose of this review is to synthesize the literature documenting the bereavement experiences of the Latino/a community, evaluate the strength of the current evidence, and provide recommendations to guide future research. Method: A narrative review of research on grief and bereavement in the Latino/a community published between 1990 and 2021. Two authors used a thematic, deductive approach to categorize emergent prevalent themes from the literature and used The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) and The Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicineâ€”Evidence Quality Rating Scale (OCEBM) approaches to evaluate the strength of the qualitative and quantitative reports reviewed. Results: Searches revealed 26 reports that were categorized into six themes: cultural values, mourning rituals, immigration, spirituality, disparities related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effects of COVID-19 on Latino/a communities. Our evaluation concludes that the evidence in this area is weak, with limited methodologically rigorous research examining the influence of culture on bereavement among Latino/a groups. Conclusion: Research is needed to identify Latino/a groups' mental health, cultural, social, and family needs and how fulfillment of mourning rituals and other cultural factors may promote or impede bereavement adjustment. Investigation into factors that may protect bereaved survivors against adverse mental health outcomes is also needed. A better understanding of Latino/a grief and bereavement is a step toward the development of culturally competent interventions designed to promote the mental health and psychosocial adjustment of Latino/a mourners.","Winoker, Hillary, Burke, Rebecca V.; Mendoza, Jose A.; Munoz, Francisco, Tergas, Ana, Maciejewski, Paul K.; Prigerson, Holly G.","https://doi.org/10.1089/heq.2022.0031","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Equity; 6(1):696-707, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38728,""
"Food Insecurity Disparities and Mental Health Impacts Among Cancer Survivors During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction: Food insecurity can negatively impact adherence and receipt of high-quality cancer care. The purpose of the study was to (1) compare the prevalence of COVID-19-associated food insecurity by cancer history and (2) examine determinants associated with COVID-19-related food insecurity among cancer survivors. Methods: We used nationally representative data from the 2020 COVID-19 Household Impact Survey (n=10,760). Our primary exposure was participants' self-report of a cancer diagnosis (n=854, 7.1%). Primary outcomes of food insecurity were categorized by the following questions: â€œWe worried our food would run out before we got money to buy moreâ€ or â€œThe food that we bought just didn't last, and we didn't have money to get moreâ€;respondents were categorized as food insecure if they chose often true or sometimes true. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to identify demographic determinants of food insecurity among cancer survivors. Results: Thirty-two percent of cancer survivors were food insecure. Cancer survivors 30â€“44 years of age and those =60 years of age were more likely to report being food insecure compared to respondents without a history of cancer, respectively (30â€“44 years, 59.9% vs. 41.2% p=0.01, =60 years 27.2% vs. 20.2%, p=0.01). Cancer survivors without a high school diploma were more likely to report food insecurity compared to adults with no history of cancer (87.0% vs. 64.1%, p=0.001). In multivariable models, uninsured cancer survivors (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] aPR: 2.39, 95% CI: 1.46â€“3.92) and those on Medicaid (aPR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.40â€“3.17) were also more likely to report being food insecure. Conclusion: Food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic is vast, but disparities persist. Among cancer survivors, differences in food insecurity were observed by age and socio economic status. Cancer survivors experiencing food insecurity more frequently reported mental health symptoms of depression, loneliness, and hopelessness compared to those who were food secure.","Rodriguez, Diane R.; Vidot, Denise C.; Bailey, Zinzi","https://doi.org/10.1089/heq.2021.0120","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Equity; 6(1):729-737, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38729,""
"COVID-19 and student stress: the effectiveness of a course on coping with stress for science and engineering undergraduate students","Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among university students worldwide is high. In most cases, stress intervention is individual-based and involves small groups for relatively short periods. New evidence shows that stress increased during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021), when learning moved to online formats and social distancing was enforced worldwide. Our research focuses on a course on adjusting to stressful situations that moved online after many years of being taught in class. Based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, we showed that the course offered students two main benefits. First, the course structure was designed as a ritual, providing students with a sense of control. Second, students were engaged in a group activity, further contributing to their ability to adjust to stressful situations, as it created a platform for sharing. Findings are discussed in the context of the ongoing pandemic, and implications for coping with student stress post COVID-19 are suggested.

"Effectiveness and feasibility of telerehabilitation in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis","To determine the pooled effectiveness and feasibility of telerehabilitation in patients with COVID-19. Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). PubMed, CINAHL, Science Direct, PEDro, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched to the end of March 2022. RCTs investigating the effects of telerehabilitation in the management of patients with COVID-19 were included. The outcomes of interest were functional capacity, cardiopulmonary exercise tests, quality of life and other variables where data are available. Two reviewers screened, extracted data and performed methodological quality assessment independently. The revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Review Manager V.5.4 and Stata V.14.0 software were used for statistical analysis. Mean difference (MD) with 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI and the corresponding p value were used to determine the treatment effect between groups. A fixed-effect model was used for all variables as no significant heterogeneity was observed. Four studies with 334 patients with COVID-19 were included. The pooled result of telerehabilitation showed statistically significant improvement on 6-minute walking test (MD 75.50; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 54.69 to 96.30; p=0.48), 30-second sit-to-stand test (MD 1.76; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.47 to 2.04; p=0.30), Borg Scale (MD 2.49; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 2.16 to 2.83; p=0.28) and level of dyspnoea (MD 6.26; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 5.42 to 7.10; p=0.66). The overall treatment completion rate was 88.46%, and the most common reason for withdrawal after randomisation was lost to follow-up or uncooperativeness. The findings showed that telerehabilitation interventions could improve functional capacity and exercise perception among patients affected by COVID-19 and can be implemented with a high completion rate and minimal adverse events.

"The Development and Use of Chatbots in Public Health: Scoping Review","Chatbots are computer programs that present a conversation-like interface through which people can access information and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has driven a substantial increase in the use of chatbots to support and complement traditional health care systems. However, despite the uptake in their use, evidence to support the development and deployment of chatbots in public health remains limited. Recent reviews have focused on the use of chatbots during the COVID-19 pandemic and the use of conversational agents in health care more generally. This paper complements this research and addresses a gap in the literature by assessing the breadth and scope of research evidence for the use of chatbots across the domain of public health. This scoping review had 3 main objectives: (1) to identify the application domains in public health in which there is the most evidence for the development and use of chatbots; (2) to identify the types of chatbots that are being deployed in these domains; and (3) to ascertain the methods and methodologies by which chatbots are being evaluated in public health applications. This paper explored the implications for future research on the development and deployment of chatbots in public health in light of the analysis of the evidence for their use. Following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines for scoping reviews, relevant studies were identified through searches conducted in the MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Open Grey databases from mid-June to August 2021. Studies were included if they used or evaluated chatbots for the purpose of prevention or intervention and for which the evidence showed a demonstrable health impact. Of the 1506 studies identified, 32 were included in the review. The results show a substantial increase in the interest of chatbots in the past few years, shortly before the pandemic. Half (16/32, 50%) of the research evaluated chatbots applied to mental health or COVID-19. The studies suggest promise in the application of chatbots, especially to easily automated and repetitive tasks, but overall, the evidence for the efficacy of chatbots for prevention and intervention across all domains is limited at present. More research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness of using chatbots in public health. Concerns with the clinical, legal, and ethical aspects of the use of chatbots for health care are well founded given the speed with which they have been adopted in practice. Future research on their use should address these concerns through the development of expertise and best practices specific to public health, including a greater focus on user experience.","Wilson, Marasoiu","https://doi.org/10.2196/35882","20221005","COVID-19; chatbot application; chatbot development; chatbots; conversational agents; digital health; evidence; health care system; health technology; mental health; pandemic; public health; scoping review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38734,""
"Effects of Physical Activity on College Students' Subjective Well-Being During COVID-19","The COVID-19 outbreak has caused widespread psychological distress to Chinese college students. To explore the beneficial psychological effects of physical activity, this study accessed the relationship of Physical Activity (PA) and Subjective Well-being (SWB) among Chinese college students during the pandemic. A total of 1198 college students (aged between 17 and 40) from 8 universities in Wuhan, China, volunteered to finish the online questionnaire survey from February 17 to 20, 2020. General Well-Being Schedule (GWBS) was used to evaluate SWB, and Physical Activity Rating Scale-3 (PARS-3) was used to measure PA. The Mann-Whitney U test, Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> test, t test, and analysis of variance were used to compare the differences between groups based on different data types. A multi-factor linear regression analysis was performed on the factors affecting college students' participation in physical activity during the pandemic. Differences were considered statistically significant when pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05. It found that: (1) The quality of physical activity during COVID-19 significantly and positively predicted subjective well-being (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.512, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), indicating that physical activity can effectively alleviate adverse mental health effects caused by the pandemic. (2) The pandemic has had a greater impact on the mental health of specific groups (such as seniors and rural college students). Supporting and encouraging them to participate in a certain level of sports activities can improve their subjective well-being, which is helpful for countering the pandemic's adverse effects. (3) People should be encouraged to participate in sports at moderate or high levels. PA can effectively alleviate the negative psychological impact of the pandemic. In general, during major public health emergencies, people should be supported and encouraged to regularly participate in physical activities at moderate or higher levels, to improve their subjective well-being, and maintain positive anti-pandemic attitudes and behavior.","Yuan, You","https://doi.org/10.1007/s44197-022-00062-4","20221005","COVID-19 pandemic; College students; Major public health event; Quality of physical activity; Subjective well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38735,""
"Mental problems and risk factors for depression among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Prevalence of depression is high among medical students and several mental problems are identified as risk factors. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic causes difficulties that could adversely affect mental health. However, data concerning prevalence of mental problems, and whether or not these problems remain risk factors for depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in medical students are scarce. To investigate the prevalence of depression, social media addiction, game addiction, sleep quality, eating disorder risk, and perceived stress among Thai medical students, risk factors for depression were investigated. Online surveys via our faculty's learning portals were advertized to medical students who engaged online learning and 224 respondents provided complete data. Study-related medical students' data were collected using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression, the Social-Media Addiction Screening Scale for social media addiction, the Game Addiction Screening Test for game addiction, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for sleep quality, the Eating Attitudes Test for eating disorder risk, and the Perceived Stress Scale for perceived stress. Depression was reported in 35.7% of medical students, social-media addiction in 22.3%, game addiction in 4.5%, eating disorder risk in 4.9%, poor sleep quality in 80.8%, and moderate-to-high perceived stress in 71.4%. The independent predictors of depression were lower grade point average, social media addiction, and moderate-to-high perceived stress. A high prevalence of depression, stress, and poor sleep was found among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Evaluating resilience in terms of COVID-19 related behavioral health among Latinx adults during the coronavirus pandemic","The mental and behavioral health burden resulting from COVID-19 has disproportionately affected the Latinx population. Yet, no work has investigated the influence of resilience as a protective factor against COVID-19 related consequences. The aim of the current study was to evaluate resilience in relation to COVID-19 related fear, anxiety symptoms, COVID-19 anxiety-related sleep disturbances, and depression among Latinx persons (178 Latinx persons [31.5% female, <i>M</i><sub><i>age</i></sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°34.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.2]). It was hypothesized that greater levels of resilience would be associated with lower levels of all COVID-19 related behavioral health outcomes above and beyond the variance accounted for by years living in the United States (U.S.), degree of COVID-19 exposure, sex, age, education, and COVID-19 related work and financial troubles and home-life distress.

"Understanding cultural factors in mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: when collectivism meets a tight culture","The long-standing pathogen prevalence hypothesis suggests that collectivism can protect from epidemics and pandemics in terms of psychological well-being. However, studies exploring the protective mechanism induced when collectivism meets cultural tightness (the strength of social norms and tolerance for deviant behavior) are few. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the protective effect of collectivism in detail considering loose and tight cultural contexts. The sample comprised 2001 Chinese participants (<i>M</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18.41Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.388Ã‚Â years; 50.2% female). Moderated regression analyses indicated that more perceived risk of COVID-19 predicted severe mental health responses (i.e., depression and anxiety), collectivism moderated this positive relationship but individualism did not. Notably, the protective effect of collectivism is especially evident in tight cultures but ineffective in loose cultures. This study emphasized that the protective effects of collectivism on mental health during a pandemic should be considered within the framework of cultural tightness. This study's findings may advance knowledge about the relationship between cultural type and mental health during epidemics.","Dong, Feng, Qiao","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03780-x","20221005","COVID-19; Collectivism; Cultural tightness; Mental health; Perceived risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38738,""
"Adult quality of life patterns and trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","Early investigations of subjective well-being responses to the COVID-19 pandemic indicated average deterioration but also high variability related to vulnerability of population groups and pandemic phase. Thus, we aimed to gain new insights into the characteristics of certain groups and their differences in subjective well-being response patterns over time. First, we performed Latent Class Analyses with baseline survey data of 2,137 adults (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°40.98, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.62) derived from the German CORONA HEALTH APP Study to identify subgroups showing similarity of a comprehensive set of 50 risk and protective factors. Next, we investigated the course of quality of life (QoL) as an indicator of subjective well-being grouped by the identified latent classes from July 2020 to July 2021 based on monthly and pandemic phase averaged follow-up survey data by means of Linear Mixed-Effects Regression Modeling. We identified 4 latent classes with distinct indicators and QoL trajectories (resilient, recovering, delayed, chronic) similar to previous evidence on responses to stressful life events. About 2 out of 5 people showed a resilient (i.e., relative stability) or recovering pattern (i.e., approaching pre-pandemic levels) over time. Absence of depressive symptoms, distress, needs or unhealthy behaviors and presence of adaptive coping, openness, good family climate and positive social experience were indicative of a resilient response pattern during the COVID-19 pandemic. The presented results add knowledge on how to adapt and enhance preparedness to future pandemic situations or similar societal crises by promoting adaptive coping, positive thinking and solidary strategies or timely low-threshold support offers.

"Resilience and Wellbeing Strategies for Pandemic Fatigue in Times of Covid-19","The COVID-19 pandemic is truly one of the greatest collective health crises in history which have altered our life and living. For years, people have felt fatigued from following public health directives such as social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands frequently, and working or studying remotely without in-person interactions. In this paper, we explore strategies for resilience and wellbeing which can mitigate pandemic-caused stress and behavioural fatigue. We start with individual level strategies including reworking stress appraisals, the importance of psychological flexibility, reducing loneliness through adaptive online platform use, optimizing familial relationships when living in close quarters for a prolonged period, reducing symptoms of burnout and using adaptive distractions, using specific evidence-based resilience strategies. We discuss specific considerations which tap on our shared identities and shared responsibilities which can enhance a sense of community, especially for individuals from marginalized backgrounds and how suicide risks can be minimized.","Zarowsky, Rashid","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41042-022-00078-y","20221005","Behavioural fatigue; Burnout; Clinical psychology; Covid-19; Mental health; Pandemic fatigue; Resilience; Wellbeing strategies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38740,""
"Using Implementation Science to Inform Workforce and Service Development in Youth Mental Health: An Australian Case Study","Globally, mental illness and substance use disorders are the leading cause of disability and disease burden for young people. Orygen is an Australian youth mental health organisation with a mission to reduce the impact of mental ill health on young people, families and society, through research, clinical services, advocacy, and the design and delivery of youth mental health workforce and service development initiatives. Orygen is one of only a few known research and clinical centres with a dedicated knowledge translation division, which concentrates on growing the capacity of the systems, services, and professionals who support young people experiencing mental ill health. This paper provides a case study of the workforce development team withinÃ‚Â the Orygen knowledgeÃ‚Â translation, outlining how implementation science informs their work and how the division has adapted its model in the face of COVID-19. Since 2017, the team has delivered training to more than 4000 youth mental health workers across Australia, on the topics of trauma, psychosis, mood and anxiety disorders, brief interventions, cognition and other areas of youth mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic generated abrupt and dramatic changes to the delivery of workforce and service development initiatives in Australia due to significant restrictions to travel and in-person events. It also placed major delivery demands on youth mental health services. This paper outlines how the team at Orygen adapted their approach to youth mental health workforce development in response to COVID-19, offering reflections and future directions for implementation science that can support flexible models of support in a changing system.","Zbukvic, Nicholas, Hamilton, Cruz-Manrique, Crlenjak, Purcell","https://doi.org/10.1007/s43477-022-00058-z","20221005","Adolescent; Adolescent health services; Framework; Health personnel; Mental health services; Staff development","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38741,""
"Neurogenesis is disrupted in human hippocampal progenitor cells upon exposure to serum samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), represents an enormous new threat to our healthcare system and particularly to the health of older adults. Although the respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 are well recognized, the neurological manifestations, and their underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, have not been extensively studied yet. Our study is the first one to test the direct effect of serum from hospitalised COVID-19 patients on human hippocampal neurogenesis using a unique in vitro experimental assay with human hippocampal progenitor cells (HPC0A07/03Ã¢â‚¬â€°C). We identify the different molecular pathways activated by serum from COVID-19 patients with and without neurological symptoms (i.e., delirium), and their effects on neuronal proliferation, neurogenesis, and apoptosis. We collected serum sample twice, at time of hospital admission and approximately 5 days after hospitalization. We found that treatment with serum samples from COVID-19 patients with delirium (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18) decreased cell proliferation and neurogenesis, and increases apoptosis, when compared with serum samples of sex- and age-matched COVID-19 patients without delirium (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18). This effect was due to a higher concentration of interleukin 6 (IL6) in serum samples of patients with delirium (meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°SD: 229.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°79.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°pg/ml, vs. 32.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°pg/ml in patients without delirium). Indeed, treatment of cells with an antibody against IL6 prevented the decreased cell proliferation and neurogenesis and the increased apoptosis. Moreover, increased concentration of IL6 in serum samples from delirium patients stimulated the hippocampal cells to produce IL12 and IL13, and treatment with an antibody against IL12 or IL13 also prevented the decreased cell proliferation and neurogenesis, and the increased apoptosis. Interestingly, treatment with the compounds commonly administered to acute COVID-19 patients (the Janus kinase inhibitors, baricitinib, ruxolitinib and tofacitinib) were able to restore normal cell viability, proliferation and neurogenesis by targeting the effects of IL12 and IL13. Overall, our results show that serum from COVID-19 patients with delirium can negatively affect hippocampal-dependent neurogenic processes, and that this effect is mediated by IL6-induced production of the downstream inflammatory cytokines IL12 and IL13, which are ultimately responsible for the detrimental cellular outcomes.","Borsini, Merrick, Edgeworth, Mandal, Srivastava, Vernon, Nebbia, Thuret, Pariante","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-022-01741-1","20221004","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38742,""
"COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and perceived stigma in patients with depression: a network perspective","The association between coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine acceptance and perceived stigma of having a mental illness is not clear. This study examined the association between COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and perceived stigma among patients with recurrent depressive disorder (depression hereafter) using network analysis. Participants were 1149 depressed patients (842 men, 307 women) who completed survey measures of perceived stigma and COVID-19 vaccine attitudes. T-tests, chi-square tests, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between depressed patients who indented to accepted vaccines and those who were hesitant. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses assessed the unique association between COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and perceived stigma, independent of depression severity. Network analysis examined item-level relations between COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and perceived stigma after controlling for depressive symptoms. Altogether, 617 depressed patients (53.7%, 95 confidence intervals (CI) %: 50.82-56.58%) reported they would accept future COVID-19 vaccination. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated higher perceived stigma scores predicted lower levels of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.125, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), even after controlling for depression severity. In the network model of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and perceived stigma nodes, ""Feel others avoid me because of my illness"", ""Feel useless"", and ""Feel less competent than I did before"" were the most influential symptoms. Furthermore, ""COVID-19 vaccination acceptance"" had the strongest connections with illness stigma items reflecting social rejection or social isolation concerns (""Employers/co-workers have discriminated"", ""Treated with less respect than usual"", ""Sense of being unequal in my relationships with others""). Given that a substantial proportion of depressed patients reported hesitancy with accepting COVID-19 vaccines and experiences of mental illness stigma related to social rejection and social isolation, providers working with this group should provide interventions to reduce stigma concerns toward addressing reluctance in receiving COVID-19 vaccines.","Cai, Bai, Du, Zhang, Zhang, Li, Liu, Tang, Jackson, Cheung, An, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-02170-y","20221004","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38743,""
"A longitudinal study on changes in food parenting practices during COVID-19 and the role of parental well-being","The COVID-19 pandemic may negatively influence food parenting practices, also among parents of adolescents. Parental well-being (stress and depressive symptoms) may explain these COVID-19 related changes in food parenting practices (snack structure, healthy structure, modeling, autonomy support, and coercive control). However, most previous studies performed before or during the COVID-19 pandemic have been limited by cross-sectional designs. The aim of the current study among parents of adolescent children was twofold. First, we aimed to examine prospective differences in food parenting practices comparing the situation before and during COVID-19. Second, we aimed to examine both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between parental well-being and the dimensions of food parenting, while additionally examining whether these prospective associations were more pronounced in parents who had experienced more COVID-19 stressful life events. Parents (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯290; 74.9% female; at baseline: M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯46.9; SD<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯4.3) of adolescent children (at baseline: M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯14.3; SD<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.6) completed online surveys about parental well-being and food parenting twice: One year before the COVID-19 pandemic (spring 2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic, 1.5 years after the first measurement (autumn 2020). In general, we found consistent evidence for an average decrease in food autonomy support and an increase in coercive control during COVID-19. However, parental well-being did not seem to explain (changes in) food parenting practices during COVID-19, also not in combination with stressful life events. Our findings suggest that, regardless of parental well-being, the general COVID-19 situation had some small negative influences on autonomy support and coercive control among parents of adolescents. These findings might be explained by parents being more often confronted with unhealthy eating occasions in the COVID-19 home context, triggering these negative parental responses.","Larsen, van den Broek, Verhagen, Burk, Vink","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2022.106331","20221004","Adolescents; COVID-19 stress; Food parenting; Longitudinal design; Parental mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38744,""
"Association between depressive symptoms in the postpartum period and COVID-19: A meta-analysis","With the pandemic of COVID, the public are faced with tremendous threatens both physically and mentally. Postpartum depression (PPD) is one of the most serious complications of childbearing, bringing severe impact on a woman's mental state and mood after birth. Research has shown that maternal mental state is closely correlated with PPD, those undergo the emergency or significant life changes during the postpartum period are more likely to suffer from PPD. In this study, we conducted the meta-analysis to estimate the association between PPD and COVID-19 pandemic. PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, CNKI, China Science and Technology Journal Database, and WANFANG Database were searched for potentially relevant articles published before April 2022. Review Manager 5.2 was used to perform a meta-analysis and subgroup analysis to compute the pooled odds ratio. A total of 26 studies were included in this review. The overall pooled prevalence of PPD in the review was 24Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% (95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 0.19-0.29), with China's at 22Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% (95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI 0.16-0.28) and other countries at 25Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% (95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI 0.18-0.32) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, compared to those who did not experience COVID-19, those who experienced it had an increased risk of PPD[OR:1.83(95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI 1.70-1.97)]. According to this analysis, there was a significantly higher prevalence and odds of PPD in those who suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we also found that China had a lower prevalence of postpartum depression than other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Parents of children with congenital heart defects during the COVID-19 pandemic: An examination of mental health variables, risk factors, and protective factors","Little is known about the mental health burden or the factors that contribute to mental health variables in parents of children with congenital heart defects (CHD) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine risk and protective factors associated with anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and perceived stress in parents of young children with CHD during the COVID-19 pandemic. A nonexperimental design was used in this study of 127 parents of children aged newborn to five years with CHD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between COVID-19 stressors, CHD care-related factors, parental resilience, external support, and mental health variables. Parental resilience, emotional support, and informational support were key protective factors for anxiety, depression, and stress. However, resilience was remarkably low in CHD parents. Increased levels of anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and perceived stress were associated with 1) Exposure to a greater number of COVID-19-related stressors, 2) Distress from family visitation restrictions during healthcare encounters, 3) Worry related to the perceived risk of their CHD child's exposure to COVID-19 during healthcare encounters, and 4) Worry about their CHD child's risk of death or serious illness from COVID-19. The additive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic plus CHD care-related worries on this parent population's mental health is significant. Interventions that promote resilience, address the effect of healthcare system changes, and support the needs of parents of young children with CHD during this and future pandemics are needed.","Harvey","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrtlng.2022.09.017","20221004","Anxiety; COVID-19; Congenital heart defect; Depression; Parent; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38746,""
"Leveraging mHealth to Manage Mental Health/ Behavioral Health Disorders: A Systematic Literature Review","Mental health is a complex condition, highly related to emotion.

"Internet-based Parent Training with Telephone Coaching on Managing Disruptive Behavior in Children During The COVID-19 Pandemic","There is growing concern about the short-term and long-term impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the mental health and psychosocial well-being of children and families. There are no existing studies about feasibility and outcomes using Internet-based Parent training programs with telephone coaching for disruptive behavioral problems in childhood during COVID-19 pandemic in clinical settings. This study explored how the Strongest Families Smart Website (SFSW) parent training program, with telephone coaching, provided support during COVID-19 pandemic at specialist family counselling centers in Helsinki, when restrictions made face-to-face counselling impossible. This study followed the success of an RCT and its implementation study of the SFSW parent training program by primary care child health clinics. The aim was to improve parenting skills, so that they could tackle disruptive behavior by developing positive parent-child relationships. It started in May 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its height in Finland. Eight family counselling centers in Helsinki, Finland, identified 50 referrals aged 3-8 years with high levels of parent-reported disruptive behavioral problems. Child psychopathology and functioning and parental skills and well-being were measured at baseline, post-treatment and six months later using a range of tools. The data were extracted from questionnaires completed by the parents. We found that 44 out of the 50 families (88%) completed the whole 11 session parent training program. Most of the children (96%) had definitive or severe behavioral problems when they were initially screened by the centers, but this dropped to 58% at the six-month follow-up assessment. There were significant changes from baseline to 6-month follow-up in most of the child psychopathology measures, including CBCL externalizing score (change in mean score 16.3, 95% Cl 10.2 to 22.3; P &lt;.001) and total score (7.0, 95% Cl 4.9 to 9.0; P&lt;.001). When parenting skills were measured with the Parenting Scale, they showed significant changes from baseline to six-month follow-up in total scores (0.5, 95% Cl 0.4 to 0.7; P&lt;.001). Parents showed significant change in stress sub score (3.9, 95% Cl 2.2 to 5.6; (P&lt;.001). They reported high satisfaction, varying from 93.3%-97.8%, in the skills and professionalism of the family coaches. The program proved to be an effective method for improving parenting skills and child psychopathology and functioning. The parents were very satisfied with the program and the drop-out rate was exceptionally low. The study shows that the training program could be implemented in specialist clinical settings and during crisis conditions like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sourander, Sourander, Hinkka-Yli-SalomÃƒÂ¤ki, Ristkari, Kurki","https://doi.org/10.2196/40614","20221004","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38748,""
"Group tele-gaming through immersive virtual reality to improve mental health among adolescents with physical disabilities: pre and post trial protocol","Adolescents with physical disabilities have higher rates of mental health conditions and issues than adolescents without disabilities, and this disparity was exacerbated by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. They also have limited access to onsite programs and nearby peers. This pilot aims to investigate the potential effects of a low-dose multiplayer virtual reality tele-gaming program on depression, socialization, and loneliness among a cohort of children with physical disabilities. A secondary aim is to describe feasibility metrics, namely, recruitment and adherence rates and perceived program enjoyment and satisfaction. The tertiary aim is to describe behavioral mechanisms that affect participant adherence and social participation in the classes. This study is a single group, pre and post test designed trial. A single cohort of 12 children with physical disabilities will pilot a 1-month program that includes 2 supervised 1-hour sessions per week of group-based exergaming. Participants will complete questionnaires before and after the program, namely, for the primary aim the Children's Depression Inventory 2 Short Form (CDI-S 2), a measure of feelings of depression, and the UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA), a measure of both loneliness and social isolation. Secondary aim measures will include three post test Likert scale questionnaires: perceived program enjoyment, program satisfaction, and satisfaction with multiplayer experiences. At post-intervention or dropout, participants will undergo semi-structured interviews to identify behavioral mechanisms that underly participation. Data will be reported descriptively and be supported by t-tests as appropriate. Recruitment procedures started in July 2022. All data are expected to be collected by January 2022. Full trial results are expected to be published by March 2023. Secondary analyses of data will be subsequently published. This trial tests a peer-to-peer virtual reality tele-gaming program that includes a completely remote enrollment, assessment, and intervention protocol. This program is accessible and short in duration and frequency, allowing it to be integrated within other interventions.

Hospitals that accepted COVID-19 patients and hospitals that unexpectedly experienced clusters underwent a nursing provision system organization phase, followed by an adjustment phase to maintain nursing organization function. Two factors aided measure implementation: an emergency system and staff protection policies. Early epidemic management strategies apply across contexts. The hospital's basic attitude is key to effective implementation of the strategies. The results suggest that hospitals, nursing directors, and nurses can each prepare for future emerging infectious disease epidemics.","Takemura, Inoue, Ichikawa, Kida, Koyanagi, IkezakiRN, Ikeda","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13844","20221004","COVID-19; hospital management; multiple-case study; nurses; nursing director","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38750,""
"Green spaces for mental disorders","Mental illness is a global challenge, exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. Research suggests access to local green spaces is associated with better mental health, yet access is not always equitable. Evaluation of how nature-based interventions protect and support mental health is therefore required. Accessible local green spaces are associated with better mental health. They encourage active behaviours and social interaction, reduce loneliness and stress. Green views from the home are associated with increased self-esteem, life satisfaction and happiness and reduced depression, anxiety and loneliness. Nature-based interventions and green social prescriptions effectively target vulnerable groups, resulting in significant reductions in depression, anxiety and anger alongside positive mental health outcomes. Although existing evidence is encouraging, robust, high-quality research that strengthens the evidence base and informs future clinical practice and policy decision making is needed. Evidence of the long-term effectiveness in individuals with diagnosed mental illness is also required to ascertain the potential social and wider returns on investment. Barriers to use of green social prescriptions like mental health symptoms and geographical accessibility need to be overcome to increase accessibility and uptake of green social prescriptions for the prevention and treatment of mental illness.","Wood, Wicks, Barton","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000830","20221004","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38751,""
"Association of socio-demographic characteristics with alcohol use initiation among never users during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal study","In this longitudinal cohort study, we examined the socio-demographic and psychological predictors of alcohol use initiation during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of never alcohol users aged Ã¢â€°Â¥21 prior to COVID-19. Our study population consisted of 56Ã‚Â 930 patients aged Ã¢â€°Â¥21, as of 30 March 2019 were collected from a pre-COVID period of 1 year before 31 March 2020, and during-COVID, a period between 1 April 2020 and 30 March 2021. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were utilized to examine the roles of socio-demographic variables (gender, age, education, Area Deprivation Index and rural residence) changes in anxiety and depression severity as predictors of alcohol use initiation. Age, gender, race, ethnicity, education and rural status were significant predictors in multivariable analysis. A subgroup analysis showed neither anxiety nor depression had a significant association with alcohol use initiation. Women, younger individuals, those living in a rural area and people who smoke cigarettes were more likely to initiate alcohol use during the pandemic. Our study has public health and clinical implications such as the need for targeted alcohol use screening and intervention for vulnerable individuals.","Sharma, Nguyen, Kurani, Holland, Maradit Kremers, Pazdernik, St Sauver, Croarkin, Kamath, Geske, Prasad, Glasgow, Sangaralingham, Patten","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdac099","20221004","COVID-19; alcohol; longitudinal; socio-demographic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38752,""
"Post-Intensive Care Syndrome Prevalence Six Months After Critical Covid-19: Comparison Between First and Second Waves","To explore the impact of improved intensive care for COVID-19 patients on the prevalence of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Ambispective cohort study. Post-intensive care unit COVID-19 patients from the first and second waves of COVID-19. Patients were evaluated at 6 months after infection. PICS was defined as the presence of a 1-min sit-to-stand test (1STS) score &lt; 2.5th percentile or a Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) below the 2 standard deviation cut-off, or a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 11. A total of 60 patients were included (34 from wave 1 and 26 from wave 2). Intensive care unit management improved between waves, with shorter duration of orotracheal intubation (7 vs 23.5 days, p = 0.015) and intensive care unit stay (6 vs 9.5 days, p = 0.006) in wave 2. PICS was present in 51.5% of patients after wave 1 and 52% after wave 2 (p = 0.971). Female sex and diabetes were significantly associated with PICS by multivariate analysis. Approximately half of post-intensive care unit COVID-19 patients have 1 or more impairments consistent with PICS at 6 months, with an impact on quality of life and participation. Improved intensive care unit management was not associated with a decrease in the prevalence of PICS. Identification of patients at risk, particularly women and diabetic patients, is essential. Further studies of underlying mechanisms and the need for rehabilitation are essential to reduce the risk of PICS.","Rapin, Boyer, Mourvillier, Giordano Orsini, Launois, Taiar, Deslee, Goury, Carazo-Mendez","https://doi.org/10.2340/jrm.v54.4363","20221004","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38753,""
"Impact of COVID-19 mitigation strategies on asthma hospitalizations in Brazil","In 2020, a unique social experience was provided by the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Interventions to tackle the pandemic may affect the burden of other respiratory diseases. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 mitigation strategies on hospitalizations for asthma in children aged between 1 and 14 years, adults aged between 20 and 59 years, and elderly older than 60 years. Data from hospital admissions for asthma were obtained from the Department of Informatics of Brazilian Public Health System database in the period between January 2016 and December 2020 and analyzed by age groups. To evaluate the effect of containment measures on the incidence of asthma and respiratory system diseases (total), the absolute reduction and relative reduction were calculated by analyzing the subsets from 2016 to 2019 versus 2020. There was a significant reduction in the average incidence of hospitalizations in 2020, with numbers ranging from -59% (incidence rate ratio, 0.41 [0.37-0.45]) for age 1 to 14 years (prepandemic 1,393.2/100,000 vs pandemic 574.9/100.000), -37% (incidence rate ratio, 0.63 [0.49-0.80]) for age 20 to 59 years (prepandemic 160.2/100,000 vs pandemic 101.1/100,000), and -60% (incidence rate ratio, 0.40 [0.33-0.47]) for older than 60 years (prepandemic 460.6/100,000 vs pandemic 185.3/100,000). Ashtma hospitalizations decreased in 2020, especially in the pediatric group and the older group during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be associated with the reduction in the incidence of many respiratory viral infections.","Friedrich, Montiel Petry, Brum, Van Der Sand Germani, Nunes, Zocche, Torres, Kafer, Enet, Irschlinger, Provenzi, Scotta, Stein, Jones, Pitrez, Pinto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacig.2022.03.004","20221004","COVID-19; COVID-19, Coronavirus disease 2019; DATASUS, Informatics Department of the Unified Health System; ICD-10, International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition; IRR, Incidence rate ratio; asthma; hospitalization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38754,""
"Outcomes From an Online Pilot Mindfulness Based Intervention with Adolescents: A Comparison by Categories of Risk","Comorbid psychiatric presentations, defined as those who present with more than one mental and/or behavioral health diagnosis at the same time, during adolescence are on the rise. Mindfulness-based interventions can alleviate psychological symptoms and improve emotion regulation in youth. Mindfulness is a multifaceted phenomenon, with five underlying facets (Observing, Describing, Acting with Awareness, Non-Judgment and Non-Reactivity of Inner Experience). Little evidence has documented which facets produce pronounced psychiatric symptom reduction for adolescents. This pilot study examined the efficacy of an online mindfulness-based intervention delivered to adolescents undergoing mental health treatment during COVID-19 to reduce psychiatric outcomes. Fifty-six adolescents (mÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.5 years, 66.1% female) categorized as moderate-risk (treatment histories of outpatient therapy only) or high-risk (treatment histories with intensive service participation) participated in the 8-session mindfulness-based intervention. Significant reductions in psychiatric symptoms and increases in adaptive coping strategies were observed at post-test, particularly for those at moderate-risk. Multivariate stepwise regression found significant associations between mindfulness facet use and anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms (<i>R</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> ranging from 42.5 to 52.8%). Results indicate preliminary efficacy for an online mindfulness-based intervention for adolescents, particularly those at moderate-risk, due to the introduction of new coping skills, given their history of less intense treatment. Further investigation is warranted to understand which mindfulness facet intervention components produce the most prominent outcomes.","Hutchison, Russell, Starkweather, Gans","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-022-02448-1","20221004","Adolescents; Mental health; Mindfulness facets; Mindfulness-based interventions; Online intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38755,""
"How COVID-19 shaped mental health: from infection to pandemic effects","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has threatened global mental health, both indirectly via disruptive societal changes and directly via neuropsychiatric sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite a small increase in self-reported mental health problems, this has (so far) not translated into objectively measurable increased rates of mental disorders, self-harm or suicide rates at the population level. This could suggest effective resilience and adaptation, but there is substantial heterogeneity among subgroups, and time-lag effects may also exist. With regard to COVID-19 itself, both acute and post-acute neuropsychiatric sequelae have become apparent, with high prevalence of fatigue, cognitive impairments and anxiety and depressive symptoms, even months after infection. To understand how COVID-19 continues to shape mental health in the longer term, fine-grained, well-controlled longitudinal data at the (neuro)biological, individual and societal levels remain essential. For future pandemics, policymakers and clinicians should prioritize mental health from the outset to identify and protect those at risk and promote long-term resilience.","Penninx, Benros, Klein, Vinkers","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-02028-2","20221003","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38756,""
"A cross-sectional study on the mental health of patients with COVID-19 1Ã‚Â year after discharge in Huanggang, China","This study is aimed to investigate the mental health status of COVID-19 survivors 1Ã‚Â year after discharge from hospital and reveal the related risk factors. From April 11 to May 11, 2021, 566 COVID-19 survivors in Huanggang city were recruited through their primary doctors. A total of 535 participants (94.5%) admitted to participate in the survey and completed the questionnaires. Five scales were applied including 7-Items Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Fatigue Scale-14. The chi-square and the Fisher's exact test were used to evaluate the classification data, multivariate logistic regression was used to explore the related factors of sleep quality, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One year after being discharged, of the 535 COVID-19 survivors, 252 (47.1%) had poor sleep quality; 157 (29.3%) had the symptoms of fatigue; 84 (15.7%),112 (20.9%), and 130 (24.3%) suffered from symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, respectively. The logistic regression analysis showed that history of chronic disease was risk factor for poor sleep quality (OR 2.501; 95% CI, 1.618-3.866), fatigue (OR 3.284; 95% CI 2.143-5.033), PTSD (OR 2.323; 95% CI 1.431-3.773) and depression (OR 1.950; 95% CI 1.106-3.436) in COVID-19 survivors. Smoking contributed to the poor sleep quality (OR 2.005; 95% CI 1.044-3.850), anxiety (OR 4.491; 95% CI 2.276-8.861) and depression (OR 5.459; 95% CI 2.651-11.239) in survivors. Drinking influenced fatigue (OR 2.783; 95% CI 1.331-5.819) and PTSD (OR 4.419; 95% CI 1.990-9.814) in survivors. Compared with college-educated survivors, survivors with high school education were at higher risk for poor sleep quality (OR 1.828; 95% CI 1.050-3.181) and PTSD (OR 2.521; 95% CI 1.316-4.830), and survivors with junior high school education were at higher risk for PTSD (OR 2.078; 95% CI 1.039-4.155). Compared with overweight survivors (BMIÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°23.0), survivors with normal BMI (18.5-22.9) (OR 0.600; 95% CI 0.405-0.889) were at lower risk for fatigue. While being housewife (OR 0.390; 95% CI 0.189-0.803) was protective factor for fatigue and having more family members was protective factor for PTSD (OR 0.404 95% CI 0.250-0.653) in survivors. One year after infection, poor sleep quality, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and PTSD, still existed in a relatively high proportion of COVID-19 survivors. Chronic disease history was an independent risk factor for poor sleep quality, fatigue, depression, and PTSD. Participants with low education levels were more likely to have mental problems than the others. We should focus on the long-term psychological impact of COVID-19 on survivors, and the government should apply appropriate mental health services to offer psychiatric support.","Li, He, Wang, Bai, Zhang, Chen, Li, Cai, Chen, Qu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-022-01484-8","20221003","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Fatigue; One year after discharge; PTSD; Related factors; Sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38757,""
"Mental health and visual acuity in patients with age-related macular degeneration","Visual acuity (VA) loss has been associated with depression in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, previous studies did not incorporate subgroups of AMD when correlating VA and mental health. The goal of this study was to describe the relationship between VA and mental health questions in patients with different classifications of AMD, and to identify associations of mental health subscale scores. AMD patients classified by multi-modal imaging were recruited into an AMD registry. Habitual VA was obtained by ophthalmic technicians using the Snellen VA at distance. At enrollment, patients completed the NEI-VFQ-25, which includes 25 questions regarding the patient's visual functionality. Median with interquartile-range (IQR) scores on the mental health subscale of the VFQ were calculated by AMD classification and VA groups. Univariate and multivariable general linear models were used to estimate associations between mental health scores and variables of interest. Eight hundred seventy-five patients were included in the study. Patients with bilateral geographic atrophy (GA) or bilateral GA and neovascular (NV) AMD scored lowest on the mental health subscales with a median (IQR) of 58.2 (38-88) and 59.3 (38-88). When stratified by VA, patients with a habitual VA of 20/200 or worse scored the lowest on mental health subscales scores: median of 43.8 (IQR: 31-62). Patients with a VA of 20/20 scored the highest: 87.5 (IQR: 81-94). Habitual VA of the better- and worse-seeing eye and AMD classification were significantly associated with mental health subscale scores (all pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001 in both the univariate and multivariable analysis, except the VA of the worse-seeing eye in multivariable model pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.027). Patients enrolled during the COVID pandemic had mental health scores that were 2.7 points lower than prior to the pandemic, but this difference was not significant in univariate (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.300) or multivariable analysis (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.202). There is a significant association between mental health questionnaire scores and AMD classification, as well as VA in both the better and worse-seeing eyes in patients with AMD. It is important for clinicians to recognize feelings of worry/ frustration in these patients, so they can be appropriately referred, screened, and treated for mental health problems.","Fonteh, Mathias, Mandava, Manoharan, Lynch, Navo, Patnaik, Akau, Christopher, Davidson, Eshete, Graef, Hauswirth, Lynch, Oliver, Olson, Palestine, Smith, Wagner","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12886-022-02602-9","20221004","Age-related macular degeneration; Mental health; Retina; Vison function questionnaires; COVID-19; Geographic Atrophy; Humans; Macular Degeneration; Mental Health; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vision Disorders; Visual Acuity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38758,""
"Associations between sedentary behavior and negative emotions in adolescents during home confinement: Mediating role of social support and sleep quality","Background Prolonged periods of sedentary behaviour, for instance, engendered by home confinement in Shenzhen city, has led to negative mental health consequences, especially in adolescents. Previous research suggests, in general, that sedentary behavior can increase negative emotions. However, the specific mechanism driving the relationship between sedentary behavior and negative emotions is still relatively unclear. Social support and sleep quality might partly explain the effect of sedentary behavior on negative emotions. Thus, the current study aimed to examine the associations between sedentary behavior and negative emotions, and to investigate if social support and sleep quality mediate such a relationship. Method During home confinement due to the COVID-19 Omicron variant outbreak, 1179 middle and high school students in Shenzhen were invited to voluntarily complete an e-questionnaire, including the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF), the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data from 1065 participants were included in the analysis. Results We observed significant sex-related and demografic-related differences in emotional (e.g., anxiety, stress and social support) and other outcome variables (e.g., sitting duration and PSQI score). Furthermore, sedentary behavior, social support, and sleep quality were associated with negative emotions (p < .01), even after controlling for sex, age, only-child case, body mass index, and metabolic equivalent level. In addition, social support and sleep quality partially mediated the association between sedentary behavior and negative emotions. Conclusion The findings of the current study suggest that social support and sleep quality partially mediate the relationship between sedentary behavior and negative emotions in middle and high school students during home confinement in Shenzhen city.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2022.100337","20230101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38759,""

"Food safety knowledge, attitudes, and practices among female food handlers engaged in home-based online food businesses in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic","Home-based online food businesses have expanded as a result of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. The objectives of the current study were to identify the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among female food handlers who are engaged in home-based online food businesses in Jordan and to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on food safety measures amongst food providers. The study was a cross-sectional survey. A validated, reliable questionnaire was distributed among female food handlers who are engaged in home-based online food businesses via social media platforms. The researchers also reached out to the participants via cellphone calls. A total of 204 respondents completed the questionnaire. The results revealed that the respondents had low knowledge, negative attitudes, and improper practices toward food safety with a mean score of 22.6 out of 42 points (53.8%). In ""personal hygiene"" and ""cleaning and sanitation"" aspects, the respondents showed a high score of KAP (=60.0%). Respondents had low KAP scores (<60.0%) in the areas of ""cross-contamination prevention"", ""safe storage, thawing, cooking, holding, and reheating of foods"", ""health problems that would affect food safety"", ""symptoms of foodborne diseases"" and ""COVID-19 KAP"". There was a significant correlation (P < 0.05) between the overall food safety KAP score and both the age of the participant and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on participantsâ€™ concerns about food safety. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore food safety KAP among female food handlers who are engaged in food businesses at homes in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is expected to benefit regulatory authorities establish food safety standards and regulations for home-based food businesses.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10427","20220801","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38765,""

"Adolescent Risk-Taking Across Population Subgroups of the United States","Aim Adolescence is assumed to be the period of the lifespan with the highest risk-taking and sensation-seeking behaviors. A normative peak in risk-taking during adolescence is thought to underlie both adaptive (e.g., independence from caregivers) and potentially harmful (e.g., substance use) outcomes. There are however, many population-level sociodemographic and psychological factors that have been speculated to be associated with risk-taking and sensation-seeking across the lifespan, and with mental health disorders where these behaviors are diagnostically relevant. Yet, it is not well known whether such factors influence the hypothesized lifespan peaks in risk-taking during adolescence and/or its link to harmful outcomes (e.g., substance use). Clarifying the generalizability of adolescent peaks in risk-taking across population-level, sociodemographic and psychiatric factors is thus essential for establishing broadly applicable and inclusive models of behavioral development for both basic developmental science and clinical care. Large-scale, national survey data provide a well-suited means towards testing these goals and can inform the increasing number of smaller, targeted studies of adolescent risk-taking. Methods National Survey on Drug Use and Health 2002-2019 data (N=1,005,421; 12-65-years-old) were used to fit non-linear lifespan trajectories (via spline regression) of a self-reported risk-taking propensity measure. Variation in this measure across the lifespan and its link to substance use during adolescence were examined in independent models across 19 sociodemographic and psychiatric subgroups (sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, population density, religious affiliation, and mental health) Results Self-reported risk-taking displayed a non-linear trajectory across the lifespan, with a robust peak during mid-adolescence (~16 years-old) that matched basic science theories of adolescent development. While average-level (â€œmain effectsâ€) differences on adolescent risk-taking were observed (e.g., males reported more risk-taking than females), population subgroups displayed highly consistent lifespan peaks in risk-taking during mid to late adolescence (18/19 subgroups displayed peaks between 15-18-years old). Likewise, across nearly all population subgroups, higher levels of risk-taking consistently disambiguated adolescents who regularly use cannabis or alcohol from non-using adolescents. Conclusions Results support predictions of adolescence as the period of the lifespan with the highest risk-taking that potentially confers vulnerability to negative outcomes, including substance use. The consistency of adolescent peaks in risk-taking and links to regular cannabis and alcohol use across nearly all population subgroups, suggests risk-taking measures may be useful in large-scale screening and related prevention efforts.","Brenden Tervo-Clemmens et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0019-917-A78","20221005","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; non-linear; risk-taking; substance use; nsduh; lifespan; adolescence","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38770,""
"The Calm Before COVID-19â€™s Storm: Unique Associations Between Pre-Pandemic Authoritative Parenting, Early Pandemic Stressors, and Children's Depression and Anxiety Symptoms","Large-scale changes due to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic negatively affected childrenâ€™s mental health. Prior research suggests that childrenâ€™s mental health problems during the pandemic may have been concurrently attenuated by authoritative parenting style and exacerbated by family stress. However, there is a gap in the literature investigating whether pre-pandemic authoritative parenting had a lasting positive influence on childrenâ€™s mental health while they were exposed to pandemic-related family stressors. Our study begins to fill this gap by investigating these unique relationships in a sample of 106 4-8 year old children (51% female). Before the pandemic, caregivers completed questionnaires on their parenting style and their childrenâ€™s depression and anxiety symptoms. Shortly after the onset of COVID-19â€™s stay-at-home mandate, parents answered questionnaires about their childrenâ€™s depression and anxiety symptoms and pandemic-related family stressors. Child depression and anxiety symptom severity increased. Higher levels of pandemic-related family stress were associated with increases only in child anxiety scores. Further, greater endorsement of a pre-pandemic authoritative parenting style was associated with smaller changes only in child depression scores. Study findings elucidate unique and complex associations between young childrenâ€™s anxiety and depressive symptoms severity and pre-pandemic parenting and pandemic-related family stressors.","Karina Heaton et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01C5-62C-F53","20221004","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; early childhood; stressors; authoritative parenting style; covid-19; depression; collective trauma; anxiety","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-06","",38771,""
