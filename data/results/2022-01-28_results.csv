"What Was It Like to Deliver Psychotherapy During the COVID- 19 Pandemic? Understanding Therapists' Perspectives Using a Phenomenological Collaborative Writing Approach","COVID-19 presented rapid challenges to usual practice within mental health services. Despite the suspension of face-to-face psychotherapy, as a group we felt compelled to adapt so that our relationships with patients could continue. This article documents some of the challenges and opportunities faced by our group. We use collaborative writing as a method of inquiry, informed by a phenomenological approach. Each of the six therapists in the group and the supervisor wrote a freestyle personal reflection;when these reflections were viewed together, noticeable themes emerged which bear relevance to future practice. We present here anonymised vignettes (excerpts from therapists' reflections) under thematic headings, to bring to life the collaboratively written discussions that follow. These include important moments related to the transition from face-to-face practice, and new perspectives on beginnings and endings in therapy. We highlight the power of holding onto hope for those that we work alongside, of advocating for the importance of these relationships, and of the vital role played by regular supervision meetings. The pandemic has prompted us to question our way of working and has shown us new ways to be flexible in the future. We invite others to reflect on whether they relate to our experiences or have different perspectives on the delivery of psychotherapy during such unpredictable times.","Hall, Katherine, Pitt, Alice, Pope, Emma","https://doi.org/10.46743/2160-3715/2022.5241","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: The Qualitative Report; 27(1):131-142, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26089,""
"Sleep quality and mental health in coronavirus disease 2019 patients and general population during the pandemic","OBJECTIVE: Sleep problems during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic commonly affected general populations. Data on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep quality in Saudi Arabia are scarce. Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate sleep quality and assess the psychological burden of the pandemic in COVID-19 patients and the general population. METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational, cross-sectional survey. Participants with COVID-19 were recruited from different health-care centers in the western region during the lockdown period from May 13, 2020 to September 2, 2020. All participants completed a validated online survey. The control group comprised individuals from the general public who responded to the online survey through social media. Demographic data, COVID-19 status, and history of chronic diseases were collected. Sleep quality, depression, and insomnia were assessed using validated questionnaires. Results: In total, 1091 participants were surveyed and 643 (58.9%) were positive for COVID-19. Poor sleep quality was reported in 66.1% of COVID-19 patients (mean score Â± standard deviation [SD] 6.9 Â± 4.0) and 72.8% of controls (mean score Â± SD 7.6 Â± 4.3). Insomnia affected 50.5% of COVID-19 patients (mean score Â± SD 6.5 Â± 5.5) and 58.5% of controls (mean score Â± SD 7.6 Â± 5.5). Depression was diagnosed in 39.5% of COVID-19 patients (mean score Â± SD 4.7 Â± 4.6) and 70.1% of controls (mean score Â± SD 8.9 Â± 6.7). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had a great impact on mental health and sleep quality in both COVID-19 patients and the general population but more pronounced in the general population.","Alshumrani, Ranya, Sultan, Qanash, Aldobyany, Ahmad, Faris, Alhejaili, Ibrahim, AlQassas, Shabrawishi, Mohammed, Alnashiwaty, Omar, Badghaish, Mohannad, Adnan, Mohammad, Afeef, Ahmed, Alghamdi, Dhafer, Aljehani, Salman, Alsurahi, Anas, Faruqui, Abdulaziz, Krayem, Ayman, Manzar, Md, Wali, Siraj","https://doi.org/10.4103/atm.atm_191_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Annals of Thoracic Medicine; 17(1):21-27, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26090,""
"Can Electric Bicycles Enhance Leisure and Tourism Activities and City Happiness?","Using Meizhou City as an example, the aim of this study was to verify whether e-bike sharing systems can improve the convenience of engaging in leisure and tourism activities in cities, and thus increase residentsâ€™ well-being. First, quantitative research was carried out to collect data on usersâ€™ opinions. Then, qualitative research was carried out to obtain the opinions of experts. Finally, the investigation was conducted using multivariate review analysis. The results of the research showed that e-bikes should be classified based on electric quantity, the rental fee should be charged based on mileage, and the relevant corporate information should be integrated. It is also necessary to develop a software interface with functions for users to rent e-bikes and search for information related to consumption, leisure, and travel activities, and make promotion plans. Finally, people need to be encouraged to cycle to obtain the benefits of leisure and exercise. In this manner, the convenience of participation in leisure and tourism activities can be increased, peopleâ€™s physical and mental health will be substantially improved, and the happiness index of the people and the city will increase.","Hsiao-Hsien, Lin, Chih-Chien, Shen, I-Cheng, Hsu, Pei-Yi, Wu","https://doi.org/10.3390/en14238144","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Energies; 14(23):8144, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26091,""
"School Closures During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Psychosocial Outcomes in Children - a Systematic Review","With implemented school closures, the global crisis of COVID-19 has caused drastic changes in the dynamics and routines of children and their families. The rapid transition to homeschooling and social distancing measures have been particularly challenging for schoolchildren and their parents. In the adverse situation of COVID-19, children are more vulnerable to contextual factors such as familial risks, leading to unfavorable outcomes in childrenâ€™s mental health, their emotional and psychosocial development. The present study aimed to synthesize available literature on psychosocial outcomes in schoolchildren (ages 6â€“13 years) who were exposed to family-related stressors during mandatory school closures. A systematic review was carried out, following the PRISMA guideline. A total of 419 records were retrieved from electronic databases, journals, and reference lists of primary studies and reviews. Studies were analyzed by the interrelation of negative child outcomes and parent-related variables during the period of school closure. Ten studies were included in this review. Studies varied in quality, in the combination of psychosocial factors, and child outcomes. Identified psychosocial variables impacting children included parental mental health, parental stress, parent-child interaction, and parenting stress. Identified negative outcomes in children encompassed emotional problems, behavioral problems, hyperactivity, anxiety and depression. Overall, results highlighted the link between childrenâ€™s psychological response and parent-related variables during school closures. Results show that pandemic-related school closures had a considerable effect on children. However, findings cannot be interpreted conclusive as studies measured other factors, that contributed to a childâ€™s psychological status quo.

"Examination of Home Quarantine Experiences of Individuals Diagnosed With COVID-19 Living in Turkey","The primary purpose of this research is to examine the experiences of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 regarding the quarantine process. This research was carried out in a phenomenological design, one of the qualitative research approaches. A total of 212 volunteers, 153 women (72.2%) and 59 men (27.8), took part in this research via an online questionnaire. As a data collection tool, an online questionnaire prepared by the researcher was used. The data were analyzed within the framework of content analysis. In the findings of the research, 4 themes named as being diagnosed with COVID-19, quarantine process, worst-case scenario and coping with uncertainty were got. Based on the research findings, in staying in quarantine at home, besides the physiological effects of the virus, it can be concluded that individuals are trying to struggle with the emotional burden of the situation they are in. For this reason, it is of great importance to provide mental health support to individuals who are in quarantine at home, considering the social, psychological, and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Backward Trajectory and Multifractal Analysis of Air Pollution in Zhengzhou Region of China","With the continuous promotion of industrialization and urbanization, China's environmental pollution is becoming increasingly serious, which has caused considerable damage to the natural balance. Air pollution seriously harms people's physical and mental health, the ecological environment, and the social sustainable development of society. In this study, the backward trajectory model and multifractal methods were adopted to analyze air pollution in Zhengzhou. The backward trajectory analysis showed that most clusters of air pollution were from southern Hebei, eastern Shandong, and mid-western Henan, which were then transported to Zhengzhou. For the PSCF and CWT analyses, we selected four representative cities to explore how close the air pollution of Zhengzhou is to other areas on the basis of air polluted concentration. The results of several multifractal methods indicated that multifractality existed in the AQI time series of Zhengzhou and cross-correlations between Zhengzhou and each of the four cities. The widths of multifractal spectra showed that the air pollution in Zhengzhou was closest to that in Jinan, followed by Shijiazhuang, Zibo, and Luoyang. The CDFA analysis showed that carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and inhalable particulate matter (PM10) had important influences on air pollution in Zhengzhou. These findings offer a useful reference for air pollution sources and their potential contributions in Zhengzhou, which can support policy makers in environmental governance and in achieving sustainable urban development.","Wang, Qizhen, Zhao, Tong, Wang, Rong, Zhang, Ling","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/2226565","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Mathematical Problems in Engineering; 2022, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26095,""
"The bad, the ugly and the monster behind the mirror - Food insecurity, mental health and socio-economic determinants","Food insecurity is associated with poor mental health outcomes, including depression and anxiety and COVID-19 could increase these relations. In this sense, we aimed to explore the relationship between food insecurity and mental health features and behaviors in adults from Portugal. We conducted a cross-sectional online snowball study from November 2020 until February 2021. A total of 882 Portuguese residents 18Ã‚Â years of age or older with food security data were included. Data on socio-demographics, food security status, and anxiety and depression symptoms were collected. Crude and adjusted logistic regression models were performed. Odds ratio (OR) and respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Most participants were women (71.3%), with a mean (SD) age of 36.8 (10.9) years, three-thirds had a university degree (76.7%), and 65.3% lived in the country's northern region. Regarding the characteristics associated with food insecurity, we observed that less-educated participants (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7.84; 95% CI: 3.67-16.73), with depression symptoms (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5.91; 95% CI: 3.12-11.19) and with anxiety symptoms (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6.41; 95% CI: 3.02-13.59), had a higher odds of belonging to a food-insecure household. After adjustments less educated individuals (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8.37; 95% CI: 3.81-18.35), those who faced a reduction in income (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.27; 95% CI: 0.13-0.53) and, presenting anxiety symptoms (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7.32; 95% CI: 3.53-15.17) had a higher odds of belonging to a food-insecure household. Approaching food insecurity without addressing mental health, and the opposite is making partial and reductive interventions.

"Neuropsychological, medical and psychiatric findings after recovery from acute COVID-19: A cross-sectional study","This study describes neuropsychological, medical, psychiatric and functional correlates of cognitive complaints experienced after recovery from acute COVID-19 infection. Sixty participants underwent neuropsychological (NP), psychiatric, medical, functional, and quality of life assessments 6-8 months after acute COVID-19. Those seeking care cognitive complaints in a post-COVID-19 clinical program for Post-Acute Symptoms of COVID-19 (PASC) (Clinical Group, N=32) were compared to those recruited from the community who were not seeking care (Non-Clinical, N=28). A subset of participants underwent serological testing for pro-inflammatory cytokines C-Reactive Protein, Interleukin-6, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-ÃŽÂ± in order to explore correlations with neuropsychological, psychiatric and medical variables. For the entire sample, 16 (27%) had extremely low test scores (&lt; 2<sup>nd</sup> %ile on at least 1 NP test). The Clinical Group with cognitive complaints scored lower than age-adjusted population norms in tests of attention, processing speed, memory, and executive function, and significantly more scored in the extremely low range than the Non-Clinical Group (38% vs. 14%, p&lt;0.04). The Clinical Group also reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, fatigue, PTSD and functional difficulties and lower quality of life. In logistic regression analysis, scoring in the extremely low range was predicted by acute COVID-19 symptoms, current depression score, number of medical comorbidities and subjective cognitive complaints in the areas of memory, language, and executive functions. IL-6 correlated with acute COVID symptoms, number of medical comorbidities, fatigue, and measures of executive function. CRP correlated with current COVID symptoms, depression score and, inversely, with quality of life. Results suggest the existence of extremely low neuropsychological test performance experienced by some individuals months after acute COVID-19 infection, affecting multiple neurocognitive domains. This extremely low neuropsychological test performance is associated with worse acute COVID-19 symptoms, depression, medical comorbidities, functional complaints, and subjective cognitive complaints. Exploratory correlations with pro-inflammatory cytokines support further research into inflammatory mechanisms and viable treatments.","Ferrando, Dornbush, Lynch, Shahar, Klepacz, Karmen, Chen, Lobo, Lerman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaclp.2022.01.003","20220127","COVID-19; Post-Acute Symptoms of COVID-19 (PASC); cognitive complaints; neuropsychiatry; neuropsychological testing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26097,""
"Validation of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and Self-Report (QIDS-SR16) for the Brazilian population","The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QID-SR16), a self-report instrument based on the DSM-IV criteria that assesses the severity of depression symptoms, in the Brazilian population.

"Impact of high platelet turnover on the platelet transcriptome: Results from platelet RNA-sequencing in patients with sepsis","Sepsis is associated with high platelet turnover and elevated levels of immature platelets. Changes in the platelet transcriptome and the specific impact of immature platelets on the platelet transcriptome remain unclear. Thus, this study sought to address whether and how elevated levels of immature platelets affect the platelet transcriptome in patients with sepsis. Blood samples were obtained from patients with sepsis requiring vasopressor therapy (n = 8) and from a control group of patients with stable coronary artery disease and otherwise similar demographic characteristics (n = 8). Immature platelet fraction (IPF) was determined on a Sysmex XE 2100 analyser and platelet function was tested by impedance aggregometry. RNA from leukocyte-depleted platelets was used for transcriptome analysis by Next Generation Sequencing integrating the use of unique molecular identifiers. IPF (median [interquartile range]) was significantly elevated in sepsis patients (6.4 [5.3-8.7] % vs. 3.6 [2.6-4.6] %, p = 0.005). Platelet function testing revealed no differences in adenosine diphosphate- or thrombin receptor activating peptide-induced platelet aggregation between control and sepsis patients. Putative circular RNA transcripts were decreased in platelets from septic patients. Leukocyte contamination defined by CD45 abundance levels in RNA-sequencing was absent in both groups. Principal component analysis of transcripts showed only partial overlap of clustering with IPF levels. RNA sequencing showed up-regulation of 524 and down-regulation of 118 genes in platelets from sepsis patients compared to controls. Upregulated genes were mostly related to catabolic processes and protein translation. Comparison to published platelet transcriptomes showed a large overlap of changes observed in sepsis and COVID-19 but not with reticulated platelets from healthy donors. Patients with sepsis appear to have a less degraded platelet transcriptome as indicated by increased levels of immature platelets and decreased levels of putative circular RNA transcripts. The present data suggests that increased protein translation is a characteristic mechanism of systemic inflammation.","NÃƒÂ¼hrenberg, StÃƒÂ¶ckle, Marini, Zurek, GrÃƒÂ¼ning, Benes, Hein, Neumann, Stratz, Cederqvist, Hochholzer","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260222","20220127","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26099,""

"Childhood adversity, reward processing, and health during the COVID-19 outbreak: The mediating role of reward learning","Childhood adversity (CA) is associated with various health problems, and recent data suggest reward processing may be an important mechanism linking the 2. However, different reward processing dimensions may have distinct roles in these associations that may be sensible to the psychological impact of more recent stressful events. We examined these associations in the COVID-19 pandemic context. A community sample of 419 respondents (M age = 27.32 years, SD = 8.98, 88.1% females) completed an online survey. Participants filled in self-report measures of CA, reward processing dimensions, depressive and anxiety symptoms, physical status, and psychological impact of COVID-19. CA was significantly associated (p &lt; .05) with depressive (r = .20) and anxiety symptoms (r = .19), physical health (r= -.16), reward learning (r = -.11) and responsiveness (r = -.16), but not reward valuation. Reward learning mediated the association between CA and all health status indicators (i.e., higher CA predicted decreased reward learning which in turn predicted increased depressive and anxiety symptoms and poorer physical health). Psychological impact of COVID-19 did not moderate the mediating role of reward processing in the associations between CA and health outcomes. Reward learning appears to be the only reward processing dimension which cuts across depressive and anxiety symptoms, and physical health problems, providing information about their onset and maintenance. Given that these findings suggest that it is a potential transdiagnostic mechanism for these various health problems, reward learning should be targeted through specific interventions.

"Predicting depression and anxiety among adults with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic","Emerging research has highlighted sources of magnified stress and trauma for people with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, as compared to others in the general population. However, little research has examined the mental health impact of the pandemic on people with disabilities in relation to disability-related stigma, social isolation, and demographic characteristics. The present study therefore sought to identify predictors of depression and anxiety symptoms among U.S. adults with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research Method/Design: Data were collected online between October and December 2020. U.S. adults with disabilities (<i>n</i> = 441) completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, psychosocial processes, and a range of demographic and disability characteristics. In our sample, 61.0% and 50.0% of participants met criteria for a probable diagnosis of major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, respectively. Participants also experienced significantly higher levels of disability-related stigma and social isolation compared to prepandemic norms. Hierarchical regression analyses identified higher social isolation, presence of chronic pain, younger age, higher disability-related stigma, and higher worries about contracting COVID-19 as significant predictors of both depression and anxiety symptoms. This study highlights important demographic and psychosocial predictors of mental health risks for people with disabilities in the context of COVID-19. Findings further underscore the need to attend to those at elevated risk within the disability community as rehabilitation professionals, disability organizations, and policy makers work to support people with disabilities in postpandemic recovery and create a more equitable response to ongoing and future public health crises.

Worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms was observed in patients with dementia and mild cognitive impairment, especially agitation/aggression, anxiety, depression and apathy. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were more common in patients with dementia than in those with mild cognitive impairment, although their typology varied depending on the severity of dementia. During lockdown a worsening in the psychobehavioral area has been observed in people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Therefore, considerations arise on the need of promoting social contact in people with mild cognitive impairment and dementia, avoiding situations of isolation and low stimulation. SÃƒÂ­ntomas neuropsiquiÃƒÂ¡tricos en personas con demencia relacionados con el confinamiento por la pandemia de la COVID-19. RevisiÃƒÂ³n sistemÃƒÂ¡tica exploratoria. IntroducciÃƒÂ³n. En pacientes con deterioro cognitivo leve y demencia, son frecuentes los sÃƒÂ­ntomas neuropsiquiÃƒÂ¡tricos, que pueden aparecer o exacerbarse ante los cambios en la rutina y el entorno habitual del paciente. La situaciÃƒÂ³n de confinamiento durante la pandemia de la COVID-19 ha supuesto un cambio en la vida cotidiana de la poblaciÃƒÂ³n general, con especial impacto en los grupos mÃƒÂ¡s vulnerables, como los pacientes con afectaciÃƒÂ³n cognitiva. Objetivo. Conocer la repercusiÃƒÂ³n de las medidas de confinamiento y cuarentena impuestas por la pandemia de la COVID-19 en la sintomatologÃƒÂ­a neuropsiquiÃƒÂ¡trica en personas con deterioro cognitivo leve (DCL) y demencia. Materiales y mÃƒÂ©todos. RevisiÃƒÂ³n sistemÃƒÂ¡tica exploratoria, siguiendo las directrices PRISMA, de artÃƒÂ­culos en las bases datos PubMed y PsycINFO publicados entre enero de 2020 y abril de 2021, que relacionaron el confinamiento por la COVID-19 con la presentaciÃƒÂ³n o el empeoramiento de sÃƒÂ­ntomas neuropsiquiÃƒÂ¡tricos en pacientes con DCL o con demencia. Resultados. Se observÃƒÂ³ un empeoramiento de los sÃƒÂ­ntomas neuropsiquiÃƒÂ¡tricos en los pacientes con demencia y DCL, especialmente agitaciÃƒÂ³n/agresiÃƒÂ³n, ansiedad, depresiÃƒÂ³n y apatÃƒÂ­a.

"Effects of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) on Mental Health and Resiliency of Migrant Live-in Caregivers in Canada: Pilot Randomized Wait List Controlled Trial","Temporary migrant live-in caregivers constitute a vulnerable stream of temporary foreign workers in Canada. This is because the majority are racialized women from the Global South, the gendered nature of caregiving work has historically been undervalued, and their working and living spheres are intertwined which makes application of labor laws and surveillance almost impossible. Their invisible position in the fabric of Canadian society along with their precarious employment and immigration status place their mental health at jeopardy. There is a paucity of research about psychological support for this population. Our pilot study Women Empowerment-Caregiver Acceptance and Resilience E-Learning (WE2CARE) aimed to assess the efficacy of a 6-week online delivery of a psychological intervention based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) in reducing psychological distress and promoting resiliency among live-in care givers in the Greater Toronto Area. A pilot randomized wait list controlled design was used. Participants were recruited by two community peer champions working with community health organizations serving migrant live-in caregivers. A total of 36 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention and wait list control groups; 7 dropped out of the study due to competing life priorities. Standardized self-reported surveys were administered online pre-, post-, and 6-week postintervention to assess mental distress (DASS-21), psychological flexibility (AAQ-2), mindfulness (CAMS-R), and Multi-System Model of Resilience (MSMR-I). Independent and dependent t tests were used to compare study outcomes at pre, post, and 6-week follow-up across and within both arms of the study. Linear mixed effects models were created for each outcome of interest from baseline to postintervention among intervention and control participants. Self-reported impact of the WE2CARE intervention was examined using independent t tests across the study arms. Average age of participants was 38 years. Many were born in the Philippines (23/29, 79%). The data on the impact of the psychological intervention showed a lower level of depression, anxiety, and stress among the intervention group compared with the control. However, the differences were not significant due to small sample size and COVID-19 crisis (6.94 vs 9.50, P=.54; 6.94 vs 10.83, P=.20; 7.76 vs 10.33, P=.44, respectively). There was a significant improvement in mindful qualities and external resilience, particularly in life satisfaction and accessible support among the intervention group (37.18 vs 32.92, t<sub>22</sub>=2.35, P=.03; 20.29 vs 16.5, t<sub>21</sub>=2.98, P=.007; 8.47 vs 6.75, t<sub>14</sub>=2.41, P=.03; 7.59 vs 5.33, t<sub>16</sub>=.008, respectively). WE2CARE is among the first studies exploring the efficacy of online delivery of ACT in addressing mental health challenges among live-in caregivers. While there are increased web-based ACT interventions, few use group videoconferencing to promote peer connection and mutual support. WE2CARE showed promising results in reducing psychological distress and promoting mindfulness and resiliency. The intervention highly motivated participants to engage collectively in building social support networks.

"Changes of immunosuppressive medication because of COVID-19 by patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases: anxiety was not a major driver","To study treatment decisions of patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases (CIRD) at the beginning of the SARS- CoV-2 pandemic in relation to disease characteristics with focus on anxiety. A total of 970 CIRD patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), psoriasis arthritis (PsA) and connective tissue diseases (CTD), selected from our records who had presented to our hospital at least twice during last year, were contacted by telephone to be asked about medication changes, health status and therapy satisfaction. Standardised tools were used to assess disease activity, anxiety and depression, the latter by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS) with a score Ã¢â€°Â¥8 denoting definite anxiety and/or depression. The cut-off for RADAI was set at Ã¢â€°Â¥3.2 and for BASDAI Ã¢â€°Â¥4. Compliance with prevention rules and vaccination status were assessed. Complete interviews of 557 patients (57.4%) made between April and July 2020 were available for analysis. The median age was 55 (47-63), disease duration 9.0 (4.5-17.0) years, 61.9% females. A recent change in medication was reported by 197 patients (35.4%), 51.2% of which admitted that this decision was mainly made due to the pandemic with more changes occurring with bDMARDs (21.8%) than cDMARDs (6.6%) and corticosteroids (5.4%). There was no major difference between patients who changed because of the pandemic or self-reported inactive disease versus patients who did not change therapy regarding disease activity, depression and anxiety (41%, 17.2%, 31.3% vs. 47.5%, 22.5%, 35.0% vs. 48.9%, 27.7%, 34.1%). More than 90% of patients reported that they rigorously followed Corona prevention rules. The majority of patients were vaccinated against influenza (55.3%) and pneumococci (61.3%), respectively. Anxiety, depression and disease activity did not play an important role in decisions favouring change of therapy, even though many patients changed medication due to the pandemic. Patients probably protected themselves by strictly adhering to hygiene recommendations. Vaccination rates against influenza and pneumococci were better than previously reported, but still too low.","Andreica, Jast, Rezniczek, Kiefer, Buehring, Kiltz, Baraliakos, Braun","https://www.google.com/search?q=Changes+of+immunosuppressive+medication+because+of+COVID-19+by+patients+with+chronic+inflammatory+rheumatic+diseases:+anxiety+was+not+a+major+driver.","20220127","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26106,""
"Perceived coping mitigates anxiety symptoms in the context of COVID-19 stress in an urban university student sample","Perceived coping, and its two subprocesses, trauma-focused coping, or finding meaning in the details and memory of a potential trauma or stressor, and forward-focused coping, or focusing on planning for the future, have been shown to be important in the context of potentially traumatic events. The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated stressors have negatively affected population mental health, and preliminary investigations have demonstrated the importance of perceived abilities to cope during the pandemic. The current study sought to examine the potentially moderating role of each subprocess on the relationship between stress and anxiety symptoms in a low-income student sample during COVID-19 (N=2364). We computed two hierarchical multiple linear regressions to assess for significant interactions between stress and perceived coping subprocess scores on anxiety outcomes. Our results demonstrated that both trauma-focused coping, and forward-focused coping, served as effect modifiers in the relationship between COVID-19 related stress and anxiety. Such findings highlight the importance of interventions that incorporate both forms of coping for low-income students during a chronic stressor.","Rudenstine, Schulder, Ettman, Galea","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941221074038","20220127","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coping; Disability &amp; Trauma; Mental &amp; Physical Health; Mental Health; Stress; Violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26107,""
"GH Therapy in children and adolescents with Growth Hormone Deficiency during the first phase of COVID-19 lockdown: a survey in an Italian center","Coronavirus Disease - 19 (COVID-19) had a profound impact on mental health of people and can influence the quality of life of children who need chronic therapies, affecting daily adherence to drug therapy and altering long-term outcomes. In Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) regular drug intake guarantees height improvement and, consequently, self-esteem of children. We conducted a survey to evaluate adherence to daily therapy and changes of height standard deviations in children with GHD during a pandemic-associated lockdown. 30 children (17 boys and 13 girls) with aged between 7 and 18 years were examined during the observational period. Adherence to therapy (self-reported and also confirmed with a standardized questionnaire), height and growth velocity during treatment were analyzed. All of our patients reported a moderate to high level of adherence during the period of sanitary emergency (N=2 Morisky 7; N=28 Morisky 8). Adherence assessed by the Morisky Scale was in agreement in all cases with the self-reported one. Analysis of our data confirmed an improvement of the patients' height standard deviations, which could be related to the good adherence to growth hormone therapy during lockdown. We can hypothesize that limitations during the lockdown period have positively influenced adherence to therapy and, consequently, height standard deviations of children with GHD in substitution therapy. The evaluation of adherence carried out by our interview showed an increased regularity in hormonal administration due to various factors, such as the greatest amount of time spent indoors. The increased adherence is coherent with the results of our auxological evaluations, which showed an increase in percentiles and standard deviations of height, compared to chronological age.","Sodero, Talloa, Cipolla","https://doi.org/10.23736/S2724-5276.21.06645-3","20220127","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26108,""

"The impact of early stages of COVID-19 on the mental health of autistic adults in the United Kingdom: A longitudinal mixed-methods study","During the COVID-19 pandemic, high levels of depression, anxiety and stress have been reported in the general population. However, much less has been reported about the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of autistic people. What we did: In the present study, we investigated how the mental health of autistic adults in the United Kingdom changed during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 133 participants completed an online survey at two different time points. Of the 133 participants, 70 completed the survey at the first time point just before the onset of the national lockdown. This allowed us to look at changes in their mental health, from before the lockdown to 10 to 15Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks during lockdown. All participants (133) told us about their experiences of the pandemic. What we found: While many autistic adults told us that their mental health worsened, people's experience varied. For some autistic adults, aspects of mental health (e.g. anxiety, stress) actually improved. Participants also described social changes that had occurred, at home and in the outside world. They described feelings of uncertainty during the pandemic, and discussed how the pandemic had affected some of their previous coping strategies. Participants also told us about their difficulties in accessing healthcare services and food during the early stages of the pandemic. In our article, we discuss these findings and focus on what needs to change to ensure that autistic people are better supported as the pandemic continues.","Bundy, Mandy, Crane, Belcher, Bourne, Brede, Hull, Brinkert, Cook","https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613211065543","20220127","COVID-19; adults; anxiety; autism spectrum disorders; depression; health services; mental health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26111,""
"The benefits and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for patients diagnosed with cancer and their family caregivers","The objectives of this study were to examine benefits and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for patients diagnosed with cancer and their family caregivers. A 23-item questionnaire assessing COVID-19-related issues, the Patient Health Questionnaire-2, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)-4 were administered to patients diagnosed with cancer and their family caregivers. Of the 161 patients and 78 caregivers who participated, 38.1% and 32.8 were male, 95% and 84.6% Caucasian, and the mean age was 66 and 64.6 years, respectively. A total of 16.5% and 15.2% reported depressive symptoms, 18.4% and 19% reported anxiety; 35.5% and 26.6% reported poor sleep quality, and 66% and 63.3% scored one standard deviation above the norms for the PSS, respectively. Predictors of poorer patient- and caregiver-reported outcomes included greater loneliness, worry about self or family being infected by the COVID-19, and worsening relationships with family. The fear of COVID-19 led to 20.8% of patients and 24.4% of family caregivers cancelling medical appointments, procedures, and treatments. A total of 52.5% of patients and 53.2% caregivers reported that the pandemic led to benefit finding but these changes were not associated with any of the measured patient- or caregiver-related outcomes. Psychological functioning for patients and caregivers was similar to that of pre-pandemic levels, however the decrease in health care utilization secondary to fear of COVID-19 was notable. While there were many negative effects of the pandemic, the majority of patients and caregivers reported some benefit to the pandemic. This article is protected by copyright.

Using newly released register data on all general practitioner consultations in Norway through 2020 (about 14 million consultations in total), we find that during the spring and early summer 2020, the number of psychological cases initially increased relative to prior years, but then fell back towards the level of prior years during the summer 2020. In early September 2020, the number of cases accelerated, a pattern that held up through December 2020, so that the gap between 2020 and prior years became largest end-of-year.

"Love in the Time of COVID-19: A Multi-Wave Study Examining the Salience of Sexual and Relationship Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The current study used Family Systems Theory as a framework to clarify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual, romantic, and individual functioning. Specifically, sexual and romantic functioning were modeled as key mechanisms linking COVID-19 related stressors (as predictors) to aspects of individual functioning over time (as outcomes). A sample of 1,241 sexually active adults in relationships (47% married/engaged) was recruited from March 5 to May 5, 2020: 82% White, 66% women, MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°34 years old, 58% heterosexual. All participants completed a baseline survey and 642 participants completed at least one of the six, monthly, follow-up surveys. Multilevel SEM models evaluated the model both at the level of stable between-person differences (i.e., level 2) and at the level of within-person change across time (i.e., level 1). The findings suggested that COVID-19 related stress was predictive of lower sexual, romantic, and individual functioning in both levels of the model. Significant indirect paths supported the proposed mediation at the level of within-person change across time: elevations in COVID-19 stress within specific months predicted corresponding drops in sexual functioning, which in turn predicted corresponding drops in romantic functioning, which in turn predicted corresponding drops in individual well-being (highlighting points of intervention). In contrast, at the level of between-person differences, stable levels of sexual and relationship satisfaction across the 6Ã‚Â months of the study were not associated with stable levels of COVID-19 stressors (representing sources of resilience that promoted well-being) and stable levels of stress from social isolation predicted stably higher amounts of communicating affection to one's loved ones (suggesting a need for affiliation in the face of chronic stress) whereas stable difficulties with orgasms were linked to stable irritability toward partners and depressive symptoms. Multigroup analyses suggested that the findings generalized across gender, age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, relationship stage, and cohabitation groups. Spillover effects within a Family Systems Theory framework clarify how upheaval of the COVID-19 pandemic could have impacted sexual, romantic, and individual functioning in a process-oriented framework, highlighting sources of resilience (sexual satisfaction, communicating affection) and risk (orgasm difficulties).","Pollard, Rogge","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-021-02208-0","20220127","COVID-19; Orgasm; Romantic relationship; SARS-CoV-2 virus; Sexual functioning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26114,""

Analysis of current studies revealed that the prevalence of eye trauma decreased overall, with a trend of delayed medical treatment during the COVID-19 era. Irregular epidemic prevention and control measures, unprotected home activities, and unusual mental states are the main causes of ocular trauma. Strategies for reducing morbidity are also discussed, including popularizing the use norms of prevention and control supplies, taking heed to the safety of family activities, highlighting the special status of child protection, and paying attention to previous case data to implement region-specific precautions.

"Substantial Impact of COVID-19 on Self-Reported Mental Health of Healthcare Professionals in the Netherlands","Initially, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a continued pressure on professionals working in hospitals due to the increase of affected patients. At the moment, the pandemic continues but thanks to all kinds of measures (e.g., social distancing) workload seems to decrease at the hospitals. On the contrary, patients with long-lasting symptoms due to COVID-19 infection or the pandemic begin to merge at the mental healthcare institutions in the Netherlands but this also holds true for other countries. Furthermore, healthcare professionals are affected by safety measures such as working from home, which led to an increased feeling of stress and may have led to a misbalance in work and private life. As a result, the question whether healthcare employees in mental healthcare experience impaired mental health remains unclear and chances are fair that mental health problems such as exhaustion and burnout may be prevalent. This study describes an online survey in which mental health amongst mental healthcare professionals is investigated. About 1,300 professionals from a large number of mental healthcare institutions replied the survey. Around 50% of the respondents experienced increased levels of stress. Feelings of anxiety, anger, and sadness were also increasingly experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, 4.2% replied that they were considering resigning their jobs which is alarming considering the shortage of healthcare professionals in mental healthcare institutions. The results support the importance of treatment or support of professionals in mental healthcare that experience psychological ailments.","de Vroege, van den Broek","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.796591","20220127","COVID-19; SARS-Cov-2; healthcare professionals; mental health; pandemic; the Netherlands","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26116,""
"Facilitators and barriers to using telepresence robots in aged care settings: A scoping review","Social isolation has been a significant issue in aged care settings, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and is associated with adverse outcomes, including loneliness, depression, and cognitive decline. While robotic assistance may help mitigate social isolation, it would be helpful to know how to adopt technology in aged care. This scoping review aims to explore facilitators and barriers to the implementation of telepresence robots in aged care settings. Following the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology and the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews reporting guidelines, we searched relevant peer-reviewed studies through eight databases: CINAHL, MEDLINE, Cochrane, PsychINFO (EBSCO), Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. Google was used to search gray literature, including descriptive, evaluative, quantitative, and qualitative designs. Eligibility includes: studies with people aged 65Ã‚Â years and older who interacted with a telepresence robot in a care setting, and articles written in English. We conducted a thematic analysis to summarize the evidence based on the constructs in the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research. Of 1183 articles retrieved, 13 were included in the final review. The analysis yielded three themes: relative advantages, perceived risks and problems, and contextual considerations. The key facilitators to telepresence robot adoption are as follows: a feeling of physical presence, ease of use, mobility, and training. The barriers to implementation are as follows: cost, privacy issues, internet connectivity, and workflow. Future research should investigate the role of leadership support in implementation and practical strategies to overcome barriers to technology adoption in aged care settings.","Hung, Wong, Smith, Berndt, Gregorio, Horne, Jackson, Mann, Wada, Young","https://doi.org/10.1177/20556683211072385","20220127","Dementia; implementation; robots; technology; telepresence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26117,""
"Developmental Trend of Subjective Well-Being of Weibo Users During COVID-19: Online Text Analysis Based on Machine Learning Method","Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic experienced by the international community has increased the usage frequency of borderless, highly personalized social media platforms of all age groups. Analyzing and modeling texts sent through social media online can reveal the characteristics of the psychological dynamic state and living conditions of social media users during the pandemic more extensively and comprehensively. This study selects the Sina Weibo platform, which is highly popular in China and analyzes the subjective well-being (SWB) of Weibo users during the COVID-19 pandemic in combination with the machine learning classification algorithm. The study first invokes the SWB classification model to classify the SWB level of original texts released by 1,322 Weibo active users during the COVID-19 pandemic and then combines the latent growth curve model (LGCM) and the latent growth mixture model (LGMM) to investigate the developmental trend and heterogeneity characteristics of the SWB of Weibo users after the COVID-19 outbreak. The results present a downward trend and then an upward trend of the SWB of Weibo users during the pandemic as a whole. There was a significant correlation between the initial state and the development rate of the SWB after the COVID-19 outbreak (<i>r</i> = 0.36, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). LGMM results show that there were two heterogeneous classes of the SWB after the COVID-19 outbreak, and the development rate of the SWB of the two classes was significantly different. The larger class (normal growth group; <i>n</i> = 1,229, 93.7%) showed a slow growth, while the smaller class (high growth group; <i>n</i> = 93, 6.3%) showed a rapid growth. Furthermore, the slope means across the two classes were significantly different (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Therefore, the individuals with a higher growth rate of SWB exhibited stronger adaptability to the changes in their living environments. These results could help to formulate effective interventions on the mental health level of the public after the public health emergency outbreak.","Han, Pan, Li, Zhang, Zhang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.779594","20220127","coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); latent growth curve model (LGCM); latent growth mixture model (LGMM); online text analysis; subjective well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26118,""
"Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms and Quality of Life of COVID-19 Survivors at 6-Month Follow-Up: A Cross-Sectional Observational Study","<b>Background:</b> Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the most common psychiatric sequelae among novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of PTSD symptoms, PTSD-related factors, and its relationship with quality of life at long-term follow-up in hospitalized COVID-19 survivors. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was undertaken to evaluate the health consequences of hospitalized COVID-19 survivors. All participants were interviewed face-to-face through a series of questionnaires: a researcher-developed symptom questionnaire, the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item, and the 36-item Short Form. <b>Results:</b> A total of 574 participants were enrolled with an average age of 57 years. The median follow-up time post-discharge was 193.9 days (SD = 15.32). Among the participants, 77.9% of survivors presented with at least one symptom, where fatigue or muscle weakness (47.9%) was reported the most frequently, followed by chest distress (29.4%) and sleep difficulty (29.4%). The prevalence of PTSD was 11.15% [95% confidence interval (CI): 8.56, 13.73] with a cut-off score of 44. Factors such as respiratory symptoms [odds ratio (OR): 3.53; 95% CI: 1.68-7.42], anxiety (OR: 14.64; 95% CI: 7.09-30.21), and sleep difficulty (OR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.14-4.16) were positively related to PTSD. Those COVID-19 survivors with potential PTSD had significantly lower quality of life than those without (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study illustrated that a significant number of COVID-19 survivors were suffering from physical or mental distress to varying degrees at 6 months post-discharge. People with PTSD were more likely to experience persistent respiratory symptoms and sleep difficulty, as well as anxiety and a decreased quality of life. Such survivors require greater attention to their mental health, particularly the PTSD symptoms at the early phase, which may play an important role in the recovery of both the physical and psychological health of COVID-19 survivors.","Huang, Xu, Zhang, Zheng, Liu, Feng, Hu, Lin, Xi, Wang, Lin, Zhou, He, Weng, Deng, Ding, Guo, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.782478","20220127","COVID-19; clinical sequelae; post-traumatic stress disorder; quality of life (QoL); survivors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26119,""
"Mediation Effect of Self-Efficacy and Resilience on the Psychological Well-Being of Lebanese People During the Crises of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Beirut Explosion","<b>Introduction:</b> Self-efficacy signifies an individual's belief in their own ability to perform the actions required to achieve a particular performance. In this study, we used an online survey to assess the mediation effect of resilience and self-efficacy on the overall psychological well-being of Lebanese people during the crises of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Beirut explosion. <b>Methods:</b> Overall, 567 Lebanese people participated in an online survey between March 17-28, 2021. The survey included the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 items (SAVE-6), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2 items, WHO-5 Well-being Index, General Self-Efficacy scale, and a single item on insomnia. We also assessed their risk perception regarding exposure to COVID-19 or explosions. <b>Results:</b> About 53% of participants were assessed as having depression (PHQ-9 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10) in the recent crisis. About half of participants (53.2%) reported feeling more stressed by COVID-19 than by the Beirut explosion, and 23.4% felt more stressed by the Beirut explosion than by COVID-19. Only the SAVE-6 score differed significantly between groups with greater stress responses to COVID-19 and the Beirut explosion. Self-efficacy mediated the influence of depression on people's psychological well-being, and self-efficacy and resilience mediated the influence of viral anxiety on psychological well-being. <b>Conclusion:</b> Self-efficacy is important for reducing people's depression and improving their psychological well-being during the Lebanon crises and also mediates the influence of anxiety in response to the viral epidemic on their psychological well-being in some people.","Hong, Mreydem, Abou Ali, Saleh, Hammoudi, Lee, Ahn, Park, Hong, Suh, Chung","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.733578","20220127","COVID-19; anxiety; explosion; psychological; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26120,""
"Virtual Reality Fitness (VRF) for Behavior Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mediation Analysis Approach","During the COVID-19 pandemic, cellphone health apps and virtual reality fitness for treating neurological disorders such as Parkinson's were beneficial. Virtual reality has been used to treat PTSD, depression, anxieties, dementia, ADHD, dyslexia, and pain control in various settings. Virtual reality exercise has been studied for its effects on biological, mental, rehabilitation, behavior, and attitude management. This research aimed to find out the role of virtual reality fitness (VRF) for behavior management during the COVID-19 pandemic concerning the demographic characteristics of the study participants and the use of fitness and health apps. The population for the current study was Chinese residents across China who were in home isolation during the early pandemic in China. According to the study objective, a convenience sampling method was used to collect the primary data through an online survey. SPSS-25 statistical software was used to analyze the demographic information and clean and prepare the data to test all proposed hypotheses. The proposed research framework was examined using the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach through SmartPLS 3.0 software.

"Online Mental Health Survey for Addressing Psychosocial Condition During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia: Instrument Evaluation","Regular monitoring of the pandemic's psychosocial impact could be conducted among the community but is limited through online media. This study aims to evaluate the self-rating questionnaire commonly used for online monitoring of the psychosocial implications of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The data were taken from the online assessment results of two groups, with a total of 765 participants. The instruments studied were Self-Rating Questionnaire (SRQ-20), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale-10 (CESD-10), used in the online assessment. Data analysis used Rasch modeling and Winsteps applications. Validity and reliability were tested, and data were fit with the model, rating scale, and item fit analysis. All the scales for outfit mean square (MnSq) were very close to the ideal value of 1.0, and the Chi-square test was significant. Item reliability was greater than 0.67, item separation was greater than 3, and Cronbach's alpha was greater than 0.60; all the instruments were considered very good. The raw variance explained by measures for the SRQ-20, PTSD, and CESD-10 was 30.7%, 41.6%, and 47.6%, respectively. The unexplained eigenvalue variances in the first contrast were 2.3, 1.6, and 2.0 for the SRQ-20, PTSD, and CESD-10, respectively. All items had positive point-measure correlations. The internal consistency of all the instruments was reliable. Data were fit to the model as the items were productive for measurement and had a reasonable prediction. All the scales are functionally one-dimensional.","Sunjaya, Sumintono, Gunawan, Herawati, Hidayat","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S347386","20220127","instrument evaluation; online assessment; pandemic COVID-19; psychosocial","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26122,""
"The mental health crisis of expectant women in the UK: effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on prenatal mental health, antenatal attachment and social support","Pregnancy has been shown to be times in a woman's life particularly prone to mental health issues, however a substantial percentage of mothers report subclinical perinatal mental health symptoms that go undetected. Experiences of prenatal trauma, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may exacerbate vulnerability to negative health outcomes for pregnant women and their infants. We aimed to examine the role of: 1) anxiety, depression, and stress related to COVID-19 in predicting the quality of antenatal attachment; 2) perceived social support and COVID-19 appraisal in predicting maternal anxiety and depression. A sample of 150 UK expectant women were surveyed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Questions included demographics, pregnancy details, and COVID-19 appraisal. Validated measures were used to collect self-reported maternal antenatal attachment (MAAS), symptoms of anxiety (STAI), depression (BDI-II), and stress related to the psychological impact of COVID-19 (IES-r). We found that the pandemic has affected UK expectant mothers' mental health by increasing prevalence of depression (47%), anxiety (60%) and stress related to the psychological impact of COVID-19 (40%). Women for whom COVID-19 had a higher psychological impact were more likely to suffer from depressive (95% HDPI = [0.04, 0.39]) and anxiety symptoms (95% HPDI = [0.40, 0.69]). High depressive symptoms were associated with reduced attachment to the unborn baby (95% HPDI [-0.46, -0.1]). Whilst women who appraised the impact of COVID-19 to be more negative showed higher levels of anxiety (HPDI = [0.15, 0.46]), higher social support acted as a protective factor and was associated with lower anxiety (95% HPDI = [-0.52, -0.21]). The current findings demonstrate that direct experience of prenatal trauma, such as the one experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly amplifies mothers' vulnerability to mental health symptoms and impairs the formation of a positive relationship with their unborn baby. Health services should prioritise interventions strategies aimed at fostering support for pregnant women.","Filippetti, Clarke, Rigato","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04387-7","20220127","Antenatal attachment; Maternal mental health; Pregnancy; Prenatal trauma; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-28","",26123,""

"The Use of a Computerized Cognitive Assessment to Improve the Efficiency of Primary Care Referrals to Memory Services: Protocol for the Accelerating Dementia Pathway Technologies (ADePT) Study","Existing primary care cognitive assessment tools are crude or time-consuming screening instruments which can only detect cognitive impairment when it is well established. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, memory services have adapted to the new environment by moving to remote patient assessments to continue meeting service user demand. However, the remote use of cognitive assessments has been variable while there has been scant evaluation of the outcome of such a change in clinical practice. Emerging research in remote memory clinics has highlighted computerized cognitive tests, such as the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (ICA), as prominent candidates for adoption in clinical practice both during the pandemic and for post-COVID-19 implementation as part of health care innovation. The aim of the Accelerating Dementia Pathway Technologies (ADePT) study is to develop a real-world evidence basis to support the adoption of ICA as an inexpensive screening tool for the detection of cognitive impairment to improve the efficiency of the dementia care pathway. Patients who have been referred to a memory clinic by a general practitioner (GP) are recruited. Participants complete the ICA either at home or in the clinic along with medical history and usability questionnaires. The GP referral and ICA outcome are compared with the specialist diagnosis obtained at the memory clinic. The clinical outcomes as well as National Health Service reference costing data will be used to assess the potential health and economic benefits of the use of the ICA in the dementia diagnosis pathway. The ADePT study was funded in January 2020 by Innovate UK (Project Number 105837). As of September 2021, 86 participants have been recruited in the study, with 23 participants also completing a retest visit. Initially, the study was designed for in-person visits at the memory clinic; however, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was amended to allow remote as well as face-to-face visits. The study was also expanded from a single site to 4 sites in the United Kingdom. We expect results to be published by the second quarter of 2022. The ADePT study aims to improve the efficiency of the dementia care pathway at its very beginning and supports systems integration at the intersection between primary and secondary care. The introduction of a standardized, self-administered, digital assessment tool for the timely detection of neurodegeneration as part of a decision support system that can signpost accordingly can reduce unnecessary referrals, service backlog, and assessment variability.

"Short-sighted decision-making by those not vaccinated against COVID-19","Widespread vaccination is necessary to minimize or halt the effects of many infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Stagnating vaccine uptake can prolong pandemics, raising the question of how we might predict, prevent, and correct vaccine hesitancy and unwillingness. In a multinational sample (N=4,452) recruited from 13 countries that varied in pandemic severity and vaccine uptake (July 2021), we examined whether short-sighted decision-making as exemplified by steep delay discountingâ€”choosing smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed rewardsâ€”predicts COVID-19 vaccination status. Delay discounting was steeper in unvaccinated individuals and predicted vaccination status over and above demographics or mental health. The results suggest that delay discounting, a personal characteristic known to be modifiable through cognitive interventions, is a contributing cause of differences in vaccine compliance.","Julia G.
