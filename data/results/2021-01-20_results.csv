"Utilization of the Public Health Ordinance to prevent nosocomial spread in a case of acute measles-associated psychosis","Measles is a highly contagious disease. A 24 years old patient, recently exposed to measles (unvaccinated), presented in the emergency department with severe agitation, compatible with an acute psychotic episode, during the measles epidemic which spread in Israel in 2018-2019. Upon hospital admission, strict isolation was instructed, yet, without compliance, probably due to the patient's status. Measles diagnosis was promptly confirmed. As measles transmission was eminent, public health measures were employed through immediate implementation of the section 15 of the Public Health Ordinance, allowing for compulsory short-term isolation. The patient's condition improved within a few days and the measures were no longer necessary. This measles case occurred in the pre-Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic when use of a Public Health Ordinance was considered an extreme measure. This is in contrast to the current global use of Public Health laws to enforce strict quarantine and isolation on persons infected or potentially exposed to COVID-19. Nevertheless, minimizing infectious diseases transmission is a core function of public health law. Utilizing legal enforcement in circumstances of immediate public health hazard, such as nosocomial measles transmission, necessitates careful consideration. The integrative clinical and public health approach and prompt measures employed in this exceptional case, led to prevention of further infection spread.","Stein-Zamir, Chen; Abramson, Nitza; Sonnenfeld-Alroey, Hagit; Charnes, Jacob; Eckstein, Dana; Dienstag, Aryeh; Wolf, Dana; Moses, Allon E; Weiss, Yoram G","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13584-020-00435-9","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Isr J Health Policy Res;10(1): 2, 2021 Jan 15.; Publication details: Isr J Health Policy Res;10(1): 2, 2021 Jan 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-20","",9624,""

In this study we report the findings from a study with 155 cognitively healthy older adults who received established PaP versions, as well as our novel computerized measures of self-rated health, depression and anxiety, and cognition. Moderate to high correlations were observed between PaP and web- based measures of self-rated health (r = 0.77), depression and anxiety (r = 0.72), and preclinical Alzheimer's disease cognitive composite (PACC) (r = .61). Test-retest correlations were variable with high correlations for a measure of processing speed and a measure of delayed episodic memory.

"Suitability of Video Consultations During the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown: A Cross-Sectional Survey Among Norwegian GPs","The COVID-19 pandemic imposed an acute, sharp rise in the use of video consultations (VCs) by general practitioners (GPs) in Norway. This study aims to document GPs' experiences with the large-scale uptake of VCs in the natural experiment context of the pandemic. A nationwide, cross-sectional online survey was conducted amongst Norwegian GPs during the pandemic lockdown (April 14-May 3, 2020). Each respondent was asked to evaluate up to 10 VCs. Basic demographic characteristics of the GPs and their practices were collected. The associations between GPs' perceived suitability of the VCs, the nature of the patients' main problems, prior knowledge of the patients (relational continuity), and follow-up of previously presented problems (episodic continuity) were explored by descriptive statistics, diagrams, and Chi-square tests. 1,237 GPs (26% of the target group) responded to the survey. Amongst these, 1,000 GPs offered VCs, and 855 GPs evaluated a total of 3,484 VCs. Most GPs who offered VCs (81%) had no experience with VCs before the pandemic. 49% of the evaluated VCs were considered to have similar or even better suitability to assess the main reason for contact, compared to face-to-face consultations. In the presence of relational continuity, VCs were considered equal to or better than face-to-face consultations in 57% of cases, as opposed to 32% when the patient was unknown. The suitability rate for follow-up consultations (episodic continuity) was 61%, compared to 35% for new patient problems. Suitability varied considerably across clinical contact reasons. VCs were found most suitable for anxiety and life stress, depression, administrative purposes, as well as for longstanding or complex problems that normally require multiple follow-up consultations. The GPs estimate that they will conduct about 20% of their consultations by video in a future, non-pandemic setting. Our study of VCs performed in general practice during the pandemic lockdown indicates a clear, future role for VCs in future, non-pandemic settings. The strong and consistent association between continuity of care and GPs' perceptions of the suitability of VCs is a new and important finding with considerable relevance for future primary health care planning.","Johnsen, Norberg, Kristiansen, Zanaboni, Austad, Krogh, Getz","https://doi.org/10.2196/26433","20210119","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-20","",9638,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on disordered eating behavior: a qualitative analysis of social media users' responses to the global pandemic","Background: A growing body of evidence suggests a significant association between the COVID-19 pandemic and population mental health. Findings suggest that individuals with a lifetime history of disordered eating behavior may be negatively affected by COVID-19 related anxiety and prevention measures may disrupt daily functioning and limit access to treatment. Nevertheless, data describing the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on disordered eating behaviors are limited and most findings focus on individuals in treatment settings. Objectives: To characterize the experiences of global Reddit users posting in eating disorder (ED)-related discussion forums, describing the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on overall mental health and disordered eating behavior. Methods: Data were collected from popular subreddits acknowledging EDs as their primary discussion topic. Unique discussion posts dated from January 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020 that referenced the COVID-19 pandemic were extracted and evaluated using inductive, thematic data analysis. Results: Six primary themes were identified: change in ED symptoms, change in exercise routine, impact of quarantine on daily life, emotional well-being, help-seeking behavior, and associated risks and health outcomes. The majority of users reported that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health prevention measures negatively impacted their psychiatric health and contributed to increased disordered eating behaviors. Feelings of isolation, frustration, and anxiety were common. Many individuals used Reddit forums to share personal experiences, seek advice, and offer shared accountability. Conclusions: Reddit discussion forums have provided a therapeutic community for individuals to share experiences and provide support for peers with ED during a period of increased psychiatric distress. Future research is needed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on disordered eating behavior and to evaluate the role of social media discussion forums in mental health treatment, especially during periods of limited treatment access.","Nutley, Falise, Henderson, Apostolou, Mathews, Striley","https://doi.org/10.2196/26011","20210119","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-20","",9639,""

After viral nucleic acid testing and antibody testing, the plasma was infused into 16 severe or critical COVID-19 patients. Time for viral nucleic acid amplification (NAA) test turning negative, total volume of plasma transfusion, average antibody concentration, and total antibody amount were recorded. White blood cell (WBC) counts, lymphocyte (LYM) counts, neutrophil (NEU) counts, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), hypersensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), and lactic acid (Lac) levels were measured and the rate of change was calculated at the baseline (d0) before plasma transfusion, and day 1 (d1), day 3 (d3) after transfusion. (1) Patient characteristics: among the 16 patients, 5 cases (31.25%) were severe COVID-19, and 11 cases (68.75%) were critical COVID-19; 62.50% (10/16) of the patients had primary disease; the percentage of invasive ventilation and use of extracorporeal membrane pulmonary oxygenation (ECMO) in critical patients were 90.91% (10/11) and 45.46% (5/11) respectively. (2) Antibody concentration of convalescent plasma and time for NAA test turning negative: the convalescent plasma antibody concentration in this study was ranged from 10.93 kAU/L to 114.7 kAU/L, with an average value of (56.44Ã‚Â±39.40) kAU/L. NAA test was continuously positive before plasma transfusion in 10 patients, and the time for NAA test turning negative could be counted. Eight patients turned negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion. Severe patients showed a shorter time for NAA test turning negative than critical patients after transfusion [2 (2-3) vs. 5 (3-8), P = 0.036]. Two critical patients transfused plasma with lower antibody concentration remained a positive result of NAA test, and died on the 3rd and 6th day respectively. (3) Laboratory results: the change rates of WBC (0.81Ã‚Â±0.28 vs. 1.00) and NEU (0.75Ã‚Â±0.33 vs. 1.00) were significantly decreased at d1 after convalescent plasma treatment (both P &lt; 0.05), and the CRP level decreased to about 63% of that before transfusion (P = 0.017). No adverse events were observed during convalescent plasma transfusion. Viral NAA test of most patients with COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion turned negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion, and the turning time of severe patients was shorter than that of critical patients. Convalescent plasma therapy can reduce the patients' CRP level, and no adverse events were found during the treatment. The antibody concentration in the convalescent plasma may be one of the factors that affect the time for the nucleic acid turning negative after transfusion. Detection and screening convalescent plasma of high-titer antibody and early application to severe and critical patients are expected to improve the efficacy of convalescent plasma.","Chen, Lu, Li, Wang, Wang, Yang, Chen-Li, Li, Ma, Sang, Xu, Li, Zhang, Kang, Xing, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20200810-00568","20210119","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-20","",9642,""
"Psychometric properties of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) in Spanish older adults","The Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) assesses nine cognitive strategies used to cope with negative events. The aim of this study was to generate validity evidences of this instrument in an older Spanish population. The Spanish version of the CERQ (CERQ-S) and self-report scales, measuring psychological well-being, depression and resilience, were administered to 305 older adults aged 65-90 (70.0Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.7) residents in the Autonomous Community of Madrid, Spain. 150 participants completed the 6-month follow-up in April 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). Confirmatory factor analyses supported 9-strategy structure, with an improved fit 27-item version (CERQ-S-27).

"The Psychological Burden of COVID-19 Stigma: Evaluation of the Mental Health of Isolated Mild Condition COVID-19 Patients","The objective of this article is to assess the mental health issues of the mild condition coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients admitted to a community treatment center (CTC) in Korea. A total of 107 patients admitted to a CTC were included as the study population, and their mental health problems including depression (patient health questionnaire-9), anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder scale-7), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (PTSD checklist-5) and somatic symptoms (by patient health questionnaire-15) were evaluated every week during their stay. The stigma related to COVID-19 infection was evaluated with an adjusted version of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) stigma scale. During the first week of isolation, the prevalence of more-than-moderate depression was 24.3%, more-than-moderate anxiety was 14.9%, more-than-moderate somatic symptoms was 36.5% and possible PTSD was 5.6% of total population. For depression and anxiety, previous psychiatric history and stigma of COVID-19 infection were significant risk factors. For PTSD, previous psychiatric history and stigma of COVID-19 infection as well as total duration of isolation were found to be significant risk factors. Prevalence of depression, anxiety and possible PTSD remained similar across the four weeks of observations, though the prevalence of severe depression, increased after four weeks of stay. Somatic symptoms seemed to decrease during their stay. The results suggest that social mitigation of COVID-19 related stigma, as well as care of patients with pre-existing mental health problems are important mental health measures during this crisis period. It is also important that clinical guidelines and public health policies be well balanced over the protection of the public and those quarantined to minimize the negative psychosocial consequences from isolation of the patients.","Kang, Lee, Kim, Jung, Kim, Kim, Park, Lee, Cho, Sohn","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e33","20210119","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Isolation; Stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-20","",9644,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health in Spain: Positive and negative outcomes","Previous studies have shown that perinatal distress has a negative influence on pregnancy outcome and the physiological development of the baby. The aim of this study was to describe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal perinatal mental health in Spain. Seven hundred and twenty-four women (N=450 pregnancy, N=274 postpartum) were recruited online during the pandemic. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Satisfaction With Life Scale were administered. Variables related to sociodemographic information, the COVID-19 pandemic, and perinatal care were also assessed. The results showed that 58% of women reported depressive symptoms. Moreover, 51% of women reported anxiety symptoms. On the other hand, a regression analysis for life satisfaction showed that besides the perception about their own health, marital status or being a health practitioner were also significant predictors during pregnancy. However, perception about baby's health and sleep, perception about their own health, and marital status were significant predictors of life satisfaction during the postpartum stage. Women assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic reported high rates of psychological distress. These results highlight the need of clinical support during this period. Knowing the routes to both distress and well-being may help maternity services to effectively cope with the pandemic.","Chaves, Marchena, Palacios, Salgado, Duque","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2021.01.007","20210119","COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Perinatal; Women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-20","",9645,""
"Effects of previous exposure to psychotherapeutic strategies on depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has seen an increase in depression and anxiety among those with and without a history of mental illness. Commonly used forms of psychological therapy improve mental health by teaching psychotherapeutic strategies that assist people to better manage their symptoms and cope with life stressors. Minimal research to date has explored their application or value in managing mental health during significant broad-scale public health crises. To determine which psychotherapeutic strategies people who have previously received therapy use to manage their distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether the use and perceived helpfulness of these strategies has an effect on symptoms of depression and anxiety. Data (N = 857) was drawn from multiple waves of a representative longitudinal study of the effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of Australian adults, which includes measures of anxiety, depression and experiences with psychotherapy and psychotherapeutic strategies. Previous engagement in therapy with psychotherapeutic strategies had a protective effect on depressive but not anxiety symptoms. Common and helpful strategies used by respondents were exercise, mindfulness and breathing exercises. Using mindfulness and perceiving it to be helpful was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety symptoms. No other strategies were associated with improved mental health. Prior knowledge of psychotherapeutic strategies may play a role in managing mental health during unprecedented public health events such as a global pandemic. There may be value in promoting these techniques more widely in the community to manage general distress during such times.","Gulliver, Banfield, Batterham, Calear, Farrer, Dawel, McCallum, Murray, Morse","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.170","20210119","COVID-19; Psychotherapeutic; anxiety; depression; psychotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-20","",9646,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and perinatal health: a scoping review","The Covid-19 pandemic affects maternal health both directly and indirectly, and direct and indirect effects are intertwined. To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic in a rapid format behooving an emergent pandemic we conducted a scoping review. A scoping review was conducted to compile evidence on direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on maternal health and provide an overview of the most significant outcomes thus far. Working papers and news articles were considered appropriate evidence along with peer-reviewed publications in order to capture rapidly evolving updates. Literature in English published from January 1st to September 11 2020 was included if it pertained to the direct or indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical, mental, economic, or social health and wellbeing of pregnant people. Narrative descriptions were written about subject areas for which the authors found the most evidence. The search yielded 396 publications, of which 95 were included. Pregnant individuals were found to be at a heightened risk of more severe symptoms than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine, vertical, and breastmilk transmission were unlikely. Labor, delivery, and breastfeeding guidelines for COVID-19 positive patients varied. Severe increases in maternal mental health issues, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, were reported. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies implemented with little evidence. Women were more likely to lose their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. Pregnant women and mothers were not found to be at higher risk for COVID-19 infection than people who are not pregnant, however pregnant people with symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more adverse outcomes compared to non-pregnant people and seem to face disproportionate adverse socio-economic consequences. High income and low- and middle-income countries alike faced significant struggles. Further resources should be directed towards quality epidemiological studies. The Covid-19 pandemic impacts reproductive and perinatal health both directly through infection itself but also indirectly as a consequence of changes in health care, social policy, or social and economic circumstances. The direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 on maternal health are intertwined. To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic we conducted a scoping review. Pregnant women who have symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more severe outcomes than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine and breastmilk transmission, and the passage of the virus from mother to baby during delivery are unlikely. The guidelines for labor, delivery, and breastfeeding for COVID-19 positive patients vary, and this variability could create uncertainty and unnecessary harm. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies are implemented with little evidence in high and low/middle income countries. The social and economic impact of COVID-19 on maternal health is marked. A high frequency of maternal mental health problems, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, during the epidemic are reported in many countries. This likely reflects an increase in problems, but studies demonstrating a true change are lacking. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Women were more vulnerable to losing their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. We make several recommendations: more resources should be directed to epidemiological studies, health and social services for pregnant women and mothers should not be diminished, and more focus on maternal mental health during the epidemic is needed.","Kotlar, Gerson, Petrillo, Langer, Tiemeier","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-021-01070-6","20210119","COVID-19; Gender equity; Maternal health; Maternal-child transmission; Mental health; Newborn health; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-20","",9647,""
"Patient preferences for telehealth services in a large multispecialty practice","Telehealth service provision has accelerated during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As the pandemic continues, clinical practices have discovered ways to resume operations. Opportunities exist to understand patient preferences for telehealth clinical services and to tailor offerings to different demographic groups. We conducted a survey of patients receiving telehealth services through our outpatient practice to understand the types of healthcare services for which patients report preferences for telehealth. We received 551 survey responses (response rateÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20.8%; 551/2650). More than half of patients indicated being 'very likely' to use telehealth services to refill medication(s) (67.3%), prepare for an upcoming visit (66.1%), review test results (60.3%), or receive education (54.2%). Males had lower odds of preferring telehealth services for reviewing test results (odds ratio (OR)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34-0.94) or mental health issues (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.54; 95% CI: 0.38-0.77). Respondents who received a video visit were significantly more likely than those who received a telephone visit to report preferences for using telehealth for education, care plan discussions, long-term health issues, and mental health. Patient preferences for telehealth services vary by services provided and respondent demographics. Experience with telehealth increases the likelihood for future use of these services.","Ebbert, Ramar, Tulledge-Scheitel, Njeru, Rosedahl, Roellinger, Philpot","https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633X20980302","20210119","Telemedicine; patient preference; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-20","",9648,""

In this report we discuss a case of completed suicide of a 34-year old male who had confined himself to his home, after stocking up large amounts of food, drinking water and cleaning materials in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in our country using site investigation reports, medico-legal autopsy and psychological authopsy of the deceased. It was found out that the victim was following the internet and the television daily for news on the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. One week before the event, he had left his workplace telling his colleagues that he would confine himself to his home for 15-20 days to clean up the premises. Washed banknotes and blister tablets were found in the house as well as stocked water and cooked food. The deceased had twice consulted hospitals for fear of COVID-19 infection 2 days before his demise. It was discussed that he might have the diagnosis of &quot;mixed anxiety and depression&quot;. Evaluation of his experiences, discourses and behaviours within the span of 3-4 days before the act and the site investigation have suggested that he might have attempted suicide as a response to stress.","Toker UÃ„Å¸urlu, SeydaoÃ„Å¸ullarÃ„Â± BaltacÃ„Â±, AkÃƒÂ§a, Acar","https://www.google.com/search?q=[A+Case+of+Suicide+Related+with+COVID-19].","20210117","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-20","",9649,""

The objectives of the study are twofold: a) to examine dose-response relationships between physical activity (PA) components (volume, intensity, frequency, duration) and depressive symptoms of the population during confinement, and b) to identify the optimal levels of PA to mitigate notable depressive symptoms (NDS). 4,811 (2,952 women) Spanish citizens, age range 16-92 years, completed an online questionnaire (snowball sampling) to measure their levels of depressive symptoms, PA, and various anthropometric and sociometric variables. Volume (METs-min/week), frequency (days/week), and duration (hours) were examined using logistic regressions with restricted cubic splines. The PA components were inversely associated with NDS. Performing at least 477 METs-min/week was associated with a 33% decrease in probability of NDS, and reaching 3,000 METs-min/week was associated with the lowest risk of NDS (47%). As for frequency, with 10 times/week the probability of NDS was 56% lower. At 10 hours of weekly practice, the probability of NDS was 39% lower. A range and optimal amount of PA is suggested to reduce the appearance of SDN during confinement.","MÃƒÂ©ndez-GimÃƒÂ©nez, Cecchini, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-RÃƒÂ­o, Carriedo","https://doi.org/10.7334/psicothema2020.294","20210117","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-20","",9652,""

To evaluate the changes in musculoskeletal problems and psychosocial status of teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic due to online education and to investigate the effects of preventive telerehabilitation applications for musculoskeletal problems. Forty teachers who conducted online education during the pandemic volunteered to participate in the study. All assessments were performed via online methods. The Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire (CMDQ), ProFitMap-Neck questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI) were used to evaluate musculoskeletal problems; the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to evaluate anxiety and depression, respectively; and the Work-Life Balance Scale (WLBS) was used to evaluate how well individuals achieve this balance. Information about before online education, during online education, and after training was obtained with the assessments. After the first assessment, telerehabilitation, which involved presentations and brochures, was applied to 18 participants willing to participate in the training.

However, the impact on patients is unknown. To evaluate the psychological and economic impact of the cancellation of scheduled spinal operations. We identified 50 patients with cancelled surgeries between 16 March 2020 and 24 April 2020. Forty-nine (98%) participants were contacted, with whom the modified WES-Pi questionnaire was filled in during a telephone interview. Of the 49 respondents, 28 (57.2%) were aged &lt;65 years. The most often reported problem (85.7%) was an ongoing limitation in basic daily activities. At least moderate sadness was experienced by 65.3% and disappointment by 73.5% of the patients. More than 80% reported concerns about the continuation and 73.5% about the progression of their symptoms. Out of 27 employees (55.1%), 63% could not work due to severe pain or movement limitation (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001).

GMDR analysis showed that there was a two-factor interaction between working years and working shifts (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). No significant factors and interactions were found associated with mental symptoms. In conclusions,Ã‚Â about one-third of medical workers suffered from sleep and mental problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in the current study. Interventions for sleep and mental problems among medical workers were needed based on related factors.","Zheng, Wang, Feng, Ye, Zhang, Fan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41105-020-00304-7","20210119","COVID-19; Medical workers; Mental health; Sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-20","",9657,""
"COVID-19-related social support service closures and mental well-being in older adults and those affected by dementia: a UK longitudinal survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on delivery of social support services. This might be expected to particularly affect older adults and people living with dementia (PLWD), and to reduce their well-being. To explore how social support service use by older adults, carers and PLWD, and their mental well-being changed over the first 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months since the pandemic outbreak. Unpaid dementia carers, PLWD and older adults took part in a longitudinal online or telephone survey collected between April and May 2020, and at two subsequent timepoints 6 and 12 weeks after baseline. Participants were asked about their social support service usage in a typical week prior to the pandemic (at baseline), and in the past week at each of the three timepoints. They also completed measures of levels of depression, anxiety and mental well-being. 377 participants had complete data at all three timepoints. Social support service usage dropped shortly after lockdown measures were imposed at timepoint 1 (T1), to then increase again by T3. The access to paid care was least affected by COVID-19. Cases of anxiety dropped significantly across the study period, while cases of depression rose. Well-being increased significantly for older adults and PLWD from T1 to T3. Access to social support services has been significantly affected by the pandemic, which is starting to recover slowly. With mental well-being differently affected across groups, support needs to be put in place to maintain better well-being across those vulnerable groups during the ongoing pandemic.","Giebel, Pulford, Cooper, Lord, Shenton, Cannon, Shaw, Tetlow, Limbert, Callaghan, Whittington, Rogers, Komuravelli, Rajagopal, Eley, Downs, Reilly, Ward, Gaughan, Butchard, Beresford, Watkins, Bennett, Gabbay","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045889","20210118","COVID-19; dementia; mental health; old age psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-20","",9658,""
"Food for thought; the importance of Nutritional wellbeing during COVID-19","Individuals with mental illness have poorer physical health, nutritional status and lowered life expectancy. Optimising their physical and nutritional status has become an increasingly important therapeutic goal. Current experience with Covid-19 has further emphasised the susceptibility to physical illness and poorer outcomes among individuals with mental illness and those who are nutritionally compromised. Although life as we knew it has been suspended until the arrival of a vaccine, individuals can take immediate action to improve physical and mental health by attending to and optimising their nutritional wellbeing. Clinicians within mental health services have a crucial role to play in assisting such change, and reminding their patients of the importance of pursuing a healthy and balanced diet.","Burke-Furey, McNicholas","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2021.2","20210118","COVID-19; Micronutrients; Nutrition; microbiome; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-20","",9659,""
"Ensuring contact: calling rural Appalachian older adults during the COVID-19 epidemic","Older adults, especially those aged 85 years or older, remain at significantly higher risk for COVID-19. This group, along with those with pre-existing heart and lung disease and diabetes, have accounted for 80% of hospitalizations and an even higher percentage of COVID-19 related deaths in the USA. West Virginia, the only state in the USA located completely within Appalachia, has a higher percentage of elderly than all but two states in the nation. Rural seniors are hesitant to use hospital emergency departments and attend routine care visits for fear of exposure to the virus. Restricted cell phone and internet service may limit effective technological outreach to more isolated rural older adults. More information is needed to develop effective, safe, and acceptable approaches to care for rural, isolated older adults. Telephone interviews were conducted with 124 community-dwelling residents in four counties in rural Appalachia between 1 and 22 April 2020. Participants were aged 75 years or older. Descriptive statistics were calculated and Fisher's Exact Test was used to examine for associations among variables. Participants consisted of 86 (69.4%) women and 38 (30.6%) men with an average age of 82.5 years. Telephone contact was the preferred method of contact among all but four participants (96.8%). Seventeen calls (13.7%) resulted in some form of intervention, including arranging for emergent home repairs, treatment of severe hypertension, scheduling urgent laboratory testing, arranging for terminal care, treating acute conditions, and providing durable medical equipment. The 17 participants requiring intervention were significantly more likely to be aged 85 years or older (p=0.004), and report two or more chronic conditions (p&lt;0.001). Those describing themselves as 'lonely' were significantly more likely to live alone (p=0.009) and describe themselves as 'anxious' or 'depressed' (p&lt;0.001). A telephone call appears to be the most effective means of communication with patients in these rural Appalachian counties. Patients aged 85 years or older and those living alone should be given highest priority for regular outreach by healthcare providers. In this population, systematically calling rural elderly patients during the COVID-19 epidemic and its aftermath represents an effective strategy for providers who care for elderly rural patients.","Walker, Grome, Rollyson, Baus","https://doi.org/10.22605/RRH6122","20210118"," USA;  geriatrics;  patient assessment;  qualitative research; Appalachia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-20","",9660,""
