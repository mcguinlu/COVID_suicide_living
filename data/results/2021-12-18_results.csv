"The impact of shielding during the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health: Evidence from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, older and clinically vulnerable people were instructed to shield or stay at home to save lives. Policies restricting social contact and human interaction pose a risk to mental health, but we know very little about the impact of shielding and stay at home orders on the mental health of older people. Aims: Understand the extent to which shielding contributes to poorer mental health. Method: Exploiting longitudinal data from Wave 9 (2018/19) and two COVID-19 sub-studies (June/July 2020; November/December 2020) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing we use logistic and linear regression models to investigate associations between patterns of shielding during the pandemic and mental health, controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, pre-pandemic physical and mental health, and social isolation measures. Results: By December 2020, 70% of older people were still shielding or staying at home, with 5% shielding throughout the first 9 months of the pandemic. Respondents who shielded experienced worse mental health. Although prior characteristics and lack of social interactions explain some of this association, even controlling for all covariates, those shielding throughout had higher odds of reporting elevated depressive symptoms (OR=1.87, 95%CI=1.22;2.87) and reported lower quality of life (B=-1.28, 95%CI=-2.04;-0.52) than those who neither shielded nor stayed at home. Shielding was also associated with increased anxiety. Conclusions: Shielding itself seems associated with worse mental health among older people, highlighting the need for policymakers to address the mental health needs of those who shielded, both in emerging from the current pandemic and for the future.","Giorgio Di Gessa; Debora Price","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.12.16.21267914","20211217","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23958,""
"The K-12 Pandemic Budget and Staffing Crises Have Not Panned Out - Yet: Selected Findings from the Third American School District Panel Survey Data Note: Insights from the American Educator Panels Research Report RR-A956-3","This report presents school district leaders' views about staff turnover, hiring, and districts' financial outlooks at the end of the 2020-2021 school year. Based on the survey responses of 292 district leaders from the American School District Panel (ASDP), the authors found that teacher and principal turnover had not increased substantially beyond pre-pandemic rates in most districts. They also found that a majority of school districts have increased or are trying to increase their number of staff--especially for substitute teachers and mental health staff--for the 2021-2022 school year. District leaders also reported budget concerns. Four in ten district leaders anticipate a fiscal cliff around the time coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) federal aid expires in September 2024, and over half of the districts that anticipate a funding increase from federal stimulus funds are concerned about their ability to spend the money, even though virtually all district leaders said that they have some level of discretion in how to spend those funds. Although districts' reported impacts have not led to much-feared budget and staffing crises for their school districts, these survey findings suggest systemic problems that could outlast the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Assessment of severity of stress among medical and dental students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has a major bearing on mental health. This study was aimed to study the level of stress among the medical and dental students amidst this crisis. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to students pursuing medical and dental undergraduate and postgraduate degrees across India. It included sociodemographics, psychological status, academic activities, online classes, information about COVID-19, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Results: The overall response rate was 86%. 9.8% of students had low, 74.4% had moderate, and 15.8% had high stress according to PSS. The major worry was uncertain future (41.8%);academic inadequacies/delays (27.78%), apprehension of self-health (26.78%), and family's health (21.13%). 52.7% of participants experienced a lack of motivation;74% were frustrated/irritable and 46.3% experienced loneliness. Their access to information about COVID-19 was from family and friends (71.42%);news (64.48%), social media sites (62.79%), Internet (36.87%), and newspapers (34.71%). Females were more stressed (P value = 0.000) with ages 21â€“25 years (P value = 0.000). The students who were motivated, frustrated/irritable, or lonely had high stress (P value &lt;0.01). The students with no exercise had high stress (P value &lt;0.01), however, the duration of exercise was not statistically significant. 58% were not satisfied with the online classes (P value &lt;0.01). Interpretation and Conclusions: Our study showed that more than three-fourths of medical and dental students were under moderate to high-level stress. Multiple factors for the stress were identified. Exercise was a stress buster, which should be encouraged for good mental health. In view of the uncertain future identified as the major worry, it is prudent for health educators to change the curriculum to keep pace with the existing competency of training.","Menon, Bindu, Sannapareddy, Subram, Menon, Medha","https://doi.org/10.4103/aian.AIAN_19_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology; 24(5):703-707, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23961,""
"Gender inequality in the global mental health research workforce: a research authorship scoping review and qualitative study in Nepal","IntroductionAlthough womenâ€™s health is prioritised in global research, few studies have identified structural barriers and strategies to promote female leadership and gender equality in the global health research workforce, especially in low-income and middle-income countries.MethodsWe conducted a mixed-methods study to evaluate gender equality in the mental health research workforce in Nepal. The scoping review assessed gender disparities in authorship of journal publications for Nepal mental health research, using databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, NepJol, NepMed) for 5 years. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 22 Nepali researchers to identify structural barriers limiting womenâ€™s leadership.ResultsOf 337 articles identified, 61% were by Nepali first authors. Among Nepali first authors, 38.3% were women. Nepali women had half the odds of being first authors compared with men, when referenced against non-Nepali authors (OR 0.50, 95% CI 1.30 to 3.16). When limiting publications to those based on funded research, the odds were worse for first authorship among Nepali women (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.71). The qualitative analysis supported the scoping review and identified a lack of gender-friendly organisational policies, difficulties in communication and mobility, and limited opportunities for networking as barriers to womenâ€™s leadership in global health research.ConclusionEfforts are needed for greater representation of Nepali women in global mental health research, which will require transformative organisational policies to foster female leadership. Those in leadership need to recognise gender inequalities and take necessary steps to address them. Funding agencies should prioritise supporting organisations with gender equality task forces, policies and indicators.","Gurung, Dristy, Sangraula, Manaswi, Prasansa, Subba, Poudyal, Anubhuti, Mishra, Shelly, Kohrt, Brandon A.","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-006146","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Global Health; 6(12), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23962,""
"Protecting the mental health of groups needing NHS care this winter","The sudden return to coronavirus restrictions to protect the UK from the latest â€œheavily mutatedâ€ covid-19 variant will only add to the trepidation that many have been feeling in the lead-up to winter.1 As the medical community continues to call for more action from the government and the NHS buckles under unsustainable demand, the public waits for signs that the winter will bring a return to familiar stay-at-home orders and sudden changes to Christmas plans.2 There has been enough research during the pandemic for us to know that mental health will be important to protect in the coming months. Many felt extremely vulnerable and were particularly worried about catching covid-19 and their increased risk of death.7 At the same time, many were concerned that without having any physical assessments, their clinicians would miss important health signs.8 Others were anxious that being locked down at home would exacerbate their health problems.9 The mental health impact of these uncertainties surrounding covid-19 were particularly strong for this group, and continuity of care, not just for their long term illnesses but for managing the impact of disrupted treatment on their mental health, will be extremely important. [...]women who were pregnant during the pandemic faced considerable disruptions to their care.","Burton, Alexandra, Bradbury, Alexandra","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n3063","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ : British Medical Journal (Online); 375, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23963,""

"Planning Just Futures","In 2020, without much thinking I said â€˜yesâ€™ to working on anÂ InterfaceÂ about planning just futures. Futures planning is at least, to some degree, a hopeful activity, and I had agreed, implicitly, to find other people who think a lot about futures and planning during a less than inspirational time. An enduring pandemic had swept across the world, most acutely affecting poor people and people of color. At the same time, in the United States, some of the largest civil uprisings in recent history, protesting police violence against Black people, were taking place. Writing about futures and optimism for change has felt absurd at times in the malaise of COVID-19, protest, and politics. I found myself talking with contributors about what it means to talk about hope in the face of such sadness and loss, to still know that we must push towards the just future. I encouraged authors, and myself, to reject the idea of producing falsely optimistic pieces, but to share visions of hope, ideas for paths forward, and reflections on now. As a less optimistic person, I appreciated what other contributors shared, and how our different ways of thinking might assemble some type of guide for those planning scholars and practitioners looking for the â€“ what happens now? In the writings, you will not find rose-colored glasses. You will also not find recommendations to stop doing the work of reaching just futures. Instead we make suggestions, offer insights, and ask questions about what it means to engage in our futures at this moment in time. Each essay offers its unique contribution, with several themes emerging across them. I want to highlight the ones that have kept me thinking, and hoping for planning scholarship and practice.","","https://doi.org/10.1080/14649357.2021.1956815","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Planning Theory & Practice; 22(4):613-642, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23965,""

Several literature databases were systemically searched for meta-analyses published by 22 September 2021 on the prevalence rates of mental health symptoms worldwide. The prevalence rates of mental health symptoms were summarized based on 388 empirical studies with a total of 1,067,021 participants from six regions and four countries. Comparatively, Africa and South Asia had the worse overall mental health symptoms, followed by Latin America. The research effort on mental health during COVID-19 has been highly skewed in terms of the scope of countries and mental health outcomes.

"Summit on actions required to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and service delivery systems in the WHO European Region: Athens, Hellenic Republic, 22â€“23 July 2021","Mental health is a priority of WHOâ€™s European Programme of Work, 2020â€“2025 (EPW). The EPWâ€™s Mental Health Coalition flagship initiative focuses on transforming attitudes around mental health, expediting mental health reforms and accelerating progress towards universal health coverage for people with mental health conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the critical importance of mental health and elevated it to the global discussion forum. In light of this, it was considered timely to hold an international meeting that will generate clear proposals and garner high-level political commitment to place mental health policy implementation at the heart of the economic and social recovery process, taking stock of the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and building on the shared experience of years of mental health reform. This report provides summaries of the presentations and discussions at the meeting, and includes the Athens Mental Health Summit Declaration.","World Health Organization.

"Mental Health and Quality of Life for Healthcare Workers in a University Hospital Under COVID-19","The aim of this study was to assess the psychosocial characteristics of the employees working at a university hospital and investigated the factors affecting their quality of life (QOL) under COVID-19. This study enrolled 1,191 healthcare workers from a university hospital, including doctors, nurses, administrative officer and technicians. Besides demographic information, depression, anxiety, somatization, insomnia, resilience, and QOL were assessed. The nurses presented significantly higher scores for anxiety, depression and showed significantly higher insomnia scores and significantly lower resilience scores. The occupations showed significant differences in the QOL and sub-groups, including the overall quality of life and general health (F=4.774, p&lt;0.001), psychological domain (F=6.230, p&lt;0.001), and environment domain (F=5.254, p&lt;0.001). There was a positive correlation between the QOL and resilience (r=0.608, p&lt;0.01). However, depression (r=-0.502, p&lt;0.01), anxiety (r=-0.425, p&lt;0.01), somatization (r=-0.364, p&lt;0.01), and insomnia (r=-0.385, p&lt;0.01) showed negative correlations with the QOL. Resilience was the most important factor influencing the QOL. The results of this study showed that low resilience adversely affected the QOL and the mental health of the healthcare workers, which consequently had a direct effect on the quality of medical care given to patients.","Choi, Yang, Lee, Lee, Jang","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2021.0307","20211216","COVID-19; Health care workers; Mental health; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23970,""

"Mental Health Outcomes Among Parents of Children With a Chronic Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Parental Burn-Out","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated quarantine measures highly impacted parental psychological well-being. Parents of children with chronic diseases might be specifically vulnerable as they already face multiple challenges to provide adequate care for their child. The research questions of the current study were twofold: (a) to examine whether parents of children with a chronic disease experienced more anxiety and depression compared to parents of healthy children and (b) to examine a series of risk factors for worsened well-being (i.e., depression, anxiety, and sleep problems), such as sociodemographic variables, COVID-19-specific variables (i.e., financial worries, living space, and perceived quality of health care), and parental psychological experiences (i.e., parental burn-out and less positive parenting experiences). Parents of children with a chronic disease (i.e., the clinical sample; NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°599 and 507 for Research Questions 1 and 2, respectively) and parents of healthy children (i.e., the reference sample: NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°417) filled out an online survey. Findings demonstrated that the parents in the clinical sample reported higher levels of anxiety than parents in the reference sample. Analyses within the clinical sample indicated that COVID-19-specific stressors and parental psychological experiences were associated with higher levels of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems. Mediation analyses furthermore indicated that the association of COVID-19-specific stressors with all outcome measures was mediated by parental burn-out. Parents of children with a chronic disease constitute a vulnerable group for worse well-being during the current pandemic. Findings suggest interventions directly targeting parental burn-out are warranted.","Wauters, Vervoort, Dhondt, Soenens, Vansteenkiste, MorbÃƒÂ©e, Waterschoot, Haerynck, Vandekerckhove, Verhelst, Van Aken, Raes, Schelstraete, Walle, Van Hoecke","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab129","20211216","COVID-19; children with a chronic disease; parental burn-out; parental well-being; parents; positive parenting experiences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23972,""
"Associations between changes in loneliness and social connections, and mental health during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Women's Health Initiative","Older women have faced significant disruptions in social connections during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Whether loneliness increased, or whether a change in loneliness from pre- to intra-pandemic period was associated with mental health during the pandemic is unknown. Older women (n=27,479; mean age 83.2 [SD: 5.4] years) completed surveys in mid-2020, including questions about loneliness, living arrangements, changes in social connections, and mental health. Loneliness was also previously assessed in 2014-2016. We examined whether loneliness changed from the pre- to intra-pandemic period and explored factors associated with this change. In multivariable models, we investigated the association of changes in loneliness and social connections with mental health. Loneliness increased from pre- to intra-pandemic levels. Factors associated with worsening loneliness included older age, experiencing stressful life events, bereavement, histories of vascular disease and depression, and social connection disruptions. Factors associated with a decrease in loneliness included identifying as Black, engaging in more frequent physical activity, being optimistic, and having a higher purpose in life. A 3-point increase in loneliness scores was associated with higher perceived stress, higher depressive, and higher anxiety symptoms. Social connection disruptions showed modest or no associations with mental health. Loneliness increased during the pandemic in older women and was associated with higher stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms. Our findings point to opportunities for interventions targeting lifestyle behaviors, well-being, disrupted social connections, and paying closer attention to those with specific medical and mental health histories that may reduce loneliness and improve mental health.","Goveas, Ray, Woods, Manson, Kroenke, Michael, Shadyab, Meliker, Chen, Johnson, Mouton, Saquib, Weitlauf, Wactawski-Wende, Naughton, Shumaker, Anderson","https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glab371","20211216","Loneliness; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; depression; social connection; stress; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23973,""
"Pediatric chronic pain in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic: Lived experiences of youth and parents","During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic youth with chronic pain have experienced additional barriers to accessing treatment and managing their pain. This study explored the experiences of youth with chronic pain and their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 youth with chronic pain (aged 13-20 years) and one of their parents, recruited from a tertiary level pediatric chronic pain program. Interviews occurred between the months of June-August 2020 and enabled participants to describe their experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic according to their own unique perspectives. Transcripts were analysed using inductive reflexive thematic analysis. Four themes were generated and labelled: 'temporality, mental health, and pain', 'coping with pain during a global pandemic', 'impact on care', and 're-appraisal in the context of development and pandemic life'. Across these themes, youth and parents described their unique challenges of living with pain as they adapted to changing circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, youth experienced increased difficulties managing their mental health and pain, which were intricately connected and related to social isolation, temporality, and uncertainty exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacted youth's access to care and their abilities to engage in coping strategies to manage their pain. The COVID-19 pandemic was also perceived to have interrupted youth's development and growing autonomy, prompting youth to re-appraise their current circumstances and imagined futures. Perspective: This manuscript provides an in-depth understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth with chronic pain and their parents. Youth and their parents perceived the COVID-19 pandemic to have impacted youth's mental health, pain, socio-emotional development, and access to care.","Neville, Lund, Soltani, Jordan, Stinson, Killackey, Birnie, Noel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpain.2021.11.012","20211216","COVID-19; Children; Pain; Parents; Pediatric","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23974,""
"SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit induces neuroinflammatory, microglial and behavioral sickness responses: evidence of PAMP-like properties","SARS-CoV-2 infection produces neuroinflammation as well as neurological, cognitive (i.e., brain fog), and neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety), which can persist for an extended period (6 months) after resolution of the infection. The neuroimmune mechanism(s) that produces SARS-CoV-2-induced neuroinflammation has not been characterized. Proposed mechanisms include peripheral cytokine signaling to the brain and/or direct viral infection of the CNS. Here, we explore the novel hypothesis that a structural protein (S1) derived from SARS-CoV-2 functions as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) to induce neuroinflammatory processes independent of viral infection. Prior evidence suggests that the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is inflammatory in vitro and signals through the pattern recognition receptor TLR4. Therefore, we examined whether the S1 subunit is sufficient to drive 1) a behavioral sickness response, 2) a neuroinflammatory response, 3) direct activation of microglia in vitro, and 4) activation of transgenic human TLR2 and TLR4 HEK293 cells. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intra-cisterna magna (ICM) with vehicle or S1. In-cage behavioral monitoring (8h post-ICM) demonstrated that S1 reduced several behaviors, including total activity, self-grooming, and wall-rearing. S1 also increased social avoidance in the juvenile social exploration test (24h post-ICM). S1 increased and/or modulated neuroimmune gene expression (Iba1, Cd11b, MhcIIÃŽÂ±, Cd200r1, Gfap, Tlr2, Tlr4, Nlrp3, Il1b, Hmgb1) and protein levels (IFNÃŽÂ³, IL-1ÃŽÂ², TNF, CXCL1, IL-2, IL-10), which varied across brain regions (hypothalamus, hippocampus, and frontal cortex) and time (24h and 7d) post-S1 treatment. Direct exposure of microglia to S1 resulted in increased gene expression (Il1b, Il6, Tnf, Nlrp3) and protein levels (IL-1ÃŽÂ², IL-6, TNF, CXCL1, IL-10). S1 also activated TLR2 and TLR4 receptor signaling in HEK293 transgenic cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that structural proteins derived from SARS-CoV-2 might function independently as PAMPs to induce neuroinflammatory processes via pattern recognition receptor engagement.","Frank, Nguyen, Ball, Hopkins, Kelley, Baratta, Fleshner, Maier","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2021.12.007","20211216","Microglia; Neuroinflammation; PAMP; S1 subunit; SARS-CoV-2; Sickness behavior; Spike protein; TLR","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23975,""
"A data-driven approach for examining the demand for relaxation games on Steam during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major source of stress for a majority of people that might have negative long-term effects on mental health and well-being. In recent years, video games and their potential positive effects on stress relief have been researched and ""relaxation"" has been an important keyword in marketing a certain kind of video game. In a quasi-experimental design, this study investigated the increase of average daily player peak (ADPPs) for the COVID period compared to the pre-COVID period and if this increase was significantly larger for relaxing games in contrast to non-relaxing games. Results showed a medium-sized increase of ADPPs over all types of games but no difference between relaxing games and non-relaxing games. These results are discussed in regards to their potential of presenting gaps between the current theoretical models of the influence of video games on mental health and actual observed player behaviour.","Croissant, Frister","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261328","20211216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23976,""
"Studying how state health services delivery policies can mitigate the effects of disasters on drug addiction treatment and overdose: Protocol for a mixed-methods study","The United States is experiencing a drug addiction and overdose crisis, made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic. Relative to other types of health services, addiction treatment and overdose prevention services are particularly vulnerable to disaster-related disruptions for multiple reasons including fragmentation from the general medical system and stigma, which may lead decisionmakers and providers to de-prioritize these services during disasters. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. states implemented multiple policies designed to mitigate disruptions to addiction treatment and overdose prevention services, for example policies expanding access to addiction treatment delivered via telehealth and policies designed to support continuity of naloxone distribution programs. There is limited evidence on the effects of these policies on addiction treatment and overdose. This evidence is needed to inform state policy design in future disasters, as well as to inform decisions regarding whether to sustain these policies post-pandemic. The overall study uses a concurrent-embedded design. Aims 1-2 use difference-in-differences analyses of large-scale observational databases to examine how state policies designed to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health services delivery influenced addiction treatment delivery and overdose during the pandemic. Aim 3 uses a qualitative embedded multiple case study approach, in which we characterize local implementation of the state policies of interest; most public health disaster policies are enacted at the state level but implemented at the local level by healthcare systems and local public health authorities. Triangulation of results across methods will yield robust understanding of whether and how state disaster-response policies influenced drug addiction treatment and overdose during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results will inform policy enactment and implementation in future public health disasters. Results will also inform decisions about whether to sustain COVID-19 pandemic-related changes to policies governing delivery addiction and overdose prevention services long-term.","Eisenberg, McCourt, Stuart, Rutkow, Tormohlen, Fingerhood, Quintero, White, McGinty","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261115","20211216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23977,""
"Prior COVID-19 Infection, Mental Health, Food and Financial Insecurity, and Association With COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage and Intent Among College-Aged Young Adults, US, 2021","More than 700,000 COVID-19 cases have been linked to American colleges and universities since the beginning of the pandemic. However, studies are limited on the effects of the pandemic on college-aged young adults and its association with their COVID-19 vaccination status and intent. Using the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey (HPS), a large, nationally representative survey fielded from April 14 through May 24, 2021, we assessed the effects of the pandemic (COVID-19 infection, mental health, food and financial security) on COVID-19 vaccination coverage (Ã¢â€°Â¥1 dose) and intentions toward vaccination among college-aged young adults in the United States (N = 6,758). We examined factors associated with vaccination coverage and intent, and reasons for not getting vaccinated. Approximately one-fifth (19.6%) of college-aged young adults had a previous diagnosis of COVID-19, 43.5% and 39.1% reported having anxiety or depression, respectively, 10.9% reported that they sometimes or often did not have enough food to eat, and 22.6% and 12.3% found it somewhat or very difficult, respectively, to pay for household expenses. Of college-aged young adults, 63.1% had received at least 1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, 15.4% probably would be vaccinated or were unsure about getting the vaccine, and 14.0% probably will not or definitely will not get vaccinated. Adults who were non-Hispanic Black (vs non-Hispanic White) or had food or financial insecurities (vs did not) were less likely to be vaccinated or intend to be vaccinated. Among adults who probably will not or definitely will not be vaccinated, more than one-third said that they did not believe a vaccine was needed. Ensuring high and equitable vaccination coverage among college-aged young adults is critical for safely reopening in-person learning and resuming prepandemic activities.","Nguyen, Irvine, Epstein, Allen, Corlin","https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd18.210260","20211216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23978,""
"An epidemic and a pandemic collide: Assessing the feasibility of tobacco treatment among vulnerable groups at COVID-19 protective lodging","Individuals experiencing homelessness have elevated smoking rates in addition to chronic and acute physical and mental health conditions, which may increase chances for complications associated with COVID-19 recovery. Unfortunately, there is underuse of tobacco cessation services in many agencies (e.g., substance use treatment centers, mental health treatment centers) providing care to these individuals. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the feasibility of providing tobacco cessation treatment alongside local COVID-19 emergency response efforts. <i>Taking Texas Tobacco Free</i> (TTTF) partnered with relevant emergency response teams at 5 isolation centers (repurposed hotels) in Austin, Texas, to address tobacco use among presumed or confirmed COVID-19 positive individuals who had nowhere else to seek care and shelter. TTTF trained staff on tobacco cessation treatment; specifically, the 5A's and use of nicotine replacement therapy. Over 5 months in 2020; 170 of 379 (44.9%) isolation center residents were reached and assessed for cigarette or vape use. Smoking/vaping prevalence was 70.6%, and 41.7% of tobacco users accepted cessation treatment. Results suggest the feasibility and potential acceptability of providing tobacco treatment services in similar care settings during local emergency response efforts, including but potentially not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, this initiates a call to action for health care providers to deliver tobacco use cessation services for typically hard-to-reach groups (e.g., individuals/families experiencing homelessness) who may have increased contact with service agencies and health providers during times of crisis. Limitations and suggestions for future implementation are also provided.

"Latent class analysis of COVID-19 experiences, social distancing, and mental health","Information is needed on the relationship between coronavirus disease (COVID-19) social distancing restrictions and their relationship with mental health. In particular, there is limited investigation into how COVID-related adversities have positively mobilized individuals. We use latent class analysis (LCA) to identify subtypes of positive and negative aspects of the experience of COVID-19 social distancing and the association of these subtypes with mental health. We conduct an online survey of COVID-19 and mental health with 3,183 adults residing in Quebec, Canada, during the first wave of the epidemic. We use LCA to identify subtypes of positive and negative aspects of social distancing. We use logistic and linear regression to estimate the associations between class membership and self-reported impact of COVID-19 on mental health and scores on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-10 (HSCL-10). We identify five classes of individuals in regards to perceived positives and negatives of social distancing related to COVID-19, named Low Impact, Freedom/Flexibility, Safety, Family/Home, and Hardships. Sociodemographic variables including age, gender, race/ethnicity, and self-reported mental health prior to COVID are associated with class assignment. Latent classes are associated with both outcomes (<i>p</i> &lt; .001).

"[Depression, anxiety and stress in primary health care users during coronavirus lockdown]","Social distancing and lockdown imposed by the world governments as a result of the coronavirus pandemic declaration has resulted in a perfect scenario to the appearance of mental disorders. To identify the levels of anxiety, depression and stress (emotional affective state) that people assigned to a primary health care clinic present during the lockdown. The DASS-21 questionnaire was administered to 150 pacients at the principal entry door of a family medicine unit of the Mexican Institute for Social Security, located in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, between April and May 2020. In addition, the internal validity test of the questionnaire was estimated using Cronbach's alpha, and also an association analysis was estimated using Pearson's chi squared test. The internal validity analysis indicated that the questionnaire is acceptable in its general version: Cronbach's alpha = 0.907. However, at the subscales level it is barely acceptable. The results indicated that 42% of the sample present some type of mental disorder, with anxiety being the most persistent. In addition, the estimated levels vary according to sex, educational level and nutritional status. During periods of lockdown, mental problems tend to arise and get worse, which is why it is necessary to implement emotional support programs, especially for working women with obesity weight problems, because they are the most vulnerable group in the face of this situation. el distanciamiento social y el confinamiento impuesto por los gobiernos mundiales a raÃƒÂ­z de la declaratoria de pandemia por coronavirus ha resultado un escenario propicio para la apariciÃƒÂ³n de transtornos mentales. identificar los niveles de ansiedad, depresiÃƒÂ³n y estrÃƒÂ©s (estado afectivo emocional) que presentan las personas adscritas a una clÃƒÂ­nica de atenciÃƒÂ³n primaria durante el confinamiento. se aplicÃƒÂ³ el cuestionario DASS-21 a un total de 150 personas encuestadas en la entrada de una unidad de medicina familiar del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, ubicada en Reynosa, Tamaulipas, entre abril y mayo de 2020.

"Media use, positive and negative emotions, and stress levels of adults during COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey: A cross-sectional study","This study was conducted to determine media use, positive and negative emotions, and stress levels of adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using media tools in the pandemic process has impacted the mental health of individuals. As the COVID-19 outbreak is a new disease fear, anxiety and stress about this situation can cause strong emotions in adults. The research was carried out using a cross-sectional design. The sample consisted of 1541 adults. The Positive and Negative Emotion Scale, and the Perceived Stress Scale were used to collect the data. The Positive Emotion Scale mean scores were lower (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) for those people whose daily media use time was more than 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°h and who followed the developments about COVID-19 through the media once a day. It was found that those with daily media use of more than 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°h/day had higher Perceived Stress Scale scores than those with lower use (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). This study concluded that the use of media in adults increased during the COVID-19 outbreak and that media use was associated with positive and negative emotions and stress levels. Health professionals should assess the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health in various community groups and develop interventions to prevent negative consequences of increased media use.","Akca, Ayaz-Alkaya","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijn.13035","20211216","COVID-19; emotion; media; mental health; nursing; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23983,""
"Estimation of the Timing and Intensity of Reemergence of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Following the COVID-19 Pandemic in the US","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of hospitalizations in young children. RSV largely disappeared in 2020 owing to precautions taken because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Estimating the timing and intensity of the reemergence of RSV and the age groups affected is crucial for planning for the administration of prophylactic antibodies and anticipating hospital capacity. To examine the association of different factors, including mitigation strategies, duration of maternal-derived immunity, and importation of external infections, with the dynamics of reemergent RSV epidemics. This simulation modeling study used mathematical models to reproduce the annual epidemics of RSV before the COVID-19 pandemic in New York and California. These models were modified to project the trajectory of RSV epidemics from 2020 to 2025 under different scenarios with varying stringency of mitigation measures for SARS-CoV-2. Simulations also evaluated factors likely to affect the reemergence of RSV epidemics, including introduction of the virus from out-of-state sources and decreased transplacentally acquired immunity in infants. Models using parameters fitted to similar inpatient data sets from Colorado and Florida were used to illustrate these associations in populations with biennial RSV epidemics and year-round RSV circulation, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed from February to October 2021. The primary outcome of this study was defined as the estimated number of RSV hospitalizations each month in the entire population. Secondary outcomes included the age distribution of hospitalizations among children less than 5 years of age, incidence of any RSV infection, and incidence of RSV lower respiratory tract infection. Among a simulated population of 19.45 million people, virus introduction from external sources was associated with the emergence of the spring and summer epidemic in 2021. There was a tradeoff between the intensity of the spring and summer epidemic in 2021 and the intensity of the epidemic in the subsequent winter. Among children 1 year of age, the estimated incidence of RSV hospitalizations was 707 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 children per year in the 2021 and 2022 RSV season, compared with 355 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 children per year in a typical RSV season. This simulation modeling study found that virus introduction from external sources was associated with the spring and summer epidemics in 2021. These findings suggest that pediatric departments should be alert to large RSV outbreaks in the coming seasons, the intensity of which could depend on the size of the spring and summer epidemic in that location. Enhanced surveillance is recommended for both prophylaxis administration and hospital capacity management.","Zheng, Pitzer, Shapiro, Bont, Weinberger","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.41779","20211217","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23984,""
"Prevalence and risk factors of musculoskeletal pain symptoms as long-term post-COVID sequelae in hospitalized COVID-19 survivors: a multicenter study","This study investigated the prevalence of long-term musculoskeletal post-COVID pain and their risk factors in a large cohort of COVID-19 survivors. A multicenter cohort study including patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 in five hospitals of Madrid (Spain) during the first wave of the pandemic was conducted. Hospitalisation and clinical data were collected from medical records. Patients were scheduled for a telephone interview after hospital discharge for collecting data about the musculoskeletal post-COVID pain. Anxiety/depressive levels and sleep quality were likewise assessed. From 2,000 patients recruited, a total of 1,969 (46.4% women, age: 61, SD: 16 years) were assessed on average at 8.4 (SD 1.5) months after discharge. At the time of the study, 887 (45% women) reported musculoskeletal post-COVID pain. According to the presence of previous pain symptoms, the prevalence of ""de novo"" (new-onset) musculoskeletal post-COVID pain was 74.9%, whereas 25.1% experienced an increase of previous symptoms (exacerbated COVID-related pain). Female gender (OR1.349, 95%CI 1.059-1.720), previous history of musculoskeletal pain (OR1.553, 95%CI 1.271-1.898), the presence of myalgia (OR1.546, 95%CI 1.155-2.070) and headache (1.866, 95%CI 1.349-2.580) as COVID-19 associated onset symptoms, and days at hospital (OR1.013, 95%CI 1.004-1.022) were risk factors associated musculoskeletal post-COVID pain. In conclusion, musculoskeletal post-COVID pain is present in 45.1% of COVID-19 survivors at eight months after hospital discharge with most patients developing ""de novo"" post-COVID pain. Female gender, history of musculoskeletal pain, presence of myalgias and headache as COVID-19 symptoms at the acute phase, and days at hospital were risk factors associated with musculoskeletal post-COVID pain.","FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-de-Las-PeÃƒÂ±as, de-la-Llave-RincÃƒÂ³n, Ortega-Santiago, Ambite-Quesada, GÃƒÂ³mez-Mayordomo, Cuadrado, Arias-NavalÃƒÂ³n, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Barrera, MartÃƒÂ­n-Guerrero, Pellicer-Valero, Arendt-Nielsen","https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002564","20211216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23985,""

"What are the experiences of clinical psychologists working with people with intellectual disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic?","People with intellectual disabilities are a particularly vulnerable group, at an increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 and of poor mental health. Psychologists providing mental health support to people with intellectual disabilities report poorer mental wellbeing and higher occupational stress. Moreover, they raise concerns about the ability of people with intellectual disabilities to engage with digital technologies for mental health support in the context of reduced face-to-face psychological provision. The study aimed to understand psychologists' experiences of working with people with intellectual disabilities during the pandemic. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 psychologists from community intellectual disabilities services. Data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Two superordinate themes emerged. Survive or Thrive highlighted the challenges and successes clinical psychologists experienced while working during the pandemic. 'Left to Their Own Devices' described psychologists' experiences of their clients as forgotten within society. The current study demonstrates psychologists' ability to adapt to extremely challenging circumstances, exposes the vulnerabilities of people with intellectual disabilities and highlights the gaps in service provision.","Chemerynska, Marczak, Kucharska","https://doi.org/10.1111/jar.12971","20211216","COVID-19; experiences; intellectual disabilities; psychologist","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23987,""
"Distress and anxiety following postponed cardiac surgery prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused postponements of elective cardiac surgery. We hypothesised that postponements due to the pandemic were associated with higher levels of psychological distress than prepandemic postponements. A prospective, observational cohort study was conducted among patients in whom elective cardiac surgery was postponed. Patients who received information regarding a new date of surgery prior to the pandemic were compared with patients postponed during the pandemic without information regarding a new date of surgery. Data were collected from patient records, validated questionnaires and interviews. Out of 55 postponed patients, 21 experienced prepandemic postponement. No significant differences were observed between groups regarding the psychological measures before their rescheduled operation. However, patients in both groups reported high levels of anxiety and depression with &gt; 60% indicative of potentially positive diagnoses. No differences were found in mortality across groups and no patients developed severe complications. Interviews showed that patients in the COVID-19 group felt immediate relief at postponement and engaged in a meaning-making process with respect to their ability to tolerate postponement in order to reassure themselves and their relatives. No significant differences were found in psychological distress between the patients of the two groups. However, both groups experienced high levels of psychological distress.

"The effect of COVID-19 epidemic on the mental health of nurses' family members","The COVID-19 epidemic is a global health crisis that, in addition to physical health, has affected the mental health of all individuals, especially health-care workers, including nurses and family members. In this regard, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-19 epidemic on mental health of nurses' family members. The present descriptive-analytic and cross-sectional study was conducted in 2020 year on family members of nurses working in Hajar Hospital for admission and hospitalization of patients with COVID-19, after obtaining the necessary permits and coordination. To prevent the spread of COVID-19 through respiratory or contact droplets, a blog was designed to collect data using software. Participation in this study was voluntary. Data collection tools included consent, demographic questionnaire, and mental health questionnaire (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Data were analyzed by SPSS version 22. Findings of this study showed that out of 208 family members of nurses participating in this study, 96 were male and 112 were female and their mean age was 35.78 years, and 55.3% of the participants had university education. Their mean mental health score was 12.91 Ã‚Â± 3.75, so that 22.6% of people had mild depression, 71.4% of people had moderate depression, and 1.8% of people had severe depression.

"Global research priorities on COVID-19 for maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health","This research prioritization aimed to identify major research gaps in maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (MNCAH) to help mitigate the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We adapted the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative methodology. We defined scope, domains, themes and scoring criteria. We approached diverse global experts via email to submit their research ideas in MNCAH and MNCAH-related cross-cutting/health systems area. We curated the research ideas as research questions (RQs) and sent them to the consenting experts for scoring via the online link. For each RQ, the research priority score (RPS) was calculated as an average of individual criterion scores and ranked based on RPS in each area. We identified top-ranked 10 RQs in each maternal, newborn, and child and adolescent health and 5 in the cross-cutting/health systems area. In maternal health, indirect effects on care, measures to improve care, health risks and outcomes, and preventing and managing SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 disease were priority RQs. In newborn health, clinical characterization and managing SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 disease, mode of transmission and interventions to prevent transmission were the focus. For child and adolescent health, top-ranked RQs were indirect effects on care, clinical status and outcomes, interventions to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 disease, and educational institute-related RQs. The cross-cutting RQs were the effects of the pandemic on availability, access, care-seeking and utilization of MNCAH services and potential solutions. We call on partners, including governments, non-governmental organizations, research institutes, and donors, to address this urgent research agenda.","Asm, Maamri, Falade, Ayede, Bhutta, Gambhir, Tagarro, Abdelmegeid, Ahmadi, Barros, Mekasha, Srinivasaiyer, Araujo da Silva, Schultz, Fatima, Dhar, Magowan, Wills, Raynes-Greenow, Homer, Maclennan, Ward, Garcia, Ross, Murdoch, Wilson, Adejuyigbe, Stasii, Scudder, Sacks, McCollum, Althabe, Russell, Kumar, Sommerfelt, Graham, Blencowe, Tappis, Saloojee, Ben Masaud, Tiwary, Asiodu, Newton, Bourdaire, Adze, Martines, Lozano, Walson, Rankin, Allegaert, PellÃƒÂ©, Edmond, Rabiei, Rasmussen, Yunis, Ferguson, Greenslade, Kiapi, Noguchi, Bont, Day, Mofenson, Aboumayaleh, Aquzouz, Wahba, Nagai, Knight, Melkumova, Jenyfa, Neuman, Meremikwu, Kinney, Gravett, Hawkes, PacquÃƒÂ©, Walsh, McGuire, AlShawafi, Khuri-Bulos, Thacker, Rollins, Kissoon, Starets, Picone, Oladapo, Erdeve, Smith, Van de Perre, Kumar, Mangtani, Abbas, Khatoon, Bahl, Lodha, Grais, Richards-Kortum, Rasaily, Aryeetey, Pattinson, Petrucci, Rossi, Pace, Yoshida, Walani, Godakandage, Bauler, Comstock, Basu, Kebede, Saha, Bhatnagar, Lee, Gupta, Antara, Downe, Freedman, Lye, Miller, Sulimani, Ley, Mangal, Lavin, Shi, Florin, Sundekilde, Baltag, Valdes, Cherniak, Nisar, Shamszai, Navabi","https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.11.04071","20211217","Adolescent; Adolescent Health; COVID-19; Child; Child Health; Female; Global Health; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Pandemics; Research; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23990,""
"A Survey of Psychiatric Healthcare Workers' Perception of Working Environment and Possibility to Recover Before and After the First Wave of COVID-19 in Sweden","<b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to investigate the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on perceived working environment, including the possibility to recover, among psychiatric healthcare workers (PHCWs) in comparison with pre-pandemic measures. <b>Method:</b> A link to an anonymous, web-based COVID-19 related survey was sent <i>via</i> email to all PHCWs at a university hospital in Sweden (<i>n</i> = 1,618) in September 2020. The response rate was 38% (566 of 1,507 eligible participants). Working environment survey responses collected in 2019 were used as pre-pandemic comparators. Statistical analyses were performed to assess overall impact over time on work demands, support, motivation, and recovery, stratified by professional role, and considering variables such as access to personal protective equipment. <b>Results:</b> The percentage of individuals responding negatively to statements about working environment increased significantly for most items after the first wave. Similarly, the increase of five of the investigated factors indicated a more negative perception of recovery during the pandemic. Registered nurses reported a greater negative impact of the pandemic on perceived working conditions and ability to recover than other professional groups. PHCWs working with patients with COVID-19 (35%) who reported being worried about becoming infected (12%) or infecting others (17%), or lacking adequate personal protective equipment (22%) were more negatively impacted regarding work environment-related items than those who did not. <b>Conclusions:</b> PHCWs' working environment and possibility for recovery were impacted by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses being most affected. Although psychiatric services do not directly care for patients with severe COVID-19 infection, the results from this study suggests that mental health services should also prepare for future pandemics.","Alexiou, Steingrimsson, Akerstrom, Jonsdottir, Ahlstrom, Finizia, Wijk, Degl'Innocenti","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.770955","20211217","COVID-19 pandemic; online survey; psychiatric healthcare workers; recovery; working environment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23991,""

Herein, we explored the association between parental well-being index and child mental health problems during the pandemic and the mediating role of harsh parenting and child sleep disturbances. An online survey was conducted among 16,398 parents of children aged 3-6 years (48.1% girls, M<sub>age</sub> = 4.69 years, SD<sub>age</sub> = 0.75 years) from March 15 to 29, 2020. Child mental health (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, SDQ), sleep problems (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, CSHQ), and parental well-being index (World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index, WHO-5), and harsh parenting were reported by parents. The results revealed that a higher parental well-being index was associated with lower child mental health problems. Harsh parenting and child sleep problems were significant mediators within the association.

"The impact of sleep, physical activity and sedentary behaviour on symptoms of depression and anxiety before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of South African participants","During lockdowns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals have experienced poor sleep quality and sleep regularity, changes in lifestyle behaviours, and heightened depression and anxiety. However, the inter-relationship and relative strength of those behaviours on mental health outcomes is still unknown. We collected data between 12 May and 15 June 2020 from 1048 South African adults (age: 32.76Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.43Ã‚Â years; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°767 female; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°473 students) using an online questionnaire. Using structural equation modelling, we investigated how insomnia symptoms, sleep regularity, exercise intensity/frequency and sitting/screen-use (sedentary screen-use) interacted to predict depressive and anxiety-related symptoms before and during lockdown. We also controlled for the effects of sex and student status. Irrespective of lockdown, (a) more severe symptoms of insomnia and greater sedentary screen-use predicted greater symptoms of depression and anxiety and (b) the effects of sedentary screen-use on mental health outcomes were mediated by insomnia. The effects of physical activity on mental health outcomes, however, were only significant during lockdown. Low physical activity predicted greater insomnia symptom severity, which in turn predicted increased depressive and anxiety-related symptoms. Overall, relationships between the study variables and mental health outcomes were amplified during lockdown. The findings highlight the importance of maintaining physical activity and reducing sedentary screen-use to promote better sleep and mental health.","Lewis, Roden, Scheuermaier, Gomez-Olive, Rae, Iacovides, Bentley, Davy, Christie, Zschernack, Roche, Lipinska","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-02021-8","20211217","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23993,""

Cross-sectional, online survey. A stratified sample of confined general population (N=1082) from four Ibero-American countries-Chile (n=261), Colombia (n=268), Ecuador (n=282) and Spain (n=271)-balanced by age and gender. Sociodemographic information (age, gender, country, education and income level), information related to COVID-19 lockdown (number of days in quarantine, number of people with whom the individuals live, absence/presence of adults and minors in charge and attitude towards the search of information related to COVID-19), Perceived Stress Scale-10, Ryff's Psychological Well-Being Scale-29 and Self-Care Activities Screening Scale-14.

"Effect of the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown on mental health among post-secondary students in the Grand Est region of France: results of the PIMS-CoV19 study","The COVID-19 epidemic has sent students around the world in to lockdown. This study sought to assess the prevalence of impaired self-perceived mental health and identify associated factors among French post-secondary students during the lockdown. A cross-sectional study was conducted among French students living in the Grand Est area in France from May 7 to 17, 2020 during the first lockdown. An online survey was used to collect sociodemographic data, learning and teaching conditions, living conditions, and exposure to COVID-19, and self-perceived mental health was assessed with mental composite score (MCS) of the SF-12. Overall, 4018 were analyzed. Most participants were female (70.7%), and the mean age was 21.7Ã‚Â years (SD 4.0). The mean MCS score was 44.5 (SD 17.3). Impaired mental health, defined by a MCSÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°1st Quartile, was mainly associated with female sex; decreased time for learning; not having access to the outside with a garden, a terrace or a balcony; difficulties with the living situation and having someone in the home affected by the SARS-COV2 requiring hospitalization or not. This study showed that living conditions during lockdown had a clear impact on the mental health of French post-secondary students. There is a need to improve prevention and to access distance education as well as an urgent need for measures to develop healthy coping strategies for students. This is significant challenge and will assist in moderating the risk for the development of further distress and mental health concerns.","Baumann, Rousseau, Tarquinio, Batt, Tarquinio, Lebreuilly, Sorsana, Legrand, Guillemin, Bourion-BÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ¨s","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12955-021-01903-9","20211217","COVID-19; French students; Living conditions; Mental health; SF-12; Adult; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Female; France; Humans; Mental Health; Quality of Life; RNA, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Students; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23995,""
"Changes in mental health during three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic: a repeated cross-sectional study among polish university students","Research indicates that mental health worsened during the Coronavirus crisis, in particular among women and university students. However, few longitudinal studies have so far investigated the changes in mental health outcomes across three subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study aims to examine changes in mental health among university students. A total of 1,961university students from Poland, at mean age 23.23 years (SD = 3.16, 57.47% of women) were included in this repeated cross-sectional study across three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic: W1 (n = 657), W2 (n = 654), and W3 (n = 650). They completed the online survey with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), General Self-Rated Health (GSRH), and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), as well as sociodemographic variables. The prevalence of people at high risk of anxiety and perceived stress, poorer physical health, and low life satisfaction changed significantly across three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the two-way ANOVA showed that both the wave (W1&lt;W2&lt;W3) and gender (men&lt;women) had a significant impact on the level of anxiety. Statistically significant changes in perceived stress were found between pandemic waves (W1&gt;W2, W1&gt;W3), and genders (men&lt;women). Self-reported physical health significantly deteriorated in W3 compared to W1 and W2 (W1&gt;W3, W2&gt;W3), and was significantly worse in women than in men. The level of life satisfaction also decreased significantly in W3 (W1&gt;W3, W2&gt;W3), but did not differ between men and women. High GAD risk was presented two times more frequently among women and people who subjectively assessed their health as poor, three times more likely in participants dissatisfied with their lives, and seven times more probably in persons with high-stress levels. The results of this study consistently indicate (using parametric and non-parametric statistical analysis) that there are significant differences in mental health problems across three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. It suggests that pandemic waves should be considered in future review studies and meta-analyses. Furthermore, these findings indicate a potential role for prevention and intervention programs aimed at alleviating life satisfaction and subjective assessment of health and improving coping skills to reduce stress and anxiety.","Rogowska, Ochnik, KuÃ…â€ºnierz, Chilicka, Jakubiak, Paradowska, GÃ…â€šazowska, Bojarski, FijoÃ…â€šek, Podolak, Tomasiewicz, Nowicka, Kawka, Grabarczyk, BabiÃ…â€žska","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03615-2","20211217","Anxiety; Life satisfaction; Logistic regression; Perceived stress; Physical health; Prevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23996,""
"The physiological and psychological effects of cognitive behavior therapy on patients with inflammatory bowel disease before COVID-19: a systematic review","Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is now included in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in many settings. However, different clinical trials report different outcomes without consensus. This study aims to evaluate the impact of CBT on the mental state, quality of life and disease activity of patients with IBD. Systematic review. This systematic review searched eligible studies from 1946 to December 8, 2019, in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane library, ClinicalTrials.gov, PsycINFO, Web of Science for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCT). Among the initial identified 1807 references, 11 studies met inclusion criteria. CBT was shown to improve patient's quality of life and reduce the level of depression and anxiety post-intervention but was not sustained. Evidence is not enough for the effect of CBT on disease activity, or C-reactive protein level. CBT has shown short-term positive psychological effects on IBD patients, but there is insufficient evidence for sustained physical and psychological improvements of IBD patients.

"Mental State of Students During the Pandemic and Affecting Factors: A Cross-Sectional Study","Evaluation of the psychological symptoms in healthcare students and the development of new strategies to improve their mental health are of great importance. The study was aimed at determining the mental state of students, prospective healthcare workers, during the pandemic, and the influencing factors. The descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at a Manisa Celal Bayar University Faculty of Health in Turkey. The sociodemographic characteristics questionnaire, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and Brief Symptom Inventory were used to collect data. The study was conducted with 828 students. In study, variables such as sleep, negative news about COVID-19, sex, income status, presence of social support, department students attend, choosing the profession willingly, and having a physical/mental illness were determined to have an effect on the mental state. The results of this study suggest that there is a relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and mental health state of the students.","Nehir, Gungor Tavsanli","https://doi.org/10.1177/00469580211056389","20211216","COVID-19; fear; mental health; pandemic; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23998,""
"Risk perception, mental health impacts and coping strategies during COVID-19 pandemic among Filipino healthcare workers","COVID-19 pandemic has caused an extraordinary situation, especially for the healthcare workers (HCWs), leading to increased psychological stress. The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of different grades of anxiety and depression across different centers in the Philippines and identify demographic factors associated with them. A cross-sectional, web-based, multi-center study was conducted among HCWs of Philippines from April 20- May 20, 2020. The study instruments used were the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Risk perception scores were analyzed using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis test. Logistic regression was done to identify factors significantly associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression determined. A total of 516 HCWs were included in the study. Most of them have anxiety symptoms (70.74%), but only half of them have symptoms of depression (50.97%). In addition, gender, age, marital status, living status, occupation, work premises, and availability of mental health services were significantly associated with the participants' anxiety symptoms; In contrast, gender, marital status, occupation, and work premises were significantly associated with depression symptoms. This study reiterates the fact and demonstrates that COVID-19 has disrupted the mental well-being of HCWs in the Philippines. Majority of HCW was psychologically affected by COVID-19. Therefore, there is a dire need to address mental illness amongst HCWs and frame guidelines based on proven algorithms to overcome these mental illnesses.","Rillera Marzo, Villanueva Iii, Chandra, Htay, Shrestha, Shrestha","https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2021.2604","20211216","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-18","",23999,""
