"Predictors and consequences of loneliness during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global context in which social isolation has become normative in order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. As a result of social distancing policies, the risk for loneliness and associated decline in quality of life has increased. The current study examined factors associated with loneliness and quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic cross-sectionally (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 797) and longitudinally (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 395). Older age and larger social network size were associated with less loneliness, whereas having multiple physical or mental health diagnoses was associated with greater loneliness. Greater virtual social contact was also associated with increased loneliness. Greater loneliness was associated with all domains of quality of life both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Understanding factors associated with loneliness is critical to developing effective strategies at reducing loneliness and improving quality of life during the pandemic. Contrary to popular perceptions, older age was associated with less loneliness and more virtual social contact was associated with more loneliness. Thus, it may be prudent to deemphasize virtual social contact in public campaigns and to emphasize safe methods of interacting in person.","Rumas, Shamblaw, Jagtap, Best","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113934","20210421","COVID-19; Loneliness; Quality of life; Social contact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-22","",13081,""
"Using Multi-modal Assessments to Capture Personalized Contexts of College Student Well-being in 2020: A Case Study","2020 has been a challenging year for many, particularly for young adults who have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging adulthood is a developmental phase with significant changes in the patterns of daily living; it is a risky phase for the onset of major mental illness. College students during the pandemic face significant risk, potentially losing several protective factors (e.g., housing, routine, social support, job and financial security) that are stabilizing for mental health and physical well-being. Individualized multiple assessments of mental health, defined as multimodal personal chronicles, present an opportunity to examine indicators of health in an ongoing and personalized way using mobile sensing devices and wearable internet-of-things. To assess the feasibility and provide an in-depth examination of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students through the utility of multimodal personal chronicles, we present a case study of an individual monitored using a longitudinal subjective and objective assessment approach over a nine-month period throughout 2020, spanning the pre-pandemic period of January through September. The individual completed psychological assessments measuring depression, anxiety, and loneliness across the 4 time points of January, April, June, and September. We used the data emerging from the multimodal personal chronicles (i.e., heart rate, sleep, physical activity, affect, behaviors) in relation to psychological assessments to understand patterns that help to explicate changes in the individual's psychological well-being across the pandemic. Over the course of the pandemic, the individual's depression severity was highest in April, shortly after shelter-in-place orders were mandated. His depression severity remained mildly severe throughout the rest of the months. Associations in their positive and negative affect, physiology, sleep, and physical activity patterns varied across time periods. Lee's positive and negative affect were positively correlated in April (r = .53, P = .04) whereas they were negatively correlated in September (r = -.57, P = .03). Only in the month of January was sleep negatively associated with negative affect (r =-.58, P = .03) and day BPM (r = -.54, P = .04), and then positively associated with resting RMSSD (r = .54, P = .04). When looking at his available contextual data, the individual noted certain situations as supportive coping factors and other situations as potential stressors. We observe more pandemic concerns in April, and notice other contextual events relating to this individual's well-being, reflecting how college students continue to experience life events during the pandemic. The rich monitoring data alongside contextual data may be beneficial for clinicians to understand client experiences and offer personalized treatment plans. We discuss benefits as well as future directions of this system, and the conclusions we can draw regarding the links between the COVID-19 pandemic and college student mental health.","Lai, Rahmani, Yunusova, Rivera, Labbaf, Hu, Dutt, Jain, Borelli","https://doi.org/10.2196/26186","20210421","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-22","",13082,""
"Mining and Validating Social Media for COVID-19-Related Human Behaviors between January and July 2020; An Infodemiology Study","Health authorities can minimize the impact of an emergent infectious disease outbreak through effective and timely risk communication, which can build trust and adherence to subsequent behavioral messaging. Monitoring the psychological impacts of an outbreak, as well as public adherence to such messaging is also important for minimizing long-term effects of an outbreak. We used social media data to identify human behaviors relevant to COVID-19 transmission, and the perceived impacts of COVID-19 on individuals, as a first step toward real-time monitoring of public perceptions to inform public health communications. We develop a coding schema for 6 categories and 11 subcategories, which includes both a wide number of behaviors, as well codes focused on the impacts of the pandemic (e.g., economic and mental health impacts). We use this to develop training data and develop supervised learning classifiers for classes with sufficient labels. Classifiers that perform adequately are applied to our remaining corpus and temporal and geospatial trends are assessed. We compare the classified patterns to ground truth mobility data and actual COVID-19 confirmed cases to assess the signal achieved here. We apply our labeling schema to ~7200 tweets. The worst performing classifiers have F1 scores of only 0.18-0.28 when trying to identify tweets about monitoring symptoms and testing. Classifiers about social distancing, however, are much stronger, with F1 scores of 0.64-0.66. We applied the social distancing classifiers to over 228 million tweets. We show temporal patterns consistent with real-world events, and show correlations of up to -0.5 between social distancing signals on Twitter and ground truth mobility throughout the United States. Behaviors discussed on Twitter are exceptionally varied. Twitter can provide useful information for parameterizing models that incorporate human behavior, as well as informing public health communication strategies by describing awareness of and compliance with suggested behaviors.","Daughton, Shelley, Barnard, Gerts, Watson Ross, Crooker, Nadiga, Mukundan, Vaquera Chavez, Fairchild","https://doi.org/10.2196/27059","20210421","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-22","",13083,""
"The associations of obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions and general severity with suicidal ideation in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder: The role of specific stress responses to COVID-19","Suicidal ideation is prevalent in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); but, during COVID-19 it may be increased. The present study aimed to examine the effects of obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptom dimensions and OCD severity on suicidal ideation by considering the role of stress responses in reaction to COVID-19 in a clinical sample of patients with OCD. In a cross-sectional study, 304 patients with OCD completed measures of OC symptom dimensions, OCD severity, general mental health (depression and anxiety), and COVID-19-related stress. Results showed that after controlling for depression, anxiety, comorbidity, and lifetime suicide attempts, the OC symptom dimensions of responsibility for harm and unacceptable obsessional thoughts as well as general severity had indirect effects on suicidal ideation through the specific stress responses to COVID-19, including traumatic stress and compulsive checking. The study shows that OCD patients with specific OC symptom dimensions and severe OCD are more likely to have suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Further, the specific stress responses to COVID-19 may be an underlying mechanism. Clinicians should carefully assess suicidal ideation in patients with OCD who experience responsibility for harm and unacceptable thoughts, particularly during the pandemic.","Khosravani, Samimi Ardestani, Bastan, McKay, Asmundson","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2602","20210421","COVID-19 stress; OCD severity; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-22","",13084,""

"Fears of compassion magnify the harmful effects of threat of COVID-19 on mental health and social safeness across 21 countries","The COVID-19 pandemic is a massive global health crisis with damaging consequences to mental health and social relationships. Exploring factors that may heighten or buffer the risk of mental health problems in this context is thus critical. Whilst compassion may be a protective factor, in contrast fears of compassion increase vulnerability to psychosocial distress and may amplify the impact of the pandemic on mental health. This study explores the magnifying effects of fears of compassion on the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety and stress, and social safeness. Adult participants from the general population (N = 4057) were recruited across 21 countries worldwide, and completed self-report measures of perceived threat of COVID-19, fears of compassion (for self, from others, for others), depression, anxiety, stress, and social safeness. Perceived threat of COVID-19 predicted increased depression, anxiety and stress. The three flows of fears of compassion predicted higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress and lower social safeness. All fears of compassion moderated (heightened) the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on psychological distress. Only fears of compassion from others moderated the effects of likelihood of contracting COVID-19 on social safeness. These effects were consistent across all countries. Fears of compassion have a universal magnifying effect on the damaging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and social safeness. Compassion focused interventions and communications could be implemented to reduce resistances to compassion and promote mental wellbeing during and following the pandemic.","Matos, McEwan, KanovskÃƒÂ½, HalamovÃƒÂ¡, Steindl, Ferreira, Linharelhos, Rijo, Asano, GregÃƒÂ³rio, MÃƒÂ¡rquez, Vilas, Brito-Pons, Lucena-Santos, Oliveira, de Souza, Llobenes, Gumiy, Costa, Habib, Hakem, Khrad, Alzahrani, Cheli, Petrocchi, Tholouli, Issari, Simos, Lunding-Gregersen, Elklit, Kolts, Kelly, Bortolon, Delamillieure, Paucsik, Wahl, Zieba, Zatorski, KomendziÃ…â€žski, Zhang, Basran, Kagialis, Kirby, Gilbert","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2601","20210421","COVID-19 pandemic; Fears of compassion; Mental health; Moderator effect; Multinational study; Perceived Threat of COVID-19; Social safeness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-22","",13086,""
"Medical Care Disruptions During the First Six-Months of the COVID19 Pandemic: The Experience of Older Breast Cancer Survivors","PurposeOlder cancer survivors required medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic despite infection risks, but there are limited data on medical care in this age group. We evaluated care disruptions in a longitudinal cohort of non-metastatic breast cancer survivors ages 60-98 from five US regions (n=321). Survivors completed a web-based or telephone survey from May 27, 2020 to September 11, 2020. Care disruptions included self-reported interruptions in ability to see doctors, receive treatment or supportive therapies, or fill prescriptions. Logistic regression models evaluated bivariate and multivariate associations between care disruptions and education, medical, psychosocial and COVID-19-related factors. Multivariate models included age, county COVID-19 rates, comorbidity and post-diagnosis time. There was a high response rate (n=262, 81.6%). Survivors were 32.2 months post-diagnosis (SD 17.5, range 4-73). Nearly half (48%) reported a medical disruption. The unadjusted odds of care disruptions were significantly higher with more education (OR 1.23 per one-year increase, 95% CI 1.09-1.39, p =0.001) and greater depression (OR 1.04 per one-point increase in CES-D score, CI 1.003-1.08, p=0.033); tangible support decreased the odds of disruptions (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97-0.99 per one-point increase, p=0.012). There was a trend for associations between disruptions and comorbidity (unadjusted OR 1.13 per 1 added comorbidity, 95% CI 0.99-1.29, p=0.07). Adjusting for covariates, only higher education (p=0.001) and tangible social support (p=0.006) remained significantly associated with having care disruptions. Older breast cancer survivors reported high rates of medical care disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic and psychosocial factors were associated with care disruptions.","Dilawari, Rentscher, Zhai, Ahles, Ahn, Bethea, Carroll, Cohen, Graham, Jim, McDonald, Nakamura, Patel, Root, Small, Saykin, Tometich, VanDyk, Mandelblatt","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-416077/v1","20210421","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-22","",13087,""

"Safe abortion services during the COVID -19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study from a tertiary center in Nepal","<b>Background:</b> Abortion is an essential service, the need for which has increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Because of the lockdowns at several periods, these services were hampered. This study analyzed the pattern of Safe Abortion Services (SAS) at a tertiary healthcare center during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal. <b>Methods:</b> This is a cross-sectional analytical study. We compared the pattern of safe abortion services between the first three months of the pandemic when a lockdown was implemented and the second three months when the lockdown was eased. Demographic and obstetric profile of women, their abortion choices, method of termination, difficulty in accessibility, and level of psychological distress were studied. <b>Results:</b> A total of 52 women were provided SAS during the study period. The number of women coming for SAS during lockdown was 47.1% less than that after easing of the lockdown. During the lockdown, women came at a later period of gestation with a mean of 9.5 weeks compared to 7.5 weeks in the later three months. Because of fear of COVID-19, 19.2% (n=10) women opted for termination of pregnancy. Increased need of contraception was felt but 40% (n=12) had problems of accessibility. More women had probable serious mental illness during the lockdown period (p=0.008). <b>Conclusion:</b>Ã‚Â Lockdown during the pandemic decreased the number of women coming for SAS due to barriers in accessibility. Contraceptive needs are also increased but access is difficult. The need for safe abortion services and contraception has increased during the pandemic but the lockdown caused inaccessibility. Psychological distress is prevalent, and fear of COVID-19 has become a common reason for termination of pregnancy. This pandemic can be taken as an opportunity to provide and improve contraception and abortion accessibility, and quality with integration of mental health support.","Aryal, Nepal, Ballav Pant","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.50977.1","20210421","Nepal; abortion; contraception; lockdown; pandemic; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-22","",13089,""
"Pandemic Risk Management using Engineering Safety Principles","The containment of infectious diseases is challenging due to complex transmutation in the biological system, intricate global interactions, intense mobility, and multiple transmission modes. An emergent disease has the potential to turn into a pandemic impacting millions of people with loss of life, mental health, and severe economic impairment. Multifarious approaches to risk management have been explored for combating an epidemic spread. This work presents the implementation of engineering safety principles to pandemic risk management. We have assessed the pandemic risk using PatÃƒÂ©-Cornell's six levels of uncertainty. The susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, recovered, deceased (SEIQRD), an advanced mechanistic model, along with the Monte Carlo simulation, has been used to estimate the fatality risk. The risk minimization strategies have been categorized into hierarchical safety measures. We have developed an event tree model of pandemic risk management for distinct risk-reducing strategies realized due to natural evolution, government interventions, societal responses, and individual practices. The roles of distinct interventions have also been investigated for an infected individual's survivability with the existing healthcare facilities. We have studied the Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) for pandemic risk management using the proposed framework. The results highlight effectiveness of the proposed strategies in containing a pandemic.","Alauddin, Khan, Imtiaz, Ahmed, Amyotte","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2021.04.014","20210421","ALARP; COVID-19; Risk analysis; non-pharmaceutical interventions; pandemic; precautionary principle","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-22","",13090,""
"Protocol for a randomized pilot study (FIRST STEPS): implementation of the Incredible Years-ASLDÃ‚Â® program in Spanish children with autism and preterm children with communication and/or socialization difficulties","Having access to parenting interventions in the early years is key to improve the developmental outcomes of children with neurodevelopmental problems. The Incredible YearsÃ‚Â® (IY) Parent Program is a group intervention that has demonstrated efficacy in terms of reducing stress in parents, as well as improving behavioral, emotional, and social outcomes in children. The program has been recently adapted for families of children with autism or language delays (IY-ASLDÃ‚Â®). This intervention has not yet been implemented in the Spanish Public Health System, where there is a scarcity of evidence-based interventions being offered to families with young children presenting neurodevelopmental problems. The main aims of this study are to determine the feasibility of implementing the IY-ASLDÃ‚Â® program within Spanish Child Mental Health Services and to examine parents' acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention. As a secondary objective, we aim to evaluate its preliminary effectiveness in terms of reducing parental stress and behavioral difficulties in their children. The FIRST STEPS study is a multicenter, pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the IY-ASLDÃ‚Â® program with a treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition. Approximately 70 families of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and preterm children with communication and/or socialization difficulties (aged 2-5Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) will be recruited. Families will be assessed prior to randomization and after the intervention. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the intervention will consist of 22 weekly online sessions (approximately 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months). The FIRST STEPS pilot trial will demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of reliably implementing the IY-ASLDÃ‚Â® program within the Spanish Public Health System. The results of this study could represent the first step to inform policymakers in Spain when designing evidence-based healthcare pathways for families of children presenting ASD symptoms or neurodevelopmental difficulties at early stages.

Data were collected between 15<sup>th</sup> April and 8 June 2020. Participants answered questions on lifestyle changes and their concerns and worries about COVID-19, and completed the SCI, PHQ9, GAD7, PWB18, UCLA3 and MEQ. Results showed self-isolation was linked to lower psychological well-being, and increased loneliness, anxiety and depression. Home-working was related to a shift in diurnal preference. Reduced work/income was related to decreased psychological well-being and sleep quality and increased anxiety, depression, loneliness and. Intensity of worried thoughts and concerns about COVID-19 were positively correlated with anxiety, depression and negatively with sleep quality. In conclusion, the social, occupational and economic disruption due to COVID19 has had a negative impact on psychological well-being. However, the transition to home-working may have been somewhat beneficial for some individuals in terms of sleep.
