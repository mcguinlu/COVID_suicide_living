"H""IT""ting the Barriers for Exercising During Social Isolation","Aerobic exercise is traditionally recommended to improve general health and prevent many non-communicable diseases  However, the measures adopted to control the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak culminated with closing of exercise facilities and fitness centers and, as a primary consequence, impaired aerobic exercise practice  This contributed to an increase in risk factors associated with physical inactivity such as insulin resistance, high blood pressure, low-grade inflammation, weight gain, and mental health problems  The scenario is worrisome, and it is important to propose alternatives for exercise practice during the COVID-19 pandemic  Interval training (IT) emerges as an exercise mode that might be feasible, low-cost, and potentially safe to be performed in many different places  IT consists of interspersing relative brief bouts of high-intensity exercise with recovery periods and promotes similar or greater health benefits when compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise  Among the different types of IT, sprint interval training and ""Tabata protocols"" might be particularly useful during social isolation  These protocols can be controlled and performed without the need of complex equipment and can be adapted to different places, including domestic environments  In this article, we present variations of IT as possible alternatives to cope physical inactivity during COVID-19 pandemics with a focus on its practical applications  The protocols suggested can be performed without the need of specialized equipment or facilities, in a time-efficient manner, and aiming to prevent detraining or even improve physical fitness and general health  1  The Problem Regular aerobic exercise is recommended by health organizations and exercise specialists for disease prevention, healthy aging and reducing mortality rates [1-3]  These benefits have been associated with increases in cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), weight loss and improvements to the immune system [4-7]  Aerobic training may be performed using different types of exercises (e g , jogging, bicycle, running, rowing, swimming), with or without specialized equipment and in many different places, such as gyms, health clubs, outdoors or public spaces  The outcomes derived from an aerobic training program seem be dependent more on adequate exercise prescription than on the equipment or environment [8], with a special attention to adequate intensity control [9]  The importance of intensity in achieving functional and health related outcomes has been evidenced in different groups, where high-intensity training provided similar or greater benefits than moderate-intensity exercise [10-14]","Souza, Daniel; Coswig, Victor; Barbosa De Lira, Claudio Andre; Gentil, Paulo","https://doi.org/10.3390/biology9090245","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Biology;2020(9):245-245, 2020.; Publication details: Biology;2020(9):245-245, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-25","",4078,""

"Developing and testing a nurse-led intervention to support bereavement in relatives in the intensive care (BRIC study): a protocol of a pre-post intervention study","BACKGROUND: When a patient is approaching death in the intensive care unit (ICU), patients' relatives must make a rapid transition from focusing on their beloved one's recovery to preparation for their unavoidable death. Bereaved relatives may develop complicated grief as a consequence of this burdensome situation; however, little is known about appropriate options in quality care supporting bereaved relatives and the prevalence and predictors of complicated grief in bereaved relatives of deceased ICU patients in the Netherlands. The aim of this study is to develop and implement a multicomponent bereavement support intervention for relatives of deceased ICU patients and to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on complicated grief, anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress in bereaved relatives. METHODS: The study will use a cross-sectional pre-post design in a 38-bed ICU in a university hospital in the Netherlands. Cohort 1 includes all reported first and second contact persons of patients who died in the ICU in 2018, which will serve as a pre-intervention baseline measurement. Based on existing policies, facilities and evidence-based practices, a nurse-led intervention will be developed and implemented during the study period. This intervention is expected to use 1) communication strategies, 2) materials to make a keepsake, and 3) a nurse-led follow-up service. Cohort 2, including all bereaved relatives in the ICU from October 2019 until March 2020, will serve as a post-intervention follow-up measurement. Both cohorts will be performed in study samples of 200 relatives per group, all participants will be invited to complete questionnaires measuring complicated grief, anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress. Differences between the baseline and follow-up measurements will be calculated and adjusted using regression analyses. Exploratory subgroup analyses (e.g., gender, ethnicity, risk profiles, relationship with patient, length of stay) and exploratory dose response analyses will be conducted. DISCUSSION: The newly developed intervention has the potential to improve the bereavement process of the relatives of deceased ICU patients. Therefore, symptoms of grief and mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress, might decrease.

"Mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya: a review","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted considerable impact on public mental health globally. With the pandemic rapidly rising in sub-Saharan Africa including Kenya, there is need to provide evidence to guide the mental health response in the region. Objectives: The objective of this review is (1) to describe the mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya, guided by the Mental Health Preparedness and Action Framework (2) to offer context specific recommendations for improvement of the mental health response in Kenya. Such information could be useful in decision-making in Kenya as well as in the greater sub-Saharan Africa region. Methods: This narrative review is based on information obtained from official government documents released from 13th March 2020, the beginning of the pandemic in Kenya, up to 31st July 2020. Discussion: The COVID-19 response in Kenya has no formal mental health response plan. There is an unmet need for psychological first aid in the community. While guidelines for the management of mental health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been prepared, implementation remains a major challenge due to a poorly resourced mental health system. There is no mental health surveillance system in place limiting ability to design evidence-based interventions. Conclusion: We propose four key strategies for strengthening the mental health response in order to mitigate the harmful impact of COVID-19 on public mental health in Kenya: (1) preparation of a formal mental health response plan specific to the COVID-19 pandemic with allocation of funding for the response (2) training of community health workers and community health volunteers on psychological first aid to enable access to support for those in need during the pandemic (3) scaling up of mobile health to increase access to care (4) conducting systematic and continuous text message surveys on the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to inform decision-making.","Jaguga, Florence; Kwobah, Edith","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13033-020-00400-8","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Syst;14: 68, 2020.; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Syst;14: 68, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-25","",4107,""

"Mindful Parenting: A Behavioral Tool for Parent Well-Being","Parents often suffer from conditions such as stress and depression due to the high demands of parenting. In particular, parenting children with some form of developmental disability may bring about increased maladaptive behaviors that may increase daily parenting stressors. The fast-spreading repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic have left millions of parents across the globe to deal with various stressors in isolation. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of mindfulness as an intervention for targeting individuals' behaviors such as aggression, self-injurious behavior, and noncompliance while increasing overall well-being and happiness levels. Significant decreases in target behaviors are noted across studies, as well as increases in parent satisfaction and well-being.

"[Optimism and COVID-19: A resource to support people in confinement?]","This text envisages looking at the psychological consequences of the health situation related to COVID-19 from the concept of optimism. Positive psychology has for several years been dealing with this concept, which is well known to the general public, but which has been the subject of major conceptual development in the field of science. It seems to us that the concept of optimism can be particularly useful in understanding and influencing the behaviour of our fellow citizens during the period of confinement that is currently imposed on everyone, in the same way that we must consider the consequences in the short, medium and long term, both economically and in terms of the moral and physical health of our fellow citizens, that is, after the period of confinement. Traditionally, being optimistic means being confident in the positive outcome of an event, whereas pessimism means expecting the worst. The uncertainty that this virus imposes on us and the new situations that it brings about, forces us to think the world in uncertain terms, which can be destabilizing. Understanding the contribution of the concept of optimism in the potential of the adaptive processes that each of us may or may not be able to mobilize to face and adapt to this unprecedented and unprecedented health crisis is essential. This will undoubtedly be a major challenge for the social sciences and psychology. This is why we believe that the concept of optimism can help to provide additional insights that will enable us to better grasp the rational (or non-rational) behaviours that we may face in the future, and in which we are already involved.","Martin-Krumm, Tarquinio, Tarquinio","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.004","20200824","COVID-19; Containment; Health; Hope; Optimism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-25","",4114,""

"Mental health key to tourism infrastructure in China's new megapark","The global economic value of parks through improved mental health of tourists has been estimated at about ten times greater than direct park tourism expenditure. The Chinese term for this health services value is <i>jing hua xin ling</i>, psychological destressing. Here we present the first case where optimal tourist infrastructure is influenced by including mental health. Using a multi-stage, cross-lingual, differential stakeholder method, we analyse conflicts between road- and roadless-access tourism in the very large new Sanjiangyuan National Park, Qinghai, which offers <i>jing hua xin ling</i> to domestic tourists from eastern-seaboard cities. This provides a powerful tourism attraction, and hence economic opportunity, for the region around the park. If these mental health aspects are included, together with their direct and indirect consequences for tourism, then roadlessness is preferable to new roads. Similar infrastructure conflicts occur for park tourism worldwide, and <i>jing hua xin ling</i> can provide a global theoretical framework.","Buckley, Zhong, Martin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2020.104169","20200824","Adventure; COVID-19; Culture; Health; Protected area","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-25","",4117,""

"COVID-19, Deferred Care and Telemedicine: A Problem, A Solution and a Potential Opportunity","The COVID-19 pandemic forced many health systems to proactively reduce care delivery to prepare for an expected surge of hospitalizations. There have been concerns that care deferral may have negative health effects and hopes telemedicine could provide a viable alternative. To measure the extent and reason for care deferral during a health system shutdown, to understand whether telemedicine was acceptable as a care delivery alternative and to estimate whether acceptance of telemedicine had changed during the shutdown. Cross-sectional analysis of survey responses from 1,694 primary care patients in a mid-sized northeastern city. The survey was conducted during the &quot;lock down&quot; and while the healthcare system was shut down except for care that could not be delayed. Our mains outcome was respondent report of telemedicine use and care deferral during the shutdown. : Deferred care is widespread - nearly half of respondents deferred care - but it was largely for preventive services, particularly dental and primary care, and did not cause concern about negative health effects. A quarter of those who delayed care were concerned about the health effects, with needs centered around orthopedics and surgery. Telemedicine was viewed more positively than prior to the pandemic and was overwhelmingly viewed as a viable option to deliver deferred care, particularly by those over age 65, female and college educated. Mental health services stood out for high levels of deferred care. Temporary health system shutdowns will necessarily lead to deferred care. However, much of the deferral will be for preventive services. The health effect can be moderated by prioritizing surgical and orthopedic services and moving other service lines to telemedicine. The need for telemedicine options is particularly acute for mental health services.","Atherly, Van Den Broek-Altenburg, Hart, Gleason, Carney","https://doi.org/10.2196/21607","20200824","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-25","",4119,""

In the United States and abroad, there is concern for how the novel coronavirus will affect vulnerable populations, including people experiencing homelessness. Individuals who lack stable housing are more likely to have preexisting health conditions and limited access to basic preventative hygiene practices such as handwashing and sanitizing. The situation has become critical in Los Angeles' Skid Row neighborhood, where nearly 5,000 unhoused residents (13% of the city's homeless population) reside on any given night. Community members' concerns have mounted as social and health services in the area have decreased, and early efforts to prevent the transmission of coronavirus did not adequately address the lack of access to handwashing stations and hand sanitizing products. This Practice Note details an academic-community partnership that uses grassroots organizing to provide &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; handwashing stations to the Skid Row neighborhood.

Social workers and mental health providers in VA home-based primary care (HBPC) teams face challenges providing psychosocial support to their homebound, medically complex, socially isolated patient population who are high risk for poor health outcomes related to COVID-19. We developed and disseminated an 8-week telephone or virtual group intervention for front-line HBPC social workers and mental health providers to use with socially isolated, medically complex older adults. The intervention draws on skills from evidence-based psychotherapies for older adults including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, and Problem-Solving Therapy. The manual was disseminated to VA HBPC clinicians and geriatrics providers across the United States in March 2020 for expeditious implementation. Eighteen HBPC teams and three VA Primary Care teams reported immediate delivery of a local virtual or telephone group using the manual. In this paper we describe the manualâ€™s development and clinical recommendations for its application across geriatric care settings.
