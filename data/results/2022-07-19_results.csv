"Postural balance and its association with functionality and quality of life in non-hospitalized patients with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome","The neuromuscular system is responsible for performing adequate muscle activities to maintain postural balance. Since COVID-19 can cause damage to this system, long-term sequelae might alter control of postural stability. This study aimed to evaluate the postural balance of patients with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) who were not hospitalized and to evaluate the correlations of changes in postural balance with general fatigue, muscle strength, and quality of life (QoL). This was a cross-sectional study in which 40 patients with PCS and 40 controls underwent balance assessment through the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Tinetti Balance Scale (TBS). They were evaluated for general fatigue by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) scale, handgrip strength (HGS), and quality of life (QoL) by the Short Form-36 (SF-36). When compared to controls, patients with PCS had lower BBS and TBS scores (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001 for both). The FACIT-F score was lower in PCS patients (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.0001). HGS was slightly lower in the PCS patients, but not statistically significant (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.09). Regarding QoL, PCS patients showed worse evaluations in five dimensions of the SF-36 (physical functioning, physical role limitations, bodily pain, general health perceptions, and mental health). Both the BBS and TBS scores had statistically significant positive correlations with the FACIT-F score, HGS, and two SF-36 dimensions (physical role limitations and emotional role limitations). Patients with PCS show worse postural balance than controls, which is associated with general fatigue, lower HGS, and poor QoL. Postural balance assessment should be considered in the follow-up and rehabilitation of PCS.","de Sousa, Gardel, Lopes","https://doi.org/10.1002/pri.1967","20220717","COVID-19; general fatigue; muscle strength; postural balance; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-19","",34414,""
"Web-based treatment for depression in pregnancy: a feasibility study of Mum2BMoodBooster","Depression in pregnancy is prevalent, under-treated, and has serious impacts on the wellbeing of women and on child development. Internet programs can reach women who may not access traditional treatments due to distance, stigma or concern about taking medication. We adapted our online postnatal depression program, MumMoodBooster, for antenatal use. We aimed to trial feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of the new Mum2BMoodBooster intervention with depressed pregnant women. Twenty-seven pregnant women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°11 used the program in a feasibility trial. Twenty-one had current diagnoses of major or minor depression on the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV. Assessment of symptoms occurred at screening/baseline, post-test (8Ã‚Â weeks post-enrollment), and at follow-up (3Ã‚Â months postpartum) using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). In this feasibility trial, depression scores on both the PHQ-9 and the DASS-21, showed significant reductions representing large effects, with average symptom scores reduced byÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°50%, and maintained in the 'minimal or no depression' range at 3Ã‚Â month follow-up. Anxiety scores also decreased significantly. Program usage was high with 74% of women visiting all six sessions. Program acceptability ratings were moderate to high. Findings paralleled the magnitude of symptom reductions seen in randomised trials of the postnatal MumMoodBooster program, suggesting that Mum2BMoodBooster is an effective treatment for depressed pregnant women. Effective internet therapies are likely to become increasingly important as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to make face-to-face access to health care problematic during 'lockdowns'.","Gemmill, Oliva, Ericksen, Holt, Holt, Milgrom","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04111-x","20220719","Antenatal depression; Feasibility trial, cognitive-behavioural therapy; Internet intervention; Web-based intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-19","",34415,""

"Emotion controllability beliefs and young peopleâ€™s anxiety and depression symptoms: A systematic review","Background Emerging research and theorizing suggest that emotion controllability beliefs (ECBs: beliefs about the extent to which emotions can be controlled) play a major role in youth depression and anxiety, via their influence on emotion regulation. This model has critical implications for basic science and practice. Yet, no systematic review of this emergent body of research has been undertaken. We provide such a review, focusing on the extent to which ECBs are associated with youth anxiety and depression, and the underlying mechanisms accounting for these links. Methods A systematic search of the affective and clinical sciences literature identified 19 peer-reviewed publications that met our inclusion criteria. In addition, two panels were established to provide expert input on the different stages of the review: a panel of young people with lived experience of anxiety or depression and a clinician panel. Findings The reviewed studies indicated that greater ECBs were associated with fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression, in part because these beliefs were associated with a greater likelihood of engaging in adaptive emotion regulation strategies (e.g., reappraisal). Conclusion The findings of this systematic review support current theoretical models linking ECBs with anxiety and depression via emotion regulation strategies that target emotional experience, such as reappraisal. In contrast, and also consistent with theory, there was little support for strategies that target emotion expression (e.g., suppression) as a mediator. Although there is evidence consistent with the view that ECBs exert a causal influence on anxiety and depression in young people, experimental and intervention studies are needed to more robustly test causal hypotheses. Future work is also needed to fully understand the influence of age, gender, and culture.","Matthew Somerville et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E008E-20E-007","20220718","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; depression; anxiety; emotion regulation; emotion controllability beliefs","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-19","",34427,""
