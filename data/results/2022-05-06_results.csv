"Longitudinal analyses of depression and anxiety highlight greater prevalence during COVID-19 lockdowns in the Dutch general population and a continuing increase in suicidal ideation in young adults","Objective: The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to an increased burden on mental health. This study therefore investigated the development of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and suicidal ideation in the Netherlands during the first fifteen months of the pandemic and three nation-wide lockdowns. Methods: Participants of the Lifelines Cohort Study -a Dutch population-based sample- reported current symptoms of MDD and GAD, including suicidal ideation, according to DSM-IV criteria using a digital structured questionnaire. Between March 2020 and June 2021, 36,106 participants (aged 18-96) filled out a total of 629,811 questionnaires across 23 time points. Trajectories over time were estimated using generalized additive models and analyzed in relation to age, sex, and lifetime history of MDD/GAD to identify groups at risk. Results: We found non-linear trajectories for MDD and GAD with a higher number of symptoms and prevalence rates during periods of lockdown. The point prevalence of MDD and GAD peaked during the third hard lockdown at 2.88% (95% CI: 2.71%-3.06%) and 2.92% (95% CI: 2.76%-3.08%), respectively, in March 2021. Women, younger adults, and participants with a history of MDD/GAD reported significantly more symptoms. For suicidal ideation, we found a linear increase over time in younger participants which continued even after the lockdowns ended. For example, 4.63% (95% CI: 3.09%-6.96%) of 20-year-old participants reported suicidal ideation at our last measured time point in June 2021, which represents a 4.14x increase since the start of the pandemic. Conclusions: Our study showed greater prevalence of MDD and GAD during COVID-19 lockdowns suggesting that the pandemic and government enacted restrictions impacted mental health in the population. We furthermore found a continuing increase in suicidal ideation in young adults. This warrants for alertness in clinical practice and prioritization of mental health in public health policy.","Anil PS Ori; Martijn Wieling; - Lifelines Corona Research Initiative; Hanna M van Loo","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.05.02.22273554","20220505","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30964,""
"Acceptance or Rejection of the COVID-19 Vaccine: A Study on Iranian People's Opinions toward the COVID-19 Vaccine","We aimed to assess the Iranian people's attitude and confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine, their concerns about the safety of vaccines, and their reasons for accepting or rejecting the COVID-19 vaccine. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study with a mixed qualitative&ndash;quantitative approach from December 2020 to February 2021. Our questionnaire consisted of a COVID-19 vaccine attitude questionnaire, a COVID-19 vaccine confidence inventory, a modified vaccine safety scale, and questions about participants' decision to accept or refuse the COVID-19 vaccine, and their explanations for their decisions. The research included 1928 people with an average age of 34.88 years with 1236 (64.1%) being female. A total of 1330 participants desired to have the COVID-19 vaccine (69%). Female gender, lower educational levels, following COVID-19 news through sources other than websites and social media, not following COVID-19 news, and loss of a first-degree relative due to COVID-19 were all associated with a more negative attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine (p &lt; 0.01). To conclude, the acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccine among Iranians is comparable to the international average;however, it is still unfavorable. There are serious challenges to the vaccination program in Iran, such as older adults' lower intention to undergo the COVID-19 vaccine and misinformation.","Nakhostin-Ansari, Amin, Zimet, Gregory D.; Khonji, Mohammad Saeid, Aghajani, Faezeh, Teymourzadeh, Azin, Rastegar Kazerooni, Amir Ali, Pirayandeh, Pendar, Aghajani, Reyhaneh, Safari, Sepideh, Khalaj, Kamand, Memari, Amir Hossein","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10050670","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Vaccines; 10(5):670, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30965,""
"Sustainable Workplace Mental Well Being for Sustainable SMEs: How?","Sustainable mental health and wellbeing (MHW), as addressed under SDG3, is crucial for achieving sustainable development, notably for sustainable SMEs growth. MWH is specifically interlinked with SDGs 8, 9 and 11: Economic growth and prosperity, sustainable communities, innovation, and jobs. Studies show over 200 million workdays are lost due to poor MHW each year, referring to the global cost of $1 trillion/year in lost productivity and it is increasing every year. Poor workplace MWH is almost an epidemic after COVID-19. It will be a significant challenge for a long time, in particular for SMEs which are hit hardest by the pandemic, as MHW problems have been shown to be a COVID side effect among 1:5 people. Despite the multifactorial aetiology of MHW (individual, social, environmental, and organizational), interventions for workplace MHW mostly refer to 'one size fits all' and top-down solutions, primarily asking for the commitment and behaviour change of employees;that has shown to be ineffective. The main assumption underlying the present work is the need for a proactive and tailored MHW frameworks that can be blended to organizational policies. The objective which corresponds to the main purpose of the paper is to provide a 5-staged MWH model, stemming from our evidence-based studies, that may speak for the identified need. We also discuss how the Model can provide a route map on how SMEs can implement and measure SDGs relevant to their business in synergistic interaction with SDG3.","Cinar, Ayse Basak, Bilodeau, Stephane","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14095290","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(9):5290, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30966,""
"Proposal of a Methodology for Assessing Financial Risks and Investment Development for Sustainability of Enterprises in Slovakia","Investments are a demanding and, at the same time, threatening indicator for enterprises not only in the time of depression such as the current coronavirus pandemic but also under normal market conditions. The goal of this article is to propose a methodology for assessing financial risks and investment development. The proposed methodology integrates the use of new modern and classical economic-statistical methods, which makes it an effective tool for the sustainability of enterprises. At the same time, the methodology can be used as an auxiliary tool for enterprise management in the investment decision-making process. In the first step, a methodology was created using a commercial software tool where the pdevelopment of the cash-flow indicator and the accumulated cash flow were modeled in order to calculate the net present value (NPV). The statistical modeling was performed using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The normality was monitored using the Shapiro&ndash;Wilk test, and the Kruskal&ndash;Wallis test was chosen as the non-parametric test. The deliverable of the applied methods was the creation of a mathematical model in the form of an algorithm that is applicable in different enterprises in Slovakia.","Tobisova, Alica, Senova, Andrea, Izarikova, Gabriela, Krutakova, Ivana","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14095068","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(9):5068, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30967,""
"Multicomponent Intervention Associated with Improved Emotional and Cognitive Outcomes of Marginalized Unemployed Youth of Latin America","Mass migration and people seeking political refuge are critical social issues facing Latin America. Ecuador has the largest population of recognized refugees in the region. Youths from a migration background have an increased risk of becoming NEET (Young people not in employment, education, or training). Such youths struggle more with mental health problems than non-NEET peers. Being a refugee, NEET further increases the risk of having mental health problems and may be linked to lower cognitive functioning, which could maintain exclusion and unemployment. This intervention study was performed with a group of young people of different nationalities who were refugees or belonged to other vulnerable groups attending a six-week employability-support intervention in Ecuador. In order to assess the impact of the intervention, a range of measures of executive cognitive function, mental health, and the potential for positive change were used. We found that post-intervention, the group reported significantly less psychological distress and better self-esteem, self-efficacy, and cognitive response inhibition than before the intervention. We conclude that multicomponent interventions may effectively improve the psychological functioning of vulnerable NEET groups in the Latin American context.","Crespo-Andrade, Cristina, Trueba, Ana Francisca, MarÃ­a Sol, GarcÃ©s, Pluck, Graham","https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci11040155","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Sciences; 11(4):155, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30968,""
"Psychedelics: Alternative and Potential Therapeutic Options for Treating Mood and Anxiety Disorders","The word â€œpsychedelicâ€ (psyche (i.e., the mind or soul) and delos (i.e., to show)) has Greek origin and was first coined by psychiatrist Humphry Osmond in 1956, who had been conducting research on lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) at the time. Psychedelic drugs such as N,N-DMT/DMT (N,N-dimethyltryptamine), 5-MeO-DMT (5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine), LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and psilocybin have had significant value as an entheogen in spiritual, religious (shamanic) and sociocultural rituals in Central and South American cultures for thousands of years. In the 1960s, the globalization of these drugs and their subsequent spread outside of their indigenous, old-world cultures, led to the subsequent implementation of strict drug control laws in many Western countries. Even today, psychedelics are still classified as Schedule I drugs, resulting in a still lingering negative stigmatization/perception, vilification, and ultimate criminalization of psychedelics. This controversy still lingers and still limits scientific research and full medical acceptance. For many years up until recently, the spiritual, religious and medicinal value of these drugs could not be explored in a scientific context. More recently, a second wave of psychedelic research is now focusing on psychedelics as neuropharmaceuticals to treat alcohol and tobacco addiction, general mood and anxiety disorders and cancer-related depression. There is now a vast array of promising evidence-based data to confirm the years of anecdotal evidence of the medicinal values of psychedelics. Natural therapeutic alternatives such as psychedelic drugs may provide a safe and efficacious alternate to conventional drugs used to treat mood and anxiety disorders. In a Western context in particular, psychedelic drugs as therapeutic agents for mood and anxiety disorders are becoming increasingly of interest amidst increasing rates of such disorders globally, changing social constructions, the implementation of government regulations and increasing investment opportunities, that ultimately allow for the scientific study to generate evidenced-based data. Alternative psychotherapeutic interventions are gaining interest also, because of their low physiological toxicity, relatively low abuse potential, safe psychological effects, and no associated persisting adverse physiological or psychological effects during and after use. On the other hand, conventional psychotic drugs and anti-depressants are becoming less favorable because of their adverse side effects. Psychedelic neuropharmaceutical interventions may with medical oversight be the solution to conventional psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, and an alternative to conventional psychiatric treatment options. This paper will review the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs as alternative therapeutic options for mood and anxiety disorders in a controlled, clinical setting, where the chances of adverse psychological episodes occurring are mitigated.","Lowe, Henry, Ngeh, Toyang, Steele, Blair, Grant, Justin, Amza, Ali, Gordon, Lorenzo, Ngwa, Wilfred","https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27082520","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Molecules; 27(8):2520, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30969,""
"The Arabic Version of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised: Psychometric Evaluation among Psychiatric Patients and the General Public within the Context of COVID-19 Outbreak and Quarantine as Collective Traumatic Events","The Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has provoked the development of negative emotions in almost all societies since it first broke out in late 2019. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) is widely used to capture emotions, thoughts, and behaviors evoked by traumatic events, including COVID-19 as a collective and persistent traumatic event. However, there is less agreement on the structure of the IES-R, signifying a need for further investigation. This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the IES-R among individuals in Saudi quarantine settings, psychiatric patients, and the general public during the COVID-19 outbreak. Exploratory factor analysis revealed that the items of the IES-R present five factors with eigenvalues &gt; 1. Examination of several competing models through confirmatory factor analysis resulted in a best fit for a six-factor structure, which comprises avoidance, intrusion, numbing, hyperarousal, sleep problems, and irritability/dysphoria. Multigroup analysis supported the configural, metric, and scalar invariance of this model across groups of gender, age, and marital status. The IES-R significantly correlated with the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-8, perceived health status, and perceived vulnerability to COVID-19, denoting good criterion validity. HTMT ratios of all the subscales were below 0.85, denoting good discriminant validity. The values of coefficient alpha in the three samples ranged between 0.90 and 0.93. In path analysis, correlated intrusion and hyperarousal had direct positive effects on avoidance, numbing, sleep, and irritability. Numbing and irritability mediated the indirect effects of intrusion and hyperarousal on sleep and avoidance. This result signifies that cognitive activation is the main factor driving the dynamics underlying the behavioral, emotional, and sleep symptoms of collective COVID-19 trauma. The findings support the robust validity of the Arabic IES-R, indicating it as a sound measure that can be applied to a wide range of traumatic experiences.","Ali, Amira Mohammed, Al-Amer, Rasmieh, Kunugi, Hiroshi, Stanculescu, Elena, Taha, Samah M.; Saleh, Mohammad Yousef, Alkhamees, Abdulmajeed A.; Hendawy, Amin Omar","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm12050681","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Personalized Medicine; 12(5):681, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30970,""
"Fatigue Is a Major Symptom at COVID-19 Hospitalization Follow-Up","Persistent symptoms after hospitalization with COVID-19 are common, but the frequency and severity of these symptoms are insufficiently understood. We aimed to describe symptoms and pulmonary function after hospitalization with COVID-19. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Central Denmark Region were invited for follow-up 3 months after discharge. Clinical characteristics, patient reported outcomes (Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), anxiety and depression (HADS)), symptoms, pulmonary function test and 6-min walk test were collected. We included 218 patients (mean age 59.9 (95% CI: 58.2, 61.7), 59% males). Fatigue, dyspnea and impaired concentration were the most prevalent symptoms at follow-up. Using FAS, 47% reported mild-to-moderate fatigue and 18% severe fatigue. Mean HADS was 7.9 (95% CI: 6.9, 8.9). FAS was correlated to HADS (&beta;= 0.52 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.59, p &lt; 0.001)). Mean DLCO was 80.4% (95% CI: 77.8, 83.0) and 45% had DLCO &#706;80%. Mean DLCO was significantly reduced in patients treated in the ICU (70.46% (95% CI 65.13, 75.79)). The highest FAS and HADS were seen in patients with the shortest period of hospitalization (2.1 days (95% CI: 1.4, 2.7)) with no need for oxygen.

"Association of Ramadan Participation with Psychological Parameters: A Cross-Sectional Study during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Iran","COVID-19 restrictions are associated with poor physical-activity (PA). Less is known about the relationship between the combination of these restrictions with Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF), PA, mental health, and sleep-quality. The present study aimed to evaluate whether COVID-19 restrictions and RIF during the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran are associated with poor PA, anxiety, well-being, and sleep-quality outcomes. A total of 510 individuals participated in an online questionnaire that was disseminated to adults (&ge;18 years) residing in Iran from 13 May 2021 to 16 May 2021 (~3 days), just after the end of Ramadan 2021. PA behavior (Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7), well-being (Mental Health Continuum-Short Form), and sleep-quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). Of 510 individuals included in the study (331 female (64.9%);mean &plusmn;SD, 31 &plusmn;12 years), 172 (33.7%) reported less PA during the Ramadan 2021. PA was associated with better well-being and sleep-quality outcomes. Regardless of PA, participants who fasted for all of Ramadan had less anxiety and better well-being outcomes than those who fasted part of Ramadan or did not fast at all. However, the fasting part of Ramadan decreased the sleep-quality of active participants. The Ramadan 2021 was associated with poor PA, well-being, and sleep-quality of Iranians. However, PA was associated with better well-being and sleep-quality outcomes, and those who fasted all Ramadan had better anxiety and well-being outcomes. Therefore, PA during Ramadan might be an essential and scalable mental health resilience builder during COVID-19 restrictions which should be encouraged.","Akbari, Hesam Addin, Yoosefi, Mohammad, Pourabbas, Maryam, Weiss, Katja, Knechtle, Beat, Vancini, Rodrigo Luiz, Trakada, Georgia, Ben Saad, Helmi, Lavie, Carl J.; Ghram, Amine","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11092346","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(9):2346, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30972,""
"Factors Associated with Mental Health Outcomes in Hospital Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mixed-Methods Study","Background: We investigated some of the factors associated with depression, perceived stress, and anxiety in clinical and nonclinical healthcare workers of two hospitals. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was used. The sample included clinical (physicians, nurses, and others) and nonclinical (security and cleaning staff) healthcare workers of two tertiary hospitals in Peru. Participants completed an online self-survey. In the qualitative analysis, data were subjected to thematic analysis. Results: We analyzed data from 613 participants, of which 8.6%, 9.0%, and 78.2% had moderate-to-severe anxiety, depression, and perceived stress, respectively. Having a previous mental health problem, being concerned about losing one's job, having at least two COVID-19 symptoms in the preceding two weeks, and being afraid of infecting family members increased the prevalence of experiencing moderate-to-severe depression and anxiety. The qualitative analysis allowed us to identify five recurring factors that caused a negative impact on workers' lives during the pandemic: emotional distress linked to hospital experiences of suffering and death, modification of routines, fear of COVID-19, exacerbation of mental disorders, and physical problems associated with emotional distress. Conclusions: Clinical and nonclinical healthcare workers in Peru have experienced depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Self-Reported Medication Use among Pregnant and Postpartum Women during the Third Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A European Multinational Cross-Sectional Study","Information on medication utilization among pregnant and postpartum women during the pandemic is lacking. We described the prevalence and patterns of self-reported medication use among pregnant and postpartum women during the third wave of the pandemic (June&ndash;August 2021). An online questionnaire was distributed in five European countries between June&ndash;August 2021. Pregnant women or women who had delivered in the three preceding months, and &ge;18 years old, could participate. The prevalence of overall medication use, self-medication, and changes in chronic medication use were determined. A total of 2158 women out of 5210 participants (41.4%) used at least one medication. Analgesics (paracetamol), systemic antihistamines (cetirizine), and drugs for gastric disorders (omeprazole) were the three most used classes. Anti-infectives were less prevalent than during pre-pandemic times. Antidepressants and anxiety related medication use remained similar, despite a higher prevalence of these symptoms. Self-medication was reported in 19.4% of women, and 4.1% of chronic medication users reported that they changed a chronic medication on personal initiative due to the pandemic. In conclusion, medication use patterns in our cohort were mostly similar to those of the first COVID-19 wave and the pre-pandemic period.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Health and Experience of the Carers of Family Members Living with Dementia: An Italian&ndash;Hungarian Comparative Study","This quantitative study (n = 370) compares the pandemic-related experiences of the family carers of older people living with dementia during the first wave of the pandemic, in two countries with different care regimes: Italy (Mediterranean) and Hungary (Eastern European). It aims at answering the following research questions: (1) How did the pandemic affect the subjective health of carers, and what were their experiences with care-related worries and workload? (2) What factors significantly predicted negative changes in these experiences? (3) What were carers' main difficulties during the first pandemic wave? Results have shown that carers in both samples reported a worsening in mental health (Italy/Hungary: M = 2.25/2.55, SD = 0.93/0.99), and Italian carers also in general health (M = 2.54, SD = 0.98) (on a scale of 1 to 5, with values under '3';representing deterioration). Carers in both samples experienced high worry levels (Italy/Hungary: M = 4.2/3.7, SD = 0.93/0.89) and feeling overwhelmed with care tasks (M = 3.2/3.7, SD = 1.3/1.3) (on a scale of 1 to 5, higher values representing higher worry/work overload). In regression models, all of the above negative experiences were predicted by a combination of factors. Two of these factors stood out in importance due to being a predictor of more than one type of negative experience: a decline in the carer&ndash;care receiver relationship, predicting work overload, as well as general and mental health deterioration and being the child of the care receiver, predicting both high worry and subjective work overload. The top five encountered problems were the unavailability of medical and social care, difficulties with shopping (medicine included), restricted freedom, isolation, and anxiety.","KostyÃ¡l, LÃ¡szlÃ³ ÃrpÃ¡d, SzÃ©man, Zsuzsa, AlmÃ¡si, VirÃ¡g ErzsÃ©bet, Fabbietti, Paolo, Quattrini, Sabrina, Socci, Marco, Gagliardi, Cristina","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095329","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5329, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30975,""
"A Cross-Sectional Study about the Associations between Physical Activity Level, Self-Perceived Health Perception and Mental Health in Informal Caregivers of Elderly or People with Chronic Conditions in Spain","Providing informal care for older people, or people with chronic conditions, is associated with poorer physical and mental health and reduced quality of life. This task, in many cases, often relies on the women in the immediate family. Physical activity (PA) is a tool to enhance caregivers' physical and mental health and their quality of life. Thus, this study aimed to analyse the associations between the physical activity level (PAL), self-perceived health (SPH) and mental health (SM) and its factors (positive coping, self-esteem, and stress) by conducting a cross-sectional study by using data from in the National Health Survey 2017 (ENSE 2017), the last one before the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample included 2225 caregivers (866 men and 1361 women). Descriptive analysis and non-parametric statistical tests, including chi-square, the Kruskal&ndash;Wallis test, the Mann&ndash;Whitney U test, and the Spearman's rho correlation coefficient, were used. Dependence relationships were found between PAL and SPH and MH and their factors. The population groups that performed moderate or vigorous PA showed better results in both SPH and MH.

"Behavior Modification Techniques on Patients with Chronic Pain in the Context of COVID-19 Telerehabilitation: An Umbrella Review","The aim of this systematic review (SR) of SRs was to assess the effectiveness of telerehabilitation based on behavior modification techniques (t-BMT) in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. We searched in PubMed, PEDro, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar (January 2022). The outcome measures were pain intensity, disability, psychological distress, pain-related fear of movement, disease impact, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and physical function. This review was previously registered on the international prospective register of systematic reviews PROSPERO (CRD42021262192). Methodological quality was analyzed using the AMSTAR and ROBIS scales, and the strength of evidence was established according to the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee grading criteria. Four SRs with and without meta-analyses covering 25 trials and involving 4593 patients were included. Of the three SRs that assessed pain intensity, two reported a significant decrease compared to usual care. Contradictory results were also found in the management of psychological distress, and of depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, two reviews found that t-BMT has significant effects on disability, and one review found that t-BMT seems to be effective for improving pain-related fear of movement and disease impact. Finally, one review found that t-BMT does not seem to be an effective modality to improve physical function. The quality of evidence was limited for all outcomes assessed. The results obtained showed that t-BMT was effective in improving disability, disease impact, and pain-related fear of movement, but it was not effective in improving physical function in patients with chronic pain. Mixed evidence was found for pain intensity, psychological distress, and depressive and anxiety symptoms, with a limited quality of evidence.","Cuenca-MartÃ­nez, Ferran, Calatayud, JoaquÃ­n, Suso-MartÃ­, Luis, Varangot-Reille, Clovis, Herranz-GÃ³mez, Aida, Blanco-DÃ­az, MarÃ­a, CasaÃ±a, JosÃ©","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095260","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5260, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30977,""
"Caregivers' Difficulty in Managing Smartphone Use of Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Relationships with Caregiver and Children Factors","This study examined the difficulty encountered by caregivers of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in managing children's smartphone use during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the caregiver- and children-related factors that influence this difficulty. In total, 252 caregivers of children with ADHD were recruited into this study. The caregivers completed a research questionnaire to provide data regarding the difficulty they encountered in managing the smartphone use of children during the COVID-19 pandemic, their general mental health and parenting styles, and the ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms of the children they are caring for. The results indicated that almost 45% of the caregivers of children with ADHD sometimes or often found it difficult to manage the smartphone use of children with ADHD during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the caregivers, a short duration of education, poor general mental health, unaffectionate/uncaring and overprotective parenting styles, older children, and inattention and ODD symptoms were significantly associated with increased difficulty in managing their children's smartphone use during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the basis of the relevant factors identified in this study, an intervention should be developed to enhance the skills of caregivers of children with ADHD with respect to the management of children's smartphone use during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Jia-In, Hsiao, Ray C.; Tsai, Ching-Shu, Yen, Cheng-Fang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095194","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5194, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30978,""
"Rehabilitation Interventions for Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome: A Systematic Review","Increasing numbers of individuals suffer from post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS), which manifests with persistent symptoms, the most prevalent being dyspnea, fatigue, and musculoskeletal, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments. This systematic review investigated the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for individuals with PACS. We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, CINHAL, Scopus, Prospero, and PEDro databases and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to November 2021. We screened 516 citations for eligibility, i.e., trials that included individuals with PACS exposed to exercise-based rehabilitation interventions. Five RCTs were included, accounting for 512 participants (aged 49.2&ndash;69.4 years, 65% males). Based on the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2.0), two RCTs had 'low risk of bias';, and three were in the 'some concerns';category. Three RCTs compared experimental rehabilitation interventions with no or minimal rehabilitation, while two compared two active rehabilitation interventions. Rehabilitation seemed to improve dyspnea, anxiety, and kinesiophobia. Results on pulmonary function were inconsistent, while improvements were detected in muscle strength, walking capacity, sit-to-stand performance, and quality of life. Pending further studies based on qualitatively sound designs, these first findings seem to advocate for rehabilitation interventions to lessen disability due to PACS.","Fugazzaro, Stefania, Contri, Angela, Esseroukh, Otmen, Kaleci, Shaniko, Croci, Stefania, Massari, Marco, Facciolongo, Nicola Cosimo, Besutti, Giulia, Iori, Mauro, Salvarani, Carlo, Costi, Stefania","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095185","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5185, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30979,""
"Predictors of Healthcare Professionals' Work Difficulty Perception during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Study of Work Environment in a Pandemic Hospital","COVID-19 has dramatically changed the work environment in healthcare, which is creating an additional burden for healthcare professionals. In this study, we investigate the factors that trigger professionals to have negative perceptions of their jobs during the pandemic. A cross-sectional survey is used for this study. The respondents are selected based on convenience random sampling. We use 345 questionaries for the analysis. Respondents are health care professionals (nurses, doctors, midwives, technicians, etc.) working in a pandemic hospital in Turkey. We run a multivariable logistic regression model to analyze the predictors of work difficulty perception. The model is adjusted for the respondents' demographical characteristics and emotional wellbeing. We found that depression and burnout are significantly correlated with the perception of job difficulty (OR Severe PHQ-9 = 10.8, p = 0.004;OR Severe Burnout = 7.83, p &lt; 0.001). The professionals who are changed from one department to another are also more likely to perceive the job as difficult (OR Department Change = 1.60, p = 0.045). However, the professionals that received sufficient applause from society are more likely to think that they did not face any difficulties doing their job during the pandemic (OR Applause = 0.56, p &lt; 0.016). Anxiety, monetary motivation, religious beliefs, and information availability did not contribute to the perceived difficulty in their jobs. Thus, efforts need to be made to give them more social support and smooth their changes in departments and functions to facilitate their jobs.","Emhan, Abdurrahim, Elkefi, Safa, Asan, Onur","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095174","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5174, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30980,""
"Ecological Model Explaining the Psychosocial Adaptation to COVID-19","The main objective of this study is to understand and characterize the adoption of an ecological perspective and the physical, psychological, social, and contextual health factors that may influence the adjustment to and mental health experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study included 5479 participants, of which 3710 were female (67.7%), aged between 18 and 90 years old, with a mean age of 48.57 years (SD = 14.29), were considered three age groups: 21.5% up to 35 years old, 61.8% between 36 and 64 years old, and 16.7% 65 years old or more. The mental health and individual adjustment to the COVID-19 situation are explained by socio-demographic factors, health-related factors, lifestyles, attitudes and behaviors, lockdown experience, and place of residence. A better adaptation and mental health are observed among men, people with a higher educational level, people with lower sadness, nervousness, and burnout, and people whose health situation did not worsen with the pandemic. In terms of lifestyle, a better adaptation is related to a better quality of sleep, fewer nightmares, a higher practice of physical activity, and less consumption of processed foods and sweets. A better adaptation is also associated with lower levels of dependence on alcohol, TV, and SN (social networks) and a more positive experience of the lockdown imposed by the pandemic. Gender and age group differences in the described context were studied. Promoting a better adjustment and improved mental health when dealing with the COVID-19 requires an ecological understanding and multitarget interventions, targeting physical, mental, and social health together with the contextual environment.","Gaspar, TÃ¢nia, Paiva, Teresa, Matos, Margarida Gaspar","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095159","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5159, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30981,""
"The Acute Impact of the Early Stages of COVID-19 Pandemic in People with Pre-Existing Psychiatric Disorders: A Systematic Review","People with pre-pandemic health conditions are more vulnerable and more likely to suffer greater psychosocial impact due to the current COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures. Thus, the objective of this work was to systematically review the impact of the early stages COVID-19 pandemic on people with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. The search was performed between 23 January and 2 September 2021 in PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE. A total of 4167 published results were identified;however, only 49 were included in this review. Results show that there was considerable heterogeneity among studies, which resulted in a low consensus. However, it seems that the impact of the first stage of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatric disorders was two-fold: (1) an overall effect, in which people suffering from psychiatric disorders in general experienced more psychological distress and anxiety when compared to people who had no psychiatric diagnosis, and (2) a condition-specific effect, namely in people suffering from eating disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. Moreover, the current work highlights that there were also some external factors that were related to worsening symptoms. For instance, unemployment or experiencing work and financial difficulties can be a trigger for greater distress during the pandemic for people with mood disorders, and being alone and in social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic may actually increase substance use and relapse rates. Further studies are needed to prospectively investigate the long-term effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic on people with (pre)-existing psychiatric conditions and on the onset or deterioration of psychiatric-related symptoms in a larger number of participants, as well as exploring the long-term effects of the current pandemic on mental health.","Carvalho, Sandra, Coelho, Catarina G.; Kluwe-Schiavon, Bruno, MagalhÃ£es, Juliana, Leite, Jorge","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095140","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5140, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30982,""
"Reducing Anxiety with Nature and Gardening (RANG): Evaluating the Impacts of Gardening and Outdoor Activities on Anxiety among US Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic impacted mental health. Growing research has identified the mental health benefits of nature contact, including gardening. We used a cross-sectional survey to investigate the association between gardening and other outdoor activities with anxiety among U.S. adults. The RANG (Reducing Anxiety with Nature and Gardening) survey was distributed online from June&ndash;September 2020 through social media (Twitter and Facebook) and a national Master Gardeners listserv. Survey questions captured demographics, COVID-19 experiences, gardening, outdoor activities, and anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale. Data were analyzed using chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Kruskal&ndash;Wallis tests, as well as logistic regression. Among participants, 46% reported anxiety symptoms. Participants who had gardened &ge;15 years and those gardening &gt; 8 h over two weeks had lower anxiety scores. Spending more time outdoors on weekdays also decreased anxiety scores. After adjusting for covariates, lower odds of anxiety were identified for 50&ndash;69 and 70&ndash;89-year-olds vs. 18&ndash;29-year-olds;males vs. females;and Texas vs. Maryland residents. These findings confirm increased anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest that sustained gardening and other outdoor activities could help reduce anxiety.","Gerdes, Megan E.; Aistis, Lucy A.; Sachs, Naomi A.; Williams, Marcus, Roberts, Jennifer D.; Rosenberg Goldstein, Rachel E.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095121","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5121, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30983,""
"A Systematic Review of Studies Describing the Effectiveness, Acceptability, and Potential Harms of Place-Based Interventions to Address Loneliness and Mental Health Problems","Given the links between the built environment and loneliness, there is interest in using place-based approaches (addressing built environment characteristics and related socio-spatial factors) in local communities to tackle loneliness and mental health problems. However, few studies have described the effectiveness, acceptability, or potential harms of such interventions. This review aimed to synthesize the literature describing local community-based interventions that target place-based factors to address loneliness and mental health problems, informing the development of future public health approaches. We searched PsycINFO, Medline, and Embase using a structured search strategy to identify English-language studies evaluating the effectiveness, acceptability, and potential harms of place-based community interventions in addressing loneliness and mental health problems, both in general and clinical populations. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria, classified as evaluating provision of community facilities (such as clubhouses), active engagement in local green spaces, and housing regeneration. None were randomised trials. Quantitative and qualitative findings suggested promising effects and/or acceptability of six interventions, with minimal potential harms. There is a clear need for randomised trials or quasi-experimental studies of place-based interventions to describe their effectiveness in addressing loneliness and mental health problems, as well as complementary qualitative work investigating acceptability. This will inform future policy development.","Yung-Chia, Hsueh, Batchelor, Rachel, Liebmann, Margaux, Dhanani, Ashley, Vaughan, Laura, Fett, Anne-Kathrin, Mann, Farhana, Pitman, Alexandra","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084766","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(8):4766, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30984,""
"Depression and Perceived Social Support among Unemployed Youths in China: Investigating the Roles of Emotion-Regulation Difficulties and Self-Efficacy","In recent years, the issue of youth unemployment has begun to emerge in China. Unemployed young people are at high risk of depression and other mental health problems. The present study investigates influential factors related to depression and examines the possible mediating effects of difficulties in emotion regulation and self-efficacy between perceived social support and depressive symptoms among unemployed youths in China. Through community recruitment, 511 unemployed young people from Shanghai participated in this cross-sectional survey. The results demonstrate that the prevalence of probable depression in the sample was 49.3% (95% CI: 45.0â€“53.7%). Moreover, we found that both the perceived social support and self-efficacy were significant negative predictors of depression, whereas difficulties in emotion regulation were positive predictors of depression. In addition, the analysis results indicate that difficulties in emotion regulation and self-efficacy partially mediate the relationship between perceived social support and depression. Overall, this cross-sectional study reveals that depression and mental health problems among Chinaâ€™s unemployed youths are concerning while identifying emotion-regulation difficulties as a risk factor for these and social support and self-efficacy as protective factors, all of which warrant our attention in preventing and intervening with cases of youth depression.","Hua, Zhiya, Ma, Dandan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084676","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(8):4676, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30985,""
"Conventional or Organic? Motives and Trends in Polish Vegetable Consumption","Vegetables constitute a major component of human food security. They are the main sources of essential nutrients including antioxidants, natural dyes, minerals, and vitamins. Eating habit issues related to the consumption of vegetables are gaining importance within the context of a healthy lifestyle, longevity, and physical fitness. Additionally, food quality is of primary importance, and so-called eco-food (defined as food as natural as possible, without fertilizers, pesticides, or preservatives) seems to be the most popular world-trend in healthy nutrition. Keeping these ideas in focus, research on vegetable consumption in Poland in the context of conventional or organic production was performed using online questionnaire surveys. The results revealed that the rate of vegetable consumption depended primarily on economic status, except for the potato, which was a staple cutting across all economic strata. Among the 108 analyzed respondents, 74% bought vegetables from certified organic farms. However, 59% bought organic vegetables â€œrarelyâ€ or â€œsometimesâ€, and only 15% â€œoftenâ€. Next, respondents chose to buy vegetables from fresh food markets (45%) and in local shops (41%). About 20% of the respondents acquired vegetables from their own farms. Among the reasons for choosing vegetables from certified organic farms, respondents mentioned in decreasing order: â€œdesire for proper nutritionâ€ (30%), â€œthinking that organic vegetables are healthierâ€ (28%), and â€œorganic vegetables are generally betterâ€ (7%).","Mazur-Wlodarczyk, Katarzyna, Gruszecka-Kosowska, Agnieszka","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084667","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(8):4667, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30986,""

"A Nurse-Led Integrated Chronic Care E-Enhanced Atrial Fibrillation (NICE-AF) Clinic in the Community: A Preliminary Evaluation","The current physician-centric model of care is not sustainable for the rising tide of atrial fibrillation. The integrated model of care has been recommended for managing atrial fibrillation. This study aims to provide a preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness of a Nurse-led Integrated Chronic care E-enhanced Atrial Fibrillation (NICE-AF) clinic in the community. The NICE-AF clinic was led by an advanced practice nurse (APN) who collaborated with a family physician. The clinic embodied integrated care and shifted from hospital-based, physician-centric care. Regular patient education, supplemented by a specially curated webpage, fast-tracked appointments for hospital-based specialised investigations, and teleconsultation with a hospital-based cardiologist were the highlights of the clinic. Forty-three participants were included in the six-month preliminary evaluation. No significant differences were observed in cardiovascular hospitalisations (p-value = 0.102) and stroke incidence (p-value = 1.00) after attending the NICE-AF clinic. However, significant improvements were noted for AF-specific QoL (p = 0.001), AF knowledge (p &lt; 0.001), medication adherence (p = 0.008), patient satisfaction (p = 0.020), and depression (p = 0004).

"Fear of COVID-19 and Perceived Stress: The Mediating Roles of Neuroticism and Perceived Social Support","Background: Fear of COVID-19 leads to stress and may result in various kinds of mental health problems. Many factors are associated with an individual's perception of stress, including neuroticism and perceived social support. This study aimed to examine the role of neuroticism and perceived social support as mediators of fear of COVID-19 on perceived stress. Methods: Data from 3299 participants aged &ge;18 years from the HOME-COVID-19 survey in 2020 were used for analysis. Measurements used included the Fear of COVID-19 and Impact on Quality of Life Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale-10, the Neuroticism inventory and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support-12. A parallel mediation model within a structural equation modeling framework with 5000 bootstrapping sampling was used to test the mediating effect. Results: Fear of COVID-19 had a direct effect on perceived stress (B&thinsp;= &thinsp;0.100, 95% CI = 0.080&ndash;0.121, p &lt; 0.001), whereas neuroticism, but not perceived social support, partially mediated the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and perceived stress (B&thinsp;= 0.018, 95% CI&thinsp;= 0.000&ndash;0.036). Among all types of social support, only perceived support from friends was a significant mediator (B&thinsp;= 0.016, 95% CI = 0.006&ndash;0.025). Conclusions: Neuroticism and perceived support from friends are critical factors in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and perceived stress.","Yang, Qiuyi, Kanjanarat, Penkarn, Wongpakaran, Tinakon, Ruengorn, Chidchanok, Awiphan, Ratanaporn, Nochaiwong, Surapon, Wongpakaran, Nahathai, Wedding, Danny","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10050812","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(5):812, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30989,""
"Anxiety, Stress, and Social Support in Pregnant Women in the Province of Leon during COVID-19 Disease","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a high risk to the mental health of the entire population. Pregnant women are strongly affected by the consequences of COVID-19, resulting in increased anxiety and stress. Social support can be a protective factor when it comes to mental health disturbances such as anxiety, fear, or stress in pregnant women. This research aims to describe the anxiety and stress of women in the first trimester of pregnancy in times of pandemic and its relationship with social support. A quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 115 women in the first trimester of pregnancy participated. Anxiety was found in 78.3% of the women. Self-perceived stress correlated significantly with the dimensions 'concern for changes in oneself';, 'feelings about oneself';, 'concern about the future';, and very weakly with social support. In addition, a negative correlation was observed between 'feelings about oneself';and social support. During the COVID-19 pandemic, anxiety levels of women in our population are elevated. Pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy showed higher levels of fear of childbirth and concern about the future than multiparous women.

In this follow-up study, conducted during the 'second wave';of COVID-19, we included the same group of individuals with HF-ASD and evaluated their levels of stress, anxiety, depression, PTSD-related symptoms, tiredness, and perceived wellbeing;moreover, we compared our results to the ones we obtained during the first lockdown on the same population. We found that individuals with HF-ASD experienced higher levels of the aforementioned psychiatric symptoms during the second lockdown, with respect to the first one. These levels positively correlated with their scores at the Autism Quotient subscale Attention Switching: hence, we speculated that these symptoms might be due not only to the prolonging of the social distancing measures, but also to the uncertainty that HF-ASD participants started experiencing at the end of the first lockdown.","NisticÃ², Veronica, Fior, Giulia, Faggioli, Raffaella, Priori, Alberto, Gambini, Orsola, Demartini, Benedetta","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10050782","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(5):782, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30991,""
"The Association between Physical Activity and Smartphone Addiction in Korean Adolescents: The 16th Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey, 2020","Many side effects of smartphone addiction have been reported, such as a lack of sleep, obesity, and poor concentration. However, the relationship between physical activity (PA) and smartphone addiction has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between physical activity and smartphone addiction among 53,534 Korean adolescents using raw data from the 16th (2020) Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBS). The dependent variables were the general user group, potential risk user group, and high-risk user group for smartphone addiction. The independent variables were moderate PA (over 5 days per week), vigorous PA (over 3 days per week), and strength exercise (over 3 days per week). Sex, body mass index (BMI), school grade, academic achievement, sleep satisfaction, depression, loneliness, and stress were selected as confounding variables. A complex sample logistic regression analysis was performed. Potential smartphone addiction risk users showed statistically significant odds ratios of 1.423 (p &lt; 0.001), 1.379 (p &lt; 0.001), and 1.383 (p &lt; 0.001) based on general users participating in moderate PA, vigorous PA, and strength exercise, respectively. High-risk users showed statistically significant odds ratios of 1.475 (p &lt; 0.001), 1.484 (p &lt; 0.001), and 1.619 (p &lt; 0.001), respectively. In conclusion, to prevent smartphone addiction among Korean adolescents, participation in moderate PA for more than five days a week, vigorous PA for more than three days a week, or strength exercise for more than three days a week is considered effective.","Kim, Jooyoung, Lee, Kihyuk","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10040702","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(4):702, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30992,""
"Boamente: A Natural Language Processing-Based Digital Phenotyping Tool for Smart Monitoring of Suicidal Ideation","People at risk of suicide tend to be isolated and cannot share their thoughts. For this reason, suicidal ideation monitoring becomes a hard task. Therefore, people at risk of suicide need to be monitored in a manner capable of identifying if and when they have a suicidal ideation, enabling professionals to perform timely interventions. This study aimed to develop the Boamente tool, a solution that collects textual data from usersâ€™ smartphones and identifies the existence of suicidal ideation. The solution has a virtual keyboard mobile application that passively collects user texts and sends them to a web platform to be processed. The platform classifies texts using natural language processing and a deep learning model to recognize suicidal ideation, and the results are presented to mental health professionals in dashboards. Text classification for sentiment analysis was implemented with different machine/deep learning algorithms. A validation study was conducted to identify the model with the best performance results. The BERTimbau Large model performed better, reaching a recall of 0.953 (accuracy: 0.955;precision: 0.961;F-score: 0.954;AUC: 0.954). The proposed tool demonstrated an ability to identify suicidal ideation from user texts, which enabled it to be experimented with in studies with professionals and their patients.","Diniz, Evandro J.

"Teaching Staff and Student Perceptions of Staff Support for Student Mental Health: A University Case Study","Background: There are significant concerns for student mental health in higher education. New factors affect student mental health, and campus counselling services are overwhelmed. Struggling students turn to ideally placed familiar teaching staff for support. This qualitative study, conducted in an East of England university, aimed to explore student and staff perceptions of support offered by teaching staff to students grappling with their mental health. It is unique, combining both staff and student perceptions, many of which overlapped. Methods: A thematic analysis was conducted of in-depth, semi-structured interviews with a small number of self-selecting staff/students. Findings (results): Staff felt inadequate in several aspects, and students agreed to give useful suggestions for their preferred support. Conclusions: It was cautiously established that staff training in mental health literacy (knowledge, skills, attributes, and understanding) was required. Specific training was recommended in pastoral care for personal tutors and for staff pedagogy on health professional programmes. Finally, teaching staff needed support when supporting students with poor mental health. Such training and support can be integrated into a preventative, university-wide, holistic policy for student mental health commensurate with the University Mental Health Charter. Embedding such supportive practice into the curriculum is preferable to add-on services and/or interventions.","Payne, Helen","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci12040237","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Education Sciences; 12(4):237, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30994,""
"Drone Usage for Medicine and Vaccine Delivery during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Attitude of Health Care Workers in Rural Medical Centres","Rural areas are often difficult to access reliably with medicine and vaccines. This study aimed to examine rural health care workers' attitude towards drone delivery for medicine and vaccines and the factors that influenced it. Health care workers from four rural health care facilities were sampled. Participants self-reported their demographic information, attitude towards medicine and vaccine delivery using drones, perception of benefits and risks of using drones, and perceived leadership innovativeness through an online or a pen-and-paper questionnaire. A total of 272 health care workers (mean age = 36.19, SD = 8.10) from all of the sites participated in this study. More than half of the study participants agreed or strongly agreed that using a drone to deliver medicine and vaccines is a good idea (54.2%, 95% CI [47.5, 60.8]), a wise idea (54.6%, 95% CI [47.9, 61.2]), and is desirable (52.5%, 95% CI [45.7, 59.0]). Males (&beta;= 0.223), workers from the Obstetrics and Gynaecology department (&beta;= 0.135), a lower perceived delivery risk (&beta;= &minus;0.237), and higher leadership innovativeness (&beta;= 0.336) predicted positive attitudes towards drone usage. Assistant medical officers (&beta;= &minus;0.172) had a negative attitude. There is a need to further understand the roles of occupation and leadership innovativeness in predicting health care workers' attitude towards drone usage, as these differences could be embedded within their roles in the health care system.","Sham, Rohana, Siau, Ching Sin, Tan, Steven, Kiu, Dawn Chii, Sabhi, Hasminulhadi, Thew, Hui Zhu, Selvachandran, Ganeshsree, Quek, Shio Gai, Ahmad, Noorsiah, Ramli, Mohd Hanif Mohd","https://doi.org/10.3390/drones6050109","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Drones; 6(5):109, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30995,""
"Suicide Prevention Program with Cooperation from Senior Volunteers, Governments, and Schools: A Study of the Intervention Effects of â€œEducational Lessons Regarding SOS Outputâ€ Focusing on Junior High School Students","As a suicide countermeasure for young people, implementing â€œSOS output educationâ€ that provides young people with opportunities and approaches to seeking support with community cooperation can be expected to reduce lifelong suicide risk. We implemented an â€œSOS output educationâ€ for junior high school students with cooperation from educators, government staff, and older people working as community volunteers. A total of 188 students were allocated to an intervention group and a waiting group. Outcome assessments were implemented at three points in time: before the program (Time 1), after the program (Time 2), and three months after the program (Time 3). Results showed that the number of people with worries increased in the intervention group compared with the waiting group between Time 1 and Time 2. There was also an increase in people with â€œreliable adultsâ€ between Time 1 and Time 3, and people with â€œadults who you can talk to at any timeâ€ increased between Time 2 and Time 3 in the intervention group.

"Supporting Relatives Prior to Caregiver Burdenâ€”Preventive E-Mental Health Short Intervention for Family Members of Individuals with Parkinsonism in an Early Phase of the Disease: Protocol for a Feasibility Study","Research on support for relatives of patients with Parkinsonism has mainly focused on caregivers, while preventive offers for non-caregiving relatives are lacking. Thus, the aim of this multicenter pilot study is to develop and assess the feasibility of a preventive psychosocial support program for relatives of patients with Parkinsonism. It specifically focuses on family members of patients who are in an early phase of the disease, are not currently caregiving, and have not yet developed distress symptoms. It includes a telemedicine-based, 6-week preventive psychological short intervention (PPSI). The main objective of this feasibility mixed-methods study is to specify the demand for an early, low-threshold, and low-cost short intervention and to collect feedback based on qualitative and quantitative data of N = 20 relatives. Secondary objectives are an evaluation of the effects of the intervention and an analysis of the study design. Future directions are to further develop the PPSI using these data. This study can serve as a basis for future randomized controlled studies on this intervention, which might fill an important gap in clinical supply.","Muente, Catharina, Folkerts, Ann-Kristin, Kalbe, Elke, Thieken, Franziska, Laura-Elisa, Assmann, Widritzki, Maria, Eggers, Carsten, Pedrosa, David, Wilhelm, Marcel","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12040442","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 12(4):442, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30997,""
"Brain Imaging Changes in Patients Recovered From COVID-19: A Narrative Review","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused several outbreaks of highly contagious respiratory diseases worldwide. The respiratory symptoms of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have been closely monitored and studied, while the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral system (PNS) lesions induced by COVID-19 have not received much attention. Currently, patients with COVID-19-associated encephalopathy present with dizziness, headache, anxiety and depression, stroke, epileptic seizures, the Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), and demyelinating disease. The exact pathologic basis for these neurological symptoms is currently not known. Rapid mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 genome leads to the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC), which have higher infectivity and virulence. Therefore, this narrative review will focus on the imaging assessment of COVID-19 and its VOC. There has been an increase in technologies, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), that have been used to observe changes in brain microstructure over time in patients with COVID-19 recovery. Medical imaging and pathological approaches aimed at exploring the associations between COVID-19 and its VOC, with cranial nerve and abnormal nerve discharge will shed light on the rehabilitation process of brain microstructural changes related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as aid future research in our understanding of the treatment and prognosis of COVID-19 encephalopathy.","Huang, Yan, Ling, Qiong, Manyande, Anne, Wu, Duozhi, Xiang, Boqi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2022.855868","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in Neuroscience;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",30998,""

"Discussion of the features of suicide trends in 1994-1995 and 2019-2020: The need for different contents in suicide prevention measures for both periods in Japan from the viewpoint of the present","Japan is a country that is prone to natural disasters. This study compared the characteristics of suicide trends before and after the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, and during the current COVID-19 pandemic 25Ã‚Â years later. In the present study, we examined the annual number of suicides, the number of suicides by age group, and the reason for suicide during the period associated with the earthquake (1994-1995) and the period associated with the pandemic (2019-2020). This study used statistical analyses to compare the two periods. Our findings suggest that research needs to be conducted from the perspective of legal medicine and social medicine to devise current and future measures to prevent suicides. During the first period, suicides increased in 1995 compared to 1994. Suicide due to economic and life problems increased significantly. During the second period, suicides increased in 2020 compared to 2019. Suicides by males decreased significantly and those by females increased significantly; suicides by individuals aged 19 or under and by those aged 20-29 increased significantly, while suicides by individuals aged 60-69 decreased significantly; and suicides due to ""other problems"" increased significantly, while suicides due to economic and life problems decreased significantly. Ongoing studies of detailed trends in suicides due to the effects of COVID-19 need to be conducted in the future, and it is important to determine suicide risk due to the effects of COVID-19.

Research has demonstrated that staff can be supported by strengthening teams and offering frequent well-being support. To assess the feedback from delivery of a strategy to provide psychological well-being support to NHS staff during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether this 'Support for Teams' initiative made a positive impact on staff and in what way. A mixed methods design was used to gain quantitative and qualitative feedback from staff. Feedback was collected from two groups: Well-being Leads and clinicians providing support and resources to Well-being Leads. Feedback was collected via online forms. Collectively, feedback responses were received from 70 staff members. The majority of staff members felt supported and benefitted from the provisions provided. This evaluation showed that our healthcare system must continue to proactively implement and adapt staff support strategies to protect the mental well-being of healthcare professionals, both in the context of future health crises and in everyday practice. This study will assist and guide development and adaptations to health and psychological well-being support, ahead of future pandemics and to provide suitable support beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Blighe, Hotton, Quarmby, Pollard, Neilan, Scholcz, Pinckston, Samuel","https://doi.org/10.1093/occmed/kqac026","20220505","COVID-19; Staff well-being; occupational health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31002,""
"The sexual experience of Italian adults during the COVID-19 lockdown","From March 11 to April 26, 2020, the Italian government imposed a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown, a quarantine that resulted in significant restrictions on the movement and social contacts of the population, with a view to limiting the pandemic outbreak. The quarantine forced people to experience distorted social distance in two contrasting ways. For some people, it resulted in social distancing and isolation, for example by separating noncohabiting couples into different dwellings. For others, however, quarantine increased and imposed social closeness, forcing couples and families into constant, daily, and prolonged cohabitation. The aim of this study was to investigate the sexual health and behaviors of Italian adults during the lockdown period using a multimethod research. An open- and a closed-ended e-questionnaire were administered immediately after the end of the lockdown. A total of 465 Italian adults completed the digital questionnaire (female = 78.7%). Participants recognized their lived sexual experience with generally positive characteristics (related to openness, unproblematic relationship with the body, and awareness and self-reflection about one's sexuality), while negative thoughts such as worry and pain were quite scarce. Participants with a disability (5.6%) showed a marked inversion compared to the mean of respondents, recognizing themselves mainly in negative thoughts related to low self-esteem, inadequacy, and feelings of suffering, yet reporting a higher than mean level of arousal. In the qualitative analysis, the Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) index was computed to measure the salience of the word used by participants to respond to the open-ended five questions. It revealed a generally depressed emotional experience associated with the experience of lockdown, both in terms of desire, which seemed to be shifted more to the level of imagination and fantasies, and the actual possibility of experiencing sexual activity as usual. Nevertheless, the participants emphasized an opening to new possibilities in terms of expressing sexuality, accompanied by a rediscovery of the value of tenderness and affectivity as well as a clearer awareness of their sexual life, needs, and desires.","Federici, Lepri, Castellani Mencarelli, Zingone, De Leonibus, Acocella, Giammaria","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268079","20220505","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31003,""
"Impact of family rejection and racism on sexual and gender minority stress among LGBTQ young people of color during COVID-19","Given the inequitable impact of COVID-19 on sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth and current sociopolitical racial justice concerns in the United States, this study examines the impact of SGM-related family rejection and racism since the start of COVID-19 on SGM-related internalized homophobia and identity concealment among SGM college students of color (SOC). Participants were a subset of SOC (<i>n</i> = 200) from a larger nonprobability cross-sectional study about minority stress and COVID-19 pandemic experiences among SGM college students. Participants completed survey items specifically related to changes in minority stress and racism experiences since the start of COVID-19. Logistic regression models were used to examine the independent and interactive effects of racism and family rejection on identity concealment and internalized homophobia since the start of COVID-19 (adjusting for covariates). Main effects models revealed that increased racism and family rejection were significantly associated with greater odds of experiencing identity concealment since the start of COVID-19. The interaction of increased racism and family rejection was also significantly associated with greater odds of experiencing identity concealment since the start of COVID-19. Study findings suggest that the intersection of racism and family rejection since the start of COVID-19 consequently translates to increased experiences of identity concealment. Such experiences are known to negatively impact mental health across the life course among SGM young people. Public health, medical, mental health, and higher education stakeholders must implement SGM-affirmative and antiracist practices and interventions to support SGM SOC during COVID-19 and beyond its containment.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on peer specialists","Individuals with mental health challenges are at particularly high risk of experiencing negative outcomes (e.g., worsening of mental health, increased risk of mortality) due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Peer specialists may have the benefit of several protective factors, including higher levels of social support and better illness self-management skills that buffer against negative effects of the pandemic. In this study, we compared the differences in the impact of COVID-19 on those trained as peer specialists (e.g., certified peer specialists, recovery coaches) to those not trained in this role. Participants with self-reported mental health and/or substance use challenges completed an online survey to collect information on their experiences during COVID-19 (Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory [EPII]), loneliness (3-item Loneliness Scale), and access to and satisfaction with mental health support. Respondents self-identified as peer specialists or not. One hundred seventy-three U.S. resident participants from 23 states were included in the final analysis: 109 were peer specialists and 64 were nonpeer specialists. Those who were trained as peer specialists reported fewer negative outcomes during the pandemic, including less disruption in employment, less loneliness, and less worsening of mental health, while reporting more positive attitudes in the face of difficulties. Peer specialists were also likely to report more access to and satisfaction with mental health services. Possibly as a function of their role, peer specialists reported better mental health outcomes during COVID-19, providing key, empirical evidence to support the benefits of helping others.

"Differences in psychosocial distress among rural and metropolitan health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","The Australian COVID-19 Frontline Healthcare Workers study examined the prevalence and severity of mental health symptoms during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This substudy examined the differences in psychological well-being between rural and metropolitan health care workers (HCWs). A nationwide survey conducted between August and October 2020. Australian HCWs were recruited through multiple strategies. Demographics, mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] and burnout). Complete responses were included from 7846 participants, with 1473 (18.8%) in regional or remote ('rural') areas and 81.2% in metropolitan areas. Rural participants were older, more likely to work in allied health, nursing or in health administration, and had worked longer in their profession than metropolitan participants. Levels of resilience were similar (pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.132), but there was significantly higher prevalence of pre-COVID-19 pandemic mental illness in the rural workforce (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). There were high levels of current mental health issues: moderate-severe PTSD (rural 38.0%; metropolitan 41.0% pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.031); high depersonalisation (rural 18.1%; metropolitan 20.7% pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.047); and high emotional exhaustion (rural 46.5%; metropolitan 43.3% pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002). Among rural participants, mental health symptoms were associated with younger age, worry about being blamed if they contracted COVID-19, fear of transmitting COVID-19 to their family, experiencing worsening relationships and working in primary care or allied health. Despite having low COVID-19 case numbers in rural Australian health services compared with metropolitan counterparts over the course of 2020, there were widespread mental health impacts on the workforce. Rural health services need specific and flexible training, education, work policies and practices that support psychological well-being now in preparedness for ongoing or future crises.","Tham, Pascoe, Willis, Kay, Smallwood","https://doi.org/10.1111/ajr.12873","20220505","COVID-19; health care workers; mental health; psychosocial stress; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31006,""
"Post-COVID-19 distress and unhealthy behavior","COVID-19 is one of the most devastating pandemics in history. It is important to understand post-COVID-19 mental health issues and unhealthy behaviors. Investigate whether and how distress levels and unhealthy behaviors might differ across population segments after the end of a nationwide COVID-19 outbreak. Using random sampling, this large-scale study analyzed post-COVID-19 distress and unhealthy behaviors of individuals in Wuhan <i>vs.</i> Beijing in China (which were differentially impacted by the pandemic). Higher percentages of individuals residing in Wuhan (<i>vs.</i> Beijing) experienced moderate or severe post-COVID-19 distress. Higher percentages of men (<i>vs.</i> women) experienced moderate distress. Larger percentages of people with (<i>vs.</i> without) children experienced a severe level of distress. Post-COVID-19, higher percentages of people decreased (<i>vs.</i> increased) smoking and drinking, but the opposite was true for unhealthy snacking. Importantly, higher post-COVID-19 distress predicted higher consumption in all three unhealthy domains.

"Fixating on the future: An overview of increased astrology use","Interest in astrology has surged recently, possibly due to the uncertain conditions in the world due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While belief in astrology is common and socially legitimized in many cultures, a few instances of excessive engagement with astrological services or ""fortune-telling addiction"" are indicating a risk of adverse mental health consequences. To understand the existing research base on correlates of belief in astrology and fortune-telling. Method: We have carried out a scoping review to synthesize the available literature base on belief in astrology and to review the evidence for ""fortune-telling addiction"" using Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework. Databases of PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCO, and SCOPUS were searched for relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals. The search findings revealed the association of belief in astrology with cognitive, personality, and psychological factors such as thinking style, self-concept verification, and stress. Case studies on ""fortune-telling addiction"" have conceptualized it as a possible behavioral addiction and have reported symptoms such as distress, cravings, and salience. However, further research on the condition along with its psychosocial determinants is necessary for the development of preventative and curative intervention efforts.","Das, Sharma, Kashyap, Gupta","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640221094155","20220505","Astrology; cognitive correlates; fortune-telling addiction; paranormal beliefs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31008,""
"The Role of Psychology in Media During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-National Study","Dealing with COVID-19 and with the preventative measures that have been taken to mitigate the transmission of the virus causing the pandemic has posed a great challenge to the population. While psychologists have expertise with regard to preventive behavior change and to dealing with the mental health impact of measures, their expertise needs to be effectively communicated to the public. Mass media play a critical role in times of crisis, in many cases being the only source of information. While most research focuses on the importance of information content as a factor affecting psychological responses to a collective traumatic event, the way information is framed in the media is likely to influence the way health professionals are perceived as trustworthy. This study aimed to analyze the media framing of information from psychology during the COVID-19 pandemic in six countries from America and Europe, identifying the most recurrent topics in the news (n news items = 541) related to psychology and mental health. In all six countries the media address the psychological needs of the population, which vary depending on the imposed restrictions. The news content is influenced by the scientific sources used by the media. While the most prevalent topics focus on psychological risk and the need to seek mental health care, the least prevalent topics relate to counseling and behavioral guidelines for managing the psychological consequences of the pandemic. The study findings provide insight into how psychological knowledge contributes to the understanding and mitigation of COVID-19 consequences in different countries and identified fields where psychologists were consulted to respond to a health emergency. They also show a preference to consult other experts when searching for contextual or more macro-social explanations of critical situation.","Caicedo-Moreno, Correa-Chica, LÃƒÂ³pez-LÃƒÂ³pez, Castro-Abril, Barreto, Rodriguez-Romero","https://doi.org/10.5334/pb.1054","20220505","COVID-19; Media, Topic Modeling; Psychology; Text Analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31009,""
"The clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of clozapine for inpatients with severe borderline personality disorder (CALMED study): a randomised placebo-controlled trial","Data from case series suggest that clozapine may benefit inpatients with borderline personality disorder (BPD), but randomised trials have not been conducted. Multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We aimed to recruit 222 inpatients with severe BPD aged 18 or over, who had failed to respond to other antipsychotic medications. We randomly allocated participants on a 1:1 ratio to receive up to 400 mg of clozapine per day or an inert placebo using a remote web-based randomisation service. The primary outcome was total score on the Zanarini Rating scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included self-harm, aggression, resource use and costs, side effects and adverse events. We used a modified intention to treat analysis (mITT) restricted to those who took one or more dose of trial medication, using a general linear model fitted at 6 months adjusted for baseline score, allocation group and site. The study closed early due to poor recruitment and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of 29 study participants, 24 (83%) were followed up at 6 months, of whom 21 (72%) were included in the mITT analysis. At 6 months, 11 (73%) participants assigned to clozapine and 6 (43%) of those assigned to placebo were still taking trial medication. Adjusted difference in mean total ZAN-BPD score at 6 months was -3.86 (95% Confidence IntervalsÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-10.04 to 2.32). There were 14 serious adverse events; 6 in the clozapine arm and 8 in the placebo arm of the trial. There was little difference in the cost of care between groups. We recruited insufficient participants to test the primary hypothesis. The study findings highlight problems in conducting placebo-controlled trials of clozapine and in using clozapine for people with BPD, outside specialist inpatient mental health units.

"Prevalence of postpartum depression and antenatal anxiety symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic: An observational prospective cohort study in Greece","A significant proportion of pregnant women and women in the early postpartum period suffer from mental health problems. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a unique stressor during this period and many studies across the world have shown elevated rates of postpartum depression (PPD). In this multicenter two-phase observational prospective cohort study, we aim to assess the prevalence of anxiety prior to labor (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), as well as PPD at 6-8 weeks postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Of the 330 women analyzed, 13.2% reported symptoms of depression using EPDS cut-off score Ã¢â€°Â¥13. High antenatal levels of anxiety (24.8% scored Ã¢â€°Â¥10 in GAD-7) were documented. A significant proportion of postpartum women reported a decrease in willingness to attend antenatal education courses (36%) and fewer antenatal visits to their obstetrician (34%) due to pandemic. Higher antenatal anxiety increased the odds of being depressed at 6-8 weeks postpartum (EPDS Ã¢â€°Â¥13). Compared to reported prevalence of PPD from previous studies before the COVID-19 era in Greece, we did not find elevated rates during the first wave of the pandemic. High anxiety levels were observed indicating that there is a need for close monitoring in pregnancy during the pandemic and anxiety screening to identify women who need support in the pandemic era. A well-planned maternity program should be employed by all the associated care providers to maintain the proper antenatal care adjusted to the pandemic strains as well as a follow-up after labor.","Micha, Hyphantis, Staikou, Valsamidis, Arnaoutoglou, Tzimas, Vlahos, Daponte, Grypiotis, Pappa, Evangelaki, Apostolidou, Paschos, Varvarousi, Bareka, Izountouemoi, Tsonis, Koullourou, Kalopita, Kotsis","https://doi.org/10.18332/ejm/146233","20220505","COVID-19; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS); anxiety; postpartum depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31011,""
"Adaptability Protects University Students From Anxiety, Depression, and Insomnia During Remote Learning: A Three-Wave Longitudinal Study From China","The longitudinal relationship between students' pre-existing adaptability and subsequent sleep and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic has not been studied. The present study examines the relationship between adaptability and students' anxiety, depression, and insomnia during and after the lockdown related to COVID-19. 5,235 university students participated in a longitudinal study with three time points. Students completed the Adaptability Scale before the outbreak (October 2019; Time 1), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) both during (April 2020; Time 2) and after lockdown (March 2021; Time 3), the Anxiety and Depression subscales of the SCL-90 (at Time 1 and 3), and the SAS/SDS (at Time 2). The results showed that self-reported adaptability is significantly negatively correlated with anxiety and depression, and that anxiety and depression are positively correlated with insomnia. Furthermore, adaptability protects from insomnia both directly and through its negative relationship with anxiety and depression. This study sheds light on the internal mechanisms mediating the relationship between students' adaptability and experience of insomnia in challenging circumstances. Implications for curtailing the negative effects of stressful events on students' sleep health by improving their adaptability and reducing their anxiety and depression are discussed.","Zhang, Mi, Parks-Stamm, Cao, Ji, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.868072","20220505","COVID-19; adaptability; anxiety; depression; insomnia; remote learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31012,""

"Memory impairment and concentration problems in COVID-19 survivors eight weeks after non-ICU hospitalization: a retrospective cohort study","Studies on the SARS-CoV-1 have shown long term effects on health, rehabilitation and quality of life in patients. To evaluate effects on recovery and mental health in COVID-19 survivors METHODS: A single centre, retrospective cohort study in (non ICU admitted) adult patients with COVID-19 infection was conducted. Next to baseline characteristics during hospital admission, data on remaining symptoms and radiographic abnormalities were extracted at the 8-week follow-up at the outpatient clinic. The HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) was used to detect anxiety and depression. 211 patients were included, median age 63 years, 61% male, with overweight (average BMI 28.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ). At the outpatient clinic 13% of the patients were symptom free, whereas 25% reported more than three symptoms. Persisting physical symptoms were mainly fatigue 68%, dyspnea 56% and cough 26%. Most patients had normalisation of chest X-ray (61.1%) and oxygen saturation (89.9%). Interestingly, 33% reported memory impairment and concentration problems 28%. 7.8% scored for anxiety and 7.1% for depression on the HADS. Correlations were found between the number of physical symptoms and scores on the HADS. Only 13% had symptom free recovery after 8 weeks. Besides physical symptoms memory problems were frequently seen. The number of mental and physical symptoms were correlated. This article is protected by copyright.

"The COV-ED Survey: exploring the impact of learning and teaching from home on parent/carers' and teachers' mental health and wellbeing during COVID-19 lockdown","Following the emergence of COVID-19 in the UK, on March 18<sup>th</sup> 2020 the majority of schools in England closed and families and teachers were tasked with providing educational support for children and adolescents within the home environment. Little is known, however, regarding the impact of remote teaching and learning on the mental wellbeing of parents/carers and teaching staff. The Coronavirus Education (COV-ED) online survey explored the practicalities of learning and teaching from home for 329 parents/carers and 117 teachers of 11-15Ã‚Â year old adolescents in England, during June/July 2020, and the associated impact on their mental wellbeing. Participants were recruited through schools and via University of Warwick social media channels. Data was analysed using a series of Multiple Linear and Multivariate Regressions. Despite coping well with the challenges of remote learning, a third of teachers reported below average mental wellbeing on the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. Multivariate regression revealed that wellbeing was associated with access to resources and confidence to teach from home. Almost half of parents/carers surveyed reported below average wellbeing. Multivariate regression revealed that poor wellbeing was more common in those who were also working from home and who lacked support for their own mental health. Concerns about their child's mental health and lack of access to electronic devices and workspace were also significantly associated with the mental wellbeing of parents/carers. Whilst young people's mental health and wellbeing has, and continues to be a national priority, the mental health and wellbeing of the families and teachers supporting them has not previously been explored. Our survey population was of predominantly white British heritage, female and living in the West Midlands UK, therefore, findings should be treated with caution. Findings provide a snapshot of factors that may be of significance to families and schools in supporting the mental wellbeing of those tasked with learning from home. They will help i) increase knowledge and awareness with regard to future support of families and teachers during similar crises; ii) enable the design and development of practical solutions in the delivery of remote teaching and learning; and, iii) help address the mental wellbeing needs of those tasked with supporting adolescents.","Connor, De Valliere, Warwick, Stewart-Brown, Thompson","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13305-7","20220505","COVID; Emotional wellbeing; Families; Learning; Lockdown; Mental health; Parents/carers; Teachers; Teaching","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31015,""
"""I'm making a positive change in my life"": a mixed method evaluation of a well-being tertiary education unit","Mental health disorders (MHDs) are prevalent among university students with detrimental impacts for individual students, universities and the wider community. There is urgent need for proactive and preventative strategies to address the mental health crisis in the university population. This study evaluated the efficacy of a 13-week unit developed to directly educate university students about ways to improve and maintain well-being. Fifty-eight university students from five disciplines participated in a 13-week elective undergraduate unit ""Well-Being Fundamentals for Success"" as part of their degree. The Act Belong Commit mental health promotion campaign framework formed the basis of teaching materials. Outcome well-being measures were self-assessed at weeks 1, 6 and 12 using four scales: 1) Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS); 2) Perceived Stress Scale (PSS); 3) Brief Resilience Scale (BRS); and 4) Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). Post-unit group interviews (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 11) were analysed for key themes. Linear mixed models demonstrated a significant improvement in BRS over the semester; well-being (WEMBS) and mindful attention (MAAS) did increase but not significantly. There was a significant increase in stress (PSS) over the semester. Key themes that emerged from the group interviews were that 1) University life contributes to well-being; 2) University life contributes to stress; 3) The well-being unit helped students see and do things differently; 4) An overall endorsement of the unit. University students' resilience increased over the semester following participation in curriculum focused on well-being which featured a combination of theoretical content and experiential workshops.","Piggott, Chivers, Bulsara, Conlon, Grigg, Harris, Lambert, Millar, Pollard","https://doi.org/10.1002/hpja.613","20220503","Act Belong Commit; COVID-19; tertiary education; university students; well-being; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31016,""

"Social activity promotes resilience against loneliness in depressed individuals: a study over 14-days of physical isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia","Loneliness is a subjectively perceived state of social isolation that is associated with negative emotional, cognitive, and physical health outcomes. Physical distancing and shelter-in-place public health responses designed to curb COVID-19 transmission has led to concerns over elevated risk of loneliness. Given that physical isolation does not necessitate social isolation in the age of digital communication, this study investigated the relationship between the frequency of social interaction and loneliness over a two-week period in people engaging in physical distancing and examined whether this relationship was moderated by physical isolation level, age, or depression. A self-selected sample of NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°469 individuals across Australia who were engaged in physically distanced living completed daily surveys for 14-days during April to June of 2020. Multilevel modelling showed that more frequent social interaction with close, but not intermediate or distant contacts, was uniquely associated with lower loneliness. In addition, being younger, more depressed, more anxious, or having a mental health condition diagnosis (past or present) were also independently associated with higher loneliness. Critically, depression was the only significant moderator of the relationship between social interaction and loneliness over time, where more frequent social interaction with close contacts buffered against loneliness over time in high depression individuals only. The findings suggest that encouraging social activity with close contacts may promote resilience against loneliness in individuals with elevated depression symptoms.","Ji, Basanovic, MacLeod","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11315-4","20220505","COVID-19; Humans; Loneliness; Pandemics; Social Behavior; Social Isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31018,""

"Sleep health and the circadian rest-activity pattern four months after COVID-19","To describe the prevalence and severity of sleep disorders and circadian alterations in COVID-19 patients four months after the acute phase of the disease. This was a cross-sectional observational prospective study of patients with mild COVID-19, moderate COVID-19 (requiring hospitalization but no mechanical ventilation), or severe COVID-19 (with ARDS) four months after the acute phase of the disease. All patients underwent a home sleep apnea test and seven-day wrist actigraphy, as well as completing questionnaires to assess sleep quality and mental health. Differences among the three groups of patients were evaluated by ANOVA and the chi-square test. A total of 60 patients were included in the study. Of those, 17 were in the mild COVID-19 group, 18 were in the moderate COVID-19 group, and 25 were in the severe COVID-19 group. Sleep quality, as assessed by satisfaction, alertness, timing, efficiency, and duration scale scores, was found to be impaired in all three groups, which also had a high prevalence of unhealthy sleep, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The prevalence of insomnia was increased in all three groups, as assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index. The home sleep apnea test showed that the overall prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea was 60%, and seven-day wrist actigraphy showed that total sleep time was &lt; 7 h in all three groups. Changes in quality of life and in the circadian rest-activity pattern were observed in all three groups.

To assess the incidence of multimorbidity and its associated factors among adults living in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Cohort study conducted in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. We included data from the two waves of the Prospective Study About Mental and Physical Health (PAMPA). Data were collected via online questionnaires between June and July 2020 (wave 1) and between December 2020 and January 2021 (wave 2). Multimorbidity was defined as the presence of two or more diagnosed medical conditions. In total, 516 individuals were included, among whom 27.1% (95% confidence interval, CI: 23.5-31.1) developed multimorbidity from wave 1 to 2.

"The Courage to Continue: Healthcare Social Worker's Resilience During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated disparities in access to healthcare and mental health, often forcing healthcare social workers into ethical and moral dilemmas as they endeavor to provide equitable, humanistic care to their patients and caregivers. The purpose of this mixed method study was to explore how COVID-19-related personal and professional grief and losses impacted healthcare social worker's distress and resilience. Participants were recruited through healthcare social work professional organizations from September-November 2020. Participants (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°246) completed an online survey capturing sociodemographic variables, as well as mental distress, pandemic-related meaning-making, and resilience. Data analysis included correlations and regressions pertaining to meaning-making, emotional distress, and resilience, as well as thematic analysis of participants' open-ended survey responses. Approximately one-third of participants reported emotional distress and difficulty in finding meaning from their pandemic-related losses. Participants reported a lower level of resilience when compared with the United States general population. Three themes emerged from social workers' qualitative responses: <i>the hardest year of my career; the collective loss of our normal;</i> and <i>we were built for this</i>. Pandemic-related grief permeates social workers' daily lives; yet their training and resilience foster hope to positively impact their clients, communities, and families.","Currin-McCulloch, Chen, Kaushik, Sparks, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1080/15524256.2022.2070330","20220504","COVID-19; distress; grief; health social work; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31025,""
"Users' satisfaction levels about mHealth applications in post-Covid-19 times in Saudi Arabia","This study aims to investigate the users' satisfaction levels about mHealth applications and their intentions to use them in future (in post-Covid-19 times) in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional survey design was adopted in this study. The mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ)22 was used in this study. An online version of the survey was created using Google Surveys, and a link for the survey was generated. As the objective of this study is to assess the users' satisfaction levels about mHealth applications and their intentions to use them in future (in post-Covid-19 times) in Saudi Arabia, all individuals who used or using mHealth applications will be included in this study. At the end of the survey time period, 318 responses were received. Items including 'easy to learn using the app' (mean rating = 3.9), 'easy to find information on the application'(mean rating = 3.9), 'interface of the app' (mean rating = 3.8) were rated to be highly effective by the participants.). However, ability to recover from mistakes while using the applications (mean rating = 2.9), inconsistency in navigation (mean rating = 2.9), and lack of all necessary functions (mean rating = 2.3) were few issues identified. No statistically significant difference of opinions was observed in relation to all sub-scales of usability factor. Although the satisfaction levels are good with respect to mHealth applications, the sudden rise in the mHealth users can be partly linked to the several psychological issues such as anxiety and depression among people and also because of restricted access during the pandemic.","Alanzi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267002","20220505","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31026,""
"'Unheard,' 'uncared for' and 'unsupported': The mental health impact of Covid -19 on healthcare workers in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa","As a direct consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, due to being exposed to chronic and multiple sources of psychological stress, healthcare workers constitute a vulnerable population. Despite the potential impact of Covid-19 on their psychological and physical health, insufficient attention has been given to their mental well-being. The primary objective of this study was to measure and understand this psychological impact on public sector doctors and nurses in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. The secondary objective was to ascertain their perceptions of psychosocial support, specific to Covid-19, within the workplace. This cross-sectional electronic survey was conducted from August to October 2020, following the first surge of the pandemic in the country, and included 312 participants. Depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were assessed with the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 item and post-traumatic stress was measured by the Impact of Events Scale-Revised version. Measures of employer support were assessed using an adapted closed-ended questionnaire. The participants' mean age was 36.6Ã‚Â± 9.3 years with three quarters being male (n = 234, 75.0%) and predominantly (n = 214, 72.3%) medical doctors. Numbers of participants with depression, anxiety and stress were 121 (51.5%), 111 (47.2%) and 104 (44.3%) respectively, with 38 (16.2%), 50 (21.3%) and 38 (16.2%) in the combined severe/extremely severe range, respectively. On the Impact of Events Scale-Revised, 34 (13.7%) participants were in the severe range. Subjectively, 63.0% felt that their concerns were not 'heard', 75.1% did not feel 'cared for' and 81.1% and 74.0% did not feel 'physically' or 'psychologically' supported, respectively. High levels of depression, anxiety, stress and traumatic stress, combined with poor perceptions of employer support, highlight the need to identify and address the psychosocial support needs and expectations of healthcare workers for the duration of the pandemic, as well as for the mental health sequelae post-pandemic.","Dawood, Tomita, Ramlall","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266008","20220505","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31027,""
"Impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the psychological status and cortisol level of multiple sclerosis patients","This study aimed to compare the changes in psychological status and cortisol level between multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and a healthy control group (HC). One hundred and fifty-five MS patients and 165 HC subjects had completed questionnaires consisting of 36-Item short health survey (SF-36), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and fatigue severity score (FSS) before and after (one year from onset) COVID-19 pandemic. The salivary cortisol level was also measured again in 26 MS patients and 14 control individuals. MS patients had lower scores of mental and physical components of quality of life (MCS and PCS), but higher HAM-A, FSS, and BDII scores than HC Before and after COVID-19. There were significant changes in scores of MCS, BDI-II, HAM-A, and FSS after the COVID-19 outbreak in MS patients, but not in PCS score. In HC group, we observed significant changes in scores of MCS, BDI-II, and FSS, but not in scores of PCS and HAM-A. Compared to HC, the MS patients reported greater deterioration in the overall mental health component of their health-related quality of life, and their levels of anxiety and fatigue over the study period. The change of cortisol levels was non-significant with a small effect size.","Hatef, Pirzad Jahromi, Meftahi, Shaygan, Ghalavand","https://doi.org/10.1080/09602011.2022.2069825","20220504","Coronavirus disease; Cortisol; Mental health; Multiple sclerosis; Psychological status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31028,""
"Inequalities in mental health, self-rated health, and social support among sexual minority young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: analyses from the UK Millennium Cohort Study","Young adults who self-identify as a sexual minority may have been particularly harmed by the consequences of lockdown, closure of educational institutions, and social distancing measures as they are likely to have been confined in households that may not be supportive of their sexual orientation. We examine inequalities in the mental health and self-rated health of sexual minority young adults, compared to their heterosexual peers, at the height of lockdown restrictions in the UK. We analysed data from singletons who participated in waves 6, 7, and the wave 1 COVID-19 survey (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2211) of the Millennium Cohort Study, a nationally representative longitudinal study of infants born in the UK between September 2000 and January 2002. Regression models compared the mental health, self-rated health, and social support of sexual minority young adults to that of their heterosexual peers. One in four young adults self-identified with a sexual orientation or attraction other than completely heterosexual. Sexual minority young adults had significantly lower levels of social support (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.38, SE 0.08), poorer self-rated health (OR 3.91, 95% CI 2.41-6.34), and higher levels of psychological distress (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.26, SE 0.34), anxiety (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.40, SE 0.15), and loneliness (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.66, SE 0.18) when compared to heterosexual young adults. Sexual minority young adults in the UK have been detrimentally impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, experiencing inequalities in mental health, self-rated health, and social support when compared to heterosexual young adults. Implications for policy and practice include a stronger provision of safe spaces in the community and in institutions, and policies that address marginalisation and harassment.","BÃƒÂ©cares, Kneale","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02291-1","20220504","Coronavirus pandemic; Mental health; Self-rated health; Sexual minority; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31029,""
"Psychological distress of cancer patients caused by treatment delay during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: A cross-sectional study","The currents study sought to explore the impact of treatment delay on the mental health for patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Travel restrictions were imposed in most areas of the country between January 23<sup>th</sup> , 2020 and February 25<sup>th</sup> , 2020 owing to the COVID-19 epidemic. Travel restrictions were lifted from February 26<sup>th</sup> , 2020 to March 12<sup>th</sup> , 2020. The number of new confirmed cases significantly reduced after March 12<sup>th</sup> , 2020. Study participants, comprised of individuals from three distinct groups: (1) 835 cancer patients who attended Zhejiang Cancer Hospital between February 26<sup>th</sup> , 2020 and March 12<sup>th</sup> , 2020; (2) 185 healthy volunteers recruited between February 26<sup>th</sup> , 2020 and March 12<sup>th</sup> , 2020; (3) 168 cancer patients who attended the hospital during the non-epidemic period (after March 12<sup>th</sup> , 2020). Two outcome measures including patients' posttraumatic stress responses and general psychological distress (GPD) were assessed using the Chinese versions of the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Treatment delay was assessed via counting the time interval from diagnosis to treatment initiation, or from planned treatment date to actual date of therapy. Communication satisfaction was evaluated via a self-report questionnaire. An independent sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for comparison. Statistical analysis included Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test and multivariate logistic regression. All 1188 participants (835 patients with cancer and 185 controls during the outbreak, and 168 patients with cancer during the non-epidemic period) completed and submitted the questionnaires. A positive association was observed between treatment delays and increased GPD levels (OR 1.716; 95% CI 1.254-2.348; p = 0.001) as well as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (OR: 1.545, 95% CI: (1.166-2.047), p = 0.002). Patients who reported good communication with their doctors showed a significantly lower risk of GPD (OR: 0.526, 95% CI (0.348-0.794), p = 0.002) and PTSD (OR: 0.683, 95% CI (0.490-0.951), p = 0.024) compared with patients who reported unsatisfactory communication or had no contact with their doctors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that treatment at a local hospital, treatment delays and unsatisfactory or no communication with cancer-care professionals were significantly correlated with severe GPD and PTSD symptoms of patients (all pÃ¢â€°Â¤0.05). The findings indicate that cancer patients who underwent treatment delays during the COVID-19 pandemic may become vulnerable to psychological distress . The results showed that effective communication with doctors and cancer-care professionals during outbreak significantly reduces GPD levels and PTSD symptoms. This article is protected by copyright.

"The prevalence of mental distress changes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a study on physicians in Turkey","The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect the physicians' mental health differently. This study aimed to investigate the degree of changes in mental distress in physicians through two cross-sectional studies before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and explore factors associated with the change of mental distress status of participants between two-time periods. This cross-sectional, web-based survey collected demographic data and mental health measurements with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire from 416 and 522 physicians before and during COVID-19, respectively. Mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the factors associated with the change of mental distress status. During the outbreak, a total of 319 of the 522 participants reported a clinically significant level of mental distress compared with 123 of 416 participants before COVID-19. Higher levels of mental distress were observed in all socio-demographic groups during COVID-19 compared with before, with more than two-fold higher prevalence of mental health deterioration in general. This study suggests a significant deterioration in mental health status after the occurrence of COVID-19 compared with before. The mental health of physicians working in all medical specialty groups, especially those in internal and surgical specialties, may require special attention.","DurmuÃ…Å¸","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2022.2069704","20220504","COVID-19; Mental health; Turkey; coronavirus; physicians","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31031,""

"Editorial Perspective: Rapid responses to understand and address children and young people's mental health in the context of COVID-19","Prior to the pandemic, we already had good reason to be concerned about the mental health of children and young people. As an example, the 2017 Mental Health of Children and Young People (MHCYP) survey in England, comprising a large, national probability sample, identified that one in nine children had a probable mental health disorder, with a 49% increase in emotional disorders compared to a previous survey in 2004 (Sadler etÃ‚Â al., 2018). The pandemic has clearly brought a broad range of challenges to children and young people. These include the direct viral threat to self, friends, and family (with recent estimates of a 17.5%-20.2% increase in parental bereavement in the United States; Kidman etÃ‚Â al, 2021), as well as disruptions to school work, social interactions, family pressures, economic impacts, a lack of opportunity and ongoing uncertainty, and reduced access to mental health and other support from outside the home.

"Mental health outcomes and risk factors among female physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic","The fast spread of the COVID-19 pandemic brought a huge workload burden. Health care workers have become a particular risk group for developing mental health symptoms, with women being the most affected group according to preliminary data. The aim of this study was to provide information about the prevalence of depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in female physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic and describe risk factors associated with them. Using a cross-sectional design, we applied an online questionnaire to 303 female physicians inquiring about COVID-19 changes in their social and professional dynamics. To assess the presence of depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, the participants responded the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). The prevalence for depression, anxiety, sleep quality disturbances and PTSD symptoms was 72.6%, 64.3%, 77.8%, and 19.4% respectively. The main risk factor associated with every outcome was having a previous history of any mental health disorder. Younger age and being at the frontline for COVID-19 attention were relevant to depression symptoms. Our results were in agreement with previous studies, confirming the need for specific age-tailored mental health interventions in female physicians, especially those with previous diagnoses of mental health disorders.","LeÃƒÂ³n Rojas, Castorena Torres, Garza Ornelas, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-de-Ita","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09325","20220504","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Sleep; Women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31034,""
"Multivariate profile and acute-phase correlates of cognitive deficits in a COVID-19 hospitalised cohort","Preliminary evidence has highlighted a possible association between severe COVID-19 and persistent cognitive deficits. Further research is required to confirm this association, determine whether cognitive deficits relate to clinical features from the acute phase or to mental health status at the point of assessment, and quantify rate of recovery. 46 individuals who received critical care for COVID-19 at Addenbrooke's hospital between 10th March 2020 and 31st July 2020 (16 mechanically ventilated) underwent detailed computerised cognitive assessment alongside scales measuring anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder under supervised conditions at a mean follow up of 6.0 (Ã‚Â± 2.1) months following acute illness. Patient and matched control (<i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 460) performances were transformed into standard deviation from expected scores, accounting for age and demographic factors using <i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 66,008 normative datasets. Global accuracy and response time composites were calculated (G_SScore &amp; G_RT). Linear modelling predicted composite score deficits from acute severity, mental-health status at assessment, and time from hospital admission. The pattern of deficits across tasks was qualitatively compared with normal age-related decline, and early-stage dementia. COVID-19 survivors were less accurate (G_SScore=-0.53SDs) and slower (G_RT=+0.89SDs) in their responses than expected compared to their matched controls. Acute illness, but not chronic mental health, significantly predicted cognitive deviation from expected scores (G_SScore (<i>p</i>=Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹0.0037) and G_RT (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.0366)). The most prominent task associations with COVID-19 were for higher cognition and processing speed, which was qualitatively distinct from the profiles of normal ageing and dementia and similar in magnitude to the effects of ageing between 50 and 70 years of age. A trend towards reduced deficits with time from illness (rÃ¢Ë†Â¼=0.15) did not reach statistical significance. Cognitive deficits after severe COVID-19 relate most strongly to acute illness severity, persist long into the chronic phase, and recover slowly if at all, with a characteristic profile highlighting higher cognitive functions and processing speed.

"Exploring subtypes and correlates of internet gaming disorder severity among adolescents during COVID-19 in China: A latent class analysis","The WHO recently included Gaming Disorder as a psychiatric diagnosis. Whether there are distinct groups of adolescents who differ based on severity of gaming disorder and their relationships with other mental health and addictive behavior outcomes, including problematic smartphone use (PSU), remains unclear. The current study explored and identified subtypes of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) severity and estimated the association between these subtypes and other disorders. Participants completed online questionnaires assessing the severity of IGD, PSU, depression, and anxiety during COVID-19. We conducted a latent class analysis of IGD symptoms among 1,305 Chinese adolescents (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.2; maleÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°58.5%) from 11 secondary schools in Macao (SAR), China. Multinomial logistic regression estimated correlates of latent class membership and PSU. A 4-class model adequately described the sample subgroups. Classes were labeled as normative gamers (30.9%), occasional gamers (42.4%), problematic gamers (22.7%), and addictive gamers (4.1%). Relative to normative gamers, PSU severity, depression, and being male were significantly higher among problematic gamers, addictive gamers, and occasional gamers. Only problematic gamers showed significant positive associations with anxiety severity compared to the other groups. The study revealed the differences in severity of gaming disorder and its association with psychopathology outcomes. Application in screening for IGD and comorbidity is discussed.

The first group is those with prior experience in an ICE environment (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯17; 7F/10Ã¢â‚¬Â¯M), the second is those aged 30-55 with a master's or doctoral degree or ""astronaut-like"" (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯22; 10F/12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯M), and the third is the general population (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯43; 27F/16Ã¢â‚¬Â¯M). Linear mixed models were used for statistical analysis of the results, given the unequal sample sizes. The experienced group did not show healthier mental health scores than the astronaut-like group, but both groups displayed higher scores than the general population. However, work productivity scores for the experienced group were higher on average than the other two groups. Results suggest that prior experience in ICE may improve the capability to maintain productivity-corresponding to the idea of resilience. However, experience may not improve mental health maintenance, suggesting that other approaches are needed to prepare astronauts for the mental health stressors of long-duration exploration missions.","Arquilla, Webb, Anderson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2022.04.026","20220504","Confined; Extreme (ICE) environments; Isolated; Resilience; Space analog; Spaceflight psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31038,""
"Physical activity and emotions in a period of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic","Social distancing (SD) to prevent SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) transmission reduced practices of physical activities (PA) and changed emotional conditions, but the relationship between PA and the emotions has to be further studied. This study aimed to analyze PA and the intensity of basic emotions during a period of social distancing in the State of SÃƒÂ£o Paulo, Brazil. Data collection was performed using the snowball system and an online survey with questions about the minimum weekly frequency of 30-min moderate and/or vigorous activities (MVPA), intensity of basic emotions, and sociodemographic profile. A total of 704 volunteers participated; mean age 38.1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯13.4 years, 67.9% female, 82.0% insufficiently practiced MVPA, and 37.9% of the group reported no weekly PA. Anxiety/fear was the emotion with the highest intensity in the study period. A significant association was observed between PA and intensity of happiness (rhoÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.125; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.01) and a negative association between PA practice and intensity of anxiety/fear (rhoÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.090; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.05), sadness (rhoÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.134; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.01), and anger (rhoÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.109; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.01). Also, an association was observed between anxiety/fear and social isolation (rhoÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.082; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.05). These results suggest that public policies offering PA programs and psychological care are required to improve the quality of life of the population.","CorrÃƒÂªa, Velho, do Prado Calazans, Camargo, Tolocka","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smhs.2022.04.004","20220504","Emotions expressed; Physical activity; Quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-06","",31039,""
