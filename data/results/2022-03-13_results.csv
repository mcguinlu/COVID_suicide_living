"EMS prehospital response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the US: A brief literature review","This study aimed to analyze prehospital Emergency Medical Services (EMS) response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the US through a brief systematic review of available literature in context with international prehospital counterparts. An exploration of the NCBI repository was performed using a search string of relevant keywords which returned n=5128 results; articles that met the inclusion criteria (n=77) were reviewed and analyzed in accordance with PRISMA and PROSPERO recommendations. Methodical quality was assessed using critical appraisal tools, and the Eggers test was used for risk of bias reduction upon linear regression analysis of a funnel plot. Sources of heterogeneity as defined by P < 0.10 or I^2 > 50% were interrogated. Findings were considered within ten domains: structural/systemic; clinical outcomes; clinical assessment; treatment; special populations; dispatch/activation; education; mental health; perspectives/experiences; and transport. Findings suggest, EMS clinicians have likely made significant and unmeasured contributions to care during the pandemic via nontraditional roles, i.e., COVID-19 testing and vaccine deployment. EMS plays a critical role in counteracting the COVID-19 pandemic in addition to the worsening opioid epidemic, both of which disproportionately impact patients of color. As such, being uniquely influential on clinical outcomes, these providers may benefit from standardized education on care and access disparities such as racial identity. Access to distance learning continuing education opportunities may increase rates of provider recertification. Additionally, there is a high prevalence of vaccine hesitancy among surveyed nationally registered EMS providers. Continued rigorous investigation on the impact of COVID-19 on EMS systems and personnel is warranted to ensure informed preparation for future pandemic and infectious disease response.","Christian Angelo I Ventura; Edward Eliseus Denton; Jessica A David; Brianna J Schoenfelder; Lillian Mela; Rebecca P Lumia; Rachel B Rudi; Barnita Haldar","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.10.22272236","20220313","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-13","",28416,""
"Prevalence and Predictors of Depression, Anxiety and Stress among Elderly in the aftermath of COVID-19: A Quantitative Study from Central India","Background Elderly persons have been more prone to depression, anxiety and stress during COVID-19 pandemic. They need more care and support towards mental health during these difficult times. Methodology This was a cross-sectional and quantitative study conducted in the state of Madhya Pradesh, during the month of March 2021 to August 2021. Participants were recruited from a population aged more than 60 years, those who were able to read and write Hindi or English or having at least one family member; reporting to a tertiary care teaching hospital during the second wave of COVID-19 in India. Those who were confirmed COVID-19 cases & undergoing treatment, with diagnosed mental health disorders and who didnot give consent were excluded. A semi-structured questionnaire along with DASS-21 scale was completed by participants online. Results Out of 690 subjects, 7{middle dot}25 percent had mild and moderate depression, 0{middle dot}58percent had severe and extremely severe depression. Mild and moderate anxiety symptoms were reported by 9{middle dot}56percent, 2{middle dot}46percent reported severe and extremely severe anxiety. Mild and moderate stress was reported by 4{middle dot}78percent, while 0{middle dot}42percent were severely and extremely stressed. A positive statistical association was found between alcohol addiction and depression (p=0{middle dot}028). The elderly subjects had a nap the day time were significantly less depressed during COVID-19 pandemic (p=0{middle dot}033). It was found that older the subjects, more were they anxious during the pandemic (p=0{middle dot}042). An association was found between alcohol addiction and stress (p=0{middle dot}043). Conclusions Depressive symptoms in participants were positively correlated with alcohol addiction. Females reported higher level of stress. There is a felt need to formulate psychological interventions for elderly to improve their mental health and psychological resilience. We need to tackle and fight the stigma, fear and anxiety related to the COVID-19, which is greater than disease itself.","Varun Malhotra; Danish Javed; Rajay Bharshankar; Vijender Singh; Namita Gautam; Shweta Mishra; Digpal Chundawat; Anuradha Kushwah; Gyanendra Singh","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.10.22272024","20220312","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-13","",28417,""
"Long COVID and its associated factors among COVID survivors in the community from a middle-income country: an online cross-sectional study","Introduction: Patients with COVID-19 usually recover and return to normal health, however some patients may have symptoms that last for weeks or even months after recovery. This persistent state of ill health is known as Long COVID if it continues for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. Long Covid has been overlooked in low and middle income countries. Therefore, we conducted an online survey among the COVID-19 survivors in the community to explore their Long COVID symptoms, factors associated with Long COVID and how Long COVID affected their work. Methods: This was a cross sectional study conducted from July to September 2021, during the implementation of a nationwide movement control order (MCO). Data was collected using the REDCap electronic data capture tool. The questionnaire was distributed in social and news media. The questionnaire covers information such as socio-demographic characteristics, existing comorbidities, self-perception on health, information on the acute COVID-19 condition and treatment received, symptoms and duration of post-COVID condition and effects on occupation. Results: A total of 732 COVID-19 survivors responded. There were slightly more females (58.7%), younger and more highly educated respondents. More than half of them were overweight or obese and about two third were free of comorbidities. Among these respondents, about 56% were without or with mild symptoms during their acute COVID-19 conditions. A total of 21.1% of the respondents reported to experience Long COVID. The most commonly reported symptoms for Long COVID were fatigue, brain fog, depression, anxiety, insomnia, arthralgia or myalgia. Females had 58% higher odds (95% CI: 1.02, 2.45) of experiencing Long COVID. Patients with moderate and severe levels of acute COVID-19 symptoms had OR of 3.01 (95% CI: 1.21, 7.47) and 3.62 (95% CI: 1.31, 10.03) respectively for Long COVID. Conclusion: This study provides additional insight on the symptoms and duration of post-COVID symptoms as well as the associated factors with Long COVID among COVID-19 survivors in Malaysia. Recognition of Long COVID and its associated factors is important in planning prevention, rehabilitation, clinical management to improve recovery and long-term COVID-19 outcomes.","Foong Ming Moy; Noran Naqiah Hairi; Eugene Ri Jian Lim; Awang Bulgiba","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.09.22272168","20220312","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-13","",28418,""
