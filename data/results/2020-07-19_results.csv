"Factors related to mental health of inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","To evaluate the mental health status of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to explore the related factors. This was a cross-sectional survey among COVID-19 inpatients in two isolation wards of a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from March 7, 2020, to March 24, 2020. Participants' demographic data, clinical data and levels of circulating inflammatory markers were collated. Mental health symptoms were evaluated with questionnaires, which included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and questions about patients' self-perceived illness severity. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to explore factors that associated with mental symptoms, and a structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the possible relationships between those factors and the patients' mental health. Among the 85 participants, 45.9% had symptoms of depression (PHQ-9Ã¢â€°Â¥5), 38.8% had anxiety (GAD-7Ã¢â€°Â¥5), and 54.1% had insomnia (ISIÃ¢â€°Â¥8). According to multivariate regression analysis, female sex, a higher level of interleukin (AL)-1ÃŽÂ² and greater self-perceived illness severity were all significantly associated with a higher PHQ-9 score, higher GAD-7 score and higher ISI score. In addition, the disease duration and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were positively related to patients' self-perceived illness severity. The results of the SEM analyses suggested that sex (ÃŽÂ²=0.313, P&lt;0.001), self-perceived illness severity (ÃŽÂ²=0.411, P&lt;0.001) and levels of inflammatory markers (ÃŽÂ²=0.358, P=0.002) had direct effects on patients' mental health. The disease duration (ÃŽÂ²=0.163, P=0.003) and levels of inflammatory markers (ÃŽÂ²=0.101, P=0.016) also indirectly affected patients' mental health, with self-perceived illness severity acting as a mediator. A majority of COVID-19 infected inpatients reported experiencing mental health disturbances. Female sex, disease duration, levels of inflammatory markers and self-perceived illness severity are factors that could be used to predict the severity of patients' mental symptoms.","Hu, Chen, Zheng, You, Tan, Hu, Zhang, Ding","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.016","20200718","COVID-19; hospitalization; inflammatory markers; mental health; patients","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-19","",3212,""
"Implementing COVID-19 Mitigation in the Community Mental Health Setting: March 2020 and Lessons Learned","In March 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, state-funded community mental health service programs (CMHSP) in Michigan, organized into 10 regions known as a &quot;Prepaid Inpatient Health Plan&quot; (PIHP), grappled with the task of developing a modified plan of operations, while complying with mitigation and social distancing guidelines. With the premise that psychiatric care is essential healthcare, a panel of physician and non-physician leaders representing Region 5, met and developed recommendations, and feedback iteratively, using an adaptive modified Delphi methodology. This facilitated the development of a service and patient prioritization document to triage and to deliver behavioral health services in 21 counties which comprised Region 5 PIHP. Our procedures were organized around the principles of mitigation and contingency management, like physical health service delivery paradigms. The purpose of this manuscript is to share region 5 PIHP's response; a process which has allowed continuity of care during these unprecedented times.","Alavi, Haque, Felzer-Kim, Lewicki, Haque, Mormann","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-020-00677-6","20200718","Behavioral health; COVID; COVID-19; Community mental health; Community mental health and covid-19; Coronavirus; Mental and physical comorbidities and covid-19; Mental health; Psychiatry; Telehealth guidelines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-19","",3213,""
"Identifying Moral Injury in Healthcare Professionals: The Moral Injury Symptom Scale-HP","ThisÃ‚Â study aims to develop and assess the psychometric properties of a measure of moral injury (MI) symptoms for identifying clinically significant MI in health professionals (HPs), one that might be useful in the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. A total of 181 HPs (71% physicians) were recruited from Duke University Health Systems in Durham, North Carolina. Internal reliability of the Moral Injury Symptom Scale-Healthcare Professionals version (MISS-HP) was examined, along with factor analytic, discriminant, and convergent validity. A cutoff score was identified from a receiver operator curve (ROC) that best identified individuals with significant impairment in social or occupational functioning. The 10-item MISS-HP measuresÃ‚Â 10 theoretically grounded dimensions of MI assessing betrayal, guilt, shame, moral concerns, religious struggle, loss of religious/spiritual faith, loss of meaning/purpose, difficulty forgiving, loss of trust, and self-condemnation (score range 10-100). Internal reliability of the MISS-HP was 0.75. PCA identified three factors, which was confirmed by CFA, explaining 56.8% of the variance. Discriminant validity was demonstrated by modest correlations (r'sÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.25-0.37) with low religiosity, depression, and anxiety symptoms, whereas convergent validity was evident by strong correlations with clinician burnout (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.57) and with another multi-item measure of MI symptoms (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.65). ROC characteristics indicated that a score of 36 or higher was 84% sensitive and 93% specific for identifying MI symptoms causing moderate to extreme problems with family, social, and occupational functioning. The MISS-HP is a reliable and valid measure of moral injury symptoms in health professionals that can be used in clinical practice to screen for MI and monitor response to treatment, as well as when conducting researchÃ‚Â that evaluates interventions to treat MI in HPs.","Mantri, Lawson, Wang, Koenig","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-020-01065-w","20200718","Burnout; Depression; Health professionals; Internal conflict; Moral injury; Religiosity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-19","",3214,""
"A projection for psychiatry in the post-COVID-19 era: potential trends, challenges, and directions","The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the face of psychiatry over a very short time period. Given the detrimental impact of the pandemic on mental health and the economy, more difficult days are ahead for psychiatry. The rising public health burden of mental illnesses will inevitably exceed the capacity of psychiatric services in the United States and worldwide. The pandemic has also profoundly affected psychiatric research due to safety concerns and containment efforts. Intermediate and long-term ramifications may even be more serious. In addition to the effects of the economic downturn on available research funding, existing research tools and protocols may not meet the emerging needs in the post-COVID-19 era. This paper discusses potential trends and challenges that psychiatric practice and research may encounter in this period from the viewpoint of workers in the field. We outline some measures that clinicians and researchers can implement to adapt to the emerging changes in psychiatry and to mitigate the forthcoming effects of the crisis.","TÃƒÂ¼rkÃƒÂ¶zer, Ãƒâ€“ngÃƒÂ¼r","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-0841-2","20200718","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-19","",3215,""

"Mental health status among family members of health care workers in Ningbo, China, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak: a cross-sectional study","To date, the psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic among family members of health care workers (HCWs) in China has been neglected. This cross-sectional study investigates the mental health status and related factors in families of HCWs employed in designated hospitals in Ningbo, China. Family members of HCWs in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China, were recruited in February, 2020 for this study. Demographic variables, COVID-19-related events in the lives of the participants, knowledge of COVID-19, and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) were collected using online self-administered questionnaires. Mental health status was assessed using the Chinese versions of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. In total, 845 participants completed the questionnaires correctly (95.80% response rate). The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms were respectively 33.73% (95% CI: 30.53-36.92%) and 29.35% (95% CI: 26.27-32.43%) when a cut-off score of 5 was used for GAD-7 and PHQ-9. Risk factors for anxiety symptoms included more time (hours) spent thinking about the COVID-19, and whether or not family members (that is, HCWs) had direct contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients while high participants' self-reported safety scores for HCW's protective equipment was a protective factor. More time (hours) spent thinking about COVID-19, longer average working time per week worked by family members (that is, HCWs), and being parents and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms. Compared to participants who were HCWs, participants who were private sector workers were more likely to develop depressive symptoms, while government or institutional employees were less likely to suffer from depressive symptoms. Psychological responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic among family members of HCWs during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our findings provide strong evidence to examine and attend to the mental health of this population during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Ying, Ruan, Kong, Zhu, Ji, Lou","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02784-w","20200718","Anxiety symptoms; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Depressive symptoms; Family members of health care workers; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-19","",3218,""
"The Early Food Insecurity Impacts of COVID-19","COVID-19 has disrupted food access and impacted food insecurity, which is associated with numerous adverse individual and public health outcomes. To assess these challenges and understand their impact on food security, we conducted a statewide population-level survey using a convenience sample in Vermont from March 29 to April 12, 2020, during the beginning of a statewide stay-at-home order. We utilized the United States Department of Agriculture six-item validated food security module to measure food insecurity before COVID-19 and since COVID-19. We assessed food insecurity prevalence and reported food access challenges, coping strategies, and perceived helpful interventions among food secure, consistently food insecure (pre-and post-COVID-19), and newly food insecure (post COVID-19) respondents. Among 3219 respondents, there was nearly a one-third increase (32.3%) in household food insecurity since COVID-19 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with 35.5% of food insecure households classified as newly food insecure. Respondents experiencing a job loss were at higher odds of experiencing food insecurity (OR 3.06; 95% CI, 2.114-0.46). We report multiple physical and economic barriers, as well as concerns related to food access during COVID-19. Respondents experiencing household food insecurity had higher odds of facing access challenges and utilizing coping strategies, including two-thirds of households eating less since COVID-19 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Significant differences in coping strategies were documented between respondents in newly food insecure vs. consistently insecure households. These findings have important potential impacts on individual health, including mental health and malnutrition, as well as on future healthcare costs. We suggest proactive strategies to address food insecurity during this crisis.","Niles, Bertmann, Belarmino, Wentworth, Biehl, Neff","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12072096","20200718","COVID-19; coronavirus; employment; food access; food security; malnutrition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-19","",3219,""
"Perceived Threat of COVID-19 Contagion and Frontline Paramedics' Agonistic Behaviour: Employing a Stressor-Strain-Outcome Perspective","Historically, infectious diseases have been the leading cause of human psychosomatic strain and death tolls. This research investigated the recent threat of COVID-19 contagion, especially its impact among frontline paramedics treating patients with COVID-19, and their perception of self-infection, which ultimately increases their agonistic behaviour. Based on the stressor-strain-outcome paradigm, a research model was proposed and investigated using survey-based data through a structured questionnaire. The results found that the perceived threat of COVID-19 contagion (emotional and cognitive threat) was positively correlated with physiological anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion, which led toward agonistic behaviour. Further, perceived social support was a key moderator that negatively affected the relationships between agonistic behaviour and physiological anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion. These findings significantly contributed to the current literature concerning COVID-19 and pandemic-related effects on human behaviour. This study also theorized the concept of human agonistic behaviour, which has key implications for future researchers.","Shahzad, Du, Khan, Fateh, Shahbaz, Abbas, Wattoo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145102","20200718","COVID-19; agonistic behaviour; anxiety; depression; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-19","",3220,""
"A mathematical model to guide the re-opening of economies during the COVID-19 pandemic","Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, continues to surge, with more than 12 million laboratory-confirmed cases and over 500,000 deaths worldwide (as of 11 July 2020). Aside from the continued surge in cases and the imperatives of public health concern and saving lives, economic devastation is also mounting with a global depression now seeming inevitable. There is limited attention directed towards people who have recovered from the virus and whether this metric can be useful in guiding when the economy can be re-opened. In this paper, a simpler model is presented in order to guide various countries on the (possible) re-opening of the economy (or re-opening in stages/phases) alongside risk categories and ratios. Factors that need to be considered when applying the model include the healthcare capacity in terms of the number of hospitals, beds and healthcare workers that are available to capacitate this virus. In addition, population size, physical distancing measures, socio-economic disparities, lockdown regulations in each country, and more importantly - the amount and accuracy of testing conducted, is also imperative to consider. Decisions adopted by leaders around the world have the most difficult decision to make (yet), and have to weigh up on what really matters; health or wealth. It is suggested that this model be applied in a number of states/counties and countries in order to gauge the risk of their location being re-opened, by observing their total number of recoveries in proximity to total number of cases.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.06.041","20200901","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-19","",3221,""
