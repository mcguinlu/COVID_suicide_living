"Elevated depression and anxiety symptoms among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic","Anxiety and depression symptoms in pregnancy typically affect between 10 and 25% of pregnant individuals. Elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with increased risk of preterm birth, postpartum depression, and behavioural difficulties in children. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a unique stressor with potentially wide-ranging consequences for pregnancy and beyond. We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the current COVID-19 pandemic and determined factors that were associated with psychological distress. 1987 pregnant participants in Canada were surveyed in April 2020. The assessment included questions about COVID-19-related stress and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, and social support. We found substantially elevated anxiety and depression symptoms compared to similar pre-pandemic pregnancy cohorts, with 37% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of depression and 57% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Higher symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with more concern about threats of COVID-19 to the life of the mother and baby, as well as concerns about not getting the necessary prenatal care, relationship strain, and social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher levels of perceived social support and support effectiveness, as well as more physical activity, were associated with lower psychological symptoms. This study shows concerningly elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, that may have long-term impacts on their children. Potential protective factors include increased social support and exercise, as these were associated with lower symptoms and thus may help mitigate long-term negative outcomes.","Lebel, MacKinnon, Bagshawe, Tomfohr-Madsen, Giesbrecht","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.126","20200810","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Physical Activity; Pregnancy; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-11","",3747,""
"Psychiatric symptomatology associated with depression, anxiety, distress, and insomnia in health professionals working in patients affected by COVID-19: A systematic review with meta-analysis","Health professionals are key personnel to containing infectious diseases like COVID-19. In the face of long work shifts (that reach 16Ã¢â‚¬Â¯h per day on average), the risk of getting infected by a high-infectious disease and the lack of enough biological protection measures, mental suffering among health professionals suddenly became evident. We carried out an updated meta-analysis to investigate the psychiatric impacts on health professionals in the face of the physical and psychological conditions to which they are subjected due to the high demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Papers were researched in four databases from December 2019 to April 2020. In total, eight papers were included in the study. Health professionals working to fight COVID-19 are being more severely affected by psychiatric disorders associated with depression, anxiety, distress and insomnia, stress, and indirect traumatization than other occupational groups. No significant differences were observed in the publication bias. There is a strong association between health professionals and COVID-19 in terms of psychiatric repercussions. Our meta-analysis showed that health professionals have a higher level of indirect traumatization, in which the level of damage exceeds psychological and emotional tolerance and indirectly results in psychological abnormalities. The incidence of obsessive-compulsive traces and somatizations was higher in situations involving front-line professionals.","da Silva, Neto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110057","20200810","COVID-19; Health professionals; Mental health; Psychiatric repercussions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-11","",3748,""
"Time and Covid-19 stress in the lockdown situation: Time free, Ã‚Â«DyingÃ‚Â» of boredom and sadness","A lockdown of people has been used as an efficient public health measure to fight against the exponential spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and allows the health system to manage the number of patients. The aim of this study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00430818) was to evaluate the impact of both perceived stress aroused by Covid-19 and of emotions triggered by the lockdown situation on the individual experience of time. A large sample of the French population responded to a survey on their experience of the passage of time during the lockdown compared to before the lockdown. The perceived stress resulting from Covid-19 and stress at work and home were also assessed, as were the emotions felt. The results showed that people have experienced a slowing down of time during the lockdown. This time experience was not explained by the levels of perceived stress or anxiety, although these were considerable, but rather by the increase in boredom and sadness felt in the lockdown situation. The increased anger and fear of death only explained a small part of variance in the time judgment. The conscious experience of time therefore reflected the psychological difficulties experienced during lockdown and was not related to their perceived level of stress or anxiety.","Droit-Volet, Gil, Martinelli, Andant, Clinchamps, Parreira, Rouffiac, Dambrun, Huguet, Dubuis, Pereira, Bouillon, Dutheil","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236465","20200810","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-11","",3749,""

"Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health of Healthcare Professionals in Pakistan","Introduction As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, health care professionals (HDPs) are facing immense strain due to the heavy load of cases. In many cases, they work increasingly long hours, often with limited resources and a dubious infrastructure. Thus, it is important to check on the mental health of caregivers. Methods and materials This cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2020, at various hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. All HCPs posted in theÃ‚Â COVID-19 isolation wards were invited to participate and aÃ‚Â total of 112Ã‚Â completed this study. A carefully structured formÃ‚Â was created, which included the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Results The overall mean score of anxiety was 19.01 Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 9.2, depression was 18.12 Ã‚Â± 10, and stress was 20.12 Ã‚Â± 12.0. There were 81 (72.3%) participants who suffered from moderate to extremely severe depression, 96 ( 85.7%) participants who suffered from moderate to extremely severe anxiety, and 101 (90.1%) participants who reported moderate to extreme stress levels Conclusions It is evident that there are a high number of healthcare workers affected by various psychological ailments such as anxiety, stress, and depression. It is important that the government take steps to ensure that HCPs' mental health is regularly checked and that efforts are made to reduce their burdens.","Sandesh, Shahid, Dev, Mandhan, Shankar, Shaikh, Rizwan","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8974","20200810","covid 19; mental health; pakistan","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-11","",3751,""
"Postcritical illness vulnerability","Critical illness survivorship is associated with new and worsening physical, cognitive, and emotional status. Survivors are vulnerable to further health set-backs, most commonly because of infection and exacerbation of chronic medical conditions. Awareness of survivors' challenges are important given the anticipated rise in critical illness survivors because of SARS-CoV-2 viral sepsis. Studies continue to document challenges of critical illness survivorship. Beyond the cognitive, physical, and mental health sequelae encompassed by postintensive case syndrome, patients commonly experience persistent immunosuppression, re-hospitalization, inability to resume prior employment, and reduced quality of life. Although recommended practices for enhancing recovery from sepsis are associated with better outcomes, only a minority of patients receive all recommended practices. ICU follow-up programs or peer support groups remain important interventions to learn about and address the multifaceted challenges of critical illness survivorship, but there is little evidence of benefit to date. Survivors of sepsis and critical illness commonly experience impaired health status, reduced quality of life, and inability to return to prior employment. Although the challenges of critical illness survivorship are increasingly well documented, there are relatively few studies on enhancing recovery. Future studies must focus on identifying best practices for optimizing recovery and strategies to promote their implementation.","Prescott, Sussman, Wiersinga","https://doi.org/10.1097/MCC.0000000000000761","20200810","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-11","",3752,""
"Exploring Readiness for Teleprecepting in Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner Training","Telehealth offers a solution to many challenges in health care, including the shortage of psychiatric providers. Recently the need to limit patient and provider exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has escalated implementation of telehealth across the globe. As telehealth utilization expands, its role in nursing education and training requires systematic evaluation. Since publication of the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculty white paper supporting telehealth in health care delivery and nurse practitioner education, several studies have demonstrated successful didactic instruction and training in telehealth. However, a recent literature review found no studies evaluating the use of telehealth technology as a means of precepting in clinical training. This small-scale qualitative study investigates the readiness of one behavioral health clinic to provide teleprecepting to psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner students. Two preceptors and one student were interviewed using a peer-reviewed semistructured interview guide using video chat. Responses were reviewed, coded, and categorized into themes. Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed three categories for consideration in establishing teleprecepting. Clinical factors, logistics, and comparison with traditional precepting are discussed. Interviewees viewed teleprecepting as a viable method of increasing access to clinical training. This project supports teleprecepting as a feasible strategy for improving access to clinical training and as a technological resource that merits systematic evaluation. Practice guidelines are needed for teleprecepting of advanced practice registered nurse students, and both preceptors and students may benefit from training to support best practices prior to implementation.","Johnson, Ling, Melino","https://doi.org/10.1177/1078390320948127","20200810","community mental health services; graduate nursing education program planning and development; telemental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-11","",3753,""
"Mental health and clinical psychological science in the time of COVID-19: Challenges, opportunities, and a call to action","COVID-19 presents significant social, economic, and medical challenges. Because COVID-19 has already begun to precipitate huge increases in mental health problems, clinical psychological science must assert a leadership role in guiding a national response to this secondary crisis. In this article, COVID-19 is conceptualized as a unique, compounding, multidimensional stressor that will create a vast need for intervention and necessitate new paradigms for mental health service delivery and training. Urgent challenge areas across developmental periods are discussed, followed by a review of psychological symptoms that likely will increase in prevalence and require innovative solutions in both science and practice. Implications for new research directions, clinical approaches, and policy issues are discussed to highlight the opportunities for clinical psychological science to emerge as an updated, contemporary field capable of addressing the burden of mental illness and distress in the wake of COVID-19 and beyond.

This commentary focuses on the mental health implications of the ongoing pandemic as well as the lockdown that lasted for more than two months and is still in place in certain areas. Whereas loneliness, stress, anxiety, and depression have been widespread, vulnerable sections of the population, including daily wage workers, migrant laborers, religious minorities, women and children, and the elderly, have been facing various forms of economic, sociopolitical, and familial stigma, racism, and violence.

"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health","Human confrontation with such a stressor as the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, manifested in severe acute respiratory distress, results also in the decrease of fitness and mental resistance on an unprecedented scale and with difficult to estimate consequences [1]. More important than the intensity of the disorder is its prevalence. When we compare our current knowledge of the impact of the pandemic on the development of mental disorders with the findings of research on acute stress disorder (ASD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) over the last 40 years, it may turn out that they are different from each other, the symptomatic spectrum of mental disorders varies and the possibilities of an effective treatment are very limited. We cannot rule out that a new diagnostic category for specific mental disorders resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may emerge in the near future. This paper presents the extent of the impact of the pandemic on the development of mental instability and current diagnostic possibilities. Subpopulations necessary for planning short-term intervention in the organisational, informative and medical areas were identified. A psychiatric guide for immediate support and assistance was proposed.","Heitzman","https://doi.org/10.12740/PP/120373","20200810","COVID-19; mental health; stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-11","",3756,""
"Views on Workplace Policies and its Impact on Health-Related Quality of Life During Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Survey of Employees","This study explored the degree of views towards supportive workplace policies among employees during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its association with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Hong Kong. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 1049 employees using online self-administered questionnaire. Views on workplace policies were measured in term of agreement on its comprehensiveness, timeliness and transparency whereas HRQoL was measured using EQ-5D-5L Hong Kong version. Univariate estimates on the impact of HRQoL from views of measures in workplace was done. Qualitative comments on the suggestions to strengthen workplace measures were collected and presented descriptively. Of 1048 respondents, 16% reported that no workplace measures nor guidelines were existed in their company related to the COVID-19 pandemics. Those who reported having workplace policy were not satisfied with the arrangement in term of comprehensiveness (36%), timeliness (38%), and transparency (63%). Regarding to the policy measure, only 68% respondents reported that their workplace supplied face masks to them. The health index was 0897, which was lower than the norm of 0.924. 64% of respondents reported having a health problem in at least 1 of 5 dimension of EQ-5D-5L with the highest proportion of having problem in anxiety/depression (55%). In addition, the workplace policy and measure had a direct effect of 0.131 on health outcome. Perception of infection risk had a direct effect of 0.218 on health outcome and partly mediated the relationship between workplace policy and measure and health outcome (0.066). The study highlighted the workplace policy and measure is an important mean to minimize infection risk at workplace so as to reduce tremendous stress and health outcome caused by a COVID-19 pandemic. Workplace measures related to COVID-19 pandemic should be further strengthen to mitigate the risk of infection and protect employee's health.","Wong, Ho, Wong, Cheung, Yau, Dong, Yeoh","https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.127","20200810","COVID-19; Employees; Health-Related Quality of Health; Hong Kong; Occupational Health; Workplace Policies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-11","",3757,""
"Negative impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on mental health service access and follow-up adherence for immigrants and individuals in socio-economic difficulties","Lockdown measures in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can have serious mental health effects on the population, especially in vulnerable groups, such as those living in poor socio-economic conditions, those who are homeless, migrant workers and asylum seekers/refugees. In addition, these vulnerable groups frequently have greater difficulty accessing health services and in treatment adherence. The aim of this study is to estimate the impact of the COVID-19-related lockdown on service utilisation and follow-up adherence in an Italian mental health outpatient service for migrants and individuals in socio-economic difficulties. The design of this study is a retrospective cross-sectional study. All patients who visited the mental health outpatient service in the months of February and March in the years 2017-2020 were included in the study. To compare service utilisation before and after the lockdown, the number of patients who visited the mental health outpatient service for psychiatric interview were recorded. Follow-up adherence was calculated as the percentage of patients who visited in February and subsequently attended a follow-up visit in March of the same year. The number of patients who visited the outpatient service between February 2017 and February 2020 was continuously increasing. In March 2020, fewer patients visited the service for psychiatric interview, in line with the introduction of lockdown measures. In addition, the number of the patients who visited in February 2020 and returned for their follow-up visits in March 2020 declined from approximately 30% over the same months in 2017-2019 to 17.53% in March 2020. The lockdown-related reduction in numbers of patients accessing the mental health service makes it difficult to help vulnerable populations during a period of time in which their mental health needs are expected to increase. Moreover, the reduction seen in follow-up compliance increases the risk of treatment discontinuation and possible relapse. Proactive alternative strategies need to be developed to reach these vulnerable populations.","Aragona, Barbato, Cavani, Costanzo, Mirisola","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.06.055","20200810","Coronavirus; Homeless; Immigrants; Mental health; Refugees; Service utilisation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-11","",3758,""

"Testing an early online intervention for the treatment of disturbed sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic (Sleep COVID-19): structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","The primary aim of the present study is to examine the efficacy of an online intervention for poor sleep in the context of an ongoing stressful major life event, by assessing if this intervention can reduce insomnia severity at short-term (one week post-intervention) and long-term (one and three months post-intervention) follow-up time points. It is hypothesised that the intervention will: 1) reduce insomnia severity in poor sleepers, compared to wait-list control poor sleepers, and good sleepers; 2) reduce subjective symptoms of anxiety and depression in all groups, and 3) prevent the transition to acute insomnia in good sleepers. This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial. Both healthy good sleepers, who do not report having any current sleep problems, and individuals who report having sleep problems, will be recruited for the present study. This is a single-site study (Northumbria University). This study will be delivered using the internet and there are no geographic restrictions. Individuals who self-report as poor sleepers will meet DSM-5 criteria for acute insomnia, which is where individuals: 1) have difficulties in falling asleep, staying asleep, or awakening too early for at least three nights per week, for a time period of between two weeks and three months; and 2) report experiencing distress or impairment caused by sleep loss. Both 1) and 2) must have occurred despite the individual having had an adequate opportunity for sleep during this time period. Good sleepers will be individuals who do not have current sleep problems. All participants must have a sufficient level of English comprehension to understand and complete study measures. Individuals cannot participate if they report having chronic sleep problems (where they have existed for more than three months immediately prior to providing consent), nor will individuals who are actively seeking treatment for their sleep problems irrespective of how long they have had the sleep problem. Individuals also cannot participate if they have a self-reported history of head injuries, or if they have a self-reported diagnosis of schizophrenia, epilepsy or personality disorder, as the distraction techniques involved in the insomnia intervention may increase rumination in individuals with these conditions, and influence the effectiveness of the intervention. Participants who receive the intervention will be provided with an online version of a self-help leaflet. A printed version of this leaflet has been successfully used in previous treatment studies, which have been conducted by our research group. Participants will be encouraged to download, save or print out this leaflet, which will be provided in PDF format. There will be no restrictions on use and participants will be encouraged to refer to this leaflet as often as they wish to. Briefly, this self-help leaflet aims to improve sleep by identifying and addressing sleep-related dysfunctional thinking by providing education about sleep, providing techniques to distract from intrusive worrisome thoughts at night, and providing guidelines for sleep-related stimulus control. The comparator is a wait-list control (i.e. where they will receive the intervention after a one month delay) group. The primary outcome measure will be insomnia severity, as measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (Bastien, ValliÃƒÂ¨res, &amp; Morin, 2001), assessed immediately prior to the intervention and at one week, one month and three months post-intervention, compared to baseline. Secondary outcome measures will include subjective mood, measured using the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &amp; Lowe, 2006)) and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001), assessed immediately prior to the intervention, and one week, one month and three months post-intervention, compared to baseline. Additionally, subjective sleep continuity, derived from sleep diaries (Carney et al., 2012), will be compared pre and post-intervention. This study will operate as a cluster randomised controlled trial. Good sleepers will be randomised into an intervention or a no-intervention group, with a 1:1 allocation. Poor sleepers will be randomised into an intervention or wait-list control group, with a 1:1 allocation. Randomisation will be conducted automatically using Qualtrics study software, where block sizes will be equal and randomisation will be computer-generated. Participants will not be blinded to group assignment. The outcomes will be assessed by a blinded investigator. The minimum sample size is 60. A total of 30 poor sleepers will be randomised to the intervention or wait-list control group. A total of 30 good sleepers will be randomised to the intervention or no intervention group. Recruitment for this study has yet to start. It is anticipated that recruitment will begin in August 2020 and end in April 2022.

"Comparison of the severity of psychological distress among four groups of an Iranian population regarding COVID-19 pandemic","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused serious psychological problems, including panic attack, anxiety, stress, and depression. The main objective of this study was to measure the prevalence and compare the severity of this psychological distress among four groups of an Iranian population. In a cross-sectional survey, the mental health status of four groups of an Iranian society including community population, patients with COVID-19, medical staff, and medical students were investigated by the self-report questionnaire of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS). DASS-21 questionnaire and the demographic data sheet were filled out by the participants. All statistical analyses were done using R version 3.6.1 software. P-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. ANOVA test was used to compare the severity of stress, anxiety, and depression between the four study groups. Of the 886 participants in this survey, 554 (62.5%) were men and 332 (37.5%) were women, and the meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°standard division of age was 40.91Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. Among these participants, 241 (27.2%) were selected from community population, 221 (24.9%) were patients with COVID-19, 217 (24.5%) were medical staff, and 207 (23.4%) were medical students. The mean score of stress, anxiety, and depression in medical students and patients with COVID-19 was significantly higher than in medical staff and community population (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Overall, the anxiety score in men was higher than that in women (27.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.6 vs. 26.48Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.8, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006), and unmarried participants had a significantly higher depression score compared with the married group (27.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.8 vs. 26.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.6, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.023). In addition, the score of depression was higher in female medical staff (27.08Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.6 vs. 25.33Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.3, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.011) and community population (26.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.3 vs. 25.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.3, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02) than in male.

"FreeSurfer based segmentation of hippocampal subfields: a review of methods and applications, with a novel quality control procedure for ENIGMA studies and other collaborative efforts","Structural hippocampal abnormalities are common in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, and even variation within the normal range is related to cognitive performance and other complex phenotypes such as stress sensitivity. Hippocampal subregions are increasingly studied, as automated algorithms have become available for mapping and volume quantification. In the context of the ENIGMA Consortium, several Disease Working Groups are using the FreeSurfer software to analyze hippocampal subregion (subfield) volumes in patients with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other conditions, along with data from matched controls. In this overview, we explain the algorithmâ€™s principle, summarize measurement reliability studies, and demonstrate two additional aspects (subfield autocorrelation and volume/reliability correlation) with illustrative data. We then explain the rationale for a standardized hippocampal subfield segmentation quality control (QC) procedure for improved pipeline harmonization. To guide researchers to make optimal use of the algorithm, we discuss how global size and age effects can be modelled, how QC steps can be incorporated and how subfields may be aggregated into composite volumes. This discussion is based on a synopsis of 162 published neuroimaging studies (01/2013â€“12/2019) that applied the FreeSurfer hippocampal subfield segmentation in a broad range of domains including cognition and healthy aging, brain development and neurodegeneration, affective disorders, schizophrenia, childhood trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder, inflammatory and systemic disease, alcoholism, stress regulation, neurotoxicity, as well as assessments of heritability, effects of candidate genes, genome-wide association studies and epigenetic effects. Lastly, we highlight points where FreeSurfer-based hippocampal subfield studies may be optimized.","Philipp Gerog SÃ¤mann et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600B-CFB-F5C","20200811","PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Clinical Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Computational Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; hippocampus; enigma; hippocampal subregions; quality control; freesurfer; hippocampal subfields; mri; segmentation","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-11","",3763,""
