"How healthcare workers respond to COVID-19: The role of vulnerability and social support in a close relationships defense mechanism","Healthcare workers play a vital role in the fight against COVID-19. Based on Terror Management Theory (TMT), the present research examined whether a close relationships defense mechanism reduces anxiety among healthcare workers (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 729) in China. Our results suggest that this defense mechanism, as indexed by relationship satisfaction, serves as an effective terror management source after exposure to reminders of death (MS; mortality salience). These findings extend TMT by identifying two moderating variables: vulnerability and social support. In a low objective vulnerability group, healthcare workers who subjectively believed themselves as less vulnerable to COVID-19 showed a stronger defense mechanism after a MS manipulation as compared to those who felt more vulnerable. Further, healthcare workers with higher levels of social support reported more relationship satisfaction. These findings have practical implications for guiding healthcare workers on how to buffer death-related anxiety and maintain their mental health in the fight against COVID-19.","Chen, Tan, Xing, Zheng","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2021.103442","20211030","COVID-19; Close relationships defense; Healthcare workers; Social support; Terror management theory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-31","",19748,""
"The Impact of the Covid-19-Related Transition to Telehealth on Visit Adherence in Mental Health Care: An Interrupted Time Series Study","Covid-19 has led to an unprecedented shift to telemental health (TMH) in mental healthcare. This study examines the impact of this transition on visit adherence for mental health services in an integrated behavioral health department. Monthly visit data for 12,245 patients from January, 2019 to January, 2021 was extracted from the electronic medical record. Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis examined the impact of the Covid-19 transition to TMH on immediate level and trend changes in the percentage of cancelled visits and no shows in the 10Ã‚Â months following the transition. ITS also compared changes across the three largest services types: adult, pediatric, and substance use. Following the TMH-transition, completed visits increased by 10% amounting to an additional 3644 visits. In April, 2020, immediately following the TMH-transition, no shows increased by 1.4%, (95% CI 0.1, 2.7, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) and cancellations fell by 13.5% (95% CI -Ã‚Â 17.9, -Ã‚Â 9.0, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Across the 10-month post-TMH period, 18.2% of visits were cancelled, compared to 28.3% across the 14-month pre-TMH period. The proportion of no-shows remained the same. The pattern was similar for pediatric and adult sub-clinics, but no significant changes in cancellations or no shows were observed in the substance use sub-clinic. TMH during the Covid-19 pandemic is associated with improved visit adherence over time and may be a promising model for improving the efficiency of mental health care deliveryÃ‚Â once it is safe to resume in person care.","Eyllon, Barnes, Daukas, Fair, Nordberg","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10488-021-01175-x","20211030","Behavioral health; COVID-19; Mental health; Telehealth; Telemedicine; Telemental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-31","",19749,""
"Prenatal distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: clinical and research implications","The objective of this study was to identify risk and protective factors related to general prenatal distress and COVID-19-specific prenatal distress toÃ‚Â inform intervention targets amongÃ‚Â women pregnantÃ‚Â during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study relied on data obtained from U.S. pregnant women (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°701) who participated in the Perinatal Experiences and COVID-19 Effects (PEACE) Study from May 21 to October 3, 2020. The present cross-sectional study examined the potential risk and protective factors associated with different features of prenatal distress among U.S. pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately two-thirds of expectant mothers indicated being more stressed about going to the hospital because of COVID-19. Generalized anxiety and PTSD were associated with higher levels of general and COVID-19-specific prenatal distress. Depression symptoms were associated with higher general prenatal distress. Higher levels of distress tolerance were associated with lower levels of general prenatal distress (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 0.192, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and COVID-19-specific prenatal distress (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â -Ã‚Â 0.089, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). Higher levels of instrumental social support were marginallyÃ‚Â associated with lower COVID-19-specific prenatal distress (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 0.140, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.1). Findings draw attention to prenatal distress experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, including new types of distress arising from the pandemicÃ‚Â itself. Women might benefit from the introduction of interventions such as mindfulness-based or relaxation therapy. Coverage of responsibilities and financial assistance is particularly needed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Limitations include a majority White and high socioeconomic sample. These findings provide specificity regardingÃ‚Â potential targets for addressing prenatal distress.","Liu, Hyun, Erdei, Mittal","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-021-06286-2","20211030","Anxiety; Depression; Mental health; Pandemic; Pregnancy; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-31","",19750,""
"A survey to explore the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on radiation therapists in Norway and Canada: A tale of two countries","Several studies have demonstrated the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care providers. However, there is little known about how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted radiation therapists (RTs) in Norway or Canada. The aim of this investigation was to study the psychological impact of working during the COVID-19 pandemic among RTs in Canada and Norway. Online surveys were administered to a convenience sample of RTs and RT department managers. Approximately 2000 and 300 RTs were invited to participate from Canada and Norway, respectively. The RT survey collected information on demographics, work-related stressors, psychological impact, quality of life, and workplace support programmes. The RT manager survey collected information on departmental changes, patient volumes, staff shortages and redeployment, personal protective equipment, and infection control measures. Descriptive analysis, group comparisons and logistic regression were used to examine the impact of COVID-19 on RTs in the two countries, while open-ended questions were examined through thematic analysis. Work-related stress and anxiety were prevalent among Canadian (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°155) and Norwegian RTs (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°124), with Canadian RTs reporting higher levels. Fear of transmission, changes in PPE usage, and changes in staffing were reported as the most frequent work-related stressors. Themes related to working during the pandemic included: generalised anxiety; physical, emotional and cognitive symptoms of stress; and loneliness, as well as negative impact on health and quality of relationships. Survey findings from RT department managers in Canada (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12) and Norway (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13) suggest that the pandemic had an organisational impact on RT departments due to implemented infection control measures and changes in staffing. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to similar stressors amongst Canadian and Norwegian RTs but relatively higher levels of psychological impact among Canadian RTs. Findings demonstrate the importance of mental health support programmes in the workplace to mitigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on RTs.","Morassaei, Di Prospero, Ringdalen, Olsen, Korsell, Erler, Ying, Ho Choi, Bolderston, Middleton, Johansen","https://doi.org/10.1002/jmrs.557","20211030","Coronavirus; anxiety; health personnel; mental health; psychological stress; quality of life; radiotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-31","",19751,""
"Keyworker mediated enhancement of physical health in patients with first episode psychosis: A feasibility/acceptability study","Early intervention for people experiencing first episode psychosis is a priority, and keyworkers are vital to such services. However, keyworkers' roles in addressing first episode psychosis patients' physical health are under researched. This study addresses this knowledge gap by evaluating a keyworker-mediated intervention promoting physical health among first episode psychosis patients. The study was informed by the Medical Research Council's Framework for Complex Interventions to Improve Health. First episode psychosis participants were recruited from three Irish mental health services. The intervention was evaluated in terms of its feasibility/acceptability. Feasibility outcomes were mixed (recruitment rateÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 24/68 [35.3%]; retention rateÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 18/24 [75%]). The baseline sample was predominantly male (M:F ratioÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 13:6; Med ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 25Ã¢â‚¬â€°y; IQRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 23-42Ã¢â‚¬â€°y). Common health issues among participants included overweightness/obesity (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 11) and substance use (smoking/alcohol consumption [nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 19]). Participants' initial health priorities included exercising more (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 10), improving diet (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6), weight loss (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7) and using various health/healthcare services. The intervention's acceptability was evidenced by the appreciation participants had for physical health keyworkers' support, as well as the healthy lifestyle, which the intervention promoted. Acceptability was somewhat compromised by a low-recruitment rate, variable linkages between keyworkers and general practitioners (GPs) and COVID-19 restrictions. Physical health-oriented keyworker interventions for first episode psychosis patients show promise and further evaluation of such initiatives is warranted. Future interventions should be mindful of participant recruitment challenges, strategies to enhance relationships between keyworkers and GPs, and if necessary, they should mitigate COVID-19 restrictions' impacts on care.","Broughan, McCombe, Lim, O'Keeffe, Brown, Clarke, Corcoran, Hanlon, Kelly, Lyne, McGorry, O' Brien, O' Connor, O' Mahony, Scott, Wycherley, Cullen","https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13234","20211030","early medical intervention; feasibility studies; patient acceptance of healthcare; physical health; psychotic disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-31","",19752,""
"Emotional distress among older adults during the COVID-19 outbreak: understanding the longitudinal psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic","Older adults have proven their ability to overcome adversities throughout their life. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults' psychological distress (anxiety and depression) over time. A community-dwelling Spaniard population (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 192) completed a survey and reported on their sociodemographic characteristics, appraisal and personal resources. Older adults took part in a longitudinal online survey collected in April 2020 (during the lockdown restrictions) and at two subsequent time points 3 and 9Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after baseline (without lockdown restrictions and during the third wave of the pandemic respectively). Older adults did not evidence higher emotional distress than during the initial lockdown. Furthermore, depression remained stable and anxiety significantly decreased. Results also suggest that some sociodemographic characteristics, appraisals and personal resources are relevant. Older participants showed less anxiety than younger ones. Furthermore, being a male, resilience, and acceptance were related with the decrease of anxiety. Otherwise, fear of the COVID-19 outbreak and depression were related with the increase of anxiety. Older adults may adapt to the adverse pandemic impact by using more adaptive resources that reduce their distress. Efforts to ameliorate older adults' anxiety by focusing on older adults' personal resources should be considered.","LÃƒÂ³pez, Perez-Rojo, Noriega, Martinez-Huertas, Velasco","https://doi.org/10.1111/psyg.12781","20211030","SARS-CoV-2; ageing; coronavirus; longitudinal study; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-31","",19753,""
"Youth in a pandemic: a longitudinal examination of youth mental health and substance use concerns during COVID-19","This study analyses longitudinal data to understand how youth mental health and substance use are evolving over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is critical to adjusting mental health response strategies. Participants were recruited from among existing participants in studies conducted in an urban academic hospital in Ontario, Canada. A total of 619 youth aged 14-28 years participated in the study (62.7% girls/young women; 61.4% Caucasian). Data on mood, substance use and COVID-19-related worries were collected over four time points, that is, every 2 months beginning in the early stages of the pandemic in April 2020. Latent class analyses were conducted on the longitudinal data to identify distinct groups of youth who have different trajectory profiles of pandemic impact on their mood, substance use and COVID-19-related worries. For the majority of participants, mood concerns increased early in the pandemic, declined over Canada's summer months and subsequently increased in autumn. Among the youth with the highest level of mood symptoms at the beginning of the pandemic, increases in mental health concerns were sustained. Substance use remained relatively stable over the course of the pandemic. COVID-19-related worries, however, followed a trajectory similar to that of mood symptoms. Girls/young women, youth living in urban or suburban areas, in larger households, and with poorer baseline mental and physical health are the most vulnerable to mental health concerns and worries during the pandemic. Youth mental health symptom levels and concerns are evolving over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with the evolution of the pandemic itself, and longitudinal monitoring is therefore required. It is also essential that we engage directly with youth to cocreate pandemic response strategies and mental health service adaptations to best meet the needs of young people.","Hawke, Szatmari, Cleverley, Courtney, Cheung, Voineskos, Henderson","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049209","20211030","COVID-19; mental health; substance misuse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-31","",19754,""
"Time trend analysis of social inequalities in psychological distress among young adults before and during the pandemic: evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study COVID-19 waves","Despite concerns about mental health problems among those aged 16-24 in England, which social groups have been most at risk, both over the past decade and during the COVID-19 pandemic, remains unclear. We examined trends in psychological distress among young adults 16-24Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old in England using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study. Using longitudinal data as repeated cross-sectional waves, we examined differences over time in mean General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) scores from wave 1 (2009-2010) to wave 10 (2018-2019) and six COVID-19 waves collected between April and November 2020, by economic activity, cohabitation with parents, parental education, area deprivation, ethnicity, age and sex. Compared with 2009-2010, increases in GHQ scores in 2018-2019 were higher in women than men (2.1 vs 1.3), those aged 16-18 than aged 22-24 (2.6 vs 0.9), those from white UK group versus other ethnic minorities, and those out of the labour force (3.6) or employed part time (2.2) than those employed full time (0.8). Compared with 2018-2019, psychological distress in 2020 also further increased among young adults residing in the most deprived areas (4.1 vs 1.2 in the least deprived areas). In 2020, losing one's job or most of one's work hours was associated with higher psychological distress and attenuated the differences between deprivation quartiles by 17%. In England, inequalities in psychological distress among young adults may have changed and increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Investing in opportunities for young adults, particularly in more deprived areas, may be key to improve population levels of mental health.","GagnÃƒÂ©, Nandi, Schoon","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-217266","20211030","health inequalities; longitudinal studies; mental health; public health; social sciences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-31","",19755,""
"Race, Ethnicity, and 60-Day Outcomes After Hospitalization With COVID-19","To examine racial and ethnic disparities in clinical, financial, and mental health outcomes within a diverse sample of hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients in the 60Ã‚Â days postdischarge. A cross-sectional study. A total of 2217 adult patients who were hospitalized with a COVID-19-positive diagnosis as evidenced by test (reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction), a discharge diagnosis of COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1), or strong documented clinical suspicion of COVID-19 but no testing completed or recorded owing to logistical constraints (n=24). Patient records were abstracted for the Mi-COVID19 data registry, including the hospital and insurer data of patients discharged from one of 38 participating hospitals in Michigan between March 16, 2020, and July 1, 2020. Registry data also included patient responses to a brief telephone survey on postdischarge employment, mental and emotional health, persistence of COVID-19-related symptoms, and medical follow-up. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data; analysis of variance and Pearson chi-squared test were used to evaluate racial and ethnic variances among patient outcomes and survey responses. Black patients experienced the lowest physician follow-up postdischarge (nÃ‚Â = 65, 60.2%) and the longest delays in returning to work (average 35.5Ã‚Â days). More than half of hospital readmissions within the 60Ã‚Â days following discharge were among nonwhite patients (nÃ‚Â = 144, 55%). The majority of postdischarge deaths were among white patients (nÃ‚Â = 153, 21.5%), most of whom were discharged on palliative care (nÃ‚Â = 103). Less than a quarter of patients discharged back to assisted living, skilled nursing facilities, or subacute rehabilitation facilities remained at those locations in the 60Ã‚Â days following discharge (nÃ‚Â = 48). Increased attention to postdischarge care coordination is critical to reducing negative health outcomes following a COVID-19-related hospitalization.","Robinson-Lane, Sutton, Chubb, Yeow, Mazzara, DeMarco, Kim, Chopra","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2021.08.023","20211030","Continuity of patient care; Michigan; hospitalization; questionnaires; registries; surveys","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-31","",19756,""
"Cyberchondria severity and quality of life among Lebanese adults: the mediating role of fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, stress and obsessive-compulsive behavior-a structural equation model approach","This study highlights the significant association between cyberchondria and quality of life among the Lebanese population in the time of COVID-19. The aim was to assess the association between cyberchondria and quality of life (QOL) of Lebanese community during the COVID-19 pandemic and assess the mediating effect of fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, stress and Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale in this association. This cross-sectional study was carried out between December 2020 and January 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 449 persons participated in this study by filling the online questionnaire. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to examine the structural relationship between cyberchondria severity, the mediator (anxiety, stress, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and fear of COVID-19) and physical/mental QOL. Having a university level of education and older age were significantly associated with higher physical QOL scores, whereas higher obsession-compulsion disorder, higher stress and higher anxiety were significantly associated with lower physical QOL scores. Higher anxiety was significantly associated with lower mental QOL scores. The results of the SEM showed that stress, fear of COVID-19 and to a lesser limit OCD, mediated the association between cyberchondria severity and physical QOL, whereas anxiety, stress and fear of COVID-19 mediated the association between cyberchondria severity and mental QOL. This research reported interesting results encouraging more exploration of cyberchondria and its association with quality of life during this unique period of the pandemic. However, this virus has altered the lives of individuals all across the world, and the consequences will last for a long time. Along with all of the steps done to stop the development of COVID-19 and improve physical outcomes, mental health requires immediate care. More research is needed to determine the coping techniques people are employing to deal with the pandemic.","Rahme, Akel, Obeid, Hallit","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-021-00674-8","20211030","Anxiety; Cyberchondria; Obsession-compulsion; Quality of life; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-31","",19757,""
