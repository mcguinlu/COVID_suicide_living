"A pandemia no cÃ¡rcere: intervenÃ§Ãµes no superisolamento; A pandemia no cÃ¡rcere: intervenÃ§Ãµes no superisolamento; The pandemic in prison: interventions and overisolation","Prisional health is, in its essence, public health. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a great threat to the world and has shown that preventing the disease escalation in prisons integrates the novel corona virus clash in society in general. Up to this moment, the most effective known measure to curb the disease spread is social isolation. Nevertheless, in penal institutions, often overcrowded, social isolation becomes difficult to carry out and, when it happens, it takes the enclosed population to overisolation, with consequences to their mental health. Besides, prisoners suffer with clogged up environment, lack of materials for personal hygiene, poor basic sanitary conditions and difficulties in accessing health services. This paper deals with a narrative review on the pandemic effects in prisons and how government and civil society have organized themselves in order to reduce the disease consequences at those places. The text has been divided into three sections: the first with literature review on the current health theme; the second discusses how different countries have been dealing with the prison situation in the pandemic context, and, the last part focuses on how the Brazilian Penal System has reacted to the new disease.","Carvalho, SÃ©rgio GarÃ³falo de; Santos, Andreia Beatriz Silva Dos; Santos, Ivete Maria","http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&nrm=iso&lng=pt&tlng=pt&pid=S1413-81232020000903493; http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&nrm=iso&lng=pt&tlng=pt&pid=S1413-81232020000903493","","Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Cien Saude Colet;25(9): 3493-3502, 2020 Sep.; Publication details: Cien Saude Colet;25(9): 3493-3502, 2020 Sep.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-10","",4498,""

In this scenario, the current study aimed to identify the impact or effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' health. This is a scoping literature review based on the following databases: Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SciELO, and PUBCOVID19. The study adopted the stages proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute for scoping reviews, and the question orienting the procedures consisted of the acronym PCC (population; concept; context). Eleven articles were included in the review. Clinically, adolescents present the same COVID-19 symptoms as adults. The pandemic and the health measures taken to control transmission were found to be associated with mental health problems in adolescents. Specifically, adolescents have a negative experience with social distancing measures and closing of schools. These measures can also favor situations of violence or aggressive behaviors in the home environment. Healthcare services that treat the adolescent population had to reorient their practices, adopting a virtual model to replace face-to-face care, and even research projects involving adolescence had to be rethought. This scoping review addressed an emerging theme in relation to a population that has received little attention in studies on COVID-19. The results suggest that the pandemic can be considered a determinant that affects different dimensions of adolescents' lives.","Oliveira, Wanderlei Abadio de; Silva, Jorge Luiz da; Andrade, AndrÃ© Luiz Monezi; Micheli, Denise De; Carlos, Diene Monique; Silva, Marta AngÃ©lica Iossi","http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&nrm=iso&lng=pt&tlng=pt&pid=S0102-311X2020000802001; http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&nrm=iso&lng=pt&tlng=pt&pid=S0102-311X2020000802001","","Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Cad Saude Publica;36(8): e00150020, 2020.; Publication details: Cad Saude Publica;36(8): e00150020, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-10","",4499,""
"The deterioration of mental health among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak: A population-based cohort study of workers in Japan","Objectives This study compared the longitudinal change in the mental health of healthcare and non-healthcare workers during two months of the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. Methods Data were derived from a prospective online cohort study of 1448 full-time employees in Japan. Participants were surveyed at baseline from 19-22 March 2020 (T1) and at follow-up from 22-26 May 2020 (T2). A self-administered online questionnaire was used to assess participants' fear and worry of COVID-19, psychological distress, and physical symptoms at T1 and T2. A series of generalized linear models were created to assess changes in outcomes between healthcare and non-healthcare workers. Demographic variables (ie, sex, age, marital status, child[ren], education, and residential area) were included in the models as covariates. Results A total of 1032 participants completed the follow-up questionnaire at T2 (follow-up rate, 72.6%). After excluding unemployed respondents (N=17), the final sample comprised 1015 full-time employees (111 healthcare and 904 non-healthcare workers). After adjusting for the covariates, psychological distress (and subscales of fatigue, anxiety, and depression) as well as fear and worry of COVID-19 increased statistically significantly more among healthcare than non-healthcare workers from T1 to T2. Conclusions Psychological distress, together with fear and worry of COVID-19, increased more among healthcare compared to non-healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study confirmed that healthcare workers are an important target for mental healthcare during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Sasaki, Kuroda, Tsuno, Kawakami","https://doi.org/10.5271/sjweh.3922","20200909","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-10","",4500,""

Daily blood coagulation and thrombotic factor profiling with immunoassays and in vitro experiments on human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. Tertiary care ICU and academic laboratory. All patients admitted to the ICU suspected of being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, using standardized hospital screening methodologies, had daily blood samples collected until testing was confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 negative on either ICU day 3 or ICU day 7 if the patient was coronavirus disease 2019 positive. None. Age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects and ICU patients that were either coronavirus disease 2019 positive or coronavirus disease 2019 negative were enrolled. Cohorts were well balanced with the exception that coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients were more likely than coronavirus disease 2019 negative patients to suffer bilateral pneumonia. Mortality rate for coronavirus disease 2019 positive ICU patients was 40%. Compared with healthy control subjects, coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients had higher plasma von Willebrand factor (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and glycocalyx-degradation products (chondroitin sulfate and syndecan-1; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).

"Available Evidence and Ongoing Hypothesis on Corona Virus (COVID-19) and Psychosis: Is Corona Virus and Psychosis Related? A Narrative Review","Corona virus (COVID-19) is an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel corona virus and declared to be a global health emergency and a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Prevention strategies to control the transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as closing of schools, refraining from gathering, and social distancing, have direct impacts on mental well-being. SARS-CoV-2 has a devastating psychological impact on the mental health status of the community and, particularly when associated with psychotic symptoms, it could affect the overall quality-of-life. The virus also has the potential to enter and infect the brain. As a result, psychosis symptoms could be an emerging phenomenon associated with the corona virus pandemic. The presence of psychotic symptoms may complicate the management options of patients with COVID-19. The aim of this article review is to elaborate the relationships between COVID-19 and psychotic symptoms. We independently searched different electronic databases, such as Google scholar, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychInfo, and other relevant sources published in English globally, by using the search terms &quot;psychosis and COVID-19&quot;, &quot;corona virus&quot;, &quot;brief psychotic&quot;, &quot;schizophrenia&quot;, &quot;organic psychosis&quot;, &quot;infectious disease&quot;, &quot;mental illness&quot;, &quot;pandemics&quot;, and &quot;psychiatry&quot; in various permutations and combinations. The results of the included studies revealed that patients with a novel corona virus had psychotic symptoms, including hallucination in different forms of modality, delusion, disorganized speech, and grossly disorganized or catatonic behaviors. The patients with COVID-19-related psychotic symptoms had responded with a short-term administration of the antipsychotic medication. A corona virus-related psychosis has been identified in different nations, but it is difficult to conclude that a novel corona virus has been biologically related to psychosis or exacerbates psychotic symptoms. Therefore, to identify the causal relationships between COVID-19 and psychosis, the researchers should investigate the prospective study on the direct biological impacts of COVID-19 and psychosis, and the clinicians should pay attention for psychotic symptoms at the treatment center and isolation rooms in order to reduce the complication of a novel corona virus.","Tariku, Hajure","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S264235","20200909","2020; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; psychosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-10","",4503,""
"COVID-19-Related Fear and Health-Related Safety Behavior in Oncological Patients","This study aimed to assess cancer patients' psychological burden during the COVID-19 pandemic by investigating distress (distress-thermometer), health status (EQ-5D-3L), general anxiety (GAD-7), COVID-19-related fear and associated behavioral changes and comparing these to matched healthy controls, using propensity score matching (PSM). During the first days of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, March 16 to 30, 2020, 150 actually treated cancer patients and 150 matched healthy controls participated in this study. Participants completed an anonymous online survey assessing health status, distress, general anxiety, COVID-19-related fear and behavioral changes (i.e., adherent safety behavior and dysfunctional safety behavior). Cancer patients showed no elevated level of distress, <i>U</i> = 10,657.5, <i>p</i> = 0.428, general anxiety <i>U</i> = 10,015.5, <i>p</i> = 0.099, or COVID-19-related fear compared to healthy controls, <i>U</i> = 10,948, <i>p</i> = 0.680. Both groups showed elevated COVID-19-related fear. Cancer patients reported more adherent safety behavior, such as washing hands more often or avoiding public places, <i>U</i> = 8,285, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, <i>d</i> = 0.468. They also reported more dysfunctional safety behavior such as buying larger quantities of basic food, compared to healthy controls <i>U</i> = 9,599, <i>p</i> = 0.029, <i>d</i> = 0.256. Adherent safety behavior could be significantly explained by cancer diagnosis, increased COVID-19-related fear and subjective level of information about COVID-19, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.215, <i>F</i>(3) = 27.026, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001. This suggests that cancer patients are more likely to utilize adherent safety behavior. Cancer patients reported comparable levels of distress and anxiety compared to healthy controls. Still, the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with elevated COVID-19-related fear. Therefore, specific interventions are needed to prevent anxiety and improve mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Musche, BÃƒÂ¤uerle, Steinbach, Schweda, Hetkamp, WeismÃƒÂ¼ller, Kohler, Beckmann, Herrmann, Tewes, Schadendorf, Skoda, Teufel","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01984","20200909","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; cancer; coping; distress; oncology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-10","",4504,""
"COVID-19 in Guangdong: Immediate Perceptions and Psychological Impact on 304,167 College Students","The outbreak of COVID-19 has brought unprecedented psychological pressure to people across China and more widely across the entire globe. The aim of this study was to assess the immediate perceptions of COVID-19 among college students in Guangdong Province, China, and to assess the psychological impact of the outbreak. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of college students via online questionnaires between February 13th and February 22nd, 2020. A total of 304,167 students completed the Impact of Event Scale 6 (IES-6) and other items. The results showed that 155,077 (50.9%) of the students reported stress symptoms, 1,565 (0.5%) reported poor mental health, and 9,752 (3.2%) reported poor sleep quality. Analysis indicated that the students' perceptions of COVID-19 were correlated with psychological stress, self-perceived mental health and sleep quality. Moreover, the analysis revealed that the relationship between types of perception and levels of stress symptoms varied according to the students' demographic characteristics. These findings allow us to better understand psychological stress among students and the factors influencing stress during the COVID-19 outbreak.

"A review of current strategies to improve HIV prevention and treatment in sexual and gender minority Latinx (SGML) communities","The HIV epidemic continues to disproportionately impact sexual and gender minority Latinxs (SGML). Several syndemic conditions have been linked with HIV acquisition and transmission among SGML including immigration, discrimination, environmental racism, substance use, and mental health. We provide a summary of biomedical, behavioral, and social/structural interventions to reduce risks for acquiring HIV and improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum among SGML. We also discuss intervention approaches and opportunities that respond at the intersection of HIV and COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Effective strategies are required to adequately respond, adapt, and continue to provide health and social services during a public health emergency. There is a dire need for the combination of biomedical, behavioral, and social/structural interventions to reduce risks for acquiring HIV and improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum. Interventions and combination approaches should be driven by community-based participatory action research. The inclusion of community members in all stages of the research process can assure successful implementation of program activities and deliverables, including the provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate services. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, which is disproportionately impacting individuals living with HIV and other comorbidities, the elderly, and under-resourced communities with a ferocity not seen in other communities, intervention approaches that respond at the intersection of HIV and COVID-19 prevention and treatment are also urgently needed.","Martinez","https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2020.1819790","20200909","Biobehavioral Interventions; Community-based participatory action research; HIV/AIDS; Medical Legal Partnerships; Sexual and Gender Minority Latinxs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-10","",4507,""

Numerous nurses have been facing mental complications associated with quarantine such as psychological distress and fear. The gravity of COVID-19 pandemic is triggering further mental health challenges among nurses. The continuous stress nurses are facing, could trigger post-traumatic stress symptoms, poor service delivery, suicide ideation and suicide. Assessing and preserving the mental health of nurses and the health care workers in general is necessary for optimal disease control. Psychiatric interventions are needed to attend to the psychological need of nurses treating COVID-19 patients.

"Escalation of sleep disturbances amid the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional international study","The stress imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing social isolation could adversely affect sleep. As sleep problems may persist and hurt health, it is important to identify which populations have experienced changes in sleeping patterns during the pandemic and their extent. In Study 1, 3,062 responders from 49 countries accessed the survey website voluntarily between March 26-April 26, 2020, and 2,562 (84%; age: 45.2Ã‚Â±14.5, 68% women) completed the study. In Study 2, 1,022 adult US responders were recruited for pay through Mechanical Turk, and 971 (95%; age 40.4Ã‚Â±13.6, 52% women) completed the study. The survey tool included demographics and items adapted from validated sleep questionnaires on sleep duration, quality and timing, and sleeping pills consumption. In Study 1, 58% of the responders were unsatisfied with their sleep. Forty percent of the responders reported a decreased sleep quality vs. before COVID-19 crisis. Self-reported sleeping pill consumption increased by 20% (p&lt;0.001). Multivariable analysis indicated that female sex, being in quarantine, 31 to 45-year age group, reduced physical activity and adverse impact on livelihood were independently associated with more severe worsening of sleep quality during the pandemic. The majority of findings were reproduced in the independent cohort of Study 2. Changes imposed due to the pandemic have led to a surge in individuals reporting sleep problems across the globe. The findings raise the need to screen for worsening sleep patterns and use of sleeping aids, especially in more susceptible populations, namely, women and people with insecure livelihoods subjected to social isolation.","Mandelkorn, Genzer, Choshen-Hillel, Reiter, Meira E Cruz, Hochner, Kheirandish-Gozal, Gozal, Gileles-Hillel","https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.8800","20200909","COVID-19; insomnia; lockdown; sleep disturbances; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-10","",4511,""
"A psychiatrist's perspective from a COVID-19 epicentre: a personal account","The COVID-19 pandemic has and will have a huge impact on mental health, especially in countries that have been significantly affected, such as Spain. Here we aim to provide the perspectives of a group of psychiatrists from Barcelona, one of the epicentres of the pandemic so far, to highlight the potential fatality of a virus that caught us unaware and unprepared, and hopefully this article will be of aid to countries about to face the pandemic. The unprecedented situations that we have been faced with so far have included reconfiguring hospitals and the redeployment of healthcare professionals, with flexibility and adaptability key to managing the overload in demand. This has led to healthcare professionals being exposed to extremely stressful situations and they have had impossible decisions to make that may have mental health consequences, some of which may be severe and long lasting. A rebound effect on mental health problems is to be expected in the medium and long term, especially for healthcare professionals and psychiatric patients, necessitating a strengthening of preventive approaches and policies for mental health along with a prompt reopening of mental health services. Ways to provide psychiatric healthcare in the immediate future need to be re-evaluated, and the development of telepsychiatry services is probably to be expected.","Pacchiarotti, Anmella, Fico, Verdolini, Vieta","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.83","20200909","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; mental health; psychiatry; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-10","",4512,""

"Resilience Moderates Negative Outcome from Stress during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Moderated-Mediation Approach","Resilience refers to an individual's healthy coping abilities when encountering adverse life events. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a situation with a high amount of stress exposure, which in turn may be associated with negative emotional outcome like depressive symptoms. The current study investigated if resilience moderated the effect of stress on symptoms of depression and if anxiety symptoms mediated this association. An adult sample of community controls completed the Perceived stress scale 14 (PSS-14), the Resilience scale for adults (RSA), the Patient health questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7). Independent samples t-test, correlation analyses and moderated mediation analyses were conducted. The results showed that resilience moderated the relations between stress and anxiety symptoms (ÃŽÂ² = -0.131, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) as well as between stress and depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ² = -0.068, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In support of a moderated mediation model, resilience moderated the indirect effect of stress on depressive symptom, as confirmed by the index of moderated mediation (IMM = -0.036, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; [95% BCa: -0.055, -0.020]). The high resilience subgroup was less affected than the low resilience subgroup by the effect of stress exposure symptoms of depression, mediated by anxiety. The study shows that stress exposure is associated with symptoms of depression, and anxiety mediates this association. Level of resilience differentiates the direct and indirect effect of stress on depression. Knowledge about the effect of stress in response to a pandemic is important for developing treatment and prevention strategies for stress, depression and health-related anxiety.","Havnen, Anyan, Hjemdal, Solem, Gurigard Riksfjord, Hagen","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186461","20200909","anxiety; depression; moderated mediation; resilience; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-10","",4519,""

"Positive Impact of Mindfulness Meditation on Mental Health of Female Teachers during the COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy","The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent public health measures were shown to impact negatively on people's mental health. In particular, women were reported to be at higher risk than men of developing symptoms of stress/anxiety/depression, and resilience was considered a key factor for positive mental health outcomes. In the present study, a sample of Italian female teachers (<i>n</i> = 66, age: 51.5 Ã‚Â± 7.9 years) was assessed with self-report instruments one month before and one month after the start of the Covid-19 lockdown: mindfulness skills, empathy, personality profiles, interoceptive awareness, psychological well-being, emotional distress and burnout levels were measured. Meanwhile, they received an 8-week Mindfulness-Oriented Meditation (MOM) course, through two group meetings and six individual video-lessons. Based on baseline personality profiles, analyses of variance were performed in a low-resilience (LR, <i>n</i> = 32) and a high-resilience (HR, <i>n</i> = 26) group. The LR and HR groups differed at baseline in most of the self-report measures. Pre-post MOM significant improvements were found in both groups in anxiety, depression, affective empathy, emotional exhaustion, psychological well-being, interoceptive awareness, character traits and mindfulness levels. Improvements in depression and psychological well-being were higher in the LR vs. HR group. We conclude that mindfulness-based training can effectively mitigate the psychological negative consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak, helping in particular to restore well-being in the most vulnerable individuals.","Matiz, Fabbro, Paschetto, Cantone, Paolone, Crescentini","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186450","20200909","COVID-19; longitudinal study; mindfulness meditation; resilience; school teachers; self-reports; womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-10","",4521,""

Individual items of the identified outcome measures were linked to ICF second-level and third-level categories using ICF linking rules and categorized according to an ICF component. (3) Results: In total, 33 outcome measures were identified from 36 studies. Commonly used (a) ICF body function measures were Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT), Impact of event scale (IES-R) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); (b) ICF activity was 6-Minute Walking Distance (6MWD); (c) ICF participation measures included Short Form-36 (SF-36) and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). ICF environmental factors and personal factors were rarely measured.

"Evaluation of Mental Health Factors among People with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic","There are considerable psychological and psychiatric consequences of the pandemic. Researchers have started to take into account the real or perceived sense of social threats that may be expressed, such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. However, analyses on pandemic-related anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders mostly rarely addresses the situation of people with autoimmune diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the mental health factors among people with systemic lupus erythematosus by quantifying the severity of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In total, 723 people took part in the study. The study group consisted of 134 individuals with a systemic lupus erythematosus. The control group consisted of 589 people without systemic lupus erythematosus. The regression adjusted by age, gender, and diagnosis of other chronic diseases showed individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus were at a much higher risk of elevated symptoms of anxiety on the GAD-7 scale (OR = 3.683; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), depression on the PHQ-9 scale (OR = 4.183; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and sleep disorders on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale (OR = 6.781; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).
