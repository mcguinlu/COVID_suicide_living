"Trajectories of child emotional and behavioural difficulties before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in a longitudinal UK cohort","Importance COVID-19 public health mitigation measures are likely to have detrimental effects on emotional and behavioural problems in children. However, longitudinal studies with pre-pandemic data are scarce. Objective To explore trajectories of emotional and behavioural difficulties in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design and setting Data were from children from the third generation of a birth cohort study; the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children - Generation 2 (ALSPAC-G2) in the southwest of England. Participants The study population comprised of 708 children (median age at COVID data collection was 4.4 years, SD=2.9, IQR= [2.2 to 6.9]), whose parents provided previous pre-pandemic surveys and a survey between 26 May and 5 July 2020 that focused on information about the COVID-19 pandemic as restrictions from the first lockdown in the UK were eased. Exposures We employed multi-level mixed effects modelling with random intercepts and slopes to examine whether trajectories of emotional and behavioural difficulties (a combined total difficulties score) during the pandemic differ from expected pre-pandemic trajectories. Main outcomes Children had up to seven measurements of emotional and behavioural difficulties from infancy to late childhood, using developmentally appropriate scales such as the Emotionality Activity Sociability Temperament Survey in infancy and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in childhood. Results The observed normative pattern of emotional and behavioural difficulties in children pre-pandemic, was characterised by an increase in scores during infancy peaking around the age of 2, and then declining throughout the rest of childhood. Pre-pandemic, the decline in difficulties scores after age 2 was 0.6 points per month; but was approximately one third of that in post-pandemic trajectories (there was a difference in mean rate of decline after age 2 of 0.2 points per month in pre vs during pandemic trajectories [95 % CI: 0.10 to 0.30, p <0.001]). This lower decline in scores over the years translated to older children having pandemic difficulty scores higher than would be expected from pre-pandemic trajectories (for example, an estimated 10.0 point (equivalent of 0.8 standard deviations) higher score (95% CI: 5.0 to 15.0) by age 8.5 years). Results remained similar although somewhat attenuated after adjusting for maternal anxiety and age. Conclusion and relevance The COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with greater persistence of emotional and behavioural difficulties after the age 2. Emotional difficulties in childhood predict later mental health problems. Further evidence and monitoring of emotional and behavioural difficulties are required to fully understand the potential role of the pandemic on young children.","Elise Paul; Daphne Kounali; Alex Siu Fung Kwong; Daniel Smith; Ilaria Costantini; Deborah A Lawlor; Kapil Sayal; Helen Bould; Nicholas J Timpson; Kate Northstone; Melanie Lewcock; Kate J Tilling; Rebecca Pearson","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.11.21257040","20210513","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-14","",13689,""
"Cardiogenic Shock due to COVID-19-Related Myocarditis in a 19-Year-Old Autistic Patient","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly responsible for respiratory involvement but cardiac complications are also reported. Nevertheless, potential life-threatening conditions in young people have not been described. A 19-year-old male autistic patient was admitted with fever and cough. The chest radiography showed viral pneumonia and the nasopharyngeal swab detected SARS-CoV-2. He rapidly developed hypotension, oliguria and increased myocardial injury markers and was treated with adrenaline, antiviral drugs and mechanical ventilation. Echocardiography revealed diffuse myocardial hypo-akinesia and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). After several days of treatment, the patient was weaned off mechanical ventilation, LVEF recovered to 50% and laboratory tests showed a decrease of markers of myocardial injury. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can therefore severely affect myocardium with life-threatening complications and even young people can be involved.","Pascariello, Cimino, Calvi, Bernardi, Grigolato, Garyfallidis, Fabbricatore, Pezzola, Lombardi, Metra, Vizzardi","https://doi.org/10.14740/jmc3517","20210513","COVID-19; Cardiogenic shock; Echocardiography; Myocarditis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-14","",13690,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic and Uptake in Suicide Attempt Among Young People of Minority Population: A Case Series","The first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan China on December 31, 2019. COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. To reduce the spread of this virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommended self and mandatory quarantine of exposed individuals and self-isolation. However, the psychological impact of this pandemic includes new onset or worsening of existing mental illnesses which include but are not limited to anxiety, depression from social isolation, eating disorders, and uptake in suicidality either in isolation or part of mental illness symptomatology. In the USA, suicide is the second leading cause of death among people aged 10 - 34 years while globally, it is the second cause of death among people aged 15 - 29 years.

"Psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on university students: Understanding apprehensions through a phenomenographic approach","Limited evidence exists to help understand the experiences of university students in relation to the long-term lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For that reason, we conducted a study using a phenomenographic approach in order to understand how university students perceive COVID-19 and the associated lockdown. Data were collected from 25 students in Pakistan. They were asked to demonstrate the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in illustrations. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with these students, to gain further insights into their perspectives on the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis revealed four interlinked directions for understanding students' experiences. These themes were: 1) escape into peace, 2) hope for personal freedom, 3) fear of becoming a victim of COVID-19, and 4) concerns regarding education, future career, and opportunities. All four themes were analyzed and condensed into an outcome space, which further gathers the perceptions of students under one theme as &quot;Hope for life while paradoxically living with fear&quot;. Studying the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on students not only highlighted their concerns, but also emphasized the importance of starting regular psychological evaluations and stress-releasing sessions, along with online education to overcome growing depression.","Shahbaz, Ashraf, Zakar, Fischer, Zakar","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251641","20210513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-14","",13692,""
"&quot;Web-based, second-best togetherness&quot;: Psychosocial group intervention with children of Holocaust survivors during COVID-19","Evidence from multiple samples of trauma-exposed populations across the globe suggests that intergenerational trauma constitutes a biopsychological risk factor which manifests itself throughout the life cycle of offspring of trauma survivors. Prior empirical studies have shown that adult children of Holocaust survivors (OHS, also referred to in select quotes as 2G for &quot;Second Generation&quot;) are vulnerable to life-threatening situations. This study aimed to examine the reactions of OHS to the COVID-19 pandemic, which posed a serious threat to the lives of many, in particular to older adults. As they enter middle age, OHS were observed to have more medical health issues and less positive perceptions of their own aging relative to peers. Less positive subjective aging was associated with more negative psychiatric symptoms in relation to Covid-19-related loneliness, further suggesting that OHS are a group of aging adults with particular vulnerabilities to negative mental health effects of the pandemic and of the social distancing and isolation it imposed. This study is a qualitative report of experiences expressed by over 1,200 participants in several web-based interactive webinars for OHS during the period of &quot;shelter at home&quot; in March and April 2020. It is proposed that this format of &quot;web-based, second-best&quot; way of being together, an intervention that emerged spontaneously in response to the coronavirus and social distancing, offers a novel, nonpathologizing, effective form of supportive psychosocial intervention uniquely suited to the unprecedented challenges experienced during times requiring social distancing.

"Caring for healthcare providers in COVID-19","There is concern for the mental health of healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we focus on the protective strategies that all people, but in this case healthcare providers, use when facing danger and how specific preventive responses could reduce the mental health burden to nurses, doctors, and emergency medical personnel working in hospitals. Our primary contributions are to demonstrate that healthcare providers are not a homogeneous group regarding mental health risks and that, consequently, individuals might need different forms of preventive and ameliorative response. We propose some (a) universally beneficial approaches, (b) strategy-specific approaches, and (c) strategy-specific contra-indicated approaches. Our two central points are that there are important psychological differences among healthcare providers and that these create different mental health needs in the COVID-19 crisis and require different protective solutions.

"The prefrontal cortex in a pandemic: Restoring functions with system-, family-, and individual-focused interventions","The COVID-19 pandemic is an unanticipated and uncontrollable chronic stressor that is detrimental to the mental and behavioral health of children and families, particularly those from disadvantaged and marginalized backgrounds. Chronic stress impairs a myriad of prefrontal cortical functions, important for coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, and has consequences on dyadic parent-child functioning. Informed by neuroscience and clinical evidence, sensitive parenting is a vital avenue of intervention that buffers against the toxic effects of COVID-19 on parent-child mental health. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we first discuss the neurobiological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms behind exacerbated mental health risks in families. We then highlight the role of sensitive parenting as a buffer against stress-related mental health problems, and conclude with recommendations for systemic-, family-, and individual-interventions to most effectively address stress-related mental health problems and their impact on children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Post-ICU Care in the Outpatient Setting","More than 5 million patients in the United States are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) annually, and an increasing percentage of patients treated in the ICU survive to hospital discharge. Because these patients require follow-up in the outpatient setting, family physicians should be prepared to provide ongoing care and screening for post-ICU complications. Risk factors for complications after ICU discharge include previous ICU admissions, preexisting mental illness, greater number of comorbidities, and prolonged mechanical ventilation or higher opioid exposure while in the ICU. Early nutritional support and mobilization in the ICU decrease the risk of complications. After ICU discharge, patients should be screened for depression, anxiety, insomnia, and cognitive impairment using standardized screening tools. Physicians should also inquire about weakness, fatigue, neuropathy, and functional impairment and perform a targeted physical examination and laboratory evaluation as indicated; treatment depends on the underlying cause. Exercise regimens are beneficial for reducing several post-ICU complications. Patients who were treated for COVID-19 in the ICU may require additional instruction on reducing the risk of virus transmission. Telemedicine and telerehabilitation allow patients with COVID-19 to receive effective care without increasing exposure risk in communities, hospitals, and medical offices.","Wilbur, Rockafellow, Shian","https://www.google.com/search?q=Post-ICU+Care+in+the+Outpatient+Setting.","20210513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-14","",13696,""

"The contribution of hypochondria resulting from Corona virus on the occupational productivity loss through increased job stress and decreased resilience in the central workshop of an oil refinery: A path analysis","The prevalence of contagious viral-infectious diseases such as COVID19 cause the economic problems in addition to harmful effect on the people health. The present study was aimed to determine the contribution of hypochondria resulting from Corona virus on the occupational productivity loss through increased job stress and decreased resilience in the central workshop of an oil refinery. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 275 subjects in the spring of 2020 in one of the oil and gas industries in southern Iran. To collect the data, the demographic, standard hypochondria, CD-RSC resilience, job stress, productivity questionnaires were sent electronically along with a guide to completing them, as well as study objectives. People were given two weeks to complete the questionnaires and send them electronically to the research team. Participation rate was 80%. Finally, a model based on the defaults was developed in AMOS software and the relationships between the variables were examined. The results showed that corona hypochondria could affect productivity in two ways. In the first place, hypochondria significantly increases job stress, thereby reducing productivity. The indirect effect of hypochondria on productivity in this direction was -0.09. In another way, hypochondria significantly reduces resilience and thus lowers productivity. The effect of hypochondria on productivity was equal to -0.04. Based on the results, the fit of the drawn model was confirmed. The results of the study generally suggested that coronavirus disease has caused the spread of hypochondria mental disorder. Hypochondria could reduce the productivity of workers through two ways of increasing job stress and reducing workers' resilience.","Yazdanirad, Sadeghian, Jahadi Naeini, Abbasi, Mousavi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06808","20210513","Corona virus; Hypochondria; Job stress; Occupational productivity; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-14","",13698,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health of Healthcare Workers: A Cross-Sectional Study From Pakistan","<b>Background:</b> The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly increased the rate of mortality and morbidity worldwide due to its rapid transmission rate. The mental health status of individuals could have a negative impact attributed to this global situation. Therefore, this study was intended to explore the symptoms of depression and anxiety among healthcare workers (HCWs) of Pakistan during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional survey was undertaken by administering a web-based questionnaire between May and June 2020. Two tools, including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), were employed to measure anxiety and depression symptoms among HCWs. The data analyses were carried out using descriptive statistics, Man Whitney, and Kruskal Wallis tests. <b>Results:</b> Of 1094 HCWs who participated in this online survey, 742 (67.8%) were physicians, followed by nurses (<i>n</i> = 277, 25.3%) and pharmacists (<i>n</i> = 75, 6.9%). The survey respondents had a median depression and anxiety score of 5.00 (7.00-3.00) and 8.00 (11.00-5.00), respectively. A considerable number of HCWs (82.2%) utilized online psychological resources to deal with their psychological distress. Female HCWs, nurses, frontline HCWs, and HCWs aged 30-49 years were more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> During the recent ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, there is a mild level of symptoms of depression and anxiety among HCWs.

"Prevalence and Factors Associated with Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh: A Survey-Based Cross-Sectional Study","Feelings of isolation, insecurity, and instability triggered by COVID-19 could have a long-term impact on the mental health status of individuals. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of mental health symptoms (anxiety, depression, and stress) in Bangladesh and the factors associated with these symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. From 1 to 30 April 2020, we used a validated self-administered questionnaire to conduct a cross-sectional study on 10,609 participants through an online survey platform. We assessed mental health status using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The total depression, anxiety, and stress subscale scores were divided into normal, mild, moderate, severe, and multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 15%, 34%, and 15% for mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 59% for severe anxiety symptoms, 14% for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 14% for mild anxiety symptoms, while the prevalence for stress levels were 16% for severe stress level, 22% for moderate stress level, and 13% for mild stress level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the most consistent factors associated with mild, moderate, and severe of the three mental health subscales (depression, anxiety, and stress) were respondents who lived in Dhaka and Rangpur division, females, those who self-quarantined in the previous seven days before the survey, and those respondents who experienced chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, and sore throat. Our results showed that about 64%, 87%, and 61% of the respondents in Bangladesh reported high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively.

"Is COVID-19 Keeping us Up at Night? Stress, Anxiety, and Sleep Among Adult Twins","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a variety of social distancing measures to mitigate the virus outbreak have been implemented. These measures may have unintended consequences on individuals' well-being, such as increased stress, anxiety, and sleep disruptions. We investigated the extent to which individuals' mental health status is associated with perceived changes in sleep amount and sleep quality among a sample of adult twin pairs (<i>N</i> = 909 pairs; 77% MZ, 23% DZ), less than a month after the outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. About half of participants reported no change in sleep amount (50.1%) or sleep quality (55.6%). Approximately one-third of the participants had increased amount of sleep (29.8%), and 32.9% reported a decrease in sleep quality. We found that stress and anxiety levels were associated with sleep reduction (ORs = 2.36 and 3.12 for stress and anxiety, respectively) and poorer sleep quality (ORs = 2.45 and 3.73 for stress and anxiety, respectively), even after taking into account between-family confounds. A much smaller association was observed between levels of stress and anxiety and increased sleep amount (ORs = 1.42 and 1.60 for stress and anxiety, respectively) and sleep quality (OR = 1.21 and 1.29 for stress and anxiety, respectively), which was no longer significant after controlling for between-family confounds.

"Assessment of physicians' resilience level during the COVID-19 pandemic","We aim to assess physicians' level of resilience and define factors that improve or decrease the resilience level during the COVID-19 pandemic. Physicians from hospitals located in areas with different COVID-19 caseload levels, were invited to participate in a national e-survey between April and May 2020. Study participants were mainly emergency physicians, and anaesthesiologists, infectious disease consultants, and intensive care. The survey assessed participant's characteristics, factors potentially associated with resilience, and resilience using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (RISC-25), with higher scores indicative of greater resilience. Factors associated with the resilience score were assessed using a multivariable linear regression. Of 451 responding physicians involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, 442 were included (98%). Age was 36.1 Ã‚Â± 10.3 years and 51.8% were male; 63% worked in the emergency department (n = 282), 10.4% in anesthesiology (n = 46), 9.9% in infectious disease department (n = 44), 4.8% in intensive care unit (n = 21) or other specialties (n = 49). The median RISC-25 score was at 69 (IQR 62-75). Factors associated with higher RISC scores were anesthesia as a specialty, parenthood, no previous history of anxiety or depression and nor increased anxiety. To conclude, this study is the first to characterize levels of resilience among physicians involved in COVID-19 unit. Our data points to certain protective characteristics and some detrimental factors, such as anxiety or depression, that could be amenable to remediating or preventing strategies to promote resilience and support caregivers in a pandemic.","Douillet, Caillaud, Riou, Miroux, Thibaud, Noizet, Oberlin, LÃƒÂ©ger, Mahieu, Riquin, Javaudin, Morin, Moumneh, Savary, Roy, Hugli","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01395-7","20210513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-14","",13702,""
"International survey for assessing COVID-19's impact on fear and health: study protocol","COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, has been one of the most highly contagious and rapidly spreading virus outbreak. The pandemic not only has catastrophic impacts on physical health and economy around the world, but also the psychological well-being of individuals, communities and society. The psychological and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic internationally have not been well described. There is a lack of international study assessing health-related impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially on the degree to which individuals are fearful of the pandemic. Therefore, this study aims to (1) assess the health-related impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in community-dwelling individuals around the world; (2) determine the extent various communities are fearful of COVID-19 and (3) identify perceived needs of the population to prepare for potential future pandemics. This global study involves 30 countries. For each country, we target at least 500 subjects aged 18 years or above. The questionnaires will be available online and in local languages. The questionnaires include assessment of the health impacts of COVID-19, perceived importance of future preparation for the pandemic, fear, lifestyles, sociodemographics, COVID-19-related knowledge, e-health literacy, out-of-control scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe participants' characteristics, perceptions on the health-related impacts of COVID-19, fear, anxiety and depression, lifestyles, COVID-19 knowledge, e-health literacy and other measures. Univariable and multivariable regression models will be used to assess the associations of covariates on the outcomes.

The severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and distress were assessed by the Chinese versions of 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder, 7-item Insomnia Severity Index and 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression and structural equation modelling was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. A total of 610 psychiatric professionals were included. 29.8% were employed in Wuhan, and 22.5% were frontline workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (461 (75.6%)), anxiety (282 (46.2%)), insomnia (336 (55.1%)) and mental stress (481 (78.9%)). Psychiatric symptoms were associated with worrying about infection (eg, OR 2.36 (95% CI 1.27 to 4.39) for anxiety), risks of exposure to COVID-19 (eg, having inadequate personal protection equipment, OR 2.43 (1.32 to 4.47) for depression) and self-perceived physical health (eg, OR 3.22 (2.24 to 4.64) for mental stress). Information sources of COVID-19 were also found to be both positively (eg, information from relatives, OR 2.16 (1.46 to 3.21) for mental stress) and negatively (eg, information from TV, OR 0.52 (0.35 to 0.77) for mental stress) associated with mental stress. There is preliminary evidence that mental health might benefit from greater availability of mental healthcare services. The structural equation model analysis indicated that worrying about infection may be the primary mediator via which risk of exposure to COVID-19 pandemic affects the mental health of psychiatric professionals. The current findings demonstrate several pathways via which the COVID-19 pandemic may have negatively affected the mental health of psychiatric professionals in China.","Guo, McCutcheon, Pillinger, Arumuham, Chen, Ma, Yang, Wang, Hu, Wang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047828","20210513","COVID-19; mental health; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-14","",13704,""
"Let It Out (LIO) study: protocol for a mixed-methods study to optimise the design and assess the feasibility of an online emotional disclosure-based intervention in UK hospices","The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced hospices to look for more ways to support people remotely, including psychological support. Emotional disclosure-based interventions hold potential as a way of providing support remotely. However, evidence of their efficacy in people with terminal illness is mixed. Reviews have highlighted this may be due to interventions not being tailored to the unique needs of this population. In response to this, we are developing Let It Out (LIO), an online, self-guided emotional disclosure-based intervention tailored for people living with terminal illness. The primary objective of the study is to optimise the design of the LIO intervention. Secondary objectives include assessing its acceptability and feasibility; exploring potential impact on well-being; identifying potential adverse effects; and informing choice of outcome measures for potential future evaluation. A single arm, mixed-methods, multisite, longitudinal study. Up to 40 people living with a terminal illness under the care of hospices in England and Scotland will receive the online LIO intervention. LIO consists of 3, self-guided expression sessions over 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. The primary outcome measures are (1) a structured feedback form completed by participants after the final expression session; and (2) semi-structured interviews and focus groups with Ã¢â€°Â¤15 patient participants, Ã¢â€°Â¤30 hospice staff and Ã¢â€°Â¤15 informal carers. These quantitative and qualitative data will be triangulated via process evaluation to inform optimisation of the intervention design. Secondary outcome measures include validated measures of physical and psychological health collected at baseline and after the final expression session (immediately, 1, 4 and 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks after); and data on recruitment, retention and fidelity. The study is approved by the University College London Research Ethics Committee (reference: 15281/002). The findings will be shared through peer-reviewed scientific journals and conferences, and traditional, online and social media platforms.","McInnerney, Candy, Stone, Kupeli","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047135","20210513","mental health; palliative care; psychiatry; qualitative research; statistics &amp; research methods","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-14","",13705,""
"How is the COVID-19 lockdown impacting the mental health of parents of school-age children in the UK? A cross-sectional online survey","Investigate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on feelings of loneliness and social isolation in parents of school-age children. Cross-sectional online survey of parents of primary and secondary school-age children. Community setting. 1214 parents of school-age children in the UK. An online survey explored the impact of lockdown on the mental health of parents with school-age children, and in particular about feelings of social isolation and loneliness. Associations between the UCLA Three-Item Loneliness Scale (UCLATILS), the Direct Measure of Loneliness (DMOL) and the characteristics of the study participants were assessed using ordinal logistic regression models. Self-reported measures of social isolation and loneliness using UCLATILS and DMOL. Half of respondents felt they lacked companionship, 45% had feelings of being left out, 58% felt isolated and 46% felt lonely during the first 100 days of lockdown. The factors that were associated with higher levels of loneliness on UCLATILS were female gender, parenting a child with special needs, lack of a dedicated space for distance learning, disruption of sleep patterns and low levels of physical activity during the lockdown. Factors associated with a higher DMOL were female gender, single parenting, parenting a child with special needs, unemployment, low physical activity, lack of a dedicated study space and disruption of sleep patterns during the lockdown. The COVID-19 lockdown has increased feelings of social isolation and loneliness among parents of school-age children. The sustained adoption of two modifiable health-seeking lifestyle behaviours (increased levels of physical activity and the maintenance of good sleep hygiene practices) wmay help reduce feelings of social isolation and loneliness during lockdown.","El-Osta, Alaa, Webber, Riboli Sasco, Bagkeris, Millar, Vidal-Hall, Majeed","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043397","20210513","epidemiology; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-14","",13706,""
"A qualitative study of experiences of NHS mental healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic","The Covid-19 pandemic has imposed extraordinary strains on healthcare workers. But, in contrast with acute settings, relatively little attention has been given to those who work in mental health settings. We aimed to characterise the experiences of those working in English NHS secondary mental health services during the first wave of the pandemic. The design was a qualitative interview-based study. We conducted semi-structured, remote (telephone or online) interviews with 35 members of staff from NHS secondary (inpatient and community) mental health services in England. Analysis was based on the constant comparative method. Participants reported wide-ranging changes in the organisation of secondary mental health care and the nature of work in response to the pandemic, including pausing of all services deemed to be &quot;non-essential&quot;, deployment of staff across services to new and unfamiliar roles, and moves to remote working. The quality of participants' working life was impaired by increasing levels of daily challenge associated with trying to provide care in trying and constrained circumstances, the problems of forging new ways of working remotely, and constraints on ability to access informal support. Participants were confronted with difficult dilemmas relating to clinical decision-making, prioritisation of care, and compromises in ability to perform the therapeutic function of their roles. Other dilemmas centred on trying to balance the risks of controlling infection with the need for human contact. Many reported features of moral injury linked to their perceived failures in providing the quality or level of care that they felt service users needed. They sometimes sought to compensate for deficits in care through increased advocacy, taking on additional tasks, or making exceptions, but this led to further personal strain. Many experienced feelings of grief, helplessness, isolation, distress, and burnout. These problems were compounded by sometimes poor communication about service changes and by staff feeling that they could not take time off because of the potential impact on others. Some reported feeling poorly supported by organisations. Mental health workers faced multiple adversities during the pandemic that were highly consequential for their wellbeing. These findings can help in identifying targets for support.","Liberati, Richards, Willars, Scott, Boydell, Parker, Pinfold, Martin, Dixon-Woods, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03261-8","20210513","Covid-19; Healthcare workers; Mental health services; Qualitative; Staff","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-14","",13707,""
"Protocol for the Mason: Health Starts Here prospective cohort study of young adult college students","Young adulthood is a period of increasing independence for the 40% of young adults enrolled in U.S. colleges. Previous research indicates differences in how students' health behaviors develop and vary by gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. George Mason University is a state institution that enrolls a highly diverse student population, making it an ideal setting to launch a longitudinal cohort study using multiple research methods to evaluate the effects of health behaviors on physical and psychological functioning, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mason: Health Starts Here was developed as a longitudinal cohort study of successive waves of first year students that aims to improve understanding of the natural history and determinants of young adults' physical health, mental health, and their role in college completion. The study recruits first year students who are 18 to 24Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old and able to read and understand English. All incoming first year students are recruited through various methods to participate in a longitudinal cohort for 4 years. Data collection occurs in fall and spring semesters, with online surveys conducted in both semesters and in-person clinic visits conducted in the fall. Students receive physical examinations during clinic visits and provide biospecimens (blood and saliva). The study will produce new knowledge to help understand the development of health-related behaviors during young adulthood. A long-term goal of the cohort study is to support the design of effective, low-cost interventions to encourage young adults' consistent performance of healthful behaviors, improve their mental health, and improve academic performance.","Cuellar, Adams, de Jonge, Espina, Espinoza, Fischer, Frankenfeld, Hines, Kornienko, Lawrence, Rana, Ramezani, Rossheim, Short, Waithaka, Wilson, Cheskin","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10969-5","20210513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-14","",13708,""
"Investigating the burden of mental distress among nurses at a provincial COVID-19 referral hospital in Indonesia: a cross-sectional study","The current outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has distorted the physical, mental, and psychological condition of frontline healthcare providers in health facilities. This study aims to investigate the prevalence, and risk factors of depression, anxiety, and stress among nurses working in a COVID-19 referral hospital in Indonesia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 491 nurses, aged between 31, and 56 years, using a self-administered questionnaire. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21), and demographic questions were used to screen the presence of psychological problems, and their associated factors. The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety and stress was 8.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°%, 20.6 and 6.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°%, respectively. Regression analysis showed that anxiety was significantly higher among nurses working in non-COVID wards (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01), those who experienced social rejection (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05), and those who frequently watched television (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). Those who had temporary contracts were more stressed (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05), and those who faced financial hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly experienced depression, anxiety, and stress at 10.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°%, 23.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°%, and 8.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°% respectively(pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). While the prevalence of mental distress in this hospital is low, it exists, and hospital management should consider training for all nurses, public sensitization on COVID-19, and provision of financial subsidies for frontline workers, in order to manage the risk factors.","Marthoenis, Maskur, Fathiariani, Nassimbwa","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-021-00596-1","20210513","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Financial; Nurse; Prevalence; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-14","",13709,""
"Psychological outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant women in Indonesia: a cross-sectional study","The objective of this study was to analyze the psychological outcomes of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in several areas that are epicenters for the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in Indonesia. This cross-sectional study used data obtained from an online survey administered to 120 women who were pregnant and gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. The psychological condition of pregnant women was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 questionnaire which was modified for conditions experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We classified pregnant women into 2 groups according to their psychological condition: pregnant women who experienced anxiety and pregnant women who did not experience anxiety or felt normal. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was undertaken for the 2 groups. This study also used univariate analysis and bivariate analysis. The results of the ROC analysis resulted in a cutoff score of 3.56. The proportion of respondents who felt anxious was 53.3% and the proportion of respondents who did not feel anxious or felt normal was 46.7%. Anxiety was most common among pregnant women with high education levels, gestational age &lt;19 weeks, and working pregnant women. Maternal health services need to be performed with strict health protocols, complemented by pregnancy counseling services. This will provide a feeling of comfort and safety as pregnant women receive health services and give birth.","Nurrizka, Nurdiantami, Makkiyah","https://doi.org/10.24171/j.phrp.2021.12.2.05","20210513","COVID-19; Pregnant women; Psychological outcomes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-14","",13710,""
"Protective Behaviors and Secondary Harms Resulting From Nonpharmaceutical Interventions During the COVID-19 Epidemic in South Africa: Multisite, Prospective Longitudinal Study","In March 2020, South Africa implemented strict nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain the spread of COVID-19. Over the subsequent 5 months, NPI policies were eased in stages according to a national strategy. COVID-19 spread throughout the country heterogeneously; the disease reached rural areas by July and case numbers peaked from July to August. A second COVID-19 wave began in late 2020. Data on the impact of NPI policies on social and economic well-being and access to health care are limited. We aimed to determine how rural residents in three South African provinces changed their behaviors during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave. The South African Population Research Infrastructure Network nodes in the Mpumalanga (Agincourt), KwaZulu-Natal, (Africa Health Research Institute) and Limpopo (Dikgale-Mamabolo-Mothiba) provinces conducted up to 14 rounds of longitudinal telephone surveys among randomly sampled households from rural and periurban surveillance populations every 2-3 weeks. Interviews included questions on the following topics: COVID-19-related knowledge and behaviors, the health and economic impacts of NPIs, and mental health. We analyzed how responses varied based on NPI stringency and household sociodemographics. In total, 5120 households completed 23,095 interviews between April and December 2020. Respondents' self-reported satisfaction with their COVID-19-related knowledge and face mask use rapidly rose to 85% and 95%, respectively, by August. As selected NPIs were eased, the amount of travel increased, economic losses were reduced, and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms fell. When the number of COVID-19 cases spiked at one node in July, the amount of travel dropped rapidly and the rate of missed daily medications doubled. Households where more adults received government-funded old-age pensions reported concerns about economic matters and medication access less often. South Africans complied with stringent, COVID-19-related NPIs despite the threat of substantial social, economic, and health repercussions. Government-supported social welfare programs appeared to buffer interruptions in income and health care access during local outbreaks. Epidemic control policies must be balanced against the broader well-being of people in resource-limited settings and designed with parallel support systems when such policies threaten peoples' income and access to basic services.","Harling, GÃƒÂ³mez-OlivÃƒÂ©, Tlouyamma, Mutevedzi, Kabudula, Mahlako, Singh, Ohene-Kwofie, Buckland, Ndagurwa, Gareta, Gunda, Mngomezulu, Nxumalo, Wong, Kahn, Siedner, Maimela, Tollman, Collinson, Herbst","https://doi.org/10.2196/26073","20210513","COVID-19; South Africa; behaviour change; economic well-being; health care access; health knowledge; mental health; nonpharmaceutical interventions; surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-14","",13711,""
