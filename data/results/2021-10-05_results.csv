"Words are not just words: how the use of media language in the COVID-19 era affects public health","Language can shape the way we perceive the world. In this paper, we investigated how exposure to media texts containing alarming and militaristic language affects peoples' notions regarding COVID-19 and the consequences of this effect on public health. The participants filled a questionnaire in which they were asked to read a passage including either alarming and militaristic or neutral terminology on COVID-19, and then answer four questions on a Likert-point scale. The questions assessed the participants' notions on the end of the pandemic, the vaccine effectiveness, and the consequences on the economies and mental health. Ordinal regression models in R were used for the analysis. Individuals who were exposed to alarming and militaristic language developed more pessimistic notions regarding COVID-19 in comparison to those who were exposed to a more neutral language. However, both groups of individuals had similar notions regarding vaccine effectiveness. The media should redefine the language they use for the description of the pandemic, considering that the extensive use of alarming and militaristic terminology may have a negative impact on public health.","Georgiou","https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2021072","20211004","COVID-19; epidemiology; language; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18553,""
"The role of equanimity in mediating the relationship between psychological distress and social isolation during COVID-19","Social isolation and the impact on mental health is a major concern during COVID-19. Trait equanimity is expected toÃ‚Â protect individuals from psychological distress associated with social isolation. The aim of this study is to examine the link between social isolation and psychological distress via the mediator equanimity.Ã‚Â ItÃ‚Â wasÃ‚Â hypothesised that objectiveÃ‚Â (few social contacts) andÃ‚Â perceived social isolationÃ‚Â (loneliness)Ã‚Â wouldÃ‚Â predict psychological distress and that equanimityÃ‚Â wouldÃ‚Â mediate theseÃ‚Â relationships. Five hundred and seventy-eight adult United States participants were recruited and completed measures of objective social isolation and perceived social isolation (De Jong Gierveld Social Isolation scale), trait equanimity (Phenomenological Experience of Meditative Equanimity Scale), and psychological distress (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, Short Form, DASS-21). Objective social isolation negatively predicted psychological distress, but equanimity did not mediate this relationship. Perceived social isolation positively predicted psychological distress and equanimity mediated this relationship. This study is limited by its cross-sectional and self-report design and by a United States sample, which may affect the generalisability of findings. Rather than a lack of social contact it is the ""perceived"" nature of isolation that is related to psychological distress and this relationship indirectly operates through trait equanimity. Individuals high in trait equanimity may be better protected from the impact of perceived social isolation. Clinical interventions can be adapted to include equanimity skills to mitigate perceived social isolation for individuals and reduce adverse outcomes.","Mann, Walker","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.09.087","20211004","COVID-19; Loneliness; Mindfulness; Psychological distress; Social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18554,""
"Functional connectivity of amygdala subregions predicts vulnerability to depression following the COVID-19 pandemic","The amygdala is vital in processing psychological stress and predicting vulnerability or resilience to stress-related disorders. This study aimed to build the link between functional magnetic resonance imaging data obtained before the stress event and the subsequent stress-related depressive symptoms. Neuroimaging data obtained before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic from 39 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 61 health controls (HCs) were used in this study. The participants were divided retrospectively into four groups in accordance with the severity of depressive symptoms during the pandemic: remitted patients, non-remitted patients, depressed HCs (HCd) and non-depressed HCs (HCnd). Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses of the amygdala and its subregions, including centromedial (CM), basolateral and superficial (SF), were performed. Vulnerability to depression was suggested by the decreased rsFC between the left CM amygdala and the bilateral lingual gyrus in the HCd group compared with the HCnd group, and decreased rsFC of the left CM or right SF amygdala with the precuneus and the postcentral gyrus in the HCd group compared with patients with MDD. No evidence supports the rsFC of the amygdala or its subregions as a biomarker for the resilience of patients with MDD to stress under antidepressant treatment. Smaller sample size and no longitudinal neuroimaging data. Our findings suggest that the rsFC of amygdala subregions may represent a neurobiological marker of vulnerability to depression following stress.","Zhang, Cui, Zhang, Wang, Liu, Chen, Feng, Zhou, Zhou, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.09.107","20211004","Amygdala; COVID-19; Depression; Resting-state functional connectivity; Vulnerability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18555,""
"Physical and mental health impact of COVID-19 on children, adolescents, and their families: The Collaborative Outcome study on Health and Functioning during Infection Times - Children and Adolescents (COH-FIT-C&amp;A)","The COVID-19 pandemic has altered daily routines and family functioning, led to closing schools, and dramatically limited social interactions worldwide. Measuring its impact on mental health of vulnerable children and adolescents is crucial. The Collaborative Outcome study on Health and Functioning during Infection Times (COH-FIT - www.coh-fit.com) is an on-line anonymous survey, available in 30 languages, involving &gt;220 investigators from 49 countries supported by national/international professional associations. COH-FIT has thee waves (until the pandemic is declared over by the WHO, and 6-18 months plus 24-36 months after its end). In addition to adults, COH-FIT also includes adolescents (age 14-17 years), and children (age 6-13 years), recruited via non-probability/snowball and representative sampling and assessed via self-rating and parental rating. Non-modifiable/modifiable risk factors/treatment targets to inform prevention/intervention programs to promote health and prevent mental and physical illness in children and adolescents will be generated by COH-FIT. Co-primary outcomes are changes in well-being (WHO-5) and a composite psychopathology P-Score. Multiple behavioral, family, coping strategy and service utilization factors are also assessed, including functioning and quality of life. Up to June 2021, over 13,000 children and adolescents from 59 countries have participated in the COH-FIT project, with representative samples from eleven countries. Cross-sectional and anonymous design. Evidence generated by COH-FIT will provide an international estimate of the COVID-19 effect on children's, adolescents' and families', mental and physical health, well-being, functioning and quality of life, informing the formulation of present and future evidence-based interventions and policies to minimize adverse effects of the present and future pandemics on youth.","Solmi, Correll","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.09.090","20211004","COVID-19; adolescents; children; mental health; pandemic; physical health; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18556,""
"Postpartum depressive symptoms of Brazilian women during the COVID-19 pandemic measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale","The COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to concerns about its potential impact on the mental health of pregnant and postpartum women as the general postpartum depression rates increased. Three postpartum questionnaires (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale - EPDS; Anxiety and Depression Scale - HAD; and a demographic questionnaire about isolation and information acquisition) were used to evaluate the mental health of women with and without COVID-19 and determine the factors associated with depressive symptoms (EPDS Ã¢â€°Â¥ 12). Data from 184 participants with a mean of 56 postpartum days were analyzed. The rate of symptoms compatible with postpartum depression (PPD) was 38.8%, with a 14.3% positive response to item 10 on the EPDS (suicidal ideation - SI). Listening to the news about COVID-19 averaged 4.45 hours a day. Factors related to PPD were concerns about lack of hospital beds (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2.45), absence of a partner (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2.70), and anxiety symptoms (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯10). Factors related to SI were anxiety symptoms (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.56) and friends as a source of information (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯5.60). Considering the rapidly changing epidemiological conditions of this pandemic, this study may only be the photograph of an instant.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of College Students in India: Cross-sectional Web-Based Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has created a mental health crisis among college students in India due to lockdown restrictions, overwhelming numbers of COVID-19 cases, financial difficulty, etc. This mental health crisis has led to high degrees of fear, anxiety, and depression among college students. The aim of this study is to investigate symptoms of fear, depression, and anxiety due to the COVID-19 pandemic among college students in India. This cross-sectional web-based study was conducted using a Google Forms questionnaire. The Google Form included a sociodemographic questionnaire and psychometric scales evaluating the psychological and behavioral impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, both qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed in the study. A total of 324 college students participated in this study, of whom 180 (55.6%) were male and 144 (44.4%) were female. After assessment of the psychometric scales, it was found that of the 324 students, 223 (68.8%) had high fear of COVID-19, 93 (28.7%) had moderate to severe depression, and 167 (51.5%) had mild to severe anxiety. Among the identified risk factors, having a family member who was infected with COVID-19 was significantly associated with anxiety and depression, with P values of .02 and .001, respectively. In addition, the correlations of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were found to be 0.492 and 0.474, respectively. This research concludes that there is a very high fear of COVID-19 among students, along with anxiety and depression symptoms. This study also concludes that the Fear of COVID-19 Scale has a moderate positive correlation with the anxiety and depression scales, respectively.","Chaudhary, Sonar, Tr, Banerjee, Yadav","https://doi.org/10.2196/28158","20211004","COVID-19; FCV-19S; GAD-7; PHQ-9; anxiety; depression; fear; mental health; pandemic; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18558,""
"Policy Opportunities To Improve Prevention, Diagnosis, And Treatment Of Perinatal Mental Health Conditions","One in five pregnant or postpartum people has a diagnosed mood or anxiety disorder, which are the most common mental health illnesses that occur during the perinatal period. Untreated perinatal mental health conditions, encompassing pregnancy and the first five years of a child's life, carry a societal burden of $14 billion per year in the US. This overview article describes the prevalence of perinatal mental health conditions; the implications of those conditions; and associated barriers to screening, treatment, and bias associated with mental health conditions. We offer six policy opportunities designed to overcome the barriers and support overall sexual and reproductive health: extending Medicaid coverage through twelve months postpartum; redesigning care and reimbursement through co-location of services; establishing coverage for home visiting and peer support programs; enhancing telehealth policies that support access and coverage beyond the COVID-19 pandemic; enhancing data, research, and accountability; and enacting social and economic policies that support families.","Moore, McLemore, Glenn, Zivin","https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.00779","20211004","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18559,""
"Risk And Resilience Factors Influencing Postpartum Depression And Mother-Infant Bonding During COVID-19","Acute stress during pregnancy can have adverse effects on maternal health and increase the risk for postpartum depression and impaired mother-infant bonding. The COVID-19 pandemic represents an acute environmental stressor during which it is possible to explore risk and resilience factors that contribute to postpartum outcomes. To investigate prenatal risk and resilience factors as predictors of postpartum depression and impaired mother-infant bonding, this study recruited a diverse cohort of 833 pregnant women from an urban medical center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and assessed them once during pregnancy in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (April-JulyÃ‚Â 2020) and again at approximately twelve weeks postpartum. Adverse childhood experiences, prenatal depression and anxiety, and COVID-19-related distress predicted a greater likelihood of postpartum depression. Prenatal depression was the only unique predictor of impaired maternal-infant bonding after postpartum depression was controlled for. Women reporting greater emotion regulation, self-reliance, and nonhostile relationships had healthier postpartum outcomes. Policies to increase the number of nonspecialty providers providing perinatal mental health services as well as reimbursement for integrated care and access to mental health screening and care are needed to improve lifelong outcomes for women and their children.","Kornfield, White, Waller, Njoroge, Barzilay, Chaiyachati, Himes, Rodriguez, Riis, Simonette, Elovitz, Gur","https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.00803","20211004","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18560,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic Support Programs for Healthcare Workers and Implications for Occupational Mental Health: A Narrative Review","This narrative review aims to summarize initiatives developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to support healthcare workers' emotional well-being within the context of a pre-existing framework of occupational mental health guidelines. This occupational mental health framework integrates principles from multiple disciplines to optimize prevention and management of mental health issues among employees. We conducted an online search on Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase for studies that reported on design or execution of medical institution-based interventions, aiming to support healthcare worker mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inclusion criteria was intentionally broad in order to incorporate as many types of interventions at varying stages of development or evaluation. We included 31 studies in our review that reported on newly designed psychological support interventions for healthcare workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that most programs commonly supported HCW mental health through offering one or more of the following initiatives: expanded basic need resources/services, additional workplace training programs that bolstered professional preparedness while also indirectly boosting HCW emotional health, and/or expanded psychological support programs, such as peer support programs, psychoeducational or counseling services. Most programs, however, did not consider methods to ensure program longevity or sustainability. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the acuity of HCW mental health issues and is likely to leave long lasting mental health strains among HCW. This pandemic is a critical point in time to catalyze much needed progress in reducing stigma and expanding HCW mental health care access.","David, DePierro, Marin, Sharma, Charney, Katz","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-021-09952-5","20211004","COVID-19; Healthcare worker mental health intervention; Mental health; Psychological support programs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18561,""
"Impact of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) on the professional practice and personal well-being of community pharmacy teams in the UK","Community pharmacy teams (CPTs) were at the frontline of dealing with patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explore the impact on professional practice and personal well-being of CPTs, in the UK. A 25-item survey was designed including a range of open and closed questions. The survey was piloted before being published online via SurveyMonkey and distributed using social media platforms. A combination of opportunity and snowball sampling was employed to recruit participants who worked in community pharmacy (CP) during the pandemic. In total 758 participants (75% completion rate) including pharmacists, owners, managers, technicians, dispensers, healthcare assistants and pre-registration pharmacists took part. Increased workloads and working hours coupled with staff shortages compromised professional practice (n = 257, 35%). Some of the key challenges of working in CP during the pandemic included: a fear of contracting and passing the virus to others (n = 578, 78%), patients stockpiling medicines (n = 530, 71%) and doctors' surgeries being closed (n = 517, 70%) The impact on emotional well-being (n = 433, 76%) included stress, anxiety, depression and loneliness; physically (n = 322, 56%) it affected sleep, pain and weight. The effects of the pandemic left 45% (n = 258/569) of participants reconsidering their future in CP as they felt demotivated, unsupported and undervalued. Despite the enhanced pressures and lack of initial recognition CPTs played a vital role in caring for the population during the pandemic. Resources to better support pharmacy teams in the future not only rely on more funding for better provisions but also investing in CPTs' well-being.","Bhamra, Parmar, Heinrich","https://doi.org/10.1093/ijpp/riab062","20211004","COVID-19; coronavirus; pandemic; pharmacy; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18562,""
"Stigma, Perceived Discrimination, and Mental Health during China's COVID-19 Outbreak: A Mixed-Methods Investigation","Research on stigma and discrimination during COVID-19 has focused on racism and xenophobia in Western countries. In comparison, little research has considered stigma processes, discrimination, and their public health implications in non-Western contexts. This study draws on quantitative survey data (N = 7,942) and qualitative interview data (N = 50) to understand the emergence, experiences, and mental health implications of stigma and discrimination during China's COVID-19 outbreak. Given China's history of regionalism, we theorize and use a survey experiment to empirically assess region-based stigma: People who lived in Hubei (the hardest hit province) during the outbreak and those who were socially associated with Hubei were stigmatized. Furthermore, the COVID-19 outbreak created stigma around people labeled as <i>patients</i> by the state. These stigmatized groups reported greater perceived discrimination, which-as a stressor-led to psychological distress. Our interview data illuminated how the stigmatized groups perceived, experienced, and coped with discrimination and stigma.","Fan, Qian, Jin","https://doi.org/10.1177/00221465211040550","20211004","COVID-19; China; discrimination; mental health; stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18563,""

"Mental health of Filipino seafarers and its implications for seafarers' education","This narrative review examines current academic literature on the mental health of Filipino seafarers working internationally, including the mental health effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Framed within a rights-based approach, it aims to identify and analyse emerging themes on Filipino seafarers' mental health literature to understand what these studies potentially mean for the improvement of seafarers' education on mental health. Based on a broad selection criteria, 28 eligible papers demonstrate collectively three key findings: firstly, there is paucity in published research on seafarers' mental health; secondly, the majority of published studies are associated with a recent piracy crisis, where a significant number of mariners were attacked, taken as hostages, or killed; thirdly, three key areas emerged under which research on Filipino seafarers' mental health can be organized: the medical repatriation of seafarers, system of care for the mental health of seafarers including the diagnostic standards used, and seafarers' experiences and conceptions of mental health including the mental health effects of COVID-19. Though the bulk of the current understanding of the mental health problems is associated with piracy, several risk factors for which the quality of quantitative and qualitative evidence are patchy. The few sources of primary data to date lack focus on mental health needs which makes it difficult to grasp the extent of the problem. Developing policies and programmes for the promotion of mental health through mental health education among seafarers is important for a couple of reasons. Seafaring remains a dangerous and socially isolating occupation where work-related accidents are likely and will be potentially traumatic to mariners. Research on occupational stressors is increasingly providing evidence of their contributions to poor mental health outcomes among seafarers. Thus, mental health education of seafarers in the context of their work is important for proactive training and development.","Abila, Acejo","https://doi.org/10.5603/IMH.2021.0035","20211004","COVID-19 and mental health of seafarers; mental health education of seafarers; mental health of Filipino seafarers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18565,""
"Coping Strategies, Neural Structure, and Depression and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study in a Naturalistic Sample Spanning Clinical Diagnoses and Subclinical Symptoms","Although the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to worsen anxiety and depression symptoms, we do not understand which behavioral and neural factors may mitigate this impact. To address this gap, we assessed whether adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies affect symptom trajectory during the pandemic. We also examined whether pre-pandemic integrity of brain regions implicated in depression and anxiety affect pandemic symptoms. In a naturalistic sample of 169 adults (66.9% female; age 19-74 years) spanning psychiatric diagnoses and subclinical symptoms, we assessed anhedonia, tension, and anxious arousal symptoms using validated components (21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale), coping strategies (Brief-Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced), and gray matter volume (amygdala) and cortical thickness (hippocampus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex) from magnetic resonance imaging T1-weighted scans. We conducted general linear mixed-effects models to test preregistered hypotheses that 1) maladaptive coping pre-pandemic and 2) lower structural integrity pre-pandemic would predict more severe pandemic symptoms; and 3) coping would interact with neural structure to predict pandemic symptoms. Greater use of maladaptive coping strategies was associated with more severe anxious arousal symptoms during the pandemic (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â = .011, false discovery rate-corrected <i>p</i> [<i>p</i> <sub>FDR</sub>]Ã‚Â = .035), specifically less self-distraction (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â = .014, <i>p</i> <sub>FDR</sub>Ã‚Â = .042) and greater self-blame (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â = .002, <i>p</i> <sub>FDR</sub>Ã‚Â = .012). Reduced insula thickness pre-pandemic predicted more severe anxious arousal symptoms (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â = .001, <i>p</i> <sub>FDR</sub>Ã‚Â = .027). Self-distraction interacted with amygdala volume to predict anhedonia symptoms (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â = .005, <i>p</i> <sub>FDR</sub>Ã‚Â = .020). Maladaptive coping strategies and structural variation in brain regions may influence clinical symptoms during a prolonged stressful event (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic). Future studies that identify behavioral and neural factors implicated in responses to global health crises are warranted for fostering resilience.","Holt-Gosselin, Tozzi, Ramirez, Gotlib, Williams","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsgos.2021.06.007","20211004","Anxiety; Brain structure; COVID-19; Coping; Depression; MRI","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18566,""
"Psychological state, family functioning and coping strategies among undergraduate students in a Nigerian University during the COVID-19 lockdown","The curtailment of social gatherings and the lack of online academic engagement during the COVID-19 lockdown could have potentially damaging effects on the psychological state of university students in Nigerian public universities. This study examined the prevalence of anxiety and depression, including associated factors and coping methods, among undergraduate students. This cross-sectional study, which involved 386 undergraduate students, was assigned approval number UI/EC/20/0242. An online questionnaire consisting mainly of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the McMaster Family Assessment Device was circulated among the students. The results were analysed by means of descriptive statistics, chi-square, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and linear logistical regression, at ÃŽÂ± 0.05. Mean age was 21 Ã‚Â± 2.9 years, with females constituting 60.1% of the sample. The prevalence rates of anxiety and depression were 41.5 and 31.9%, respectively. Students in health-related faculties were significantly less anxious than others. Inability to afford three square meals, negative family functioning, chronic illness and living in a State/Region with a high incidence of COVID-19 were significantly associated with depression. These factors jointly accounted for 14% of depression. Coping methods included the use of social media, watching movies and participating in online skills-development programs. The overall level of anxiety and depression among undergraduate students during the COVID-19 lockdown was higher than the levels previously reported.

"Therapeutic Factors and Member Satisfaction in an Online Group Intervention During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The purpose of the present study was to evaluate members' perceptions of the therapeutic factors during a group intervention that was designed to mitigate the adverse psychological effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the imposition of restrictive measures, their satisfaction with the online format of the intervention, and how these are associated with the intervention's outcomes. The participants (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°44, <i>M</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°31.93, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.09) were Greek adults who attended a 2-week, voluntary, online group intervention. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention, 1Ã‚Â week before and 1Ã‚Â week after implementation, participants completed several questionnaires measuring their demographic characteristics, empathy, resilience, affectivity, feelings of loneliness, depression and anxiety levels, and feelings of fear regarding the outbreak. One week after the intervention, they also completed two questionnaires evaluating the therapeutic factors and their satisfaction and impressions regarding telemental health counseling. Analyses showed that the most frequently cited therapeutic factor was guidance, followed by acceptance, self-disclosure, universality, and instillation of hope. Therapeutic factors of catharsis, self-disclosure, guidance, self-understanding, vicarious learning, and therapeutic alliance correlated with elements of empathy, resilience, loneliness, positive emotions, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and fear of the coronavirus. Satisfaction with the online format of the intervention was associated to universality, elements of empathy, and symptoms of depression. More specifically, member satisfaction was negatively correlated with improvement in personal distress and depression, an unexpected finding that may be attributed to the brief duration of the present intervention. The practical value of the results for the development and implementation of online psychological interventions during a crisis is discussed.","Brouzos, Vassilopoulos, Stavrou, Baourda, Tassi, Brouzou","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41347-021-00216-4","20211004","COVID-19; Member satisfaction; Telemental health; Therapeutic factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18568,""
"Is the Future Bright or Bleak? Assessing Past and Future Outlooks Across the Adult Lifespan","An individual's outlook on society can change over time and can be related to both their physical and mental health. Here, we developed an instrument to measure outlooks on the past and future in relation to the present in 413 adults ranging in age from 18 to 80Ã‚Â years. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on independent samples and test-retest reliability was assessed in a subset of participants. Construct validity of the two past and future scales was assessed by relating them to 1) pre-existing scales measuring related constructs, and 2) beliefs and safety behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The final Bright or Bleak Scale (BOBS) consists of a past and future scale, each with two factors measuring societal and personal outlooks. Brighter future societal and personal outlooks were positively associated with longer future time perspectives, while self-reporting a higher likelihood of already having contracted COVID-19 was related to bleaker past societal and personal outlooks.","Silaj, Schwartz, Castel, McDonough","https://doi.org/10.1177/23337214211046080","20211004","COVID-19; aging; life satisfaction; mental health; societal outlooks","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18569,""
"Internal Locus of Control and Sense of Coherence Decrease During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey of Students and Professionals in Social Work","Mental health is severely challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic due to a variety of restrictions in public and private life. Students in particular may face additional and unique stressors: face-to-face classes have been largely replaced by digital formats, leading to further reduced social contacts, thus facilitating the development of psychological symptoms. In this study, we aimed to assess the impact of the current peri-pandemic situation on students' 1) locus of control and 2) sense of coherence, both of which have been linked to mental health in previous work. A total of 403 social work students from Germany participated, providing both retrospective (pre-pandemic) and current (February/March 2021) ratings. Furthermore, 324 social work professionals were included to analyze differences between both groups. Locus of control shifted significantly from internal to external during the pandemic for students and professionals. Furthermore, high mental burden correlated with increased external and decreased internal locus of control. Sense of coherence decreased during the pandemic for the entire sample and correlated with high mental burden. Overall, students showed a stronger drop compared to professionals, primarily due to a more pronounced decrease in perceived meaningfulness (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In summary, students and professionals responded with increased feelings of powerlessness in the absence of sufficient coping strategies-this could lead to further deterioration of mental health as the pandemic continues. In this context, students appear to be particularly vulnerable to a reduction in sense of coherence. We conclude that interventions to improve coping strategies are urgently needed.","Misamer, Signerski-Krieger, Bartels, Belz","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.705809","20211004","coping strategies; feeling of powerlessness; locus of control; mental health; sense of coherence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18570,""
"Sleep Quality in the Indian Adult Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing measures such as stay-at-home orders were implemented for all non-essential workers. The consequent disruption in theÃ‚Â defined daily work routine has impacted both the quality and duration of sleep. Our aim was to evaluateÃ‚Â the quality of sleep in the Indian adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were collected between April 17, 2020 and May 24, 2020, and participants wereÃ‚Â invited openly through social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram). Sleep quality wasÃ‚Â evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality IndexÃ‚Â (PSQI)Ã‚Â Questionnaire. The study population consisted of 808 participants (mean age 30.85 years, 56.7% female).Ã‚Â The mean sleep score of the study population was 6.78 Ã‚Â± 3.19 on the PSQI, with a majority (57.2%) of respondents showing 'poor' sleep quality (&gt;5 on PSQI). The meanÃ‚Â sleep duration of the study population was found to be 6.9 Ã‚Â± 1.4 h, and sleep latency was 42.64 Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 51.6 min. The PSQI scores were comparable for age, gender, and work status and were notÃ‚Â significant. However, a significant association between self-reported mental health and quality ofÃ‚Â sleep was found (p&lt;0.05). Participants who reported a deterioration in mental health were moreÃ‚Â likely to have poor sleep quality than those who reported an improvement in their mental health.

"Coronavirus Disease 2019: Psychological Stress and Cardiovascular Diseases","Minimising deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global priority. However, the harmful effects are not limited to those directly related to the infection. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a serious impact on the mental health of the general population. An increasing number of people are exhibiting signs of depression and an increase in suicides has also been noted around the world. Mental health issues may be linked to starting or increasing the use of addictive substances, such as tobacco, alcohol and drugs, along with increased overweight and obesity resulting from changes in eating habits. These issues can impact cardiovascular diseases because of worsened risk factor control. This review discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and cardiovascular risk factors.

"The Influence of Family Function on State Anxiety of Chinese College Students During the Epidemic of COVID-19","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) may affect mental health. There is little research about the influence of family function on the state anxiety of college students in the context of the global pandemic. The study aimed to clarify that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and trait anxiety had mediating effects in family function on the state anxiety of Chinese college students following the ""stay-at-home"" order during the outbreak of COVID-19. This cross-sectional study was conducted online with 1,039 respondents. We analyzed demographics, The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (ST-AI) and Chinese Family Function Scale (FAD-18), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and used path analysis to discuss the influence of family function on state and trait anxiety. The results showed that female students' state and trait anxiety was higher than that of male students (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Medical students' state and trait anxiety was lower than that of literature students (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The GAD of the male was lower compared with the female. The score of family function has significant differences in gender, age, education, and region (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Gender, family function, state anxiety, trait anxiety, and GAD relate to others (<i>r</i> = 0.07Ã¢Ë†Â¼0.85, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The results of fit indices for measurement invariance models showed that the impact of family function among GAD, state and trait anxiety across gender is significantly different (each step <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). GAD and trait anxiety had a complete meditating effect between family function and state anxiety (the proportion of standard indirect mediating effect was 24.94% in females and 36.79% in males). A healthy family function may alleviate GAD and anxiety of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yang, Wu, Wang, Peng","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.701945","20211004","COVID-19; Chinese college student; anxiety; family function; mediating effect analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18574,""
"What Factors Are Most Closely Associated With Mood Disorders in Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Cross-Sectional Study Based on 1,771 Adolescents in Shandong Province, China","<b>Background and Aims:</b> COVID-19 has been proven to harm adolescents' mental health, and several psychological influence factors have been proposed. However, the importance of these factors in the development of mood disorders in adolescents during the pandemic still eludes researchers, and practical strategies for mental health education are limited. <b>Methods:</b> We constructed a sample of 1,771 adolescents from three junior high middle schools, three senior high middle schools, and three independent universities in Shandong province, China. The sample stratification was set as 5:4:3 for adolescent aged from 12 - 15, 15 - 18, 18 - 19. We examined the subjects' anxiety, depression, psychological resilience, perceived social support, coping strategies, subjective social/school status, screen time, and sleep quality with suitable psychological scales. We chose four widely used classification models-k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT), and a combination of the GBDT and LR (GBDT + LR)-to construct machine learning models, and we utilized the Shapley additive explanations value (SHAP) to measure how the features affected the dependent variables. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used to evaluate the performance of the models. <b>Results:</b> The current rates of occurrence of symptoms of anxiety and depression were 28.3 and 30.8% among the participants. The descriptive and univariate analyses showed that all of the factors included were statistically related to mood disorders. Among the four machine learning algorithms, the GBDT+LR algorithm achieved the best performance for anxiety and depression with average AUC values of 0.819 and 0.857. We found that the poor sleep quality was the most significant risk factor for mood disorders among Chinese adolescents. In addition, according to the feature importance (SHAP) of the psychological factors, we proposed a five-step mental health education strategy to be used during the COVID-19 pandemic (sleep quality-resilience-coping strategy-social support-perceived social status). <b>Conclusion:</b> In this study, we performed a cross-sectional investigation to examine the psychological impact of COVID-19 on adolescents. We applied machine learning algorithms to quantify the importance of each factor. In addition, we proposed a five-step mental health education strategy for school psychologists.","Ren, Xin, Wang, Liu, Ho, Ho","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.728278","20211004","COVID-19; GBDT; SHAP value; adolescents; mood disorders; resilience; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18575,""
"Prevalence of Internet Addiction Disorder and Its Correlates Among Clinically Stable Adolescents With Psychiatric Disorders in China During the COVID-19 Outbreak","<b>Background:</b> Since the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emerged, Internet usage has increased among adolescents. Due to this trend, the prevalence of Internet addiction disorder (IAD) may have increased within this group. This study examined the prevalence of IAD and its correlates among clinically stable adolescents with psychiatric disorders in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. <b>Method:</b> A multi-center, cross-sectional study was carried out between April 29 and June 9, 2020 in three major tertiary mental health centers in China. IAD and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. <b>Results:</b> A total of 1,454 adolescent psychiatric patients were included in final analyses.

"Adolescent emotion scale for online lessons: A study from Turkey","People's day-to-day routines have changed drastically since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the changes to take place has been the transition to online learning due to the changing conditions in learning environments. One of the factors that guide students through learning environments is their emotions. The few existing scales that measure the emotions of adolescents in learning environments have been developed with consideration of face-to-face learning environments and their items do not adequately express the state of online environments. For this reason, this study aimed to develop a scale which reveals the emotions of adolescents that may affect their academic success with regard to this transition of learning environments as they attend online lessons. A total of 3,655 middle and high school students living in Istanbul, Turkey, participated in the study. The scoring system was designed with regard to the frequency with which each student reading an item experiences the relevant emotion for the item in the online learning environment. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses conducted show the scale to possess a four-dimensional structure. These dimensions are enjoyment-pride, boredom-hopelessness, loneliness and anxiety. For all dimensions of the scale, Cronbach alpha values range between .93 and .83. 'Positive and Negative Affects Schedule-Children' was used to confirm the scale's criterion-related validity, and correlations between dimensions were examined. After validity and reliability studies, the Adolescent Emotion Scale for Online Lessons was found to be sufficient. The scale can be used by experts and teachers who wish to determine adolescents' emotions during a period of online learning.","Yilmaz, Orhan, Zeren","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-021-10734-6","20211004","Academic emotion scale; Adolescents; Online learning; Online learning environment; Scale development","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18579,""
"COVID-19 conversations: A qualitative study of majority Hispanic/Latinx youth experiences during early stages of the pandemic","Growing evidence informs about the detrimental impact that COVID-19 has had on youths' mental health and well-being. As of yet, no study has directly examined the experiences and perspectives of children and young adolescents from racial and ethnic minority groups in the U.S., despite being exposed to more adversity, which may affect coping with the many challenges posed by the pandemic. This study aimed to give voice to a mostly Hispanic/Latinx group of youth regarding the impact of COVID-19 stay-at-home measures and to identify their emotional responses and coping strategies amid the pandemic in the U.S. when restrictions were at their hardest. A total of 17 youths (70.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°% Hispanic; age rangeÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10-14 years; 52.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°% female) participated in four virtual semi-structured focus groups for each grade level (grades 5-8). Data was transcribed and analyzed using a gold standard thematic analysis approach. Seven themes were identified concerning the impact of COVID-19, centering around the impact of racism, loss of income, the role of community and family in coping with stress, information overload, home-schooling, loneliness and boredom, and lack of structured routines. Our findings suggest that cultural factors (e.g., collectivism and familism) in Hispanic communities may offer important buffering during COVID-19.

MAIN: In this review, we briefly summarize what is known about carer burden in families where a young person has an ED, consider the additional impact consequent to COVID-19 and highlight the need for interventions aimed at alleviating this. Pre-COVID-19 research identifies high levels of psychological and physical strain amongst those caring for a child with an ED. Themes are beginning to emerge as to why COVID-19 may further exacerbate carer burden: (1) reduced access to ED services; (2) increased physical vulnerability and exacerbation of psychiatric co-morbidity amongst youth with EDs; (3) increased practical demands placed on carers; and (4) social isolation and decreased social support. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a specific threat to the mental health of youth with EDs and their carers. Given the salient role families play in caring for youth with an ED, attending to carer burden is imperative. Supporting carers through all phases of their child's ED journey by offering adaptive and flexible supportive services which accommodate time constraints, geographic barriers and possible COVID-19 spread is essential. Caring for a child with an Eating Disorder (ED) can be difficult at the best of times. Research is beginning to emerge demonstrating the negative impact the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having both on youth with an ED and their carers. In this review, we briefly summarize what is known about carer burden in families where a young person has an ED, consider the additional impact of COVID-19 and highlight the need for further supportive interventions. This review indicates that carer burden is substantial amongst those caring for a loved one with an ED and additional strain has been placed on carers during the pandemic. Key themes have emerged likely contributing to an increase in carer burden during COVID-19: (1) reduced access to ED services; (2) increased physical vulnerability and exacerbation of psychiatric co-morbidity amongst youth with EDs; (3) increased practical demands placed on carers; and (4) social isolation and decreased social support. Findings from this review aim to inspire further research on how best we can support carers of youth with EDs during the pandemic and beyond.","Maunder, McNicholas","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-021-00485-7","20211004","COVID-19; Carer burden; Carers; Children and adolescents; Eating disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18583,""
"Experiences of health care providers on pregnancy and childbirth care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran: a phenomenological study","Coronavirus currently cause a lot of pressure on the health system. Accordingly, many changes occurred in the way of providing health care, including pregnancy and childbirth care. To our knowledge, no studies on experiences of maternity care Providers during the COVID-19 Pandemic have been published in Iran. We aimed to discover their experiences on pregnancy and childbirth care during the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study was a qualitative research performed with a descriptive phenomenological approach. The used sampling method was purposive sampling by taking the maximum variation possible into account, which continued until data saturation. Accordingly, in-depth and semi-structured interviews were conducted by including 12 participants, as 4 gynecologists, 6 midwives working in the hospitals and private offices, and 2 midwives working in the health centers. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's seven stage method with MAXQDA10 software. Data analysis led to the extraction of 3 themes, 9 categories, and 25 subcategories. The themes were as follows: ""Fear of Disease"", ""Burnout"", and ""Lessons Learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic"", respectively. Maternal health care providers experience emotional and psychological stress and work challenges during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, comprehensive support should be provided for the protection of their physical and mental health statuses. By working as a team, utilizing the capacity of telemedicine to care and follow up mothers, and providing maternity care at home, some emerged challenges to maternal care services can be overcome.","Hantoushzadeh, Bagheri, Amjadi, Farahani, Haghollahi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-04148-y","20211004","COVID-19 pandemic; Experience; Health care providers; Pregnancy and childbirth care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18584,""
"Relative Risk of Anxiety and Depression among COVID-19 Survivor Healthcare Workers from a Tertiary Care Hospital in Pakistan: A Pilot Cohort Study","Longitudinal studies for determining the risk of anxiety and depression among COVID-19 survivor healthcare workers are lacking. This study aimed to determine the risk of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers that survived COVID-19 infection through a six-month post-recovery follow-up. This was a cohort study conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, from 1st March to 30th August 2020. A total of 64 subjects participated. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used for assessing the anxiety and depression symptoms. HADS has three score cutoff as normal, borderline abnormal and, abnormal anxiety/depression. For the purpose of the study, borderline and above scores were taken as positive for anxiety/depression. Data was analysed using STATA Corp 15.1. There was no increased risk of anxiety or depression six months post-COVID-19 infection in the infected HCW, compared to uninfected HCW. It is recommended to conduct longitudinal studies with large sample and longer follow-up.

"Mental health status and quality of life in close contacts of COVID-19 patients in the post-COVID-19 era: a comparative study","Close contacts of those with COVID-19 (CC) may experience distress and long-lasting mental health effects. However, the mental health status and quality of life (QOL) in CC have not been adequately examined. This study examined the mental health status and QOL in CC during the post-COVID-19 period. This cross-sectional study comprised 1169 CC and 1290 who were non-close contacts (non-CC). Demographic data were collected; depression, fatigue, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and QOL were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 items (PHQ-9), fatigue numeric rating scale, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - 17 items (PCL-17), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire - brief version (WHOQOL-BREF), respectively. Analysis of covariance was used to compare depressive symptoms, QOL, fatigue, and PTSS between the CC and non-CC groups. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the independent correlates for depression, fatigue, PTSS, and QOL in the CC group. Compared to the non-CC group, the CC group reported significantly more severe depression (F<sub>(1, 2458)</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.58, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.018) and fatigue (F<sub>(1, 2458)</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.22, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002) in the post-COVID-19 period. No significant differences in PTSS and QOL between the CC and non-CC groups were found (F<sub>(1, 2458)</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.93, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.087 for PTSS; F<sub>(1, 2458)</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.45, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.064 for QOL). In the CC group, younger age, financial loss due to COVID-19, and perception of poor or fair health status were significantly associated with depression and fatigue, while frequent use of mass media was significantly associated with fatigue. In conclusion, close contacts of COVID-19 patients experienced high levels of depression and fatigue in the post-COVID-19 period. Due to the negative effects of depression and fatigue on daily functioning, early detection and timely interventions should be provided to this neglected population.","Zhao, Zhang, Li, Zhang, Cheung, Tang, Ng, Yang, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01623-0","20211003","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18586,""

"Anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms among high school students in china in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown","This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms, and associated risk factors among a large-scale sample of adolescents from China after the pandemic and lockdown. A total of 57,948 high school students took part in an online survey from July 13 to 29, 2020. The mental health outcomes included anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms. Risk factors included negative family relationships, COVID-19 related exposure, and a lack of social support. The prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms was 7.1%, 12.8%, and 16.9%, respectively. COVID-19 related exposure significantly linked to the mental health outcomes (all pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). The most important predictors for the mental health outcomes were family relationship and social support (all p &lt; .001). The pandemic may have long-term adverse mental health consequences among adolescents. Adverse family relationships and lack of social support could be the major risk factors for the post-pandemic mental health outcomes of adolescents.","Cao, Wang, Fang, Liu, Bi, Luo, Grace, Olff","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.09.052","20211003","Adolescent; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; PTSD","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18588,""
"Suicide prevention in the context of COVID-19: An Indian perspective","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the health and wellbeing of communities worldwide. Measures to limit transmission, have enhanced vulnerability of individuals to well identified risk factors associated with mental illness and suicide. These include a sense of loneliness, anxiety, depression, insomnia, PTSD, harmful alcohol and drug use. Given that the potential for increased rates of suicide persist, the suicide prevention agenda remains urgent and essential. The same is one of the cornerstones of resilience in a society that is facing an array of challenges due to the pandemic. In this article, we recommend few possible strategies for attenuating suicide risk amidst the COVID-19 pandemic with particular relevance to the Indian context.","Suchandra, Bhaskaran, Manjunatha, Kumar, Bada Math, Reddi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102858","20211003","COVID-19; Policy recommendations; Suicide and pandemic; Suicide prevention; Suicide prevention during pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18589,""
"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical and psychoaffective health of older adults in a physical exercise program","COVID-19 lockdowns restricted physical activity levels for individuals in many countries. In particular, older adults experienced limited access to their usual activities, including physical exercise programs. How such restrictions and interruptions in physical exercise programs might impact the physical and mental health of older adults has not yet been studied. We sought to analyse changes in the physical and mental health of older adults enrolled in a group-based multicomponent physical exercise (MPE) program that was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We followed 17 participants of this program from October 2018 to October 2020, including the interruption of the program during the pandemic. The MPE program included strength, balance, and stretching exercises. We compared anthropometric and cardiovascular parameters, physical fitness, frailty, quality of life, and psychoaffective status of participants before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most parameters followed the same pattern, improving after 8Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months of the first MPE season (Oct. 2018-Jun. 2019), worsening after 4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months of summer rest, improving from October 2019 to January 2020 in the second MPE season (Oct. 2019-Jan. 2020), and severely worsening after 7Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months of program interruption. We show that an MPE program has clear benefits to the physical and psychoaffective health of older adults, and interruption of these programs could adversely impact participants. These results highlight the need to maintain physical exercise programs or facilitate engagement in physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour in older adults, particularly in situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Markotegi, Irazusta, Sanz, Rodriguez-Larrad","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2021.111580","20211003","Aging; COVID-19 pandemic; Mental health; Physical activity; Physical health; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-05","",18590,""
"A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort studies comparing mental health before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020","Increases in mental health problems have been observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives were to examine the extent to which mental health symptoms changed during the pandemic in 2020, whether changes were persistent or short lived, and if changes were symptom specific. Systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort studies examining changes in mental health among the same group of participants before vs. during the pandemic in 2020. Sixty-five studies were included. There was an overall increase in mental health symptoms observed during March-April 2020 (SMCÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.102 [95% CI: .026 to .192]) that significantly declined over time and became non-significant (May-July SMCÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.067 [95% CI: -.022 to .157].

In primary analyses increases were most pronounced among samples with physical health conditions and there was no evidence of any change in symptoms among samples with a pre-existing mental health condition. There was a high degree of unexplained heterogeneity observed (I<sup>2</sup>s &gt; 90%), indicating that change in mental health was highly variable across samples.

"A Mid-to-Long Term Comprehensive Evaluation of Psychological Distress and Erectile Function in COVID-19 Recovered Patients","The psychological and sexual health of different populations are negatively affected during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, little is known about psychological distress and erectile function of male recovered patients with COVID-19 in the long term. We aimed to evaluate psychological distress and erectile function of male recovered patients with COVID-19 in the mid-to-long terms. We recruited 67 eligible male recovered patients with COVID-19 and followed them up twice within approximately 6 months of recovery time. The psychological distress and erectile function were assessed by validated Chinese version of paper questionnaires. The primary outcomes were Symptom Checklist 90 questionnaire for psychological distress and International Index of Erectile Function-5 for erectile function. In the first visit, COVID-19 patients with a median recovery time of 80 days mainly presented the following positive symptoms: Obsessive-Compulsive, additional items (ADD), Hostility, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Depression, and Somatization; while the dimension scores in Somatization, Anxiety, ADD, and Phobia were higher than Chinese male norms. Besides, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) in the first-visit patients was significantly higher than Chinese controls. In the second visit, the primary psychological symptoms of COVID-19 patients with a median recovery time of 174 days were Obsessive-Compulsive, ADD, Interpersonal Sensitivity, and Hostility, while all dimensions scores of Symptom Checklist 90 were lower than Chinese male norms. Moreover, second-visit patients had no significant difference with Chinese controls in ED prevalence. In addition, it suggested that GSI was the independent risk factor for ED in the regression analysis for the first-visit patients. The study showed the changes of psychological symptoms and erectile function in COVID-19 recovered patients, and provided reference on whether psychological and sexual supports are needed after a period of recovery. To our knowledge, it is the first study to comprehensively evaluate the psychological distress and erectile function of COVID-19 recovered patients in the mid-to-long terms. The main limitations were the low number of analyzed participants, and the psychological distress and erectile function of healthy Chinese men over the same period were not evaluated, and the psychological and sexual related data of participants prior to COVID-19 were not available. Additionally, there was a selection bias in comparing COVID-19 patients with healthy controls. With less impact of COVID-19 event, the impaired erectile function and psychological distress improved in COVID-19 recovered patients with a recovery time of nearly half a year.
