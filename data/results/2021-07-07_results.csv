"Neurological, neuropsychiatric and psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 infection and after recovery: a systematic review of observational studies","Background The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a wide spectrum of disease severity. Initial manifestations include fever, dry cough, and constitutional symptoms, which may progress to respiratory disease. There may also be neurological and psychiatric manifestations, involving both the central and peripheral nervous system. Methods We performed a literature search of the databases PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science for observational studies reporting neurological, psychiatric, and neuropsychiatric effects of COVID-19. This was followed by a narrative synthesis to summarise the data and discuss neuropsychiatric associations, symptom severity, management, and recovery. Findings The most frequently reported neurological symptoms were ageusia, hyposmia/anosmia, dizziness, headache, and loss of consciousness. Statistically significant relationships were noted between Asian ethnicity and peripheral neuropathy (p=0.0001) and neuro-syndromic symptoms (p=0.001). ITU admission was found to have a statistically significant relationship with male sex (p=0.024). Depression and anxiety were also identified both during and after infection. The most frequent treatments used were intravenous immunoglobulins, followed by antibiotics, antivirals, and hydroxychloroquine; with mean treatment duration of 6 days. Interpretation Various neuropsychiatric symptoms have been associated with COVID-19 infection. More studies are required to further our knowledge in the management of neurological and psychiatric symptoms during and after COVID-19 infection","Maria Stavrou; Solomis Solomou; Anthousa Kythreotou; Antreas Ioannou; Eva Lioutas; Joanna Lioutas; Peter Karayiannis","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.02.21259902","20210707","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-07","",15732,""
"Implementation, adoption and perceptions of telemental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review","Background: Early in 2020, mental health services had to rapidly shift from face-to-face models of care to delivering the majority of treatments remotely (by video or phone call or occasionally messaging) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in several challenges for staff and patients, but also in benefits such as convenience or increased access for people with impaired mobility or in rural areas. There is a need to understand the extent and impacts of telemental health implementation, and barriers and facilitators to its effective and acceptable use. This is relevant both to future emergency adoption of telemental health, and to debates on its future use in routine mental health care. Objective: To investigate the adoption and impacts of telemental health approaches during the COVID-19 Pandemic, and facilitators and barriers to optimal implementation. Methods: Four databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science) were searched for primary research relating to remote working, mental health care, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Preprint servers were also searched. Results of studies were synthesised using framework synthesis. Results: A total of 77 papers met our inclusion criteria. In most studies, the majority of contacts could be transferred to a remote form during the pandemic, and good acceptability to service users and clinicians tended to be reported, at least where the alternative to remote contacts was interrupting care. However, a range of impediments to dealing optimal care by this means were also identified. Conclusions: Implementation of telemental health allowed some continuing support to the majority of service users during the COVID-19 pandemic and has value in an emergency situation. However, not all service users can be reached by this means, and better evidence is now needed on long-term impacts on therapeutic relationships and quality of care, and on impacts on groups at risk of digital exclusion and how to mitigate these.","Rebecca Appleton; Julie Williams; Norha Vera San Juan; Justin Needle; Merle Schlief; Harriet Jordan; Luke Sheridan Rains; Lucy Goulding; Monika Badhan; Emily Roxburgh; Phoebe Barnett; Spyros Spyridonidis; Magdalena Tomaskova; Jiping Mo; Jasmine Harju-Seppanen; Zoe Haime; Ceclilia Casetta; Alexandra Papamichail; Brynmor Lloyd-Evans; Alan Simpson; Nick Sevdalis; Fiona Gaughran; Sonia Johnson","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.05.21260018","20210706","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-07","",15733,""

"COVID-19 and the impact on rural and black church Congregants: Results of the C-M-C project","The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating effects on Black and rural populations with a mortality rate among Blacks three times that of Whites and both rural and Black populations experiencing limited access to COVID-19 resources. The primary purpose of this study was to explore the health, financial, and psychological impact of COVID-19 among rural White Appalachian and Black nonrural central Kentucky church congregants. Secondarily we sought to examine the association between sociodemographics and behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs regarding COVID-19 and intent to vaccinate. We used a cross sectional survey design developed with the constructs of the Health Belief and Theory of Planned Behavior models. The majority of the 942 respondents were Ã¢â€°Â¥36 years. A total of 54% were from central Kentucky, while 47.5% were from Appalachia. Among all participants, the pandemic worsened anxiety and depression and delayed access to medical care. There were no associations between sociodemographics and practicing COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Appalachian region was associated with financial burden and delay in medical care (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03). Appalachian respondents had lower perceived benefit and attitude for COVID-19 prevention behaviors (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004 and &lt;0.001, respectively). Among all respondents, the perceived risk of contracting COVID was high (54%), yet 33.2% indicated unlikeliness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine if offered. The COVID-19 pandemic had a differential impact on White rural and Black nonrural populations. Nurses and public health officials should assess knowledge and explore patient's attitudes regarding COVID-19 prevention behaviors, as well as advocate for public health resources to reduce the differential impact of COVID-19 on these at-risk populations.","Williams, Fernander, Azam, Gomez, Kang, Moody, Bowman, E Schoenberg","https://doi.org/10.1002/nur.22167","20210706","COVID-19; Health Belief Model; Theory of Planned Behavior; health equity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-07","",15737,""
"Socio-economic and corporate factors and COVID-19 pandemic: a wake-up call","The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) emerges from the Chinese city Wuhan and its spread to the rest of the world, primarily affected economies and their businesses, leading to a global depression. The explanatory and cross-sectional regression approach assesses the impact of COVID-19 cases on healthcare expenditures, logistics performance index, carbon damages, and corporate social responsibility in a panel of 77 countries. The results show that COVID-19 cases substantially increase healthcare expenditures and decrease corporate social responsibility. On the other hand, an increase in the coronavirus testing capacity brings positive change in reducing healthcare expenditures, increased logistics activities, and corporate social responsibility. The cost of carbon emissions increases when corporate activities begin to resume. The economic affluence supports logistics activities and improves healthcare infrastructure. It linked to international cooperation and their assistance to supply healthcare logistics traded equipment through mutual trade agreements. The greater need to enhance global trade and healthcare logistics supply helps minimize the sensitive coronavirus cases that are likely to provide a safe and healthy environment for living.","Anser, Yousaf, Hyder, Nassani, Zaman, Abro","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15275-6","20210706","COVID-19 cases; Carbon damages; Corporate social responsibility; Cross-sectional regression; Healthcare expenditures; Logistics activities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-07","",15738,""

"Prevalence and correlates of depressive symptoms among Rohingya (forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals or FDMNs) older adults in Bangladesh amid the COVID-19 pandemic","Depression is globally a crucial communal psychiatric disorder, which is more common in older adults. The situation is considerably worse among millions of older (forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals or FDMNs) Rohingya adults, and the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may exacerbate the already existing precarious situation. The present study investigated depressive symptoms and their associated factors in older adult Rohingya FDMNs in Cox Bazar, Bangladesh, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 416 older adults aged 60 years and above residing in Rohingya camps situated in the South Eastern part of Bangladesh were interviewed using a 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) in Bengali language. Chi-square test was performed to compare the prevalence of depressive symptoms within different categories of a variable and a binary logistic regression model was performed to determine the factors associated with depressive symptoms. More than 41% of Rohingya older adults had depressive symptoms (DS). Socio-demographic and economic factors such as living alone, dependency on family for living, poor memory, feelings of being left out, difficulty in getting medicine and routine medical care during COVID-19, perception that older adults are at highest risk of COVID-19 and pre-existing non-communicable chronic conditions were found to be significantly associated with developing DS. Higher DS was also evident among older female Rohingya FDMNs. DS are highly prevalent in older Rohingya FDMNs during COVID-19. The findings of the present study call for immediate arrangement of mental health care services and highlight policy implications to ensure the well-being of older FDMNs.","Mistry, Ali, Irfan, Yadav, Siddique, Peprah, Reza, Rahman, Casanelia, O'Callaghan","https://doi.org/10.1017/gmh.2021.24","20210706","COVID-19; GDS-15; Rohingya; depressive symptoms; forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-07","",15740,""
"The Experiences of Carers of Adults With Intellectual Disabilities During the First COVID-19 Lockdown Period","The recent COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread international restrictions, severely impacting on health and social care services. For many individuals with an intellectual disability (ID) this meant reduced access to services and support for them and their carers. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the ways parents of adults with ID coped during the first 2020 lockdown period. Eight parents of adults with ID were interviewed. The recordings of these interviews were subjected to a thematic analysis. Four main themes were identified: powerless and unappreciated; coping under lockdown; support; and the impact of lockdown on well-being. The parents of adults with ID who made up our sample reported that they received little support from services and experienced a sense of powerlessness. Nevertheless, they were open to accepting support from family and friends and showed remarkable resilience. These findings are discussed in the light of the Willner et al. (2020) survey results on parental mental health and coping, and suggestions for future service provision during pandemic conditions are proposed.","Patel, Perez-Olivas, Kroese, Rogers, Rose, Murphy, Cooper, Langdon, Hiles, Clifford, Willner","https://doi.org/10.1111/jppi.12382","20210706","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; carers; intellectual disability; lockdown; parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-07","",15741,""

"Possible posttraumatic stress disorder in Chinese frontline healthcare workers who survived COVID-19 6 months after the COVID-19 outbreak: prevalence, correlates, and symptoms","Suffering from COVID-19 and witnessing the suffering and deaths of patients with COVID-19 may place frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) at particularly high risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, few data are available on the clinical characteristics of PTSD among frontline HCWs who survived COVID-19 (""surviving HCWs"" hereafter). The present study examined the prevalence, correlates, and clinical symptoms of possible PTSD in surviving HCWs 6 months after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. A total of 291 surviving HCWs and 42 age- and gender-matched COVID-19-free frontline HCWs (control group) were recruited and administered the Chinese Essen Trauma Inventory, which was used to assess the presence of possible PTSD according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Survivors' clinical data and characteristics of exposure to COVID-19 were collected via self-report questionnaires. Surviving HCWs had significantly higher rates of possible PTSD than controls (19.9% vs. 4.8%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.017). Correlates of PTSD in survivors were ICU admission (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.73, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003), &gt;10 respiratory symptoms during the most symptomatic period of COVID-19 (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.08, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006), the residual symptom of dizziness (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.43, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.013), the residual symptom of difficult breathing (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.23, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.027), life in danger due to COVID-19 (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.59, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006), and exposure to other traumatic events (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.94, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.035). Less commonly seen PTSD symptoms in survivors were having nightmares about the event (34.5%), suddenly feeling like they were living through the event suddenly (25.9%), being unable to remember an important part of the event (32.8%), and overalertness (31.0%). Nearly one-fifth of the surviving HCWs had possible PTSD 6 months after the COVID-19 outbreak. Mental health services for this vulnerable population should include periodic screening for PTSD, expanded social support, and, when necessary, psychotherapy and psychopharmacological treatment.","Xiong, Zhong, Cao, Xiong, Huang, Ding, Li, Tong, Shen, Xia, Hu","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01503-7","20210706","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-07","",15743,""
"Impact of the mandatory confinement during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic in Portuguese patients with rheumatoid arthritis: results from the COVID in RA (COVIDRA) survey","The aim of this study was to evaluate the self-reported impact of mandatory confinement occurring in the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Portuguese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as a means to improve care during this and in future pandemics. The web-based survey COVIDRA was developed to assess 5 domains including RA symptoms, attitudes towards medication, employment status, physical exercise and mental health. The questionnaire was sent to RA patients through e-mail and social media of the Portuguese Society of Rheumatology and two patient associations; and it was filled locally at two rheumatology centers in Lisbon. Recruitment took place during June and July 2020. We obtained 441 valid questionnaires. Most respondents were female (88.4%), caucasian (93.6%) with a mean age of 58 years. The majority had disease lasting &gt;10 years and were treated with csDMARDs (63.2%) and/or bDMARDs/tsDMARDS (23.7%). Over 40% experienced symptom worsening during confinement, almost half considered moderate or severe. Mobility restriction and increased stress, anxiety or depression were responsible for this worsening. Only 2.5% reduced or withheld their immunosuppressive medication due to fear of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. After confinement, 16.2% of those previously employed were in a lay-off regime and 3% lost their jobs. Most employed RA patients practiced telework during confinement. The majority of patients decreased or did not practice any physical exercise (80.5%). Symptoms of anxiety and depression developed or worsened in 67.3% and 51.9% respectively, approximately one third were considered moderate or severe. Portuguese RA patients experienced significant symptom worsening, anxiety and depression during the first wave confinement. Only a minority changed their immunosuppressive treatment for fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

"Housing and health inequities during COVID-19: findings from the national Household Pulse Survey","COVID-19 has exploited the inequities within the US housing system. Examining the association between housing and health during the pandemic is imperative to reducing health inequities and improving population health. We analysed 957 714 responses from the Household Pulse Survey Study, collected between April and July 2020. Using survey-weighted multivariable regression analyses, we assessed the relationships between housing tenure and health, both on average and over time, as well as how these relationships were moderated by COVID-19-related hardships including job loss, food insecurity and inability to afford housing-related costs. We controlled for a variety of potential socioeconomic and demographic confounding factors. We found that housing tenure was significantly associated with both self-rated health and mental distress. Compared with homeowners without mortgage debt, homeowners with mortgage debt reported worse self-rated health (ÃŽÂ²=-0.13; 95% CI -0.15 to -0.12, p&lt;0.001) and greater mental distress (ÃŽÂ²=0.50; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.55, p&lt;0.001). Renters also reported worse self-rated health (ÃŽÂ²=-0.18; 95% CI -0.20 to -0.16, p&lt;0.001) and greater mental distress (ÃŽÂ²=0.76; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.83, p&lt;0.001) than homeowners without mortgage debt. Across all tenure groups, self-rated health decreased (ÃŽÂ²=-0.007; 95% CI -0.011 to -0.004, p&lt;0.001) and mental distress increased (ÃŽÂ²=0.05; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.06, p&lt;0.001) over this period. Additionally, time and COVID-19-related hardships compounded differences in health status between homeowners and renters. These results add to a limited body of evidence suggesting that, during this period, housing instability and COVID-19-related hardships have contributed to an increase in health inequities in the USA.","Bushman, Mehdipanah","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-216764","20210706","COVID-19; health inequalities; housing; mental health; self-rated health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-07","",15745,""
"Work-related stress: the impact of COVID-19 on critical care and redeployed nurses: a mixed-methods study","We need to understand the impact of COVID-19 on critical care nurses (CCNs) and redeployed nurses and National Health Service (NHS) organisations. This is a mixed-methods study (QUANT-QUAL), underpinned by a theoretical model of occupational stress, the Job Demand-Resources Model (JD-R). Participants are critical care and redeployed nurses from Scottish and three large English units.Phase 1 is a cross-sectional survey in part replicating a pre-COVID-19 study and results will be compared with this data. Linear and logistic regression analysis will examine the relationship between antecedent, demographic and professional variables on health impairment (burnout syndrome, mental health, post-traumatic stress symptoms), motivation (work engagement, commitment) and organisational outcomes (intention to remain in critical care nursing and quality of care). We will also assess the usefulness of a range of resources provided by the NHS and professional organisations.To allow in-depth exploration of individual experiences, phase 2 will be one-to-one semistructured interviews with 25 CCNs and 10 redeployed nurses. The JD-R model will provide the initial coding framework to which the interview data will be mapped. The remaining content will be analysed inductively to identify and chart content that is not captured by the model. In this way, the adequacy of the JD-R model is examined robustly and its expression in this context will be detailed. Ethics approval was granted from the University of Aberdeen CERB2020101993. We plan to disseminate findings at stakeholder events, publish in peer-reviewed journals and at present at national and international conferences.","Rattray, McCallum, Hull, Ramsay, Salisbury, Scott, Cole, Miller, Dixon","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051326","20210706","COVID-19; adult intensive &amp; critical care; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-07","",15746,""

Nationwide cross-sectional study using survey data. Internet survey using sampling weights for national estimates conducted between 25 August and 30 September 2020 in Japan. Demographics (age, gender), socioeconomic status (income level, employment type, educational attainment, marital status, family composition and caregiving burden); the experience of domestic violence (DV), the state of emergency and fear of and stigma related to COVID-19. Prevalence of SPD, defined as Kessler 6 Scale score Ã¢â€°Â¥13. Among 25 482 respondents, 10.0% met the criteria of SPD. Overall, women (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.59; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.16; p=0.003), ages 15-29 (aOR 2.35 compared with ages 45-59 years; 95% CI 1.64 to 3.38; p&lt;0.001), low-income level (aOR 1.70 compared with intermediate income; 95% CI 1.16 to 2.49; p=0.007), providing caregiving to family members (aOR 5.48; 95% CI 3.51 to 8.56; p&lt;0.001), experiencing DV (aOR 5.72; 95% CI 3.81 to 8.59; p&lt;0.001) and fear of COVID-19 (aOR 1.96; 95% CI 1.55 to 2.48; p&lt;0.001) were associated with SPD. Among women aged 15-29 years, who have a higher risk of suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, caregiving, DV, fear of COVID-19 and COVID-19-related stigma were associated with SPD. Economic situation, caregiving burden, DV and fear of COVID-19 were independently associated with SPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among young women, similar factors, except economic situation, were associated with SPD. Targeted interventions based on age and gender may be more effective in mitigating the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population's mental health.","Yoshioka, Okubo, Tabuchi, Odani, Shinozaki, Tsugawa","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051115","20210706","COVID-19; health policy; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-07","",15747,""
"Repercussions of COVID-19 on psychiatric inpatient care in Latin America and the Caribbean","To characterise the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatric hospitalisations in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region. Descriptive study. 85 semi-structured interviews were conducted with health workers involved with psychiatric hospitalisations in general hospitals (GHs) and specialised psychiatric hospitals (SHs) from 18 LAC countries. The interviews were done between 8 May and 30 June 2020. The data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. An initial decrease in the demand for hospitalisation is reported, attributed to the population's fear of approaching health services as well as restrictions on mobility. Stricter criteria for hospitalisation were reported with a double focus on the acute within the acute. The length of hospitalisations were mixed, with both increases and decreases in GHs and SHs. The therapeutic offer was drastically reduced, and interaction between hospitalised people and their support networks was restricted. In the COVID-19 context, hospitalisation seems to be not the last but the only alternative for psychiatric treatment. The decrease in the number of beds in SHs could be a positive aspect for the reform of psychiatric care, but it is questioned since this reduction also occurs in GHs.","Ardila-GÃƒÂ³mez, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Matkovich, Rosales, Alonso, Agrest, Paternina, DÃƒÂ­az","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2021.05.004","20210706","Coronavirus infections; General hospitals; Hospitales generales; Hospitales psiquiÃƒÂ¡tricos; Hospitalisation; HospitalizaciÃƒÂ³n; Infecciones por coronavirus; Mental health services; Psychiatric hospitals; Servicios de salud mental","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-07","",15748,""
"Levels of physical activity in four domains and affective wellbeing before and during the Covid-19 pandemic","Latest studies indicated that the general mental health level is low during the pandemic. Probably, this deterioration of the mental health situation is partly due to declines in physical activity. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in and the association between affective wellbeing and levels of different domains of physical activity at three time points before and during the pandemic. We used a nationwide online panel with a trend data design encompassing a total sample of NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3517, representing the German population (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°14Ã¢â‚¬â€°years). Four different activity domains (sport and exercise, light outdoor activity, housework/gardening, active travel) and affective wellbeing (positive and negative affect) were assessed at three time points before and during the Covid-19 pandemic (October 2019, March 2020, October 2020). Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) indicate differences regarding affective wellbeing over the three time points with the lowest values at the second time point. Levels of activity in the four domains differed significantly over time with the strongest decrease for sport and exercise from the first to the second time point. Partial correlations indicated that the relationships between sport and exercise and positive affect were most consistent over time. Overall, our findings suggest that physical activity plays a particularly important role in the pandemic period as a protective factor against poor mental health. Especially sports and exercise seem to be supportive and should be encouraged, e.g. by providing additional support in finding adequate outdoor, home-based or digital substitutes.","Engels, Mutz, Demetriou, Reimers","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-021-00651-y","20210706","Affective wellbeing; Covid-19 pandemic; Domains of physical activity; Gender; Trend data","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-07","",15749,""
"Getting to the Sandbar: Understanding the Emotional Phases of COVID-19 Among College and University Students","This paper provides a framework for understanding the emotional and behavioral responses of college and university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. It builds on the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Phases of Disaster Model and Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Additionally, we conceptualize a new phase in the Phases of Disaster Model, which we refer to as the ""Sandbar Phase,"" to address the unique factors of COVID-19 for college and university students. For each phase, we discuss the expected timeline and the associated emotional reactions, behaviors, and applications of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs during COVID-19 for college and university students. Our proposed model aims to reveal short- and long-term effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of college and university students and be a resource in the development of effective mitigation efforts to diminish any psychological deficits as the result of future disasters and/or traumatic events.","Stowe, Upshaw, Estep, Lanzi","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941211028105","20210706","Mental health, awareness; anxiety, college, university; public health issues; sociocultural issues in psychology; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-07","",15750,""
"Factors associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: a Brazilian study","<b>Objectives:</b> Older adults are one of the most vulnerable age groups to the social distance measures imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to assess factors associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms in Brazilian older adults during the pandemic.<b>Method:</b> This cross-sectional online study assessed 380 older adults (over 60Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age) living in Brazil, from 26th May 2020 to 29th June 2020. A self-reported questionnaire included sociodemographic data, lifestyle, health characteristics, and the COVID-19 related variables. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) were also applied. Data were analyzed via logistic regression models, using a hierarchical approach.<b>Results:</b> The prevalence of depressive symptoms according to GDS was 28.7% (95% CI = 24.4%, 33.4%) and the prevalence of anxiety symptoms according to GAI was 26.1% (95% CI = 21.9%, 30.7%). Physically inactive older adults, the ones who were in social isolation for more days, feel much vulnerable to contracting COVID-19, and never or almost never receive support from family/friends were more likely to have depressive symptoms. Being female, physically inactive or physically active 1-3 times/week, feel very vulnerable to contracting COVID-19 and never or almost never receive support from family/friends were associated with the anxiety symptoms.<b>Conclusion:</b> A high prevalence of depressive and anxious symptoms was identified in Brazilian older adults. The data can help in planning interventions aimed at older adults, also including their families, health professionals, and the whole society.","de Oliveira Andrade, Correia Silva Azambuja, Carvalho Reis Martins, Manoel Seixas, Moretti Luchesi","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1942431","20210706","COVID-19; Mental health; psychology of aging; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-07","",15751,""
