"Profiling post-COVID syndrome across different variants of SARS-CoV-2","AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSSelf-reported symptom studies rapidly increased our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic and enabled the monitoring of long-term effects of COVID-19 outside the hospital setting. It is now evident that post-COVID syndrome presents with heterogeneous profiles, which need characterisation to enable personalised care among the most affected survivors. This study describes post-COVID profiles, and how they relate to different viral variants and vaccination status.

MethodsIn this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from 336,652 subjects, with regular health reports through the Covid Symptom Study (CSS) smartphone application. These subjects had reported feeling physically normal for at least 30 days before testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. 9,323 individuals subsequently developed Long-COVID, defined as symptoms lasting longer than 28 days. 1,459 had post-COVID syndrome, defined as more than 12 weeks of symptoms. Clustering analysis of the time-series data was performed to identify distinct symptom profiles for post-COVID patients, across variants of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccination status at the time of infection. Clusters were then characterised based on symptom prevalence, duration, demography, and prior conditions (comorbidities).

Using an independent testing sample with additional data (n=140), we investigated the impact of post-COVID symptom clusters on the lives of affected individuals.

FindingsWe identified distinct profiles of symptoms for post-COVID syndrome within and across variants: four endotypes were identified for infections due to the wild-type variant; seven for the alpha variant; and five for delta. Across all variants, a cardiorespiratory cluster of symptoms was identified. A second cluster related to central neurological, and a third to cases with the most severe and debilitating multi-organ symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms clustered in no more than two specific phenotypes per viral variant. The three main clusters were confirmed in an independent testing sample, and their functional impact was assessed.

InterpretationUnsupervised analysis identified different post-COVID profiles, characterised by differing symptom combinations, durations, and functional outcomes. Phenotypes were at least partially concordant with individuals reported experiences.

Our classification may be useful to understand distinct mechanisms of the post-COVID syndrome, as well as subgroups of individuals at risk of prolonged debilitation.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe conducted a search in the PubMed Central database, with keywords: (""Long-COVID*"" OR ""post?covid*"" OR ""post?COVID*"" OR postCOVID* OR postCovid*) AND (cluster* OR endotype* OR phenotype* OR sub?type* OR subtype).

On 15 June 2022, 161 documents were identified, of which 24 either provided descriptions of sub-types or proposed phenotypes of Long-COVID or post-COVID syndrome(s). These included 16 studies attempting manual sub-grouping of phenotypes, 6 deployments of unsupervised methods for patient clustering and automatic semantic phenotyping (unsupervised k-means=2; random forest classification=1; other=2), and two reports of uncommon presentations of Long-COVID/post-COVID syndrome. Overall, two to eight symptom profiles (clusters) were identified, with three recurring clusters. A cardiopulmonary syndrome was the predominant observation, manifesting with exertional intolerance and dyspnoea (n=10), fatigue (n=8), autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia or palpitations (n=5), lung radiological abnormalities including fibrosis (n=2), and chest pain (n=1). A second common presentation consisted in persistent general autoimmune activation and proinflammatory state (n=2), comprising multi-organ mild sequelae (n=2), gastrointestinal symptoms (n=2), dermatological symptoms (n=2), and/or fever (n=1). A third syndrome was reported, with neurological or neuropsychiatric symptoms: brain fog or dizziness (n=2), poor memory or cognition (n=2), and other mental health issues including mood disorders (n=5), headache (n=2), central sensitization (n=1), paresthesia (n=1), autonomic dysfunction (n=1), fibromyalgia (n=2), and chronic pain or myalgias (n=6). Unsupervised clustering methods identified two to six different post-COVID phenotypes, mapping to the ones described above.

14 further documents focused on possible causes and/or mechanisms of disease underlying one or more manifestations of Long-COVID or post-COVID and identifying immune response dysregulation as a potential common element. All the other documents were beyond the scope of this work.

To our knowledge, there are no studies examining the symptom profile of post-COVID syndrome between different variants and vaccination status. Also, no studies reported the modelling of longitudinally collected symptoms, as time-series data, aiming at the characterisation of post-COVID syndrome.

Added-value of this studyOur study aimed to identify symptom profiles for post-COVID syndrome across the dominant variants in 2020 and 2021, and across vaccination status at the time of infection, using a large sample with prospectively collected longitudinal self-reports of symptoms. For individuals developing 12 weeks or more of symptoms, we identified three main symptom profiles which were consistent across variants and by vaccination status, differing only in the ratio of individuals affected by each profile and symptom duration overall.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe demonstrate the existence of different post-COVID syndromes, which share commonalities across SARS-CoV-2 variant types in both symptoms themselves and how they evolved through the illness. We describe subgroups of patients with specific post-COVID presentations which might reflect different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Given the time-series component, our study is relevant for post-COVID prognostication, indicating how long certain symptoms last. These insights could aid in the development of personalised diagnosis and treatment, as well as helping policymakers plan for the delivery of care for people living with post-COVID syndrome.","Liane S Canas PhD; Erika Molteni PhD; Jie Deng PhD; Carole H.

"COVID-19 exposure and mental wellbeing of European male employees","Background: The present research intends to identify the determinants of men???s mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The fear and uncertainty caused by this pandemic and its prolongation have caused a considerable rise in mental health disorders. In a very short time, much research has been conducted examining the main consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals??? mental health. Some studies pointed out that COVID-19 stressors significantly affect individuals, and some statistics suggest that the pandemic affects men and women differently. However, the literature on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on men???s mental health remains limited. This research attempted to fill these gaps in the literature by examining an essential research question about the determinants of men???s mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This research uses a dataset collected on Eurofound???s Living, Working, and COVID-19 survey, and the full sample consisted of 24,123 European citizens. The sample was split into two main groups: men (N = 3577) and women (N = 8744). This research uses linear regression methodology to investigate the mental wellbeing of male employees. The input method was applied to estimate two regression models, one for men and one for women. Results: Our results revealed that men???s exposure to COVID-19 infection deteriorates their mental wellbeing. Similarly, some organizational factors also determined men???s mental wellbeing, such as working under fixed employment contracts, feelings of doing useful work, and satisfaction with the quality of work. Finally, individual and attitudinal factors contributed to determining the mental wellbeing of male employees, optimism about the future, general health, positive feelings about themselves, and overall life satisfaction. Conclusion: This research deduces that men???s mental wellbeing is determined by factors that are different from those of women employees. In conclusion, this research deduces that men???s good mental wellbeing is determined differently from women employees. Specifically, we identified that exposure to COVID-19, employment contracts at the job, feelings of doing useful work, satisfaction with the quality of work, resilience, age, life satisfaction, general health, optimism about the future, and feeling positive about themselves are the key determinants of men???s health.","Han, Heesup, Saleem, Maria, Ariza-Montes, Antonio, Mahmood, Faisal","https://doi.org/10.31083/j.jomh1807145","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Men's Health; 18(7), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35479,""
"Depression Levels of University Students and Changes in their Nutritional Status in the COVID-19 Pandemic Quarantine Period: A study in Turkey","Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the depression levels and nutritional changes of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine process. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 4528 (1726 male and 2802 female) university students, aged between 18-42 years, living in Turkey. A questionnaire form questioning demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, dietary changes and BECK Depression Inventory was sent to the university students via the online system (via google form). Analysis results mean ?? s for quantitative data. Categorical data as deviation and median (minimum ??? maximum) were presented as frequency (percentage). Significance level was taken as p&lt;0.050. Results: There was a statistically significant relationship between gender and the BDI score (p&lt;0.001). A statistically significant difference was found between the distributions of general nutritional change in women compared to the BDI groups (p&lt;0.001). Risk factors affecting nutritional changes were analyzed by binary logistic regression analysis as univariate and multivariate models. According to the Univariate model result, the risk of nutritional changes increases 1.042 times when the BDI score increases (p&lt;0.001). The risk of nutritional changes of women is 1.618 times higher than that of men (p&lt;0.001). When the results of the multivariate model are examined, the risk of nutritional changes increases 1.038 times when the BDI score increases (p&lt;0.001). The risk of nutritional changes of women is 1.339 times higher than that of men (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: The quarantine period caused some changes in the nutritional changes and depression levels of university students. As a result, in this study conducted with university students, differences in food preferences and the presence of depressive state were observed during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine period. It is necessary to be aware of what university students are going through in this period and to take preventive measures to improve their health.","Baygut, H.","https://doi.org/10.23751/pn.v24i2.12539Mattioli1885","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: PROGRESS IN NUTRITION; 24(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35480,""
"Young Adult's Health-Preventive Behaviors toward Coronavirus Disease 2019","OBJECTIVE: To explore the young adult's coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health-preventive behaviors in Saudi Arabia. METHODOLOGY: Semi-structured virtual interviews regarding health-preventive behaviors were conducted with 35 participants during the lockdown because of the pandemic. The Health Belief Model was used in the analysis and data presentation. RESULTS: Young adults had feelings of fear, loneliness, anxiety, irritability, easy distraction, loss of concentration, and depression during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in this study were aware of the benefits of applying the health-preventive actions. The reported barriers hinder some of them from using some of the COVID-19 health-preventive steps are mainly related to social distancing and the curfew on some people. The participants reported their confidence in their COVID-19 health preventive knowledge and stated that they could protect themselves and others from getting infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: According to HBM, they strongly believe in health actions efficacy in their country and followed the COVID-19 health-preventive actions. Participants had a positive perception regarding the threat and severity of COVID-19 infection. Financial consequences of the curfew, noncompliance with the preventive actions' and lack of awareness of the importance of the health-preventive activities of some people are among the barriers to applying the COVID-19 health-preventive measures.","Asfour, H.

"INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY IN SMES: CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS GROWTH","During the pandemic, the tourism and hospitality sector was one of the worst-hit sectors in Seychelles. Due to the uncertainties in the 'new normal' environment, businesses had to devise strategies and tactics to survive and emerge from the turmoil. This event or the new normal was unexpected, and there is a lack of studies on this phenomenon in Seychelles. This qualitative study aimed to ascertain the impact of the pandemic and, subsequently, the tactics and strategies to survive and sustain the growth of SMEs in Seycheles. This research was a qualitative study in which semi-structured open-ended interviews were conducted. The objective was to collect in-depth data from the target population who were owners or operators of SMEs engaged in the tourism sector in Seychelles. Judgemental sampling was utilized. The researcher's professional judgment was used to select the participants who thematic analysis identified the themes that emerged from colected through interviews and transcribed data. The key impact of the pandemic uncovered in this study encompass increased uncertainty, a drop in sales leading to cash flow shortage, changes in customers, and an increase in operating costs. The main strategies to deal with the effect of the pandemic include cost-cutting, managing cash on hand, CSR involvement, flexible pricing, and implementing intensive growth strategies. The results are expected to provide policymakers in Seychelles with additional information that could be useful in forming policies that would help ease the struggles that businesses are encountering. The study also suggested that SMEs be more innovative and search for new opportunities to sustain and grow. To the sector in Seychelles.","Pillay, H. L.; Singh, J. S. K.; Fah, B. C.

"Assessing health-related behaviors among Jordanian children during COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Background: The coronavirus disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19) led to extreme actions being taken by the governments to restrict the spread of this virus. Closure of schools, sport clubs and playgrounds were among these actions;children had to stay indoors and were not allowed to pursue their normal lifestyle activities. Objectives: To assess the differences in health-related behaviors among Jordanian school-aged children (6-16 years) before and during COVID-19 quarantine and to evaluate public's perception of the role of pharmacists regarding children's health-related behaviors management. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2020 to January 2021 using an anonymous web-based survey. The survey was developed based on previously published surveys. Evaluation of the validity and reliability of the survey were conducted by a professional committee of clinical pharmacists and a statistician. Results: A total of 230 children, aged 9.02 +/- 2.977 participated in the study.

"Developing Community Public Health Interventions by Pharmacy Students during the SARS-COV2 Pandemic in Costa Rica","Objective: To describe the development of virtual community interventions within the framework of public health interventions in community pharmacies, as a didactic strategy in university education from a constructivist approach for its subsequent implementation at times when these initiatives cannot be carried out face to face. Method: The students developed virtual interventions in communities or specific population groups on the topics of vaccination, asthma, depression, and fibromyalgia, previously chosen by the professors. The interventions were developed in accord with the 10 essential services in public health and with the mandatory participation of the community or interested stakeholders;interventions consisted of six phases: description of the community, problem identification, proposal of an action plan, construction of the interventions, marketing plan development, and the evaluation of interventions. To identify the problem, students conducted interviews on people familiar with each assigned topic, to identify common needs or concerns. These common needs or concerns were considered the aspects on which the participating population agreed were considered as the problem to work on. Results: The interventions developed were mainly talks, workshops, and virtual educational campaigns through infographics, posters, and social networks. Conclusions: The activities of the course were easily adapted to the virtuality, which could mean a reconsideration of the course modality. The use of virtuality for the development of health interventions in the community is an important resource that facilitates access to health education for the population especially for those who live in rural or remote areas. It constitutes a way of providing people with digital tools for self-care in health.","Ramirez, V. C.; Gonzalez, T. C.; Herrera, L. G. J.; Salas, A. L.; Morua, M. S.

"Let's Look at Cannabis from This Angle: COVID-19","Cannabis sativa (Can nabis=hemp) contains cannabinoid-derived main components. Cannabinoids exert biological effects by stimulating cannabinoid receptors distributed throughout the body. Cannabis products affect various systems in the body such as the cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous and immune systems. They show analgesic, antiemetic, anxiolytic, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antihypertensive, antitussive and cardioprotective effects. COVID-19 affects different organ systems in the body and causes symptoms depending on the mutation, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and sense of smell. In this article, effectiveness of C. sativa and its components on COVID-19 have been evaluated, based on the fact that components or the extracts can affect the whole body due to cannabinoid receptors. Although cannabis and its components have potential beneficial effects for the entry of COVID-19 through the receptors into the body and the symptoms, further studies are needed for their safe use.

"STUDY OF PROFESSIONAL HEALTH OF HIGHER EDUCATION TEACHERS IN UKRAINE UNDER QUARANTINE","The problem of changes in educators' various health aspects in the context of transition to distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by changes in professional activities, is not sufficiently studied. This study aimed to identify and analyze physiological, psychological, and professional changes in scientific and pedagogical staff of Ukrainian higher education institutions, associated with the transition to distance learning under quarantine, which affected social, psychological, physical, and mental aspects of their health. A total of 254 educators of Ukrainian higher education institutions were surveyed and their responses analysed. The study revealed certain physiological, psychological, and psychosomatic indicators showing that online work leads to health deterioration. The survey showed that educators consider online learning to be ineffective, opting for a mixed form of education under quarantine. It was found that scientific and pedagogical staff is divided into two clusters according to their state of health as a result of new conditions of professional activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two-thirds of educators coped with the challenges quite well, while the remaining third felt severe aftereffects on their physiological and psychological health. The distinct features that differentiate these two clusters were identified and discussed. Most of scientific and pedagogical staff of Ukrainian higher education institutions pointed out that the lockdown and quarantine measures and the consequent transition to distance teaching had a significant impact on their social, psychological, physical, and mental health. Though the majority of educators confirmed their adaptation to the new working conditions, there was a cluster of teachers for whom the process of adjustment was quite psychologically traumatic.","Sheykina, N.

Cancer patients are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity than the general population. Due to this, there is a possibility that cancer patients may be suffering from a higher level of COVID-19 related anxiety, fear, and obsession. Aim: To explore COVID-19 related mental health issues (anxiety, fear, and obsession) and its correlates in patients with cancer. Materials and Methods: The present study was a cross-sectional pilot study which was conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital located in Ratnagiri, Maharashtra, India. Patients receiving treatment for cancer (n=55) consequently at tertiary care teaching hospital of India were recruited. The Corona Anxiety Scale (CAS), Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7) were used to assess all eligible patients. Fisher's-exact test. spearman's rank correlation, and logistic regression were used to analyse the data. Results: Among the 55 patients (mean age was 49.64 +/- 13.08 years) with cancer, 11 (20%) had Coronavirus related anxiety and 2 (3.6%) had obsession related COVID-19, 22 (40%) had depression and 18 (32.7%) has GAD. CAS score positively correlated with FCV-19S score [rho=0.50 (p&lt;0.001)], PHQ-9 score [rho=0.90 (p&lt;0.001)] and GAD-7 score [rho=0.74 (p&lt;0.001)]. Conclusion: COVID-19 related mental health issues (fear, anxiety), depression, and GAD were prevalent among patients with cancer. Further, COVID-19 specific issues may not be addressed in routine screening and evaluation in current practice. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop systematic strategies to screen and develop specific mental health interventions for patients with cancer.","Padma, K.; Saka, D.; Fernandes, S.; Nanaware, S.; Patil, I.; Ransing, R.","https://doi.org/10.7860/JCDR/2022/52123.16571","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH; 16(7):VC16-VC20, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35489,""
"Dimensions of emotional distress among Brazilian workers in a COVID-19 reference hospital: A factor analytical study","BACKGROUNDThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented challenge for public health and has caused the loss of millions of lives worldwide. Hospital workers play a key role in averting the collapse of the health system, but the mental health of many has deteriorated during the pandemic. Few studies have been devoted to identifying the needs of workers on frontline duty.AIMTo investigate dimensions of common emotional symptoms and associated predictors among Brazilian workers in a COVID-19 reference hospital.METHODSThis is an observational study of the mental health of professionals in a COVID-19 hospital in the city of Sao Paulo. We invited all hospital employees to respond to an online survey between July and August 2020, during the first peak of the pandemic. Data of 1000 participants who completed the survey were analyzed (83.9% were women and 34.3% were aged 30 to 40). Hospital workers self-reported the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, trauma-related stress, and burnout through the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Mini-Z Burnout Assessment respectively. Responses were assembled and subjected to exploratory factor analysis to reveal workers' core emotional distress. Multiple linear regression models were subsequently carried out to estimate the likelihood of dimensions of distress using questions on personal motivation, threatening events, and institutional support.RESULTSAround one in three participants in our sample scored above the threshold of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout. The factor analysis revealed a three-factor structure that explained 58% of the total data variance. Core distressing emotional domains were avoidance and re-experience, depression-anxiety, and sleep changes. Regression analysis revealed that institutional support was a significant protective factor for each of these dimensions (beta range = -0.41 to -0.20, P &lt; 0.001). However, participants' personal motivation to work in healthcare service was not associated with these emotional domains. Moreover, the likelihood of presenting the avoidance and re-experience dimension was associated with having a family member or close friend be hospitalized or die due to COVID-19 and having faced an ethical conflict.CONCLUSIONDistressing emotional domains among hospital workers were avoidance and re-experience, depression and anxiety, and sleep changes. Improving working conditions through institutional support could protect hospital workers' mental health during devastating public health crises.","Carvalho-Alves, M. O.; Petrilli-Mazon, V.

"Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic Referrals During Covid-19 Pandemic in Turkey","Background: The objective of the current study was to assess how the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has affected mental health services compared to the same period of the year before the pandemic. Methods: The data in the study were retrieved from the databases of the computer systems of the hospitals. All referrals in the child psychiatry outpatient clinic between March 1 and June 30, 2019, and between March 1 and June 30, 2020, constituted the sample. Results: Of the 3110 referrals, 2246 were cases and 864 were repeating examinations. Of the 2246 cases, 70.5% (n = 1583) were admitted in 2019, while 29.5% (n = 663) were admitted in 2020. Of the cases who referred in 2019, 37.3% (n = 590) were female, while this rate was 43.9% (n = 291) in 2020. The mean age of 2019 cases was found to be 9.51 Â± 4.17, while the mean age of 2020 cases was found to be 10.39 Â± 4.06. While attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, depressive disorder, panic disorder, school refusal, and sleep disorder rates increased significantly, specific learning disorders and mental retardation rates were found to be on the decrease in 2020. In 2019, 47.6% (n = 754) of the cases were followed with medication, and in 2020, this rate increased to 63.2% (n = 419). Conclusion: Pandemic conditions affected the content of public hospital psychiatry referrals significantly. It can be thought that the significant decrease in the number of referrals may be the result of citizens obeying the prohibitions and the fear of disease transmission in families with the onset of the pandemic that precedes the existing psychiatric problems of children.","AkgÃ¼l, G.

"The Persistent Symptoms and Decreased Quality of Life of COVID-19 Patients (A 3-month Follow-up after Discharge)","BACKGROUND: Most coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are still experiencing persistent clinical symptoms even after being discharged from the hospital. The previous studies have reported the remaining symptoms in 29â€“93% of patients. This condition can have a major impact on a patientâ€™s ability to perform daily activities and have a deleterious effect on their quality of life (QoL). AIM: This study aimed to evaluate persistent symptoms and QoL of COVID-19 patients 3 months after discharge from Dr. Kariadi Hospital Semarang, Central Java, Indonesia. METHODS: Confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this prospective cohort study after discharge from Dr. Kariadi Hospital Semarang from March 1, 2021, to May 15, 2021. Telephone interviews were conducted each week in the 1st month, and every 2 weeks in the 2nd and 3rd months regarding persistent symptoms. EQ-5D-5L questionnaires were completed and evaluated every month for 3 months after hospital discharge. RESULTS: Of the 104 patients enrolled, 52.9% were male, with a mean age of 48.96 years. The incidence of persistent symptoms in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd months was 49%, 31.7%, and 25%, respectively. The most common persistent symptoms were fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, and nausea. The characteristics of the patients included being overweight/obese, having one or more comorbidities, having five or more symptoms classified as moderate COVID-19, and requiring supplemental oxygen during hospitalization. Based on the EQ-5D questionnaire, most patients reported worsening in the quality of their ability to perform usual activities, feelings of pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The total values of the EQ-5D and EQ-VAS indices were lower than those of the Indonesian general population, indicating a decrease in QoL. CONCLUSION: The patients developed persistent symptoms and decreased quality of life during the 3-month following hospital discharge.","Farhanah, N.; Budiman, C.; Sofro, M. A.

"Depression, Anxiety, and Stress among Sudanese Medical Students during the COVID-19 Lockdown Period","BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed a compulsory lockdown that has led to the emergence of various types of psychological distress among medical students. AIM: This study aimed to identify the determinants and the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among Sudanese medical students during the COVID-19 lockdown period. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire that contained the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: A total of 1058 students responded and completed the questionnaire. The study sample consisted of 604 (57.1%) females, and the rest were male. The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress were 75%, 55.3%, and 51.8%, respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that depression, anxiety, and stress were significantly associated with the female gender (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-2.16) (AOR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.35-2.22) (AOR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.07-1.74) respectively. Depression and stress were significantly associated with students at the pre-clinical phase (AOR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.24-2.20) (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.12-1.83), respectively. Anxiety was significantly associated with studying at a private university (AOR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.05-1.76). CONCLUSIONS: Female students in the pre-clinical phase had an increased risk of depression and stress. Female students attending a private university had an increased risk of anxiety. Depression, anxiety, and stress were highly prevalent among Sudanese medical students.","Mohamed, O. G. N.; Mohamed, E. G. N.; Ahmed, R.; Aburas, L.; Ali, M.; Hamdan, H.

"Mental Health Outcomes and Psychological Support among University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Egypt","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the impact of a major public health emergency on mental health. AIM: The aim of the study was to assess psychological impact among university students and train them to raise mental health awareness among their peers during the pandemic. METHODS: This an online electronic survey that was carried out over the period of July to September 2020. Study participants were medical and paramedical university students representing studentsâ€™ union alliance of the Egyptian Youth Initiative. A convenient non-probability sampling method used for recruiting the study participants. Key mental health outcomes investigated 2 weeks before the survey were posttraumatic stress symptoms, symptoms of depression using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), anxiety using Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), insomnia using Insomnia Severity Index, and perceived stress using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Based on the preliminary analysis of the online questionnaires, a PhD qualified psychiatrist was assigned to develop an online psychosocial support to the volunteersâ€™ students (n = 60) to be facilitators for raising mental awareness among peers and train them how to handle stress. RESULTS: Of the 115 students, 42.6% experienced moderate to severe depression, 21.7% were afflicted with moderate to severe anxiety, and 62.7% suffered from sub-threshold to severe insomnia. PSS analysis showed moderate levels of stress among the study participants. A significant difference was detected between pre-and post-test mean scores of the PSS (p = 0.001) 8 weeks after the training program included psychological support for the students. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study showed that young people suffered of more than one psychological problems and highlighted the urgent need to develop interventions and preventive strategies to address mental health of college students.","Abdel-Aziz, S.

"A Communication Study of Young Adults and Online Dependency during the COVID-19 Pandemic","People use digital media and the Internet daily. The time that young people spend connected to digital devices will increase as technology advances, which could have severe health risks and behavioral dependence implications. In the context of the current pandemic, in which socializing, studying, and working is changing, this question has become particularly relevant. Therefore, we propose to investigate the perceptions of young university adults-understood as generation Z-regarding their digital media practices, particularly during the pandemic, and to study the consequences of a permanent connection to these formats on the development of an addiction to the Internet. Our quantitative method approach applied questionnaires to a sample of 407 young university adults studying in Portugal. Through this survey, we could target a specific user group, quantify their consumption, and measure their online experiences. The results point to an increase in dependence on the Internet during confinement. While it is true that carrying out academic work is one of the reasons for this growth, it is noteworthy that the respondents sought the online world in a significan way to pass the time and escape their routine. In addition, they confess to experiencing some consequences of excessive use, such as sleep disturbances and adverse emotional reactions-such as instabilities, depression, and nervousness-when not online. We conclude that the pandemic has intensified online dependence. However, above all that, it is necessary to look at the mental and general health consequences that this excessive use has brought, which may not be visible or manifested by the youth in the short term, and may come to have consequences in the long term.","Silveira, PatrÃ­cia, Morais, Ricardo, Petrella, Simone","https://doi.org/10.3390/soc12040109","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Societies; 12(4):109, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35495,""
"Experiential Avoidance Mediates the Relationship between Prayer Type and Mental Health before and through the COVID-19 Pandemic","The practice of prayer has been shown to predict various mental health outcomes, with different types of prayer accounting for different outcomes. Considering the numerous stressors facing seminary students, which have only intensified throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, prayer may be a common coping strategy for students who study theology, spiritual growth, and leadership. The present study investigates the role that different types of prayer may have in reducing anxiety, depression, and work burnout among seminary students. Experiential avoidance is proposed as a mediator such that specific types of prayer contribute to greater spiritual and characterological formation through staying engaged in the midst of struggle. Longitudinal data was collected from 564 graduate seminary students from 17 institutions accredited by the Association of Theological Schools. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that experiential avoidance would mediate the relationship between colloquial, liturgical, meditative, and petitionary prayer types and the negative mental health outcomes of anxiety, depression, and work burnout. Results confirmed significant negative relationships between colloquial, liturgical, and meditative prayer types and all three mental health indicators, fully mediated by experiential avoidance. Petitionary prayer was not significantly related to lower levels of mental health. These results indicate that engaging in certain prayer practices may be a protective factor by facilitating experiential engagement.","Lowe, Gabriel B.; Wang, David C.; Chin, Eu Gene","https://doi.org/10.3390/rel13070652","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Religions; 13(7):652, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35496,""
"Parent&ndash;Teacher Interactions during COVID-19: Experiences of US Teachers of Students with Severe Disabilities","In 2020, COVID-19 disrupted all aspects of society across the globe including healthcare, employment, social interactions, and education. In many parts of the world, abrupt school closures caught teachers off guard, as they were forced to immediately shift their practices from in-person to online instruction with little-to-no preparation. Furthermore, during this time, many parents of school-aged children vacillated between multiple roles associated with their employment, household caregiving activities, and supporting their children at home. These challenges were especially challenging for teachers and parents of students with severe disabilities. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of U.S. teachers of students with severe disabilities regarding interacting with parents during the COVID-19 pandemic, including when schools initially closed in March 2020 and then reopened in September of 2020. This manuscript outlines six key themes highlighting parent&ndash;teacher interactions: (a) parents directing school decisions, (b) teacher inability to meet parent expectations, (c) parent&ndash;teacher communication, (d) parents as teachers, (e) parent exhaustion, and (f) teacher helplessness.","Francis, Grace L.; Raines, Alexandra R.; Reed, Alexandra S.; Kinas Jerome, Marci","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci12070488","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Education Sciences; 12(7):488, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35497,""

"Caregiver Perspective on the Impact of COVID-19 on the Psychosocial and Behavioral Health of Children with ASD in the United States: A Questionnaire-Based Survey","Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were particularly vulnerable to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study we conducted an anonymous caregiver survey to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychosocial and behavioral health of children with ASD. Data from 700 responses identified several significant factors predicting greater difficulties for the child including pre-existing behavioral challenges (OR = 5.179;95% CI: 2.696, 9.951), disrupted sleep (OR = 2.618;95% CI 1.341, 5.112), and a diagnosis of depression (OR = 3.425;95% CI: 1.1621, 4.116). Greater difficulties for caregivers in managing their child's behaviors were associated with sleep disturbances (OR = 1.926;95% CI: 1.170, 3.170), self-injurious behavior (OR = 3.587;95% CI: 1.767, 7.281), and managing the child's school activities (OR = 3.107;95% CI: 1.732, 5.257) and free time (OR = 3.758;95% CI: 2.217, 6.369). However, being under the care of a neuropsychiatrist was associated with less difficulty in managing the child's behaviors (OR = 2.516;95% CI: &minus;1.046, &minus;5.382). Finally, the presence of comorbidities (OR = 2.599;95% CI: 1.053, 4.067) and a greater difficulty in managing the child's school activities (OR = 2.531;95% CI: 1.655, 3.868) and free time (OR = 1.651;95% CI: 1.101, 2.478) were associated with an increased likelihood of caregiver desire for their child to return to in-person school in the fall.

"The Advances of Immersive Virtual Reality Interventions for the Enhancement of Stress Management and Relaxation among Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review","The rapid changes in human contacts due to the COVID-19 crisis have not only posed a huge burden on the population's health but may have also increased the demand for evidence-based psychological programs delivered through digital technology. A systematic review, following the 'Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)';guidelines, was therefore conducted to explore the advances in stress management interventions utilizing VR and suggest up-to-date directions for future practice. The relevant literature was screened and the search resulted in 22,312 records, of which 16 studies were considered for analysis. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) was also employed to assess the quality of the included studies. The results suggest that VR-based interventions can facilitate positive changes in subjective stress levels and stress-related biomarkers. However, special attention should be paid to the development of rigorous VR protocols that embrace natural elements and concepts deriving from traditional treatment approaches, such as cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. Overall, this review aims to empower future researchers to grasp the opportunity that the COVID-19 pandemic generated and utilize digital technologies for strengthening individuals' mental health. Future projects need to conduct large-scale VR studies to evaluate their effectiveness compared to other mental health interventions.","Velana, Maria, Sobieraj, Sabrina, Digutsch, Jan, Rinkenauer, Gerhard","https://doi.org/10.3390/app12147309","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Applied Sciences; 12(14):7309, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35500,""

This research will focus on the youth of the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East. The word 'youth' indicates that this research will be focused solely on the demographic of 13-30 years of age. The reason for choosing these two specific geographical locations is due to the circumstance that both of these areas faced the outbreak of the virus around the same time and imposed strict lockdown rules within the same week. While the reason for choosing this specific age group is due to the fact that we have the maximum number of reaches pertaining to this age group.

"Investigating the Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Healthcare Professionals: Implications and Recommendations","Public health crises that increase the demand for healthcare professionals (HCPs) often result in increased mental distress in HCPs. The current study investigated the specific mental health ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic on HCPs and perceived support from their places of work. Data was collected from US-based HCPs (N = 325) working as physicians (21.8%), nurses (26.8%), mental health professionals (MHPs;30.5%), and allied healthcare professionals (AHPs;20.9%) from April 2020 to April 2021 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, using an online self-report survey. Descriptive and correlational statistical analyses assessed worry, stressors, psychological functioning, and perceived support. A majority of participants expressed worry about the pandemic broadly (93%), and approximately half (50.5%) indicated that their degree of worry was moderate to extreme. Respondents worried most about the risk of infection for family and relatives. HCPs reported not having been able to enjoy daily activities (66.9%), losing sleep (43.1%), and feeling constantly under strain (66.9%), compared to usual. Most HCPs indicated a strong desire for clear communication regarding the pandemic and psychological support from their workplaces. This paper provides recommendations to support HCP mental health by both ameliorating distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as protecting the health and wellness of HCPs more generally. HCPs and institutions that employ them should seek out or provide access to mental health resources and services, engage with or provide opportunities and activities to actively address mental health, and improve communication regarding COVID-19 or other topics HCPs demonstrate interest in.","Meyer, Marisol L.; Louder, Ceewin N.; Self, Kyle J.; Nicolas, Guerda","https://doi.org/10.1177/26320770221091735","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Prevention and Health Promotion;: 26320770221091735, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35502,""
"Strategies and inequities in balancing recreation and COVID exposure when visiting green spaces","Green spaces are beneficial for physical and mental health, especially during and after disasters. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, created a trade-off: parks could be therapeutic but also could expose people to infection. This paradox posed inequities as marginalized populations often have less access to parks and were hit harder by the pandemic. We combined cellphone-generated mobility data with demographic indicators, a neighborhood survey, and local infection rates to examine how residents of Boston, MA, navigated this trade-off in April?August 2020. We hypothesized that they adopted strategies for mitigating infection exposure?including fewer park visits and prioritizing parks that might have lower infection risk, including larger parks with more opportunity for social distancing and parks near home with fewer unfamiliar faces?but that marginalized populations would have less opportunity to do so. We also introduce a novel measure of exposure per visit based on the volume of other visitors, infection rates, and park size. Bostonians made fewer park visits relative to 2019 and prioritized larger parks and parks closer to home. These strategies varied by community. Experiences of the pandemic were influential, as communities that perceived greater risk or had more infections made more park visits, likely because they were a relatively safe activity. Communities with more infections tended to avoid nearby parks. Inequities were also apparent. Communities with more Black residents and infections had greater infection exposure per visit even when controlling for the types of parks visited, highlighting difficulties in escaping the challenges of the pandemic.","Dass, Sarina, Oâ€™Brien, Daniel T.; Ristea, Alina","https://doi.org/10.1177/23998083221114645","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science;: 23998083221114645, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35503,""
"COVID-19 and the Adaptive Role of Educators: The Impact of Digital Literacy and Psychological Well-Being on Educationâ€”A PLS-SEM Approach","Mobility restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic raised mental health consequences. This paper examines the triangulation of Digital Literacy (DL), psychological well-being, and effectiveness of remote teaching and learning during the pandemic. Survey responses collected from 518 schoolteachers in Sri Lanka are analyzed with Partial Least Squares ? Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) method. Results indicate that Remote Education (RE) has twisted a stressful life for educators. DL negatively affects the psychological well-being of the teacher. The effectiveness of teaching and learning and teacher engagement depends upon their DL level. Educators? stress and depression status mediate the outcome of remote teaching and learning mode. Moreover, digital skills count more than the accumulated teaching experience. We emphasize the adaptive role of the teacher for sustainable digital education. The results indicate that augmented education success could be obtained by investing in digital competence. It suggests that upgrading DL is an urgent role and alarms the policymakers and education managers to mitigate the potential mental health and social capital crisis.","Gunathilaka, Chandana, Wickramasinghe, Rasika S.; Jais, Mohamad","https://doi.org/10.1177/10567879221113546","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Educational Reform;: 10567879221113546, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35504,""
"The Psychological Consequences of SARS-CoV 2 in Healthcare Professionals","During the Covid-19 health emergency, the self-assessment of psychological relapses in 24 health workers through a Covid-19 Emergency Triage Card sought to examine how doctors, health technicians, nurses and auxiliaries perceived their mental state immediately after the communication coronavirus positivity. A Covid-19 Emergency Triage Card consisting of two sections was submitted to the study sample. First section personal data: age, sex, educational qualification, seniority, marital status, offspring, job, workload in hours, presence of night shifts, lifestyle habits (use of alcohol, tobacco, coffee). Second section: self-assessment of the psychological repercussions of the pandemic event with five sub-dimensions: anxiety;psychosomatic disorder;depression;thought disorder. behavioral changes, rated on a three-level scale: mild - medium - severe. The analysis of our results shows that anxiety-depressive symptoms take on significant values in Covid-19 positive healthcare personnel, with greater predominance among nurses. This results in identifying workers most at risk of adverse mental health outcomes during times of health emergency is a public health task.

"Moulding and Sustaining Excellence and Passion of Teachers through Resilience in the Post-Covid-Pandemic Era","Human resource excellence through resilience is a recent area of research in organisations to overcome all pitfalls of the workforce. Due to the pandemic wave of COVID-19, all institutions were closed for reducing the crisis dilemma;the entire world was affected especially the education sector. The lockdown system throughout the world arose out of the Corona epidemic and has created changes in the model of teaching, that is, from a conventional-lecture method to a virtual classroom system. Though the sudden shift affected the entire sector of education, the aftermath of this situation has adversely disturbed the college teachers and students. This study aimed at reducing the stress, worries and technological issues that college teachers are experiencing in Thrissur district, Kerala. By following a simple random sampling method, the study was conducted among 268 teachers who were working in a college by administering a self-structured questionnaire. The result through the SEM analysis has shown that resilience has prevented negative mental health, and stress in work while there was an increased work?life balance, that is, the well-being of teachers. It has created a signature strength in their work.","Rekha Francis, C.; Fraga, F. X.

"Suicidal Economy of Turkey in Times of Crisis: 2018 Crisis and Beyond","This article aims to explain the political-economic character of the increasing suicides in Turkey since 2018 that stem from indebtedness, poverty, and unemployment. It frames the acts as economy-relevant suicides to emphasize the embeddedness of these suicides within the neoliberal transformation and its consequences at the global and national levels. In this regard, the study traces the trajectory of neoliberalism in Turkey from 1980 to the COVID-19 pandemic, and critically evaluates the political and economic decisions of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government to reveal the causal links with the increasing number of suicides. The study argues that two aspects of neoliberalization have paved the way for the post-2018 suicides: the declining political and economic power of the working class and the outcomes of financialization such as long-term unemployment and indebtedness. Thus, it argues that economy-relevant suicides are pathologic but depict political character, regardless of their effectiveness as a political strategy, given the consequences of the neoliberal transformation and political choices in due course.","YÃ¼cel, Yunus, Kabalay, Berkay","https://doi.org/10.1177/08969205221113072","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Critical Sociology;: 08969205221113072, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35507,""
"Pilot Outcomes of A Multi-component Support Intervention for Caregivers of Persons with Heart Failure","Background: Caregivers of persons with heart failure must manage high levels of patient health care utilization, treatment complexity and often unpredictable stressors associated with intermittent symptom exacerbations and mortality. Interventions have often focused on the needs of the person with HF, not the caregiver. Therefore, we developed an intervention using human-centered design to provide caregiver-targeted support for this population. Objective: Pilot test the feasibility and gauge initial effect size of the Caregiver Support intervention to improve quality of life (mental and physical), caregiver burden, and self-efficacy among family caregivers from baseline to 16 weeks. Methods: The intervention includes five individualized, nurse-led sessions over 10 weeks conducted remotely (due to COVID-19). Intervention components focus on 1) nature of caregiving, 2) life purpose, 3) co-development of an action plan to address caregiver goals to reduce caregiver burden and improve caregiver well-being, 4) exploration of social and community resources to support unmet needs, and 5) building a sustainability plan for addressing future caregiver needs. We tested our approach in a randomized waitlist control pilot trial (N=35) from August 2020 through March 2022. We calculated enrollment and retention rates, described acceptability, and computed intervention effect sizes from baseline to 16 weeks. Results: 35 out of 101 (35%) eligible caregivers enrolled and were majority female (93.3%), White (60%) and spousal caregivers (63.3%). Average age was 59.4 Â± 16.6 years. Overall retention was 69%. All intervention participants completed the five core components, reporting high levels of satisfaction and acceptability of activities. Between-group effect sizes (n=21) at 16 weeks suggest improvement in the mental health component of quality of life, caregiver burden, and self-efficacy (effect sizes 0.88, 0.31, and 0.63, respectively). Conclusion: Caregivers found Caregiver Support acceptable and study methods were feasible, despite challenges to engaging during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings provide foundational evidence that this person-centered behavioral intervention can contribute to enhanced caregiver outcomes.","Saylor, M.

"Body Mass Index Is A Predictor of Mortality and Adverse Cardiorespiratory Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized for SARS-COV-2 Infection","Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the association of body mass index (BMI) with in-hospital mortality and cardiorespiratory outcomes in patients admitted with COVID-19 infection. Methods: This data was collected from an academic tertiary referral center in upstate New York. Retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on patients admitted with COVID-19 infection (n=194). BMI was calculated and patients were stratified into two categories: 'healthy' (BMI=18.5-24.5) and 'overweight' (BMI&gt;25). Cardiorespiratory outcomes were classified as in-hospital mortality, need for vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and hemodialysis. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to evaluate for left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, right ventricular (RV) systolic function and RV dilation. Cardiovascular (CV) risk factors such as history of COPD, Diabetes, HTN, CAD and cigarette smoking were analyzed. LDH, troponin, CRP and ferritin levels were also noted. Results: Out of 194 patients, 68% were overweight with a mean BMI of 29.8 +/-9.5 kg/m2 and a mean age of 66 +/-16, 75% of females and 63% of males were overweight. Mortality rate was 31% in overweight patients compared to 17% in healthy subset (p&lt;0.04). The rate of need for mechanical ventilation was higher in overweight group as well (34% vs. 17%, p&lt;0.02). There was no significant difference between the cohorts in terms of vasopressor and hemodialysis requirement (p=0.09 and 0.2 respectively). RV systolic function was depressed in 21% of overweight cohort vs. 8% of healthy patients (p&lt;0.02) while RV dilatation was seen in 15% of overweight patients compared with 5% of healthy patients (p&lt;0.03). There was no significant difference in LV ejection fraction between the groups. LDH was more frequently elevated in overweight cohort with a mean level of 346 +/-185 IU/L (p&lt;0.01). No significant difference in rest of the laboratory analysis or CV risk factors were found. Conclusion: Elevated BMI (&gt;25) is associated with a statistically significant increase in in-hospital mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, right ventricular abnormalities, and LDH levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection.","Ehtesham, M.; Oweis, J.; Al-Tarbsheh, A.; Chopra, A.; Torosoff, M.","https://doi.org/10.1161/circoutcomes.15.suppl_1.53","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes; 15, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35509,""

"ASSOCIATIONS OF LONELINESS AND SLEEP WITH SOLITARY DRINKING AND DRINKING CONSEQUENCES","Purpose: Loneliness and sleep problems have been independently associated both with each other and with drinking-related impairment. However, much research investigating loneliness and sleep has not considered the social context of drinking. Of particular relevance, individuals may engage in solitary drinking as a means of managing both loneliness and sleep problems. This cross-sectional study tested (a) associations of loneliness and sleep quality with solitary drinking, and (b) associations of loneliness, sleep quality, and solitary drinking with drinking consequences. Methods & Data: Online survey data were drawn from 184 past-year college drinkers (Mage = 18.73 [SD = 1.07];55% female;68% White) reporting on affect and substance use behavior six months into the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression was used to detect differences in odds of past-year solitary drinking by loneliness and subjective sleep quality, and zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to detect differences in drinking consequences by loneliness, subjective sleep quality, and past-year solitary drinking. All analyses controlled for sex, age, White race, depressive symptoms, and overall drinking frequency. Results: Loneliness, but subjective sleep quality, was positively associated with odds of past-year solitary drinking (OR = 1.11 [95% CI = 1.02, 1.21], p = .02). The relationship of loneliness with solitary drinking was attenuated to non-significance (p = .06) when the interaction between loneliness and sleep on solitary drinking was considered. Solitary drinking was associated with greater drinking consequences (RR = 1.28 [95% CI = 1.01, 1.59], p = .03), although neither loneliness nor sleep were associated with drinking consequences. Conclusions: College students may engage in solitary drinking to cope with loneliness, which may be particularly heightened in the context of pandemic-related social isolation;however, they do not appear to drink alone to manage sleep. Consistent with prior literature, findings highlight solitary drinking as a risk for greater drinking consequences, though null associations with loneliness and sleep suggest that additional risk factors for solitary drinking and associated consequences be explored.","Wedel, A.

"THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF EXPANDING US ALCOHOL HOME DELIVERY LAWS","Purpose: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many states expanded online alcohol sales and directto- consumer home delivery and shipping laws. Given that expanding access to and availability of alcohol in general is harmful to youth and adults, it is important to track these new laws and understand their impacts. This presentation will: (1) discuss the expansion of alcohol home delivery laws across the U.S.;and (2) assess the drinking patterns and behaviors of adults who reported having alcohol delivered to their homes. Method: (1) An inter-disciplinary team studied state alcohol home delivery laws and developed a new policy topic to be tracked by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration under the Sober Truth on the Prevention of Underage Drinking (STOP) Act. (2) Along with colleagues at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, a team of researchers conducted a cross-sectional online survey with a convenience sample of U.S. adults over 21 years old in May 2020 to assess the relation between having alcohol delivered and alcohol consumption. Data: Data were obtained from: (1) Analyzing relevant alcohol-related home delivery statutes and regulations for all states and the District of Columbia. (2) The online survey whose sample included 832 participants - 84% female, 85%White, and 72%ages 26-49. Results: (1) Preliminary results demonstrate that more states expanded current laws or enacted new laws to allow manufacturers and retailers to ship or deliver alcohol directly to consumers' homes by the end of 2021 than had such laws in 2009. (2) Participants who had alcohol delivered reported consuming significantly more drinks (p &lt; 0.001) and drinking on a significantly greater number of days (p &lt; 0.001) than participants who obtained their alcohol in other ways. Conclusions: Alcohol home delivery laws have significantly expanded over the last decade, with many changes occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic. As these laws change to expand consumers' access to alcohol at home, this may result in increased public health harms, including among the underage population. States should consider these public health findings when deciding on the permanency of their alcohol delivery laws.","Grossman, E.

"Analyzing the research trends of COVID-19 using topic modeling approach","Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted 222 countries across the globe, with millions of people losing their lives. The threat from the virus may be assessed from the fact that most countries across the world have been forced to order partial or complete shutdown of their economies for a period of time to contain the spread of the virus. The fallout of this action manifested in loss of livelihood, migration of the labor force and severe impact on mental health due to the long duration of confinement to homes or residences. Design/methodology/approach The current study identifies the focus areas of the research conducted on the COVID-19 pandemic. s of papers on the subject were collated from the SCOPUS database for the period December 2019 to June 2020. The collected sample data (after preprocessing) was analyzed using Topic Modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Findings Based on the research papers published within the mentioned timeframe, the study identifies the 10 most prominent topics that formed the area of interest for the COVID-19 pandemic research.

"Forensic psychiatry in times of COVID-19: a qualitative study into the concerns and needs of patients","Purpose The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of the concerns and needs of forensic psychiatric patients regarding the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on their mental health and treatment. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine patients from various wards of the hospital. Using the consensual qualitative research method, these interviews were coded by a team of three researchers. Findings Four domains emerged from the analysis, namely, restrictions, emotional consequences, coping and communication. One of the primary restrictions for patients was not being allowed to have physical contact with the people in their network/visitors. This prompted patients, in some cases, to decline visitors altogether. Emotional consequences of the COVID-19 measurements included anxiety, frustration and passivity. Ambiguity about the rules added to this frustration. Furthermore, a cut in autonomy was felt by patients due to them not being able to do their own grocery shopping. Despite these restrictions that were imposed on patients, the relationship between patients and staff was perceived as good and even improved according to the participants. Practical implications A lack of autonomy emerged as a salient issue related to the restrictions within the hospital. Certain degrees of control may be inevitable, but it is nonetheless important to focus on the effect of control within forensic settings. This could be done by aiming to actively include patients in decisions that affect their living climate. Furthermore, it appeared that the ""ballet dancer"" approach was used by the staff of the hospital, leaving more room for individualized care. As perceived support is important to increase willingness to accept the treatment being offered, a focus on this approach in times of rapid change such as during a pandemic, would be recommended. Originality/value Because few pandemics have occurred in the past century, little information is available about how a pandemic might affect patients residing in forensic psychiatric hospitals. To the best of the authors' knowledge this is one of the first studies to assess concerns and needs of forensic psychiatric patients regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.","Simjouw, Annabel, Verstegen, Nienke, Smid, Wineke, Langeveld, Agnita","https://doi.org/10.1108/jfp-02-2022-0008","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Journal of Forensic Practice;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35514,""

"ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DEPRESSION DISORDER AND INCIDENTAL HYPERTENSION IN COVID 19 POSITIVE PATIENTS","Objective: Although the association between depression disorder and cardiovascular diseases has been well recognized. but an effect of depression for incident hypertension are scarce. Design and method: 300 men and 390 women aged over 40 without hypertension or cardiovascular diseases. Depressive disorder was assessed using Beck's depression inventory (BDI) ranged 0 to 63 and was considered if BDI score over 16. Hypertension was defined as SBP over 140 and/or DBP over 90 mmHg or the use of antihypertensive medication. We calculated incidence rates (IRs) per 100 person-year for incident hypertension were calculated and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and its 95% CIs. Results: COVID 19 positive patients with depressive symptoms had a significantly higher incidence of hypertension in women compared to men with depressive symptoms. In the logistic regression analysis, the presence of depressive symptom was significantly associated with incident hypertension with COVID 19 positive independently of age, body mass index, education level, and current smoking and drinking status. Conclusions: COVID 19 positive patients with Depressive symptoms were highly associated with the incidence of hypertension among middle aged women.","Koh, J. H.; Kang, M.

"How Did Levels of Psychological Distress and Perceptions of Workplace Support amongst Childrenâ€™s Social Work Staff Change during the Covid-19 Pandemic?","Covid-19 brought about drastic changes in day-to-day life and working practices, and had a profound impact on the mental health and well-being of the general population. Certain professional groups have also been particularly affected. This study sought to explore how levels of psychological distress and perceptions of workplace support amongst social work staff changed during the pandemic. We present the results from a series of surveys conducted in four local authorities (LAs) in England, before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. Social workers and other social care staff (n = 62) were asked about their experiences of psychological distress, using the twelve-item General Health Questionnaire. Overall, we found the proportion of staff reporting elevated levels of psychological distress increased and, in line with previous studies involving social workers, was high relative to the general population. Yet, most staff also said they had high levels of support from managers and colleagues, whilst a small proportion reported an increased perception of workplace support during the pandemic, compared to before. We consider these findings in relation to Organisational Support Theory and reflect on the ability of LAs to provide effective support for social care staff. Long before most of us had heard of coronavirus, social workers were already reporting high levels of psychological distress compared to the general public. In this study, we explored how levels of psychological distress changed amongst staff working in children's social services during the pandemic. We asked sixty-two people working in children's social services in four local authorities in England to complete a survey about their well-being and to tell us whether the support they received changed during Covid-19. We found the proportion of staff reporting elevated levels of psychological distress was high and that it increased over the pandemic. But social work staff also said they had high levels of support from managers and colleagues, and some reported an increased perception of workplace support during the pandemic, compared to before.","Jones, Rebecca K.; Wilkins, David, Bezeczky, Zoe, Thompson, Sarah","https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsw/bcac126","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: The British Journal of Social Work;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35518,""

"The mentality of dieability/killability: Reflections on the special issue on law, medicine, and bioethics","This commentary discusses the Special Issue on Law, Medicine, and Bioethics: Role of Interdisciplinary Leadership in Influencing Health and Public Health Policy and Democratic Systems of Governance from the perspective of the concept of killability/dieability. Killability refers to the idea that the other can be killed as an active doing, whereas dieability means that certain people can be left to die, although their death could be prevented. Killability and dieability overlap and can be observed as mentalities not only in authoritarian regimes but also in existing liberal democracies. The four articles are analyzed within the framework of killability/dieability, and it is suggested that the special issue is paradigmatic for how philosophical-psychological studies should expand their traditional boundaries by incorporating reflections from a variety of academic disciplines and practices. Public Significance Statement This comment asks the public to consider the degree to which ""we"" have accepted dieability and killability of people in our societies. It is suggested that the public and professionals should look at human existential crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health, migration, increasing inequality, wars, and climate change through this concept pair.","Teo, Thomas","https://doi.org/10.1037/teo0000205","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35520,""
"â€˜On a road to nowhereâ€¦â€™ analyzing motivations for undirected travel","This study is the first to empirically analyze motivations for taking undirected travel (UT) trips, or travel without a destination (as opposed to derived trips) undertaken for the purpose of the trip itself, as the determinants and characteristics are largely unknown. The overall research objective is to explore UT motivations in terms of demographics and trip characteristics, such as mode, frequency, distance, and duration, using survey data from Flanders, Belgium during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (18 March â€“ 4 May 2020). First, a factor analysis identifies four main motivations for UT: 1. Improving Health and Well-Being, 2. Removing Negative Feelings, 3. Enjoying Scenery, and 4. Out-of-Home Socializing. Following, differences in UT motivations across groups are analyzed with mean-comparisons of demographic characteristics, trip characteristics, and attitude and well-being measurements. Findings suggest a clear relationship between UT and physical/mental health. There are stronger motivations for active than motorized UT trips, and stronger motivations associated with use of multiple modes. Longer (distance and duration) and more frequent UT trips increasingly fulfill all motivations. This research provides more evidence for the idea that travel is not always a derived demand for which less is always better, or an ancillary event to other activities, and can offer baseline empirical information on UT from which future studies can grow as well as contribute information about the value of travel.","Hook, Hannah, De Vos, Jonas, Van Acker, Veronique, Witlox, Frank","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2022.06.009","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice; 163:148-164, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35521,""
"How schools in Germany shape and impact the lives of adolescent refugees in terms of mental health and social mobility","Schools are relevant settings for supporting refugee adolescents' mental health. As education and migration are important social determinants of health, we aim to integrate the qualitative findings of our mixed-methods study into a broader discussion regarding the role of schools and the potential effects on refugee adolescents' lives and mental health, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this commentary, we present the findings of school-based actors' (i.e., teachers and school psychologists) perception of refugee adolescents' access to mental health care. The interviews highlight the importance of schools and social activities as main stabilizers and sources of support for refugee adolescentsâ€™ mental health and the role trusting school-parent relationships play in mental health care help-seeking. Our data indicate that schools lack the resources to properly address these needs. However, these structural gaps are rooted into historical segregation and discrimination in the German educational system and left unaddressed, can increase stigma and intergenerational social inequalities, especially in connection to the COVID-19 pandemic. We conclude our article with a set of recommendations that could be relevant and implemented across different contexts to strengthen the role of the school setting in promoting the mental health and well-being of refugee adolescents.","Podar, Monica-Diana, Fretian, Alexandra Maria, Demir, Zeynep, Razum, Oliver, Namer, Yudit","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2022.101169","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: SSM - Population Health;: 101169, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35522,""

A common symptom of mental illness is change in Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, the phase of sleep associated with dreaming and nightmares. The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of systemic stress on nightmares. In this study, we investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic affects nightmare frequency and content using a web-based survey within the state of New Mexico. The survey returned 197 responses showing an increase in the quantity of both bad dreams and nightmares. Furthermore, significant changes in nightmare themes were reported compared to relative rates prior to the pandemic (RR 1,42, pÂ &lt;Â 0.01;RR 5, pÂ &lt;Â 0.001).

"The Gendered impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on academics working in Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy","Introduction Healthcare workers have been particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as have those educating them, albeit differently. Several papers have identified a gendered difference in the impact of the pandemic. This study aims to determine impact of COVID-19 on the health and wellbeing of Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy (MIRT) academics. Methods An electronic survey was designed in English on Qualtrics and distributed via email and online platforms to MIRT academics. Fifty-one questions were used;demographic (n=9), work patterns (n=11), general health (n=8), mental health (n=2), physical health (n=10), and workload (n=11). Overall, 46 were quantitative and five were qualitative â€˜open-endedâ€™ questions. The survey was open between 3rd March 2021 to 1st May 2021. Quantitative analysis was carried out using MS Excel v 16.61.1ss and SPSS v26. Results The survey reached 32 countries globally and 412 participants;23.5% identified as men (n=97) and 76.5% as women (n=315). Women reported worse sleep quality than men and overwhelmingly felt they would not like to work remotely again if given a choice. A higher percentage of males,73% versus 40.5% of females reported getting outdoors less. The CORE-10 validated questionnaire found that 10.3% of males (n= 42) and 2.7% of females (n=11) experienced severe psychological distress the week immediately before the survey was conducted. Conclusion While the study has identified some gender-related differences in the impact of COVID-19 on the mental and physical health of MIRT academics, both males and females have experienced significant deterioration in health and wellbeing due to the pandemic. Implication for Practice Developing mental health support for MIRT academics and defining optimum methods for raising awareness is recommended.","Oâ€™Donoghue, K.; Malamateniou, C.; Walton, L.; England, A.; Moore, N.; McEntee, M.

"Burnout Mitigation: Resident & Fellow Well-Being Through Hospital Supported Spiritual Care","Introduction: Resident physician burnout, depression, and suicide is a growing epidemic in graduate medical education. The prevalence of resident burnout can be as high as 50% and can have serious short and long-term consequences. As many as 400 doctors die by suicide every year. While coping mechanisms and spirituality have been examined among medical residents in predicting the likelihood of developing burnout, no studies have examined a spiritual care intervention on the well-being of medical trainees. Methods: In 2017, all resident physicians and fellows at West Virginia University were provided information about their eligibility to participate in a ""Call to Wellness,"" a campaign to foster resiliency in graduate medical education training. The curriculum provided information on depression and burnout while also offering support and guidance from hospital interfaith chaplains for those who may be suffering from these conditions. Interested residents were eligible to participate in an hour-long individualized session or to attend a group meeting limited to 25 participants per session. Those that participated were required to complete a pre-wellness survey that included topics such as identifiable stressors, support and perceived overall well-being. A post-wellness survey was also completed to evaluate perceptions of the intervention. Pre and post survey results were examined using Chi-square analyses with a P &lt; 0.05 considered to be significant. Results: From July 2017 to June 2018, 49% of the residents participated in the spiritual care session for the â€œCall to Wellnessâ€ curriculum. Prior to the intervention, 51% of participants rated their overall well-being as â€œneutralâ€ and approximately 25% selected the â€œslightly positive, positive, or very positiveâ€ category. Post spiritual care session, 25% of participants rated their well-being as â€œneutralâ€ (P &lt; 0.001) and 51% chose â€œslightly positive, positive, or very positive,â€ (P &lt; 0.001). Findings also included 75% of medical trainees stating they did not feel embarrassed about their participation, and 87% stating they did not feel pressured to discuss personal religious preferences with the chaplain, indicating that they likely received individualized support, a hallmark of well-being. A limitation of this study is that it was performed at a single institution. Conclusion: In a post covid training environment we are continuing to study these efforts, by providing resources and support services. Ultimately, any mitigation effort should help to influence longterm change so that throughout a physician's career, they have the tools to prevent burnout.

"Evaluating Chronic Use of Opioids in COVID-19 Survivors","Introduction: The United States opioid epidemic combined with the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated a 32% rise in non-prescribed fentanyl use and 12.5% rise in heroin use per urine drug test analyses (1). A subset of COVID-19 survivors given inpatient opioids are also being prescribed opioids at discharge. The goal of this investigation is to determine the incidence of chronic opioid use, which is defined as opioid use for 3 months or more, following discharge of in-patient admits for management of COVID-19 with in-patient opioid use in order to evaluate at-risk patient populations and to assess follow-up outcomes following discharge. Methods: Following Ochsner Health IRB approval, we performed a retrospective chart analysis of 336 patients with admission for COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020 who were treated with in-patient opioids. The following patient data was collected: patient demographics, medical history, comorbidities, in-patient and out-patient opioid prescription data, follow-up visits, and social determinants of health. Patients were followed for 3 months post-discharge. Results: In this cohort, 17.2% patients were prescribed outpatient opioids following discharge and 82.7% patients were not. The patients who continued to receive opioids were predominantly female (62.1%). Of the patients (N = 58) who continued to receive outpatient opioid orders, 13.8% received these prescriptions for COVID-19-related pain with only one patient meeting criteria for â€˜chronic opioid useâ€™ with use of three or more months. Out-patient opioid prescriptions in chronic use patients consisted largely of hydrocodone (20.7%) and included oxycodone (12.1%), tramadol (8.6%), and morphine (6.9%). Additionally, of patients who continued to receive opioids following discharge, 69% were Black and 43% had commercial insurance. Additionally, this cohort had a 43% incidence of mental health disorders with anxiety (25.9%) and depression (20.7%) being most commonly cited. Conclusion: Therapeutic opioids used in COVID-19 for myofascial pain must be weighed against the potential risk of abuse. It is suspected that significant trauma or post-surgical pain in conjunction with opioid use in the hospital is associated with the risk of development of chronic opioid use (2-4). In this patient population, only one COVID-19 survivor requiring hospitalization with in-patient opioid use, later developed chronic opioid use. Preliminary data suggests low opioid dependence following its use in COVID-19 patients. Further data refinement and analysis is underway and is necessary to confirm and draw further conclusions. This includes evaluating the role of various patient demographics, significant comorbidities, and opioid characteristics.

"Long-Term Results of a Novel, Externally-Powered, Spinal Cord Stimulator for Chronic Pain (AUS nPower study)","Introduction: A novel spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system with a battery-free micro-implantable pulse generator (mIPG;Nalu Medical, Inc. CA, USA) is available for the treatment of intractable chronic pain. The system utilizes an external power source that bi-directionally communicates with the mIPG (~1.5 cc volume). Methods: A prospective, multi-center clinical study was initiated to confirm the safety and performance of this novel system, in the treatment of trunk and limb intractable chronic pain. Specifically, subjects with leg(s) and/or back pain, meeting eligibility criteria were recruited and consented into the study. Subjects underwent a SCS trial utilizing a menu of therapy options, including tonic and the novel pulsed stimulation pattern (PSP) therapy. Eligible subjects received the permanent implant and were followed-up for up to 12-months from activation. Due to global COVID-19 restrictions, subjects were moved into a long-term follow-up (LTFU) phase, with study visits planned every 6-months, for an additional 2-years from their last visit. This  reports on the long-term clinical and functional (depression, activities of daily living, overall change in quality of life) outcomes. The study was approved by an independent Ethics Committee and conducted in compliance with local regulations. Results: Twenty-five (25) intractable chronic back and/or leg pain subjects, using the PSP therapy, passed a screening and trial phase with =50% pain reduction in leg(s) and/or back and moved into the long-term implant phase of the study. Of these 25 subjects, 13 subjects have currently completed an average of 22-months follow-up;the average pain reduction was 73% (n=12) in the leg and 64% (n=11) in the back, from baseline to this time point. The responder rate (=50% pain relief) was 92% in the leg (11/12) and 64% (7/11) in the back. In addition, all subjects wore the external power source via an adhesive clip and rated both its average comfort and ease of use as &lt;1 on an 11-point scale (0=Very Comfortable, 10=Very Uncomfortable;0=Very Easy, 10=Very Difficult). The average percent improvement on the Beckâ€™s Depression Inventory (BDI) was 40% (n=13) from screening to 22-months;the average improvement in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was 34% (n=13) at this time point. Sixty-nine percent (69%;9/13) of subjects indicated â€œvery much improvedâ€ on the Patient Global Impression of Change. Conclusion: These results continue to demonstrate the favorable performance of this novel, battery-free, externally-powered micro-implantable SCS through 22-months post implantation. Further investigation is warranted to confirm these preliminary findings.

"Changes in Sleep Pattern During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Patients With Narcolepsy, Idiopathic Hypersomnia, and Restless Legs Syndrome","To explore the first COVID-19 lockdown impact on sleep symptoms in patients with narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) and restless legs syndrome (RLS). Between March and May 2020, a sample of adult patients regularly followed-up in a Reference Hospital Sleep Unit (299 with narcolepsy, 260 with IH, 254 with RLS) was offered an online survey assessing their sleep-wake habits, daily activities, medication intake, and validated scales: International RLS Study Group questionnaire, Narcolepsy Severity Scale (NSS), IH Severity Scale (IHSS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Insomnia Severity Index, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and European Quality of Life (QoL) scale. The survey was proposed once, and the questions were answered for the pre-lockdown (recall of the month before the confinement) and the lockdown (time of study) periods. Overall, 331 patients completed the survey (response rate 40.7%): 102 with narcolepsy, 81 with IH and 148 with RLS. All patients reported later bedtimes, with reduced differences for time in bed (TIB) and total sleep time (TST) over-24h between weekdays and weekends. Narcoleptic patients spent more TIB and increased TST overnight, with more daytime napping. They had more awakenings, higher ESS scores, lower QoL, and no NSS changes. IH patients had also increased TIB, TST overnight and 24-h on weekdays. Nocturnal sleep latency and number of awakenings increased, but with no change in ESS, QoL, and IHSS scores. RLS patients reported a longer nocturnal sleep latency, more awakenings, more naps, a decreased TIB and TST overnight. RLS severity increased while QoL decreased. A significant portion of patients reported disease worsening during lockdown (narcolepsy:39.4%, IH:43.6%, RLS:32.8%), and some patients stopped or lowered their medication (narcolepsy:22.5%, IH:28%, RLS:9.5%). During the lockdown, all patients reported later bedtimes; those with narcolepsy and IH extended their sleep duration unlike RLS patients. These changes were often associated with negative consequences on QoL. In the current context of recurrent COVID-19 waves, the recent development of teleconsultations should enable physicians to monitor patients with chronic sleep disorders more closely, to recommend optimized sleep schedules and duration, in order to prevent psychological problems and improve their QoL.","Barateau, Chenini, Rassu, Denis, Lorber, Dhalluin, Lopez, Jaussent, Beziat, Dauvilliers","https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000200907","20220802","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35537,""
"Pre-pandemic Alzheimer Disease Biomarkers and Anxious-Depressive Symptoms During the COVID-19 Confinement in Cognitively Unimpaired Adults","Increased anxious-depressive symptomatology is observed in the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which may accelerate disease progression. We investigated whether amyloid-ÃŽÂ², <b><u>cortical thickness in medial temporal lobe structures</u></b> , neuroinflammation and sociodemographic factors were associated with <b><u>greater</u></b> anxious-depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 confinement. This retrospective observational study included cognitively unimpaired older adults from the ALFA (Alzheimer and FAmilies) cohort, the majority with a family history of sporadic AD. Participants performed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) during the COVID-19 confinement. A subset had available retrospective (on average: 2.4 years before) HADS assessment, amyloid [<sup>18</sup>F] flutemetamol PET and structural MRI scans and CSF markers of neuroinflammation (interleukin-6 [IL-6], triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels). We performed multivariable <b><u>linear</u></b> regression models to investigate the associations of <b><u>pre-pandemic AD-related</u></b> biomarkers and sociodemographic factors with HADS scores during the confinement<b>. <u>We further performed an analysis of covariance in order to adjust by participants' pre-pandemic anxiety-depression levels</u></b> . Finally, we explored the role of stress and lifestyle changes (sleep patterns, eating, drinking, smoking habits, and medication use) on the tested associations and performed sex-stratified analyses. <u>We included 921 (254 with AD biomarkers) participants.</u> Amyloid-ÃŽÂ² positivity (B=3.73; 95%CI=1.1 to 6.36; <i>p=.006</i>), caregiving (B=1.37; 95%CI=0.24 to 2.5; <i>p=.018</i>), sex (women: B=1.95; 95%CI=1.1 to 2.79; <i>p&lt;.001</i>), younger age (B=-0.12; 95%CI=-0.18 to -0.052; <i>p&lt;.001</i>) and lower education (B=-0.16; 95%CI=-0.28 to -0.042; <i>p=.008</i>) were associated with greater anxious-depressive symptoms during the confinement. Considering pre-pandemic anxiety-depression levels, we further observed an association between <b><u>lower levels of CSF IL-6</u></b> (B=-5.11; 95%CI=-10.1 to -0.13; <i>p=.044</i>) and <b><u>greater</u></b> HADS scores. The results were independent of stress-related variables and lifestyle changes. Stratified analysis revealed that the associations were mainly driven by women. Our results link AD-related pathophysiology and neuroinflammation with <b><u>greater</u></b> anxious-depressive symptomatology during the COVID-19-related confinement, notably in women. AD pathophysiology may increase neuropsychiatric symptomatology in response to stressors. This association may imply a worse clinical prognosis in people at risk for AD after the pandemic, and thus deserves to be considered by clinicians.

"Longitudinal assessment of physician wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic","Physician wellness was greatly impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Busy clinical services, personal safety concerns, changing guidelines, and compassion fatigue weighed on physicians. Although studies have examined physician wellness, few have studied how it changed over time. A survey about wellness was distributed to 299 physicians at Ascension St. Vincent Hospital-Indianapolis March 2020, July 2020, November 2020, and March 2021. Physicians also free-texted about their well-being during the pandemic. Participation rates over the four time periods averaged 22.23%. Responses were compared among the time periods using Pearson Chi-Square and Fisher's Exact Tests. Six wellness factors (anxiety, worry about becoming ill, worry about infecting family, worry about caring for children, concern about personal finances) were reported as worse after the pandemic began, but statistically significantly improved over the course of the study. In contrast, seven wellness measures (increased issues with depression, frustration, hopelessness, fatigue, dread going to work, worry about missing work, worry about caring for family), that also worsened after the pandemic began, did not statistically improve over time. Physician wellness was impacted by the pandemic; however, not all measures followed the same course over time. Longitudinal assessments of wellness can help inform programs to best support physicians.","Patel, Foster","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114739","20220802","Adaptation; COVID-19 pandemic; Longitudinal; Physician wellness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35541,""
"Omicron-associated changes in SARS-CoV-2 symptoms in the United Kingdom","The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has been replaced by the highly transmissible Omicron BA.1 variant, and subsequently by Omicron BA.2. It is important to understand how these changes in dominant variants affect reported symptoms, while also accounting for symptoms arising from other co-circulating respiratory viruses. In a nationally representative UK community study, the COVID-19 Infection Survey, we investigated symptoms in PCR-positive infection episodes vs. PCR-negative study visits over calendar time, by age and vaccination status, comparing periods when the Delta, Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants were dominant. Between October-2020 and April-2022, 120,995 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive episodes occurred in 115,886 participants, with 70,683 (58%) reporting symptoms. The comparator comprised 4,766,366 PCR-negative study visits (483,894 participants); 203,422 (4%) reporting symptoms. Symptom reporting in PCR-positives varied over time, with a marked reduction in loss of taste/smell as Omicron BA.1 dominated, maintained with BA.2 (44%/45% 17 October 2021, 16%/13% 2 January 2022, 15%/12% 27 March 2022). Cough, fever, shortness of breath, myalgia, fatigue/weakness and headache also decreased after Omicron BA.1 dominated, but sore throat increased, the latter to a greater degree than concurrent increases in PCR-negatives. Fatigue/weakness increased again after BA.2 dominated, although to a similar degree to concurrent increases in PCR-negatives. Symptoms were consistently more common in adults aged 18-65 years than in children or older adults. Increases in sore throat (also common in the general community), and a marked reduction in loss of taste/smell, make Omicron harder to detect with symptom-based testing algorithms, with implications for institutional and national testing policies.","Vihta, Pouwels, Peto, Pritchard, House, Studley, Rourke, Cook, Diamond, Crook, Clifton, Matthews, Stoesser, Eyre, Walker","https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciac613","20220802","Omicron; SARS-CoV-2; symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35542,""
"Systematization of initiatives in sexual and reproductive health about good practices criteria in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in primary health care in Chile","Introduction The COVID- 19 pandemic discontinued sexual and reproductive health care in Chile and the world. The national focus on hospital care led primary care teams to respond in natural and diverse ways. Understanding the factors involved in this process may improve future responses from the judgment of good practices. Therefore, this study aimed to identify and systematize sexual and reproductive health initiatives raised by primary care teams in response to the COVID- 19 pandemic in Chile. Methods We systematically evaluated initiatives and practices in sexual and reproductive health in prima-ry care between June 2020 and November 2021. This study was developed in three methodological phases: a review of documents, a collection of experiences through an electronic instrument sent to the 29 health services in Chile, and in-depth interviews. According to best practice criteria, mapping and characterizing the initiatives and critical discourse analysis of narratives and interviews were carried out. Results Forty-one initiatives from 19 health services were identified, mainly from the South Central macro zone and urban areas. In these areas, care was recognized. These practices were relevant, aligned with their objectives, rapidly implemented, and used novel strategies through new technologies. However, these initiatives had little intercultural relevance or evaluation. Perceived success was related to motivation, leadership, and institutional and community resilience. The adaptability of initiatives emerged as a new need and criterion of analysis. Conclusion The lessons learned from these initiatives invite us to consider health care teams' mental health, their relationship with the community, the use of new technologies, the evaluation of practices considering satisfaction, cross- cutting approaches, and their adaptability. In all, these aspects may improve primary care response in sexual and reproductive health to new crises. IntroducciÃƒÂ³n La pandemia de COVID- 19 ha implicado la discontinuidad de atenciÃƒÂ³n en salud sexual y reproductiva en Chile y el mundo. El foco en la contenciÃƒÂ³n hospitalaria de la pandemia llevÃƒÂ³ a los equipos de atenciÃƒÂ³n primaria a responder de manera innata y diversa. Por lo tanto, el objetivo de este estudio fue identificar y sistematizar iniciativas de salud sexual y reproductiva planteadas por equipos de atenciÃƒÂ³n primaria en respuesta a la pandemia COVID- 19 en Chile, con el fin de comprender y aprender de los factores involucrados en esta, para mejorar futuras respuestas desde la lÃƒÂ³gica de buenas prÃƒÂ¡cticas. MetodologÃƒÂ­a Estudio de sistematizaciÃƒÂ³n de iniciativas y prÃƒÂ¡cticas en salud sexual y reproductiva en atenciÃƒÂ³n primaria, entre junio de 2020 y noviembre de 2021. Fue desarrollado en tres fases metodolÃƒÂ³gicas: revisiÃƒÂ³n de documentos, recolecciÃƒÂ³n de experiencias a travÃƒÂ©s de instrumento electrÃƒÂ³nico enviado a los 29 servicios de salud de Chile y entrevistas de profundizaciÃƒÂ³n. Se realizÃƒÂ³ un mapeo y caracterizaciÃƒÂ³n de las iniciativas y anÃƒÂ¡lisis crÃƒÂ­tico de discurso de narrativas y entrevistas, segÃƒÂºn criterios de buenas prÃƒÂ¡cticas. Resultados Se identificaron 41 iniciativas de 19 servicios de salud, principalmente de la Macro Zona Centro- sur, urbanas y de reorganizaciÃƒÂ³n de atenciÃƒÂ³n. Fueron prÃƒÂ¡cticas pertinentes, alineadas a sus objetivos, con procesos rÃƒÂ¡pidos de implementaciÃƒÂ³n, estrategias innovadoras, alto uso de tecnologÃƒÂ­as con escasa pertinencia intercultural ni evaluaciÃƒÂ³n. El ÃƒÂ©xito percibido se relacionÃƒÂ³ con motivaciÃƒÂ³n, liderazgo, y resiliencia institucional y comunitaria. La adaptabilidad de las iniciativas emergiÃƒÂ³ como una nueva necesidad y criterio. ConclusiÃƒÂ³n Son importantes los aprendizajes emanados de las iniciativas que invitan a considerar la salud mental de los equipos, su relaciÃƒÂ³n con la comunidad, el uso de tecnologÃƒÂ­as, la evaluaciÃƒÂ³n de las prÃƒÂ¡cticas considerando satisfacciÃƒÂ³n, enfoques transversales y la adaptabilidad de estas, para mejorar la respuesta de atenciÃƒÂ³n primaria en salud sexual y reproductiva ante nuevas crisis.","Ortiz Contreras, Quiroz CarreÃƒÂ±o, Neira Contreras, DÃƒÂ­az Navarrete, Elgueta, Lucero, LÃƒÂ³pez, Herrera Burott","https://doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2022.06.002555","20220802","COVID-19; Good Practices; Health; Primary Health Care; Reproductive; Sexual health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35543,""
"Quality Measures for Patients at Risk of Adverse Outcomes in the Veterans Health Administration: Expert Panel Recommendations","Despite longstanding efforts to improve health care quality for patients with complex needs who are at highest risk for hospitalization or death, to our knowledge, no guidance exists on what constitutes measurable high-quality care for this heterogeneous population. Identifying quality measures that are cross-cutting (ie, relevant to multiple chronic conditions and disease states) may enable health care professionals and health care systems to better design and report on quality improvement efforts for this patient population. To identify quality measures of care and prioritize quality-of-care concepts in the ambulatory primary care setting for patients in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) who have complex care needs and are at high risk for adverse outcomes, such as hospitalization or death. In this expert panel assessment and prioritization, relevant measure concepts for future quality measure development in 3 care categories (assessment, management, and other features of health care) were extracted from a systematic review, conducted from June 2020 to June 2021, of published studies that suggested, evaluated, or used indicators of quality care for patients at high risk of adverse outcomes. Measure concepts associated with single conditions, surgical or other specialty care settings, and inpatient care were excluded. A panel of 14 experts (10 VHA leaders and staff, 2 non-VHA physician investigators, and 2 veterans) discussed and rated the importance of the remaining set of potentially relevant measure concepts using a modified RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method on January 15, 2021. Measure concepts were rated on a scale of 1 to 9, with 9 being the highest priority. A median rating of 7.5 or greater was used as the cutoff to identify the highest-priority items. The systematic review identified 519 measure concepts, from which 15 domains and 49 measure concepts were proposed for expert panel consideration. After panel discussions and changes to measure concepts, the expert panel rated 63 measure concepts in 13 domains. The measure concepts with the highest median ratings focused on caregiver availability and support, COVID-19 vaccination, and pneumonia vaccination (all rated 9.0); housing instability (rated 8.5); and physical function, depression symptoms, cognitive impairment, prescription regimen, primary care follow-up after an emergency department visit or hospitalization, and timely transmission of discharge information to primary care (all rated 8.0). Recommendations to improve care included timely assessment of housing instability, caregiver support, physical function, depression symptoms, and cognitive impairment; annual prescription regimen review; coordinated transitions in care; and preventive care including vaccinations. The expert panelists identified a parsimonious set of high-priority, evidence-based, cross-cutting quality measure concepts for improving care of patients at high risk for adverse health outcomes in the VHA. These quality measures may inform both future research for patients at high risk and health care system quality improvement.","Chang, Newberry, Rubenstein, Motala, Booth, Shekelle","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.24938","20220802","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35544,""
"A Biofeedback-Based Mobile App With Serious Games for Young Adults With Anxiety in the United Arab Emirates: Development and Usability Study","Following the outbreak of COVID-19, several studies have reported that young adults encountered a rise in anxiety symptoms, which could negatively affect their quality of life. Promising evidence suggests that mobile apps with biofeedback, serious games, breathing exercises, and positive messaging, among other features, are useful for anxiety self-management and treatment. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the usability of a biofeedback-based app with serious games for young adults with anxiety in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This study consists of two phases: Phase I describes the design and development of the app, while Phase II presents the results of a usability evaluation by experts. To elicit the app's requirements during Phase I, we conducted (1) a survey to investigate preferences of young adults in the UAE for mobile games for stress relief; (2) an analysis of serious games for anxiety; and (3) interviews with mental health professionals and young adults in the UAE. In Phase II, five experts tested the usability of the developed app using a set of Nielsen's usability heuristics. A fully functional biofeedback-based app with serious games was co-designed with mental health professionals. The app included 4 games (ie, a biofeedback game, card game, arcade game, and memory game), 2 relaxation techniques (ie, a breathing exercise and yoga videos), and 2 additional features (ie, positive messaging and a mood tracking calendar). The results of Phase II showed that the developed app is efficient, simple, and easy to use. Overall, the app design scored an average of 4 out of 5. The elicitation techniques used in Phase I resulted in the development of an easy-to-use app for the self-management of anxiety. Further research is required to determine the app's usability and effectiveness in the target population.","Almeqbaali, Ouhbi, Serhani, Amiri, Jan, Zaki, Sharaf, Al Helali, Almheiri","https://doi.org/10.2196/36936","20220802","anxiety; app; biofeedback; connected mental health; development; digital game; gamification; gaming; mHealth; mental health; mobile health; serious game; stress; stress relief; usability; user experience; user feedback; user need; user-centered design; user-centred design; young adult; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35545,""
"Outpatient Opioid and Naloxone Prescribing Practices at an Academic Medical Center during the COVID-19 Pandemic","While improving opioid safety has been a national priority, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with increased rates of opioid overdose. The present study characterized outpatient opioid and naloxone prescribing patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. A retrospective chart review was conducted of adult patients receiving opioid therapy between August 2020 through October 2020 from outpatient clinics within a Texas health system. The primary outcome was naloxone co-prescription during the study period or within the year prior. During the study period, 1,368 patients received an opioid prescription, most of which were prescribed for chronic pain treatment (63.0%). Most opioid prescriptions (91.5%) were written for &lt; 50 MME/day. For prescriptions written for acute pain, 78% were written for Ã¢â€°Â¤ 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°days supply. While 31.1% of patients received gabapentinoid prescriptions, few (7.9%) received benzodiazepine or Z-hypnotic prescriptions. Twenty-two (1.6%) patients were co-prescribed naloxone. In this study, naloxone was rarely prescribed for outpatients receiving opioid prescriptions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Military Adolescent Pandemic Study 2021: MAPS21","Military-connected students move between 6 to 9 times throughout their K-12 experience, creating unique challenges relating to integration, adaptation, identity development, and acceptance. However, when transitions occur during a global pandemic, isolation and disconnect with schools and the community create new challenges that impact health and well-being. The MAPS21 study uncovers the lived experiences of military-connected students who have experienced a transition during the pandemic and gives rise to the need for interdisciplinary care within the public-school setting to promote mental health and academic support during and post-pandemic transitions. Military adolescents and their parent(s) were interviewed and data were analyzed following an interpretive phenomenological process. A social-ecological model served as the guide to understand the participants' experiences and to further inform future supportive measures. Seven subthemes surface under Individual, Relationships, Community, and Society and Policy, the levels within the social-ecological model. These subthemes included: anticipatory processes, control, growth and maturity, adapting views, isolation, school support, community support. Military-connected students may experience adverse outcomes relating to mental health and academic progression after experiencing a move during the pandemic.

The research involved 723 girls and 626 boys aged 15 to 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. The structure of the weekly PA was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Long Form, while well-being was assessed using the World Health Organization-5 Well-Being Index. There was a statistically significant decrease of PA among boys in school PA, transportation PA, recreation PA, vigorous PA, moderate PA, walking, and overall weekly PA during the DE resulting from the pandemic. In girls, during DE, a decrease was observed in school PA, vigorous PA, and overall PA. During DE, a high level of well-being was reported by only 34.9% of girls (43.8% during HE) and 50% of boys (65.6% during HE). The observed low PA and high incidence of depressive symptoms in adolescents in distance education during pandemic constraints are a challenge for schools to change in supporting physical activity, eliminating similar negative impacts on school life in the future.","FrÃƒÂ¶mel, Groffik, Valach, Ã…Â afÃƒÂ¡Ã…Ëœ, MitÃƒÂ¡Ã…Â ","https://doi.org/10.1111/josh.13232","20220802","Covid-19; distance education; mental health; physical activity recommendations; sedentary behavior; symptoms of depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35548,""
"PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF TRAUMATIC MEMORIES IN COVID-19 SURVIVORS","The COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected a significant number of individuals worldwide, is generating serious mental health issues. Recovered COVID-19 patients have experienced traumatic events related to their symptoms, isolation, possible hospitalization, bereavement, fear of infecting loved ones, and the physical consequences of COVID-19. One effective psychological treatment for these patients is Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). The aim of this paper is to describe the therapeutic intervention and effects of EMDR in a pool of COVID-19 survivors referred to an integrated psychological/psychiatric outpatient service. Twelve patients, comprising of nine males and three females, underwent EMDR psychotherapy from October 2020 to February 2022. Each patient received 8 to 16 weekly treatment sessions. The standard EMDR protocol of eight stages was administered to enable desensitization and reprocessing of four main targets: first positive swab, hospitalization, isolation, and fear for relatives' health. Efficacy of EMDR was demonstrated by the significant improvement at clinical scale for subjective distress caused by traumatic events. For the therapists, carrying out these treatments was an intense and challenging experience. In fact, the perceived distance between therapist and patient was less defined than in other hospital settings because the pandemic affects everyone equally. However, with the widespread availability of vaccines and although the pandemic is still ongoing with the emergence of new variants, a window of improvement in the mental health landscape is starting to open up.","Dinapoli, Ferrarese, Belella, Carnevale, Camardese, Sani, Chieffo","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2771","20220802","COVID-19; EMDR; psychological trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35549,""
"The Impact of Parental Presence Restrictions on Canadian Parents in the NICU During COVID-19: A National Survey","The purpose of this research was to explore parental perspectives on the impact of parent restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic across Canadian Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). A co-designed online survey was conducted targeting parents (<i>n</i> = 235) of infants admitted to a Canadian NICU from March 1, 2020, until March 5, 2021. Parents completed the survey from 38 Canadian NICUs. Large variation in the severity of policies regarding parental presence was reported. Most respondents (68.9%) were classified as experiencing <i>high restrictions</i>, with one or no support people allowed in the NICU, and felt that policies were less easy to understand, felt less valued and respected, and found it more challenging to access medicine or health care. Parents reported gaps in care related to self-care, accessibility, and mental health outcomes. There is significant variation in parental restrictions implemented across Canadian NICUs. National guidelines are needed to support consistent and equitable care practices.","Campbell-Yeo, Dol, McCulloch, Hughes, Hundert, Bacchini, Whitehead, Afifi, Alcock, Bishop, Dorling, Earle, Elliott Rose, Inglis, Leighton, MacRae, Melanson, Simpson, Smit","https://doi.org/10.1177/10748407221114326","20220802","family nursing; family-centered care; hospital policy; neonatal intensive care unit; parent perspective","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35550,""
"Mental health and COVID-19: The impact of a virtual course for family caregivers of adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted family caregivers of adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). This study evaluated a virtual course for family caregivers from across Canada, focused on supporting the mental health and well-being of adults with IDD and their families. The evaluation examined the feasibility and acceptability of the course, as well as the impact of the intervention on participants' overall health and well-being. The 6-week virtual course, informed by a parallel Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) course for service providers, combined didactic instruction with applied activities. A total of 126 family caregiver course participants consented to be part of the research evaluation delivered over three cycles between October 2020 and April 2021. Attendance was measured at each weekly session. Satisfaction was assessed weekly and post-program. Learning, self-efficacy, and well-being were assessed pre- and post-course, and again at follow-up (8Ã‚Â weeks post-course). Mixed-effects models assessed changes between and within individuals across time. Participants had consistent attendance, low-dropout rates, and reported high satisfaction, with 93% of participants reporting that their expectations for the course were met. Compared with pre-course, participants reported improved self-efficacy and well-being post-course, which were maintained at follow-up. An interactive and applied virtual education course delivered to a large group of family caregivers of adults with IDD was both feasible and acceptable. It positively impacted participants' well-being by offering much needed mental health support and creating a peer-led community of practice.","Lake, Volpe, St John, Thakur, Steel, Baskin, Durbin, Chacra, Lunsky","https://doi.org/10.1111/jir.12965","20220802","COVID-19; family caregivers; intellectual and developmental disabilities; mental health; virtual psychoeducation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35551,""
"Psychological strain and suicidal ideation in young university students during Covid-19 outbreak: the mediating roles of rumination and depression","The link between psychological strain and suicidal ideation is well embedded in literature, however, the underlying mechanism is rarely explored. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the relationship between psychological strain, suicidal ideation, rumination, and depression among Pakistani young adults during the Covid-19 outbreak. In addition, it will also try to determine the mediating role of ruminative subtypes and depression in the relationship between psychological strain and suicidal ideation. The sample consists of 400 university students (83 males and 289 females) with the age range from 18 to 30Ã‚Â years (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°22.25, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.40). Psychological strain scale, Suicidal Ideation Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Ruminative Response Scale were administered to the participants. Results indicated a significant and positive association between the study variables. Psychological strain positively influenced suicidal ideation both directly, and indirectly via brooding and depression. Both variables were found to be serially mediated by the brooding subtype of rumination and depression and not with the reflective subtype. Strain theory of suicide and response style theory also postulated important insights regarding the association of these variables in young adults, among which, strain is serially related to first brooding and then depression, which is eventually related to suicidal ideation. The present study makes a significant contribution to the literature by providing a unique conceptual and theoretical framework to identify suicide at the ideation level before it proceeds to behavior during this unprecedented time of the pandemic outbreak.","Muneeb, Hassan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03551-8","20220802","Brooding; Depression; Psychological strain; Rumination; Suicidal ideation; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35552,""
"Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among university students in South Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic: the application of interpersonal-psychological theory and early maladaptive schema","This study examined the application of interpersonal-psychological theory and early maladaptive schema of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in South Korean university students. In this cross-sectional study, data from 367 university students were surveyed using the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, Early Maladaptive Schema, Suicide Ideation Scale, and the Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale. Data were collected between June 21 and July 21, 2021. University students' interpersonal needs and early maladaptive schema were significantly associated with suicidal ideation, and influencing suicide attempts. The acquired capability for suicide moderated the relationship between suicidal ideation and attempts. In suicide prevention programs for university students, it is critical to consider their interpersonal needs and early maladaptive schema, and the acquired capability for suicide, to prevent suicidal ideation and attempts among them.","Ha, Park","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13830","20220802","COVID-19 pandemic; Early maladaptive schema; Interpersonal-psychological theory; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35553,""
"Weight change-related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic: a population-based cross-sectional study using social cognitive theory","Published studies during the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic have focused on eating and exercise behaviors and failed to portray a comprehensive understanding of the factors associated with weight change in a setting of a behavioral change framework. This study explores factors associated with weight change during the COVID-19 pandemic among Lebanese residents using the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) framework, integrating behavioral, environmental, and cognitive factors. This study uses a cross-sectional design using an anonymous online survey. Participants were recruited from a tertiary hospital patient portal and social media posts. The survey included four domains: demographics, cognitive, behavioral, psychological, and environmental factors. Multiple validated self-reported instruments were included Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 items (GAD-2), Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), General Self Efficacy Scale (GSES), Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (AUDIT-C), and the dietary pattern evaluation tool. A sample of 335 complete responses was obtained. Mean age was 39.0 Ã‚Â± 13.4 years old. Participants were mostly females (<i>n</i> = 224, 66.9%), employed (<i>n</i> = 191, 57.4%), nonsmokers (<i>n</i> = 227, 70.5%), reporting depression (<i>n</i> = 224, 80.3%) and anxiety (<i>n</i> = 242, 84.3%). Mean weight change was -7.0 Ã‚Â± 6.0 kg in the decrease weight group and 6.4 Ã‚Â± 5.0 kg in the increase group. When compared to stable weight, the multinomial logistic model factors that were found to correlate significantly to weight gain were: overeating/binge eating (<i>p</i>-value = 0.001) and unbalanced food pattern (<i>p</i>-value = 0.012). Baseline BMI (<i>p</i>-value = 0.003), anxiety (<i>p</i>-value = 0.020) and smoking (<i>p</i>-value = 0.004) were significant factors of weight loss as compared to stable weight. COVID-19-related weight change is multifactorial and is associated with specific behavior and individual characteristics. Hence, addressing people's behaviors and relationship to food is vital to control weight change during this continuing and future pandemic or natural occurrence.","Assaf, Antoun","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13829","20220802","COVID-19; Obesity; Predictors; Quarantine; Weight","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35554,""
"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on sleep quality of pharmacy students in UiTM Puncak Alam","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the closure of educational institutions was executed during the period of lockdown. This subsequently led to alterations in daily routines and emotional distress, particularly among university students, affecting their sleep quality resulting in disturbance of immune functioning and mood regulation. Hence, the present study aimed to measure students' sleep quality during the first few months of the lockdown period. This study is a cross-sectional, single-centred survey that was done by distributed electronic questionnaire. The e-questionnaire was divided into 4 sections that assessed socio-demographic characteristics, sleep quality, psychological state and engagement in physical activity. Exactly 248 valid responses were received, 82Ã‚Â % female students. Students with poor sleep quality were three times greater than those with good sleep quality. No association were found between physical activity and sleep quality. However, a significant positive relationship between sleep quality and psychological state was observed (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01). In conclusion, this study suggests that the majority of pharmacy students in UiTM Puncak Alam are poor sleepers and psychological distress negatively affects sleep quality but, is mainly due to stress. Thus, interventions such as stress management programs and mental health support can be taken by the faculty's management to overcome this problem.","Hazizul Hasan, Ae Moustafa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsps.2022.07.009","20220802","COVID-19; Lockdown; Pharmacy students; Sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35555,""
"Changes in Internalizing Symptoms and Anxiety Sensitivity Among College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The early months of the COVID-19 pandemic saw significant increases in symptoms of anxiety and depression, particularly among college students. However, research has not examined how internalizing symptoms in this population have changed as the pandemic has continued into its second year. Further, there has yet to be an examination of potential changes in transdiagnostic vulnerability factors. Therefore, the purpose of the current repeated cross-sectional study was to examine differences by term in undergraduates' symptoms of depression, anxiety, worry, social anxiety, and anxiety sensitivity in the Spring 2020 (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°251), Fall 2020 (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°427), and Spring 2021 (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°256) semesters. Results indicated that there were significant increases in depression, anxiety, worry, and anxiety sensitivity from Spring 2020 to Fall 2020 that were maintained through the Spring 2021 semester, and levels of social anxiety were significantly higher in Spring 2021 compared to Spring 2020. These findings suggest that the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students have continued beyond the initial months, and colleges and universities will need to develop comprehensive plans to adequately address college students' mental health needs.","McLeish, Walker, Hart","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10862-022-09990-8","20220802","Anxiety; Anxiety sensitivity; COVID-19; College students; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35556,""
"An eight country cross-sectional study of the psychosocial effects of COVID-19 induced quarantine and/or isolation during the pandemic","Forced quarantine and nationwide lockdowns have been a primary response by many jurisdictions in their attempt at COVID-19 elimination or containment, yet the associated mental health burden is not fully understood. Using an eight country cross-sectional design, this study investigates the association between COVID-19 induced quarantine and/or isolation on probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive episode (MDE) psychological outcomes approximately eight months after the pandemic was declared. Overall, 9027 adults participated, and 2937 (32.5%) were indicated with GAD and/or MDE. Reported quarantine and/or isolation was common, with 1199 (13.8%) confined for travel or health requirements, 566 (6.5%) for being close contact, 720 (8.3%) for having COVID-19 symptoms, and 457 (5.3%) for being COVID-19 positive. Compared to those not quarantining or isolating, the adjusted estimated relative risks of GAD and/or MDE associated with quarantine and/or isolation was significant (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), ranging from 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07, 1.43) for travel/health to 1.37 (95% CI 1.19, 1.59) for COVID-19 symptom isolation reasons. While almost universally employed, quarantine and/or isolation is associated with a heavy mental health toll.

"Substance use and self-harm emergency department presentations during COVID19: evidence from a National Clinical Programme for Self-Harm","Given the evidence that drinking patterns and self-harm hospital presentations have changed during COVID-19, this study aimed to examine any change in self-harm and suicide-related ideation presentations, together with any possible contribution made by alcohol or substance misuse, to Irish Emergency Departments in 2020, compared with 2018 and 2019. A population-based cohort with self-harm and suicide-related ideation presenting to Irish hospitals derived from the National Clinical Programme for Self-Harm was analysed. Descriptive analyses were conducted based on sociodemographic variables and types of presentation for the period January to August 2020 and compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019. Binomial regression analyses were performed to investigate the independent effect of demographic characteristics and pre/during COVID-19 periods on the use of substances as contributory factors in the self-harm and suicide-related ideation presentations. 12,075 presentations due to self-harm and suicide-related ideation were recorded for the periods January-August 2018-2020 across nine emergency departments. The COVID-19 year was significantly associated with substances contributing to self-harm and suicide-related ideation ED presentations (OR = 1.183; 95% CI, 1.075-1.301, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). No changes in the demographic characteristics were found for those with self-harm or suicide-related ideation across the years. Suicide-related ideation seemed to be increased after May 2020 compared with previous years. In terms of self-harm episodes with comorbid drug and alcohol overdose and poisoning, these were significantly increased in January-August 2020, compared with previous timepoints (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 42.424, df = 6, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). An increase in suicide-related ideation and substance-related self-harm presentations may indicate longer term effects of the pandemic and its relevant restrictions.

"Parentsâ€™ intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19","Usually, parents and caregivers are the ones responsible for children's vaccination, their intention to vaccinate children depending on many factors. In a society where almost half of adults have refused to take a jab against COVID-19, it is important to know which factors increase or decrease the odds of a child getting vaccinated. In the present study, we examined parentsâ€™ reasons for/against children vaccination and predictors of this intention. We found that about 30% of parents intended to have their children vaccinated to protect the health of children and their close ones. On the other hand, parents who did not intend to have their children vaccinated were typically afraid of long-term consequences of vaccination and its side effects, with less than one fifth of them being skeptical about vaccination per se. Using logistic regression analyses, we found that a higher willingness to vaccinate was in male, older parents, and those with higher (socio)economic status. Parents with a higher adherence to restrictions, and higher trust in government and authorities were more likely to vaccinate their children. Moreover, parents who had themselves been vaccinated or were more positive towards vaccination in general were much more willing to vaccinate their children. On the contrary, belief in conspiracy theories decreased this intention 10-times. No other variables (e.g., demographic characteristics, mental health indicators, or direct experience with COVID-19) significantly predicted parentsâ€™ intention to vaccinate their children. The study offers several implications related to the complexity of factors which determine hesitant parentsâ€™ intention to vaccinate their children. We aimed to answer questions on how, when, and by whom parents should be approached to improve their awareness on vaccination decisions.","Michal KentoÅ¡ et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0138-8B2-C9A","20220802","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; intention to vaccinate children; vaccine hesitancy; vaccination; covid-19 vaccines; children vaccination; covid-19; parental vaccination intention","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-03","",35559,""
"The Building Emotional Awareness and Mental health (BEAM) program developed with a community partner for mothers of infants: A study protocol for a pragmatic Phase 2A randomized controlled trial","Background: Drastic increases in the rates of maternal depression and anxiety have been reported since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Most programs aim to improve maternal mental health or parenting skills separately, despite it being more effective to target both concurrently. The Building Emotional Awareness and Mental health (BEAM) program was developed to address this gap. BEAM is a mobile health program aiming to mitigate the impacts of pandemic stress on family well-being. Since many family agencies lack infrastructure and personnel to adequately treat maternal mental health concerns, a partnership will occur with Family Dynamics (a local family agency) to address this unmet need. This study aims to examine (1) the efficacy of BEAM, vs. standard of care, at reducing negative mental health, parenting, and child outcomes and (2) the efficacy/feasibility/acceptability of BEAM, vs. standard of care, while exploring opportunities for program development. Methods: A randomized controlled trial will compare 10 weeks of the BEAM program to standard of care among 160 (80 per group) mothers who have depression and/or anxiety and children 6-18 months old living in Manitoba, Canada. Primary (maternal depression [Patient Health Questionnaire-9] and/or anxiety [Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7]), secondary (other maternal mental health, parenting, and child outcomes), and exploratory (e.g., relationship functioning, cost effectiveness) outcomes will be self-reported at three time-points. Google Analytics and back-end App data will be used to assess the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of the BEAM program. A longitudinal analysis of covariance, using linear mixed modeling, will test treatment effects on outcomes of interest. Discussion: In partnership with a local family agency, BEAM holds the potential to promote maternal-child health via a cost-effective and easily accessible program designed to scale. Results may inform care and increase access to first line care for families typically waiting 12+ months to access mental health and parenting services.

"Creative leisure activities, mental health, and wellbeing during five months of the COVID-19 pandemic: A fixed effects analysis of data from 3,725 US adults","Introduction We investigated whether changes in engagement in home-based creative activities were associated with changes in depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic, aiming to replicate findings from the UK in a US sample. Methods 3,725 adults were included from the COVID-19 Social Study in the United States, a panel study collecting data weekly during the COVID-19 pandemic. We measured engagement in eight types of creative leisure activities on the previous weekday between April and September 2020. Data were analysed using fixed effects regression models. Results Increased time spent gardening was associated with reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms and enhanced life satisfaction. Spending more time doing woodwork/DIY and arts/crafts were also associated with enhanced life satisfaction. However, more time watching TV, films, or other similar media (not for information on COVID-19) was associated with increased depressive symptoms. Other creative activities were not associated with mental health or wellbeing. Conclusion Some findings differ from evidence obtained in the UK, demonstrating the importance of replicating research across countries.
