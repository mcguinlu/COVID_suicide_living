"Mood-congruent negative thinking styles and cognitive vulnerability in depressed COVID-19 survivors: A comparison with major depressive disorder","COVID-19 is associated with depressive psychopathology in survivors. Negative thinking styles are a core feature of major depression, fostering the experience of negative emotions and affects and hampering recovery. This cognitive vulnerability has been observed in medical conditions associated with depression, but never explored in post-COVID depression. We studied 729 participants: 362 COVID-19 survivors, 73 inpatients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and 294 healthy participants (HC). Severity of depression was self-rated on the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS). Neuropsychological bias toward negative emotional stimuli and the negative outlook on the self were tested in a self-description task, yielding latencies and frequencies of attribution of morally tuned elements. Dimensions of negative thinking and depressive cognitive style in evaluation of hypothetical events were measured on the Cognition Questionnaire (CQ). 22.4% COVID survivors self-rated depression above the clinical threshold. Frequencies and latencies of attribution of morally negative elements, and CQ scores, correlated between themselves and predicted ZSDS scores, with post-COVID depressed patients showing intermediate scores between the more severe MDD patients, and non-depressed post-COVID participants and HC. Recruitment was in a single center, thus raising the possibility of population stratification. The breadth of self-reproach and depressive cognitive style in evaluating events showed the same association with severity of depression in MDD and in post-COVID depressed patients, distributing along a gradient of severity, thus suggesting that individual features of negative thinking styles are shared in these conditions, and should be addressed as treatment targets in depressed COVID-19 survivors.","Benedetti, Palladini, Greta, Furlan, Ciceri, Rovere-Querini, Mazza","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.077","20220423","Bias; COVID; Cognition; Depression; Distortion; Neuropsychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30479,""
"Understanding the impact of emotional support on mental health resilience of the community in the social media in Covid-19 pandemic","Emotional support in social media can act as a buffer against the negative impact of affective disorders. However, empirical evidence relating to emotional support in social media and how it influences the wider public remains scanty. The objective of this study is therefore to conduct a prototype investigation into the translation mechanism of emotional support in social media, providing empirical evidence for practitioners to use to tackle mental health issues for the wider public. A regression model is proposed to examine the relationship between perceived and received emotional support. Received emotional support is set as the dependent variable and measured using public activity. Perceived emotional support is derived using Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based content analysis. The model is then analyzed using a panel date with a total number of 61,297 posts from 17 Weibo accounts in 17 provincial administrative units in China. The relationship between perceived and received emotional support is not linear but complex, suggesting that translation of emotional support is not automatic. Further, our empirical evidence suggests that the translation of emotional support in social media is affected by frequency and pandemic stage. The study does not examine the direct relationship between perceived and received emotional support, instead adopting public activity as a proxy for the latter construct. In addition, the relationship between perceived and received emotional support is more complex than linear, requiring further model and theory development.","Hu, Song, Zhu, He, Zhou, Li, Bao, Shen, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.105","20220423","Affective disorders; COVID-19; Perceived emotional support; Received emotional support; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30480,""
"Changes in perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among American veterans","American veterans are a population that suffer from both context specific stressors as well as many population-specific major-life events. The present exploratory study utilizes a longitudinal cohort of 1,230 U.S. veterans surveyed from February 2020 through February 2021. We sought to understand heterogeneity in perceived stress, using growth mixture modeling, over this time period, how COVID-specific factors such as negative reactions to the pandemic, loneliness, and employment disruptions influence perceived stress trajectories, and how veterans vary across distal outcomes including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), pain, depression, sleep problems, physical health, and alcohol use disorder. Results revealed a 4-class solution: Stable High, Stable Low, Steady Increasing, and Steady Decreasing classes. In terms of COVID specific factors, negative reactions to COVID were consistently associated with perceived stress for those in the Stable High and Steady Increasing classes whereas loneliness was associated with stress trajectories for all emergent classes. Finally, in terms of our distal outcomes, results showed a relatively robust pattern with veterans in the Stable High or Steady Increasing classes reporting worse scores across all outcomes including PTSD, pain, sleep problems, physical health, depression, and alcohol use disorder. Understanding the interplay between existing vulnerabilities, ongoing stressors, and behavioral health outcomes among veterans is crucial for prevention and intervention efforts.

"Digital training for building resilience: Systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression","Resilience is learnable and broadly described as an individual's adaptive coping ability, its potential value for stress reduction must be explored. With a global coronavirus pandemic, innovative ways to deliver resilience training amidst heightened mental health concerns must be urgently examined. This systematic review aimed to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of digital training for building resilience and reducing anxiety, depressive and stress symptoms and (2) to identify essential features for designing future digital training. A three-step search was conducted in eight electronic databases, trial registries and grey literatures to locate eligible studies. Randomised controlled trials examining the effects of digital training aimed at enhancing resilience were included. Data analysis was conducted using the Stata version 17. Twenty-two randomised controlled trials involving 2,876 participants were included. Meta-analysis revealed that digital training significantly enhanced the participants' resilience with moderate to large effect (g = 0.54 - 1.09) at post-intervention and follow-up. Subgroup analyses suggested that training delivered via the Internet with a flexible program schedule was more effective than its counterparts. This review supports the use of digital training in improving resilience. Further high-quality randomised controlled trials with large sample size are needed. This article is protected by copyright.

"Alleviating psychological symptoms in nurses during disease outbreaks: An integrative review","To explore interventions and coping strategies used to treat the psychological symptoms associated with compassion fatigue among nurses. The rapid transmission of infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19) has put nurses, around the world, at high risk of developing profound psychological health issues due to compassion fatigue. If unrelieved, compassion fatigue can lead to catastrophic psychological symptoms such as depression, stress, anxiety, and insomnia, negatively impacting patient care. This necessitates interventions to prevent or mitigate the psychological symptoms of compassion fatigue. Following Whittemore and Knafl's integrative review method, the literature search comprised three databases: CINAHL, MEDLINE-OVID, and Scopus. The 11 included studies were categorized into four themes: (1) using relaxation strategies, (2) neutralizing emotional trauma, (3) enhancing nurses' preparedness for confronting disasters, and (4) educating nurses about coping strategies to manage their psychological issues. Researchers studied several coping strategies and interventions. There is a need for policymakers' support and hospital-level interventions. Early interventions may prevent or relieve psychological issues. The findings have implications for hospital leaders around the world to initiate interventions that teach nurses strategies to cope with stressful events. Future researchers might consider long-term supports and multiple interventions that target several leading causes of psychological symptoms among nurses before, during, and after high-stress situations. Policymakers around the world could use the findings to initiate policies to facilitate nurses' access to needed resources, hence protecting their mental health and increasing the quality of patient care.","Hawsawi","https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12756","20220423","COVID-19; Compassion fatigue; coping strategies; diseases outbreaks; intervention; nurses; psychological symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30483,""
"COVID-19 stressors and symptoms of depression and anxiety among Black cisgender sexual minority men and Black transgender women during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic","To examine associations between COVID-19-related stressors and symptoms of depression and anxiety in Black cisgender sexual minority men (SMM) and transgender women during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants from the N2 Cohort Study comprised Black cisgender SMM and Black transgender women in Chicago, IL, completed a face-to-face video or phone interview between April 20 and July 31, 2020. The survey included 18 measures of individual, network, and structural COVID-19 stressors such as income loss, network COVID-19 diagnoses, and housing loss, as well as 5 outcome measures: anxiety, depression, loneliness, worry and hope. Of 226 participants, 56.6% experienced anxiety on at least 1 of the last 14Ã‚Â days, 48.7% experienced depression, 48.7% experienced loneliness, 42.0% experienced worry, and 51.8% did not experience hope. Completing the study during a later phase of reopening was associated with hopefulness, RRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.37 95% CI [1.02, 1.85]. Fifteen of the 18 multi-level COVID-19 stressors were associated with 1 or more symptoms of depression and anxiety, for example, physical stress reactions, income loss, food loss, medication loss, network COVID-19 diagnoses, partner violence, housing loss, and neighborhood pandemic concerns (aRRsÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.61-2.78, psÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05).

"Ethical and Safe Discharges from Psychiatric Units during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The current pandemic raises substantive ethical and legal challenges for inpatient psychiatric units striving simultaneously to contain COVID-19 and provide safe, high-quality psychiatric care. Among these challenges, psychiatric units need to consider their role in isolating and quarantining COVID-19 positive patients who are psychiatrically cleared for discharge. We examine this complex dilemma by evaluating mental health law, quarantine law, public health ethics, a case from an urban academic medical center's inpatient unit, and literature focused on treatment and isolation protocols during HIV and tuberculosis epidemics. Although inpatient units are highly restrictive and intended for acute psychiatric treatment, at present there are no obvious isolation, quarantine, or housing options for many patients with mental illness infected with COVID-19.","Belfer, Gardner, Broutman, Alpert","https://doi.org/10.29158/JAAPL.210074-21","20220423","COVID-19; civil commitment; ethics; legal regulation of psychiatry; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30485,""
"Prior sleep-wake behaviors are associated with mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic among adult users of a wearable device in the United States","To characterize objective sleep patterns among U.S. adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to assess for associations between adverse mental health symptoms and (1) sleep duration and (2) the consistency of sleep timing before and during the pandemic. Longitudinal objective sleep-wake data during January-June 2020 were linked with mental health and substance use assessments conducted during June 2020 for The COVID-19 Outbreak Public Evaluation (COPE) Initiative. Adult users of WHOOP-a commercial, digital sleep wearable. Adults residing in the U.S. and actively using WHOOP wearable devices, recruited by WHOOP, Inc. The COVID-19 pandemic and its mitigation. Anxiety or depression symptoms, burnout symptoms, and new or increased substance use to cope with stress or emotions. Of 4912 participants in the primary analytic sample (response rate, 14.9%), we observed acutely increased sleep duration (0.25 h or 15 m) and sleep consistency (3.51 points out of 100) and delayed sleep timing (onset, 18.7 m; offset, 36.6 m) during mid-March through mid-April 2020. Adjusting for demographic and lifestyle variables, participants with persistently insufficient sleep duration and inconsistent sleep timing had higher odds of adverse mental health symptoms and substance use in June 2020. U.S. adult wearable users displayed increased sleep duration, more consistent sleep timing, and delayed sleep onset and offset times after the COVID-19 pandemic onset, with subsample heterogeneity. Associations between adverse mental health symptoms and pre- and mid-pandemic short sleep duration and inconsistent sleep timing suggest that these characteristics warrant further investigation as potential modifiable mental health and substance use risk factors.","Czeisler, Capodilupo, Weaver, Czeisler, Howard, Rajaratnam","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2022.03.001","20220423","Coronavirus; anxiety; depression; epidemiology; substance use; wearable","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30486,""
"Traditional use and safety evaluation of combination Traditional Chinese Medicine in European registration: with XiaoYao Tablets as an example","Mental health disorders such as stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia caused by COVID-19 have attracted worldwide attention. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) have been proven to be a safe and effective option for treating mental health disorders. Recently, after assessing its efficacy and safety fully, the Netherlands Medicines Evaluation Board approved XiaoYao Tablets as a traditional herbal medicinal product (THMP), indicated for an alternative self-care for patients in Europe to relieve the symptoms of mental stress and exhaustion. Despite the fact that TCMs have gradually become one of the therapeutic choices worldwide, to-date, only a few TCMs have been successfully registered in the European Union (EU) as THMPs, and XiaoYao Tablets is the first successfully registered combination TCM from China. In this article, traditional use efficacy and clinical safety of XiaoYao Tablets in the treatment of mental health disorders were summarized and analyzed from the perspective of traditional use registration (TUR). Additionally a safety evolution pathway of combination TCMs was established. This article will not only seek to enhance our understanding about traditional use efficacy and clinical safety of XiaoYao Tablets, but also summarize the experience of XiaoYao Tablets as the first successfully registered combination TCM from China, which could serve as role model for the others to overcome registration difficulties in the EU.","Wang, Gao, Zhang, Zhao, He, Sun, Zhang, Yu, Zhou, Ye, Su, Zhang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1691/ph.2022.1227","20220423","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30487,""
"Effect of distance learning on the quality of life, anxiety and stress levels of dental students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The long-term psychological effects of COVID-19 on dental students are unclear. The aim of this cross-sectional online study was to investigate the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on dental students. The Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF) was sent to all dental students through Google Forms to evaluate their quality of life (QoL), and the DASS-21 scale was used to evaluate their psychosocial status due to distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The answers were analyzed both on the basis of year of education and type of education (online versus classroom learning). One-way ANOVA was used for comparison of students in the different years of education; post hoc LSD test was used for pairwise comparisons. Sample t-test was used to compare the two groups separated as classroom/face-to-face learning and distance/online learning. The questionnaire was completed by 580 students with a response rate of 87.74%. According to the QoL scale results, there was no significant difference between the groups regarding general health, physical health, and psychology, both between different years and learning methods (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). According to the results of the DASS-21 scale, anxiety and depression in the 3rd year students were significantly higher than the other years. The stress level of the 2nd year students was statistically significantly different from the other years (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Evaluation of anxiety, stress and the QoL showed an overall detrimental effect of distance learning on the dental students, although the evaluation did not reach statistical significance. Anxiety, stress and factors affecting the quality of life negatively affected dental students who received online/distance learning, although the difference did not reach statistical significance when compared to students who received in-classroom learning.","BaÃ…Å¸aÃ„Å¸aoÃ„Å¸lu Demirekin, Buyukcavus","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03382-y","20220423","COVID -19; DASS-21 scale; Dental students; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30488,""
"Alpha-1 Acid Glycoprotein Reduction Differentiated Recovery from Remission in a Small Cohort of Cats Treated for Feline Infectious Peritonitis","Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a systemic immune-mediated inflammatory perivasculitis that occurs in a minority of cats infected with feline coronavirus (FCoV). Various therapies have been employed to treat this condition, which was previously usually fatal, though no parameters for differentiating FIP recovery from remission have been defined to enable clinicians to decide when it is safe to discontinue treatment. This retrospective observational study shows that a consistent reduction of the acute phase protein alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) to within normal limits (WNL, i.e., 500 ÃŽÂ¼g/mL or below), as opposed to duration of survival, distinguishes recovery from remission. Forty-two cats were diagnosed with FIP: 75% (12/16) of effusive and 54% (14/26) of non-effusive FIP cases recovered. Presenting with the effusive or non-effusive form did not affect whether or not a cat fully recovered (<i>p</i> = 0.2). AGP consistently reduced to WNL in 26 recovered cats but remained elevated in 16 cats in remission, dipping to normal once in two of the latter. Anaemia was present in 77% (23/30) of the cats and resolved more quickly than AGP in six recovered cats. The presence of anaemia did not affect the cat's chances of recovery (<i>p</i> = 0.1). Lymphopenia was observed in 43% (16/37) of the cats and reversed in nine recovered cats but did not reverse in seven lymphopenic cats in the remission group. Fewer recovered cats (9/24: 37%) than remission cats (7/13: 54%) were lymphopenic, but the difference was not statistically different (<i>p</i> = 0.5). Hyperglobulinaemia was slower than AGP to return to WNL in the recovered cats. FCoV antibody titre was high in all 42 cats at the outset. It decreased significantly in 7 recovered cats but too slowly to be a useful parameter to determine discontinuation of antiviral treatments. Conclusion: a sustained return to normal levels of AGP was the most rapid and consistent indicator for differentiating recovery from remission following treatment for FIP. This study provides a useful model for differentiating recovery from chronic coronavirus disease using acute phase protein monitoring.","Addie, Silveira, Aston, Brauckmann, Covell-Ritchie, Felstead, Fosbery, Gibbins, Macaulay, McMurrough, Pattison, Robertson","https://doi.org/10.3390/v14040744","20220423","AGP; FIP; acute-phase protein; alpha-1 acid glycoprotein; antiviral; feline coronavirus; feline infectious peritonitis; interferon omega; meloxicam; treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30489,""

"Predictors of Psychological Distress in Women with Endometriosis during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Endometriosis is a multifaceted chronic pain condition that can have a negative impact on mental health. Patients suffering from chronic pain may face an additional psychological burden during adversity, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The main aim of this research was to evaluate the prevalence of self-reported depression and anxiety, the influence of demographic, endometriosis-specific, pandemic-specific factors, and resilience on mental health outcomes of patients with endometriosis. An online survey was conducted through patient support groups of women suffering from endometriosis during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The PHQ-4 questionnaire, which combines two items of the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression (PHQ-2) and two items from the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-2) was used to assess self-reported mental health. The Brief Resilience Score (BRS) was employed to evaluate resilience. Independent risk and protective factors for mental health were investigated by multivariate logistic regression analyses. The PHQ-4 questionnaire was completed by 274 respondents. More than 40% reached depression (PHQ-2) and anxiety (GAD-2) scores of Ã¢â€°Â¥3, and more than 20% achieved PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores of Ã¢â€°Â¥5. High resilience was found to be a reliable and strong independent protector for the probability of developing adverse psychological outcomes: OR 0.295, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001 for developing generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-2 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3), and OR 0.467, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001 for having major depression (PHQ-2 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3). Pain-induced disability is an independent risk factor for developing major depression and anxiety, while resilience was identified as a potential protective parameter in terms of positive psychological outcomes in women with endometriosis. The results of this study may help to identify women at risk for adverse mental health outcomes and should encourage healthcare practitioners to establish strategies for the reduction of negative psychological and psychiatric impacts on patients with endometriosis.","Schwab, Stewen, Ost, Kottmann, Theis, Elger, Schmidt, Anic, Kalb, Brenner, Hasenburg","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084927","20220423","COVID-19; chronic pain; endometriosis; mental health; pain-induced disability; quarantine; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30491,""

This study provides a unique contribution to the literature by considering the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on frontline healthcare workers and their families. Thirty-nine frontline healthcare workers from Victoria, Australia, who were parents to at least one child under 18 were interviewed. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Five superordinate and 14 subordinate themes were identified. Themes included more family time during lockdowns, but at a cost; changes in family responsibilities and routines; managing increased demands; healthcare workers hypervigilance and fear of bringing COVID-19 home to their family members; ways in which families worked to ""get through it"". While efforts have been made by many healthcare organisations to support their workers during this challenging time, the changes in family functioning observed by participants suggest that more could be done for this vulnerable cohort, particularly with respect to family support.","Sheen, Clancy, Considine, Dwyer, Tchernegovski, Aridas, Lee, Reupert, Boyd","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084897","20220423","COVID-19; family functioning; frontline; healthcare worker; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30492,""
"Mental Disorder Symptoms and the Relationship with Resilience among Paramedics in a Single Canadian Site","There is growing recognition in research and policy of a mental health crisis among Canada's paramedics; however, despite this, epidemiological surveillance of the problem is in its infancy. Just weeks before the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, we surveyed paramedics from a single, large, urban paramedic service in Ontario, Canada to assess for symptom clusters consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder and to identify potential risk factors for each. In total, we received 589 completed surveys (97% completion rate) and found that 11% screened positive for PTSD, 15% screened positive for major depressive disorder, and 15% screened positive for generalized anxiety disorder, with one in four active-duty paramedics screening positive for any of the three as recently as February 2020. In adjusted analyses, the risk of a positive screen varied as a function of employment classification, gender, self-reported resilience, and previous experience as a member of the service's peer support team. Our findings support the position that paramedics screen positive for mental disorders at high rates-a problem likely to have worsened since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We echo the calls of researchers and policymakers for urgent action to support paramedic mental health in Canada.","Mausz, Donnelly, Moll, Harms, McConnell","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084879","20220423","first responders; mental disorders; mental health; operational stress injuries; peer support; post-traumatic stress injuries; public safety personnel; resilience; trauma; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30493,""

Moreover, understanding the rationale and characteristics present in xenophobic bullying may have important implications for our social wellbeing, mental health, and inclusiveness as a global community both in the short and long term. This study employs a mixed-method approach using Big Data techniques as well as qualitative analysis of xenophobic bullying disclosures on Twitter following the spread of COVID-19. The data suggests that about half of the sample represented xenophobic bullying. The qualitative analysis also found that 64% of xenophobic bullying-related tweets referred to occasions that perpetuated racist stereotypes. Relatedly, the rationale for almost 75% of xenophobic bullying incidents was due to being Chinese or Asian. The findings of this study, coupled with anti-hate reports from around the world, are used to suggest multipronged policy interventions and considerations of how social media sites such as Twitter can be used to curb the spread of misinformation and xenophobic bullying.","Dhungana Sainju, Zaidi, Mishra, Kuffour","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084824","20220423","COVID-19; Twitter; machine learning; misinformation; qualitative analysis; social wellbeing; xenophobic bullying","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30494,""
"Post-COVID-19 Tourists' Preferences, Attitudes and Travel Expectations: A Study in Guayaquil, Ecuador","Expectations about a destination influence the tourist experience during the travel process stages. In the post-COVID-19 normalcy, people are adjusting their priorities and social values. Therefore, it becomes crucial to identify tourists' expectations before traveling. The objectives of this research were: (a) identify the preferences of tourists; (b) establish the attitudes of tourists; and (c) determine the expectations of tourists for post-COVID-19 destination selection. The study analyzed a sample of 491 people during pandemic lockdowns in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Statistical techniques such as exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were used in data analysis. The results show that after the pandemic, tourists prefer urban tourism, followed by cultural tourism and traveling with relatives. It also shows a more responsible and supportive attitude when traveling. Likewise, the results support the dimensional structure that explains a set of post-pandemic tourist expectations. Five factors were identified: Smart Care, pricing strategy, safety, comfort, and social distancing. Finally, the theoretical and managerial implications of the results that will guide for tourism destination managers were discussed.","Orden-MejÃƒÂ­a, Carvache-Franco, Huertas, Carvache-Franco, Landeta-Bejarano, Carvache-Franco","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084822","20220423","comfort; crisis; destination choice; mental health; pandemic; pricing strategy; safety; smart care; social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30495,""
"Family Resilience and Adolescent Mental Health during COVID-19: A Moderated Mediation Model","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and is still impacting people's lives, including physical and mental health. Family plays an important role in adolescent mental health due to the long staying at home. This paper aimed to investigate the impact of family resilience on adolescent mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the mediation role of pandemic stress perception and the moderation role of meta-mood. A total of 2691 Chinese adolescents were recruited using convenient sampling. Their mental health, family resilience, pandemic stress perception and meta-mood were surveyed. Multivariate statistics were used to analyze the data. Our results showed that (1) about 36.7% adolescents in our sample have some mental health problems; (2) family resilience can positively predict adolescent mental health, whereas pandemic stress perception can negatively predict mental health; (3) pandemic stress perception mediates the relationship between family resilience and adolescent mental health; (4) meta-mood moderates the relationship between family resilience and pandemic perception, i.e., the first half of the mediation role. Our results indicate that one can either improve family resilience or improve adolescents' meta-mood to relieve adolescents' mental health problems.","Zhuo, Yu, Shi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084801","20220423","COVID-19 pandemic; adolescent mental health; family resilience; meta-mood; pandemic stress perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30496,""
"Healthcare Utilization and Adherence to Treatment Recommendations among Children with Type 1 Diabetes in Poland during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is, next to obesity and asthma, the most common chronic disease in children in Poland. The results of T1D treatment strongly depend on the patient's compliance with therapeutic recommendations, which entails the use of necessary health services. Based on a retrospective analysis of the data on health services provided in 2016-2020 to over 15.5 thousand patients with T1D in Poland, we assessed the compliance of the actual model of treatment of T1D in children with the current guidelines. It was found that only about 50% of patients received the number of diabetes consultations corresponding to the recognized standards, with about 15% of children with T1D remaining outside the public healthcare system. In the case of many outpatient services (ophthalmological, neurological, mental health), the number of consultations was extremely low-one order of magnitude lower than in general population and dropped even lower in 2020. This shows that the health needs of children with T1D are not being met within the public healthcare system. The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant limitations in access to healthcare in Poland. Compared to the pre-pandemic period there was a significant decrease (-27% compared to 2019) in the number of hospitalizations, and a substantial increase (+22% compared to 2019) in the number of diabetic ketoacidoses (DKA) cases. The proportion of hospitalizations caused by DKA rose to 8.9% compared to 7.3% in 2019.","GrudziÃ„â€¦Ã…Â¼-SÃ„â„¢kowska, SÃ„â„¢kowski, Kobuszewski","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084798","20220423","DKA; adherence; diabetes mellitus; healthcare utilization; pandemic; type 1","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30497,""
"Implementation of a Psychiatric Consultation for Healthcare Workers during First Wave of COVID-19 Outbreak","Prevention and management strategies of mental suffering in healthcare workers appeared as important challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article aims to: (1) show how potential psychiatric disorders for healthcare workers (HCW) during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak were identified; (2) present an activity report of this consultation; and (3) analyze and learn from this experience for the future. We performed a retrospective quantitative analysis of socio-demographic and clinical data, in addition to psychiatric scales scores for the main potential psychiatric risks (PDI, PDEQ, PCL-5, HADS, MBI-HSS) and post-hoc qualitative analysis of written interviews. Twenty-five healthcare workers consulted between 19 March 2020 and 12 June 2020. We found 78.57% presented high peritraumatic dissociation and peritraumatic distress, 68.75% had severe anxiety symptoms, and 31.25% had severe depression symptoms. Concerning burnout, we found that 23.53% had a high level of emotional exhaustion. In the qualitative analysis of the written interview, we found a direct link between stress and the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily concerning traumatic stressors, and secondarily with work-related stress. Early detection of traumatic reactions, valorization of individual effort, and limitations on work overload appear like potential key preventive measures to prevent psychiatric complications for healthcare workers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Benzakour, Langlois, Marini, Groz, Chiabotto, Apetrei, Corneau, Bondolfi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084780","20220423","COVID-19; Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); burnout; healthcare workers; psychiatric consultation; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30498,""
"Assessment of Subjective Well-Being in a Cohort of University Students and Staff Members: Association with Physical Activity and Outdoor Leisure Time during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Time spent outdoors and physical activity (PA) promote mental health. To confirm this relationship in the aftermath of COVID-19 lockdowns, we explored individual levels of anxiety, depression, stress and subjective well-being (SWB) in a cohort of academic students and staff members and tested their association with sport practice, PA at leisure time and time spent outdoors. Our cross-sectional study collected data during the COVID-19 outbreak (April-May 2021) on 939 students and on 238 employees, who completed an online survey on sociodemographic and lifestyle features, depression, anxiety, stress, and SWB. Results showed that the students exhibited higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress, and lower levels of SWB (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001 for all domains) compared to the staff members. Correlation analysis confirmed that PA and time spent in nature were associated to high mental health scores among staff and, more consistently, among students. Finally, mediation analyses indicated that the time spent in nature, social relationships, and levels of energy play a mediator role in the relationship between sport practice and SWB. Our evidence reinforces the protective role of time spent in nature in improving mental health, and provides support for policymakers to make appropriate choices for a better management of COVID-19 pandemic consequences.","Quarta, Levante, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Conesa, Lecciso, Scoditti, Carluccio, Calabriso, Damiano, Santarpino, Verri, Pinto, Siculella, Massaro","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084787","20220423","distress; general health; mental health; quality of life; social relationship; sport practice; subjective well-being (SWB); time spent in nature","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30499,""
"Returning to Work after the COVID-19 Pandemic Earthquake: A Systematic Review","The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has disrupted life and work habits and has produced landmark changes worldwide. This systematic review aimed to analyse the management of Return to Work (RTW) by work organisations following the virus spread. A selection of 2477 papers, using string research on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus from January 2020 to October 2021, were analysed. Fifty-one articles were finally included, and the results obtained were discussed from three different points of view. Twenty articles concerning 'Remodelling of Work Organization' proposed some model strategies for resumption to work. Twenty-one papers, including 'Clinical Evaluation of Workers', mostly explored the psychosocial impact of returned workers. Finally, twelve articles explored the best 'Testing Strategies related to RTW'. Despite the heterogeneity of included articles, several interesting approaches have emerged in managing RTW.

"(Mis)Information, Fears and Preventative Health Behaviours Related to COVID-19","Social and mass media platforms (SMM) are essential tools for keeping people informed about health-promoting practices. However, the potential to spread misinformation or false rumors exists. These might influence preventive health behaviours and incite anxiety and/or fear among the population. A sample of 300 adults participated in a survey to understand information needs, fears and preventive health behaviours related to COVID-19 while analyzing differences in COVID-19 acceptance rates. Descriptive-correlational, between-group comparisons and regression analyses were applied. Most of the sample revealed a willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccines (65.4% vs. 34.5%) and was prone to use and trust different SMM without experiencing significant obstacles in managing COVID-19-related information except for the need to ration it from time to time (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>(2, <i>N</i> = 298) = 6.654, <i>p</i> = 0.036). Preventive behaviours/measures carried out were similar among the people resistant, hesitant or willing to get vaccinated for COVID-19. However, higher self-efficacy was observed in resistant vaccine individuals (F<sub>(2)</sub> = 3.163, <i>p</i> = 0.044). Psychological impact (need for psychological support due to COVID-19 situation) in accepting (F<sub>(5,</sub>&amp;amp;nbsp;<sub>189)</sub> = 17.539, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.317) and hesitant individuals (F<sub>(5,</sub>&amp;amp;nbsp;<sub>77)</sub> = 17.080, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.526) was explained by female gender, younger age, threat susceptibility and differential characteristics in terms of psychological symptoms experienced and SMM trust. No explanatory model was obtained for the resistant individuals. SMM could be effective tools to promote COVID-19 health preventive behaviours. However, psychographic characteristics might modulate information-seeking and management as well as self-perceived threat susceptibility and severity. All these factors must be accurately considered when designing different health preventive campaigns for the general public.","Castellano-Tejedor, Torres-Serrano, Cencerrado","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084539","20220423","COVID-19; anxiety; cross-sectional survey; fear; information needs; misinformation; online survey; pandemic; population mental health; preventative behaviours","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30501,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Maternal Well-Being during Pregnancy","The outbreak of a pandemic has negative psychological effects. We aimed to determine the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic during pregnancy and identify the risk factors for maternal well-being. A multicenter, prospective, population-based study was carried out that included women (<i>n</i> = 1320) who were pregnant during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Barcelona (Spain) compared against a pre-pandemic cohort (<i>n</i> = 345). Maternal well-being was assessed using the validated World Health Organization Well-Being Index Questionnaire (WHO-5 Index). Pregnant women attended during the COVID-19 pandemic showed worst WHO-5 well-being scores (median (IQR) of 56 (36-72) for the pandemic cohort vs. 64 (52-76) for the pre-pandemic cohort <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), with 42.8% of women presenting a poor well-being score vs. 28% for the pre-pandemic cohort (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). Presence of a previous psychiatric disorder (OR 7.1; 95% CI 2.6-19, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), being in the third trimester of pregnancy (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.5-2, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), or requiring hospital admission for COVID-19 (OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.4-16.7, <i>p</i> = 0.014), significantly contributed to low maternal well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic (multivariate analysis). Being infected by SARS-CoV-2 was not associated with a lower well-being score. We conclude that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there were higher rates of poor maternal well-being; the infection of SARS-CoV-2 itself did not worsen maternal well-being, but other factors as psychiatric disorders, being in the third trimester of pregnancy or hospital admission for COVID-19 disease did.","Pascal, Crovetto, Casas, Youssef, Trilla, Larroya, Cahuana, Boada, Foraster, Llurba, Sunyer, Crispi, Gratacos, GÃƒÂ³mez-Roig","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11082212","20220423","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; depression; pandemic; pregnancy; psychiatric disorders; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30502,""
"COVID-19 and the <i>Infodemic</i>: An Overview of the Role and Impact of Social Media, the Evolution of Medical Knowledge, and Emerging Problems","The <i>infodemic</i> is an important component of the <i>cyber-risk</i> in regard to the poor and uncontrolled dissemination of information related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to perform a narrative review based on three points of view to allow for an overall picture of this issue. The points of view focused on: (a) the volume of use of social media (a key element of the infodemic) and the position of international health domain bodies; (b) the evolution of scientific production in the life sciences; (c) emerging issues. The research methodology was based on Google and PubMed searches and a qualification process based on a standard checklist and an evaluation of eligibility based on parameters with five score levels applied by two experts (plus one in case of discrepancy). The three points of view stressed the key role of social media as a dissemination tool of the <i>infodemic</i> among citizens. The impact on citizens depends on various social factors and involves indirect (e.g., vaccine avoidance) and direct risks such as mental problems and the risk of suicide. The widespread diffusion of social media, conveyed by mobile technologies, also suggests their use as countermeasures, calibrated based on citizens' level of both technological and health literacy. Effective and promising countermeasures in this direction are based both on initiatives of contact by apps or SMS and the collection of data based on surveys and finalized to the particular intervention. The review also suggests as further areas of in-depth research: (a) to combat <i>high-level</i>&amp;amp;nbsp;<i>infodemic</i> produced by scientific publications that are not yet official (preprint) or that have undergone peer review with bias/distortion; (b) focusing on the impact of the <i>infodemic</i> considering its spread in different languages.","Corinti, Pontillo, Giansanti","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10040732","20220423","COVID-19; infodemic; infodemiology; infoveillance; pandemic; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30503,""

There were two research foci: first, ethical decision-making related to treating patients in the context of potential medical resource scarcity, and second, other psychosocial factors for healthcare professionals pertaining to coping, role conflicts, and the availability of institutional support. An online survey was conducted in the fall of 2020 amongst the frontline healthcare professionals working in the three most impacted hospitals; respondents were also drawn from two ambulance services. The focus of the survey was on the first wave of COVID-19 (spring 2020). A total of 215 respondents completed the quantitative survey and qualitative data were gathered from open comments. Over half of the surveyed healthcare professionals in Estonia expressed confidence in their roles during the pandemic. More than half cited the complex ethical aspects related to their decisions as their main source of doubt and uncertainty. In response to this uncertainty, Estonian healthcare professionals drew on their previous training and experience, the policies and guidelines of their institution, and support from their colleagues, to aid their decision-making during the pandemic. Although frontline healthcare professionals faced difficult decisions during the first wave of the pandemic, overall, most agreed that experiencing the pandemic reconfirmed that their work mattered greatly.","Simm, Zameska, Lubi","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10040711","20220423","COVID-19; Estonia; ethical decision-making; frontline healthcare workers; mental health; pandemic; triage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30504,""
"The Potential Use of Ebselen in Treatment-Resistant Depression","Ebselen is an organoselenium compound developed as an antioxidant and subsequently shown to be a glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mimetic. Ebselen shows some efficacy in post-stroke neuroprotection and is currently in trial for the treatment and prevention of hearing loss, Meniere's Disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In vitro screening studies show that ebselen is also an effective inhibitor of the enzyme inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), which is a key target of the mood-stabilising drug lithium. Further, in animal experimental studies, ebselen produces effects on the serotonin system very similar to those of lithium and also decreases behavioural impulsivity. The antidepressant effects of lithium in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) have been attributed to its ability to facilitate presynaptic serotonin activity; this suggests that ebselen might also have a therapeutic role in this condition. Human studies utilising magnetic resonance spectroscopy support the notion that ebselen, at therapeutic doses, inhibits IMPase in the human brain. Moreover, neuropsychological studies support an antidepressant profile for ebselen based on positive effects on emotional processing and reward seeking. Ebselen also lowers a human laboratory measure of impulsivity, a property that has been associated with lithium's anti-suicidal effects in patients with mood disorders. Current clinical studies are directed towards assessment of the neuropsychological effects of ebselen in TRD patients. It will also be important to ascertain whether ebselen is able to lower impulsivity and suicidal behaviour in clinical populations. The objective of this review is to summarise the developmental history, pre-clinical and clinical psychopharmacological properties of ebselen in psychiatric disorders and its potential application as a treatment for TRD.","Ramli, Cowen, Godlewska","https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15040485","20220423","depression; ebselen; inositol; serotonin","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-24","",30505,""
"Changes in the Mean of Medical Visits Due to Psychiatric Disease in Korean Children and Adolescents before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has been suggested to have adverse impacts on psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to investigate the changes in medical visits due to a wide range of psychiatric disorders in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. The medical visits of all Korean children and adolescents (0-19 years old) due to the 12 following psychiatric disorders were investigated: autism; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); depressive disorder; bipolar disorder; primary insomnia; schizophrenia; panic disorder; hypochondriasis; posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); anxiety disorder; anorexia nervosa; and adephagia. The mean medical visits before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared.

"Coronavirus infections from 2002 to 2021: neuropsychiatric manifestations","Coronaviruses have been known to infect humans for several decades and there are four endemic subtypes: HCoV (human coronavirus)Ã‚Â -229E, -NL63, -OC43 and -HKU1. These mainly cause a mild upper respiratory illness, but occasionally in vulnerable individuals they can result in more severe respiratory disease and, rarely, CNS involvement. Prior exposure to these viruses has also been associated with an increased odds of having a major psychiatric illness. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by SARS-CoV, started in 2002 and, as well as causing a more severe respiratory phenotype, was also associated with delirium and affective symptoms acutely. Psychosis occurred in about 1% of individuals and was generally thought to be due to corticosteroid administration. The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), caused by MERS-CoV, revealed similar findings. Survivors of both SARS and MERS reported persistent physical and psychological symptoms at least several months after the acute illness. The reported neuropsychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 range from the common symptoms of systemic and upper respiratory infections to severe and disabling conditions. Delirium has been described using varying terminology; as well as being a possible presenting feature of COVID-19, it has also been shown to be a marker of severe disease. Stroke, both ischaemic and haemorrhagic, have been reported to be more common in COVID-19 than in other medical illnesses. Mood and anxiety disorders are likely to be common at follow-up, while psychosis remains rare and controversial.
