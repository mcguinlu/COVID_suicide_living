"Interoceptive anxiety-related processes: Importance for understanding COVID-19 and future pandemic mental health and addictive behaviors and their comorbidity","The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with an increased prevalence of mental health problems and addictive behaviors. There is a growing theoretical and empirical evidence that individual differences in interoceptive anxiety-related processes are a one set of vulnerability factors that are important in understanding the impact of pandemic-related mental health problems and addictive behavior. However, there has not been a comprehensive effort to explore this rapidly growing body of research and its implications for public health. In this paper, we discuss why interoceptive anxiety-related processes are relevant to understanding mental health and addictive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We then provide a narrative review of the available COVID-19 literature linking interoceptive fear and anxiety-related processes (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, health anxiety, and COVID-19 anxiety, fear, and worry) to mental health and addictive behaviors. We then propose a novel transdiagnostic theoretical model that highlights the role of interoceptive anxiety-related processes in mental health and addictive behavior in the context of the present and future pandemics. In the final section, we utilize this conceptualization to underscore clinical implications and provide guidance for future research initiatives in the management of COVID-19 mental health and addictive behaviors and inform the public health field for future pandemics.","Zvolensky, Kauffman, Garey, Viana, Matoska","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2022.104141","20220625","Addiction; COVID-19; Chronic illness; Coronavirus; Health behavior; Mental health; Pandemic(s)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-26","",33370,""
"Rural older adults' resilience in the context of COVID-19","Public health and media discourses have often portrayed older adults as a vulnerable group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, some emerging research is showing that older adults are faring better in terms of their mental health when compared to their younger counterparts. Understanding older adults' mental well-being during the pandemic requires in-depth exploration of the different place-based resources and systems around them. In particular, rural older adults face distinct challenges and opportunities related to accessing valued resources to promote their well-being. Drawing together research on aging and multi-systemic resilience, we explored what strategies, resources, and processes rural older adults valued in the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A series of 51 semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted from May to August 2020 with 26 rural older adults in Manitoba, Canada. Despite adversities, participants drew on and developed resources at the individual, local, community, institutional, and societal level to support their well-being. Specifically, they identified individual strategies (e.g., positivity, acceptance, and gratitude), resources in their immediate environments (e.g., opportunities to keep busy, connect with friends, family and neighbours, and outdoor visits), and community organizations that contributed to their well-being. They also identified broader systems that shaped their resilience processes, such as access to health services, opportunities to volunteer and support others, media stories, reliable information, and public health policies and practices that value older adult lives. Importantly, some resources were less accessible to some participants, highlighting the need to develop strategies that address inequitable resources at different levels. By describing rural older adults' resilience we seek to advance the growing body of research in relation to social ecological resilience that moves beyond a focus on individual characteristics to include understanding of the role of material, social, and cultural contexts.","Herron, Lawrence, Newall, Ramsey, Waddell-Henowitch, Dauphinais","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115153","20220625","COVID-19; Canada; Older adults; Resilience; Rural; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-26","",33371,""
"Protecting mental health during periods of financial stress: Evidence from the Australian Coronavirus Supplement income support payment","This paper investigates whether the Australian government's Coronavirus Supplement, a temporary income support payment for unemployed jobseekers during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, protected mental health (frequency of feeling anxious or depressed during the past week) by lowering financial stress (how comfortable people are in paying for essential services). We use unique nationally representative repeated cross-sectional data on 3843 unemployed Australian adults over the period April 6, 2020 to May 10, 2021. We find that the Coronavirus Supplement payment significantly reduced reported financial stress, and lower financial stress was associated with lower mental distress. Though the Coronavirus Supplement was designed to reduce financial stress, we find the Supplement was also successful in protecting community mental health indirectly via its ability to reduce financial stress. The findings provide support for income support packages to protect mental health during economic shocks. However, transitory support measures also tend have short-lived positive effects on mental health, suggesting that more permanent income support reform may have longer-term mental health benefits.","Botha, Butterworth, Wilkins","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115158","20220625","Australia; Coronavirus; Financial stress; Income support; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-26","",33372,""
"Investigation of the Relationship Between the Spiritual Orientation and Psychological Well-Being Levels of Inpatients with a Diagnosis of COVID-19 In Turkey: A Cross-Sectional Study","This study was carried out to determine the relationship between the spiritual orientation and psychological well-being levels of inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 and the factors affecting the psychological well-being of patients. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 136 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in the COVID-19 clinics of a state hospital between May and July 2021 and volunteered to participate in the study. To collect the study data, the Personal Information Form, Spiritual Orientation Scale (SOS) and Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWBS) were used. There was a positive correlation between the mean scores obtained from the overall SOS and PWBS (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.335, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Of the participants, those who were women, who were over 65-year-old patients, who were hospitalized for 8-14Ã‚Â days and who had chronic diseases had lower levels of psychological well-being. The inpatients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 had high levels of spirituality and psychological well-being. It was found that there is a relationship between the spiritual orientation and psychological well-being of inpatients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19. The fact that nurses take spirituality into account while providing care to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 may be effective in protecting their patients' mental health.","Ã…Å¾ahin Altun, Ãƒâ€“zer, SatÃ„Â±lmÃ„Â±Ã…Å¸, Ã…Å¾ahin","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-022-01602-9","20220625","COVID-19; Psychological well-being; Spiritual care; Spirituality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-26","",33373,""

"Caring for Service Members Who Have Been Sexually Assaulted: The Military Health System","Reports of sexual assault (SA) in the U.S. Military have increased in recent years. Given the deleterious effects of military SA, there remains a need for large-scale studies to assess SA-related health care utilization among active duty service members (ADSMs). The present study, therefore, utilized Military Health System (MHS) data to determine the prevalence of SA-related care, sociodemographic characteristics of ADSMs receiving said care, and the type of provider seen during the initial SA-related health encounter. Utilizing the MHS Data Repository and Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, all ADSMs from the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps during fiscal years (FY) 2016-2018 were identified. Those with an International Classification of Diseases diagnostic code related to SA during the study period were isolated. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted. The study was exempt from human subjects review. A total of 1,728,433 ADSMs during FY 2016-2018 were identified, of whom 4,113 (0.24%) had an SA-related health encounter. Rates of SA-related health care encounters decreased each FY. Women (odds ratio [OR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.02, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001), those in the Army (reference group), and enlisted personnel (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.65, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001) were most likely to receive SA-related health care, whereas ADSMs aged 18-25Ã¢â‚¬â€°years had lower odds (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.70, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001). In addition, higher odds of SA-related care were observed among those identifying as American Indian/Alaskan Native (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.37, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.02) and ""Other"" race (e.g., multiracial) (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.60, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001). Initial SA-related health encounters were most likely to occur with behavioral health providers (41.4%). The current study is the first large-scale examination of health care usage by ADSMs in the MHS who have experienced SA. Results indicated that rates of SA-related care decreased throughout the study period, despite the increasing rates of SA documented by the DoD. Inconsistent with previous research and DoD reports indicating that younger ADSMs are at the highest risk for SA, our study observed lower rates of SA-related care among those aged 18-25Ã¢â‚¬â€°years; additional research is warranted to determine if there are barriers preventing younger ADSMs from seeking SA-related health care. Behavioral health providers were most frequently seen for the initial SA-related encounter, suggesting that they may be in a unique position to provide care and/or relevant referrals to ADSMs who have experienced SA. The present study provides key insights about the prevalence of SA-related care within the MHS, not yet reported in previous literature, which could help inform MHS screening practices. The strengths of the study are the inclusion of the entire active duty population without the need for research recruitment given the utilization of de-identified TRICARE claims data. The study is limited by its use of health care claims data, general SA International Classification of Diseases codes as a proxy indicator for military SA, and lack of data on ethnicity. Future research utilizing MHS data should examine mental health outcomes following the documentation of SA and disruptions in SA-related care due to SARS-CoV-2.","Murray, Perez Koehlmoos, Banaag, Schvey","https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usac175","20220625","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-26","",33375,""
"Family-based treatment for adolescents with anorexia nervosa: A long-term psychological follow-up","Family-based treatment (FBT) has the greatest evidence base for the treatment of adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN). However, little is known about the long-term outcomes for patients who receive FBT. The current study aimed to investigate the long-term psychological health of former patients who received FBT for AN during adolescence. Former patients diagnosed and treated for AN at the Royal Children's Hospital and Monash Children's Hospital (NÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°36) in Melbourne, Australia completed self-report questionnaires to assess eating, exercising, mood and the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Patient scores were compared to healthy controls (NÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°29) and normative data. The eating and exercising behaviours of the patients who formerly had AN were comparable to controls. However, the former patients experience significantly greater levels of depression, anxiety, and stress than the controls (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The COVID-19 pandemic appeared to impact the former patients and controls to a similar extent across quantifiable criteria. This study extends previous research highlighting FBT as an effective intervention for adolescents with AN. Positive short- and long-term patient outcomes can be achieved with this form of treatment.","Springall, Caughey, Zannino, Cheung, Burton, Kyprianou, Yeo","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.16070","20220625","adolescent health; anorexia nervosa; family-based treatment; mental health; psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-26","",33376,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on foot care services in Ontario, Canada","The COVID-19 pandemic has directly affected the delivery of health care services in Canada, including foot care. The goal of this descriptive study was to understand the impact of the early COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to April 2021) on chiropodists' and podiatrists' clinical practices and foot care service delivery in Ontario, Canada. A web-survey was completed by participating chiropodists and podiatrists registered with the College of Chiropodists of Ontario. The survey consisted of 31 multiple choice and open-ended items on clinical practice characteristics, foot care service delivery changes, perceived barriers during the pandemic, and its impact on clinicians. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and examine clinicians' responses, and qualitative content analysis was used to explore opened-ended items. Of the 773 eligible clinicians, 279 participated for a response rate of 36.1%. Most respondents reported a decline in patient volume, an increase in urgent foot health problems, a financial impact on their clinical practices, an emotional impact, and substantial changes to how they provided foot care services, such as incorporating telehealth/virtual care into patient care. Factors that impact clinicians' perception of future pandemic preparedness are identified. This study describes foot care service delivery in Ontario, Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic saw an increase in urgent foot health problems, decline in patient volume, and impacted clinicians' mental health and emotional well-being. Future studies should examine patients' experiences of foot care service delivery and maintaining their foot health during the pandemic, and further examination of factors that impact clinicians' perception of pandemic preparedness.","Lu, McLaren, Pinsker","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13047-022-00555-2","20220624","COVID-19; Chiropodists; Foot care; Foot health; Mental health; Pandemic preparedness; Podiatrists; Telehealth/virtual care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-26","",33377,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a cohort of Labrador retrievers in England","The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have affected the welfare and health of dogs due to surges in adoptions and purchases, changes in the physical and mental health and financial status of dog owners, changes in dogs' lifestyle and routines and limited access to veterinary care. The aims of this study were to investigate whether COVID-19 restrictions were associated with differences in Labrador retrievers' lifestyle, routine care, insurance status, illness incidence or veterinary attendance with an illness, who were living in England and enrolled in Dogslife, an owner-based cohort study. Longitudinal questionnaire data from Dogslife that was relevant to the dates between the 23rd of March and the 4th of July 2020, during COVID-19 restrictions in England, were compared to data between the same dates in previous years from 2011 to 2019 using mixed regression models and adjusted chi-squared tests. Compared with previous years (March 23rd to July 4th, 2010 to 2019), the COVID-19 restrictions study period (March 23rd to July 4th 2020) was associated with owners reporting increases in their dogs' exercise and worming and decreases in insurance, titbit-feeding and vaccination. Odds of owners reporting that their dogs had an episode of coughing (0.20, 95% CI: 0.04-0.92) and that they took their dogs to a veterinarian with an episode of any illness (0.58, 95% CI: 0.45-0.76) were lower during the COVID-19 restrictions compared to before. During the restrictions period, owners were less likely to report that they took their dogs to a veterinarian with certainÃ‚Â other illnesses, compared to before this period. Dogslife provided a unique opportunity to study prospective questionnaire data from owners already enrolled on a longitudinal cohort study. This approach minimised bias associated with recalling events prior to the pandemic and allowed a wider population of dogs to be studied than is available from primary care data. Distinctive insights into owners' decision making about their dogs' healthcare were offered. There are clear implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions for the lifestyle, care and health of dogs.","Woolley, Handel, Bronsvoort, Schoenebeck, Clements","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-022-03319-z","20220624","Animals; COVID-19; Cohort studies; Dogs; Epidemiology; Labrador retrievers; Longitudinal studies; Pandemics; Surveys and questionnaires; Veterinarians","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-26","",33378,""
"Sequelae of COVID-19 among previously hospitalized patients up to 1Ã‚Â year after discharge: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Although complications and clinical symptoms of COVID-19 have been elucidated, the prevalence of long-term sequelae of COVID-19 is less clear in previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This review and meta-analysis present the occurrence of different symptoms up to 1Ã‚Â year of follow-up for previously hospitalized patients. We performed a systematic review from PubMed and Web of Science using keywords such as ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""sequelae"", ""long-term effect"" and included studies with at least 3-month of follow-up. Meta-analyses using random-effects models were performed to estimate the pooled prevalence for different sequelae. Subgroup analyses were conducted by different follow-up time, regions, age and ICU admission. 72 articles were included in the meta-analyses after screening 11,620 articles, identifying a total of 167 sequelae related to COVID-19 from 88,769 patients. Commonly reported sequelae included fatigue (27.5%, 95% CI 22.4-33.3%, range 1.5-84.9%), somnipathy (20.1%, 95% CI 14.7-26.9%, range 1.2-64.8%), anxiety (18.0%, 95% CI 13.8-23.1%, range 0.6-47.8%), dyspnea (15.5%, 95% CI 11.3-20.9%, range 0.8-58.4%), PTSD (14.6%, 95% CI 11.3-18.7%, range 1.2-32.0%), hypomnesia (13.4%, 95% CI 8.4-20.7%, range 0.6-53.8%), arthralgia (12.9%, 95% CI 8.4-19.2%, range 0.0-47.8%), depression (12.7%, 95% CI 9.3-17.2%, range 0.6-37.5%), alopecia (11.2%, 95% CI 6.9-17.6%, range 0.0-47.0%) over 3-13.2Ã‚Â months of follow-up. The prevalence of most symptoms reduced afterÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°9Ã‚Â months of follow-up, but fatigue and somnipathy persisted in 26.2% and 15.1%, respectively, of the patients over a year.

"Corowa-kun: A messenger app chatbot delivers COVID-19 vaccine information, Japan 2021","There is a long history in Japan of public concerns about vaccine adverse events. Few studies have assessed how mobile messenger apps affect COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Corowa-kun, a free chatbot, was created on February 6, 2021 in LINE, the most popular messenger app in Japan. Corowa-kun provides instant, automated answers to 70 frequently asked COVID-19 vaccine questions. A cross-sectional survey with 21 questions was performed within Corowa-kun during April 5-12, 2021. A total of 59,676 persons used Corowa-kun during February-April 2021. Of them, 10,192 users (17%) participated in the survey. Median age was 55Ã‚Â years (range 16-97), and most were female (74%). COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy reported by survey respondents decreased from 41% to 20% after using Corowa-kun. Of the 20% who remained hesitant, 16% (1,675) were unsure, and 4% (364) did not intend to be vaccinated. Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy were: age 16-34 (odds ratio [OR]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.7; 95% confidential interval [CI]: 3.0-4.6, compared to ageÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 65), female sex (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.4; Cl: 2.1-2.8), and history of a previous vaccine side-effect (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.5; Cl: 2.2-2.9).

"Impaired serological response to COVID-19 vaccination following anti-cancer therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Owing to high COVID-19-related morbidity and fatality rate among patients with cancer, the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines is of profound significance in this fragile population. Accumulated data suggested that oncologic patients, especially those with anti-cancer therapy have an impaired immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. However, the exact effect of anti-cancer treatments on post-vaccination response has not been elucidated yet. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of treatments on response to COVID-19 vaccination in patients with cancer. A total of 39 studies were finally included comprising 11075 oncologic patients. Overall, we found humoral response was significantly decreased in patients undergoing anti-cancer treatments (OR=2.55, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI:Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.04-3.18) compared with those without active treatment. The seroconversion rates were significantly lower in patients with chemotherapy (OR=3.04, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI:Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.28-4.05), targeted therapy (OR=4.72, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI:Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.18-7.01) and steroid usage (OR=2.19, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI:Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.57-3.07), while there was no significant association between immunotherapy or hormonal therapy and seroconversion after vaccination. Subgroup analyses showed therapies with anti-CD20 antibody (OR=11.28, 95% CI: 6.40-19.90), BCL2i (OR=5.76, 95% CI: 3.64-9.10) and BTKi (OR=6.86, 95% CI: 4.23-11.15) were significantly correlated with the risk of negative humoral response to vaccination. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that specific oncologic therapies may significantly affect serological response to COVID-19 vaccines in patients with cancer. Thus, an adapted vaccination strategy taking the influence of active treatment into account is in need, and further research on the effect of a third dose of vaccine and the role of post-vaccination cellular response in oncologic patients is also needed.

"The School's Suicide Postvention Response","In this chapter, we discuss how Poplar Grove High School responded to suicide losses at the school. Crisis responses focused on suicide losses are often referred to as suicide â€œpostvention,â€ and, when the losses are among youth, schools are a key site of response. Suicide postvention specifically encompasses the activities and organized interventions we undertake to limit suffering as much as possible, promote healing, and prevent additional suicides. Schoolsâ€™ postvention strategies can greatly shape how the loss of a young person impacts the student body. Indeed, if there is any hope of encouraging the help-seeking we know is crucial yet frequently downplayed, schools must preventively establish and continuously revise evidence- and best-practices-based suicide postvention strategies. We begin by discussing why suicide postvention is so difficult for schools â€“ in part because the science and funding is lacking. We by foregrounding youthâ€™s experiences and words during postvention reveal how important it is to acknowledge the pain of suicide loss on a community. We then discuss the critical role of teachers, the structure of crisis counseling on the day of, and how inequalities in response can impact youth.

"Environmental Policy Issues and Public Health Concerns Associated with Rohingya Refugee Population in Bangladesh","Introduction: The Rohingya population in Myanmar has been adversely affected by the Citizenship Act of 1982. This Act opted out of them from the list of recognized ethnic minorities and deprived them of civil rights and public services. As a result, the Myanmar army started a massive cleaning operation in the Rohingya community where thousands of Rohingyas were killed, and 750,000 refugees fled to Bangladesh. The Government of Bangladesh is helping this migrant community to settle in Bangladesh with the support of multiple national and international nonprofit organizations. This paper aims to explain the policy challenges in accommodating the Rohingya refugees from an environmental policy and public health perspective. Methodology: In this study, the researchers collected secondary data from multiple sources, such as journal articles, websites of internationally renowned organizations, and the health record of clinics supported by OBAT Helpers, Inc., a U.S.-based nonprofit, who are providing healthcare services to the Rohingya community living in multiple camps. The collected information is summarized systematically to understand the risks to the environment and health conditions in the Rohingya refugee camps that occurred due to a lacking policy readiness and logistic unpreparedness of the government. These issues are very critical not only for the migrant population but also for the host community. Findings: Approximately 860,175 Rohingya Refugees have been placed in 34 camps located in multiple districts in Bangladesh since 2017. To accommodate this large population in Bangladesh, the government had to cut the forest and fill out water bodies. Therefore, deforestation and building houses near cliff areas cause soil erosion and create risks for marine resources. In these camps, the refugees use fuelwood and kerosene for cooking, which increases particle pollution in the air. The overpopulated camps are having issues with the inexistence of ventilation. In the past couple of years, there were several massive fire incidents where hundreds of houses were burnt, and many people were injured and dead. Besides, building new houses for the refugees sets the local biodiversity at critical risk. The Kutupalong camp blocked the only corridor for the Asian elephants and trapped them in a corner of that area. In this challenging situation, the elephants invade nearby camp areas for food. As a result, 13 people died in a human-elephant conflict. Along with the environmental issues, the health condition in these refugee camps is very critical for different age groups and sex. Unplanned water and sewerage system are also polluting the water bodies which is increasing water-borne diseases in the community. The most common diseases found in these clinics are communicable, such as upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), skin disease, cough and cold, diarrhea, chickenpox, respiratory tract infection, fever, measles/rubella, and sexually transmitted disease, and malnutrition. In the past several decades, the Government of Bangladesh has been successfully working root-level to end chronic diseases, such as diphtheria, polio, whooping cough, tetanus, tuberculosis, chickenpox, and cholera which are crucial not only for the babies but for the community. The healthcare services of OBAT Health clinics have found many cases of these chronic diseases among the Rohingya refugees which may bring new threats to public health situations in Bangladesh. The congested environment of the camps spreads communicable diseases including COVID-19. Besides, thousands of patients in the camps are diagnosed with psychological trauma and gender-based violence in multiple age groups. More healthcare facilities are needed in these camps to provide mental healthcare services and support sexually assaulted victims. Conclusion: The government of Bangladesh and multiple national and international organizations are supporting the Rohingya refugees to live with basic human rights and security in Bangladesh. However, accommodating a large number of Rohingya refugees in a very short time causes multiple environmental issues and public health concerns. Policy readiness and logistic preparedness are necessary to reduce these long-term environmental challenges and public health concerns in the refugee camps and the nearby host communities. Planned zoning of the refugee camps and forestation would minimize the harm to land, water bodies, and biodiversity. Providing renewable or clean energy would help reduce PM pollution in the air quality. In addition to that, health education, awareness for immunization and vaccination, and adequate healthcare facilities for physical and mental healthcare would help to minimize health risks in this community. All these proposed solutions require support for policy intervention at both national and international levels. It will help to minimize the risk of climate change and public health issues globally.","Tahmina Afroz et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01EC-535-188","20220626","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; communicable disease; environmental policy; environmental pollution; government; public health; migrant population; rohingya refugee; noncommunicable disease; climate change; public policy","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-26","",33384,""
