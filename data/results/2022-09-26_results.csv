"Determinants of self-reported health status during COVID-19 lockdown among surveyed Ecuadorian population: a cross sectional study","Objective: To examine the associations of sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors with depression, anxiety, and self-reported health status during the COVID-19 lockdown in Ecuador. We also assessed the differences in these associations between women and men. Design, setting , and participants: We conducted a cross-sectional study of adults living in Ecuador between July and October 2020. All data were collected through an online survey. We ran descriptive and bivariate analyses and fitted sex-stratified multivariate logistic regression models to assess the association between explanatory variables and self-reported health status. Results: 1801 women and 1123 men completed the survey. Their median (IQR) age was 34 (27-44) years, most participants had a university education (84%) and a full-time public or private job (63%); 16% of participants had poor health self-perception. Poor self-perceived health was associated with severe depression, COVID-19 infection, and chronic diseases. For women, and self-employment, having cohabitants requiring care, having COVID-19 and having a chronic disease increased the likelihood of having poor self-reported health status. For men, poor self-reported health status was associated with perceived poor or inadequate housing and depression. Conclusion: Being female, having solely public healthcare system access, perceiving housing conditions as inadequate, living with cohabitants requiring care, perceiving difficulties in coping with work or managing household chores, COVID-19 infection, chronic disease, and depression symptoms were significantly and independently associated with poor self-reported health status in Ecuadorian population.","IvÃ¡n DueÃ±as-EspÃ­n; Constanza Jacques- AviÃ±Ã³; VerÃ³nica Egas-Reyes; Sara Larrea; Ana  LucÃ­a Torres-Castillo; Patricio Trujillo; AndrÃ©s Peralta","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.09.23.22280279","20220925","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-26","",38304,""
"Black sickle cell patients' lives matter: healthcare, long-term shielding and psychological distress during a racialised pandemic in England - a mixed-methods study","To understand the psychological and social impact of shielding on people with sickle cell disorders and their carers in the Midlands region of England. This region was badly affected during the pandemic, with the city of Birmingham having some of the highest rates of COVID-19 deaths. A mixed-methods project with a quantitative survey on shielding and adapted SF36 V.2 questionnaire, which was supplemented by qualitative semistructured interviews analysed using interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA). Fifty-one participants who were predominantly of Black Caribbean or Black African heritage anonymously took part in the online survey. We supplemented this with eight in-depth semistructured interviews with adults with sickle cell disorders using IPA. The adapted 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF36) version 2 (V. 2) survey indicated worse quality of life and mental health. The open-ended questions from the adapted survey also identified shielding concerns about hospital care, pain management and knowledge of sickle cell by healthcare professionals. From the interviews, it emerged that the racialised element of the pandemic caused significant psychological distress for a population group that had to regularly access hospitals. It was noted that psychological health needs both during a pandemic and outside of it were poorly understood and became invisible in services. The psychological impact of experiences of hospital care as well as growing up with an invisible chronic condition were important to understand psychologically.","Berghs, Horne, Yates, Graham, Kemp, Webster, Howson","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057141","20220924","COVID-19; EDUCATION &amp; TRAINING (see Medical Education &amp; Training); ETHICS (see Medical Ethics); HAEMATOLOGY; MENTAL HEALTH","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-26","",38305,""
"Outcomes at least 90 days since onset of myocarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in adolescents and young adults in the USA: a follow-up surveillance study","Data on medium-term outcomes in indivduals with myocarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination are scarce. We aimed to assess clinical outcomes and quality of life at least 90 days since onset of myocarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in adolescents and young adults. In this follow-up surveillance study, we conducted surveys in US individuals aged 12-29 years with myocarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, for whom a report had been filed to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System between Jan 12 and Nov 5, 2021. A two-component survey was administered, one component to patients (or parents or guardians) and one component to health-care providers, to assess patient outcomes at least 90 days since myocarditis onset. Data collected were recovery status, cardiac testing, and functional status, and EuroQol health-related quality-of-life measures (dichotomised as no problems or any problems), and a weighted quality-of-life measure, ranging from 0 to 1 (full health). The EuroQol results were compared with published results in US populations (aged 18-24 years) from before and early on in the COVID-19 pandemic. Between Aug 24, 2021, and Jan 12, 2022, we collected data for 519 (62%) of 836 eligible patients who were at least 90 days post-myocarditis onset: 126 patients via patient survey only, 162 patients via health-care provider survey only, and 231 patients via both surveys. Median patient age was 17 years (IQR 15-22); 457 (88%) patients were male and 61 (12%) were female. 320 (81%) of 393 patients with a health-care provider assessment were considered recovered from myocarditis by their health-care provider, although at the last health-care provider follow-up, 104 (26%) of 393 patients were prescribed daily medication related to myocarditis. Of 249 individuals who completed the quality-of-life portion of the patient survey, four (2%) reported problems with self-care, 13 (5%) with mobility, 49 (20%) with performing usual activities, 74 (30%) with pain, and 114 (46%) with depression. Mean weighted quality-of-life measure (0Ã‚Â·91 [SD 0Ã‚Â·13]) was similar to a pre-pandemic US population value (0Ã‚Â·92 [0Ã‚Â·13]) and significantly higher than an early pandemic US population value (0Ã‚Â·75 [0Ã‚Â·28]; p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001). Most patients had improvements in cardiac diagnostic marker and testing data at follow-up, including normal or back-to-baseline troponin concentrations (181 [91%] of 200 patients with available data), echocardiograms (262 [94%] of 279 patients), electrocardiograms (240 [77%] of 311 patients), exercise stress testing (94 [90%] of 104 patients), and ambulatory rhythm monitoring (86 [90%] of 96 patients). An abnormality was noted among 81 (54%) of 151 patients with follow-up cardiac MRI; however, evidence of myocarditis suggested by the presence of both late gadolinium enhancement and oedema on cardiac MRI was uncommon (20 [13%] of 151 patients). At follow-up, most patients were cleared for all physical activity (268 [68%] of 393 patients). After at least 90 days since onset of myocarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, most individuals in our cohort were considered recovered by health-care providers, and quality of life measures were comparable to those in pre-pandemic and early pandemic populations of a similar age. These findings might not be generalisable given the small sample size and further follow-up is needed for the subset of patients with atypical test results or not considered recovered.

"Poverty, parental work intensity and child emotional and conduct problems","Poverty is known to be associated with poorer child mental wellbeing. Relatedly, the security and quality of employment are reported to affect adult wellbeing. Less is known about how both poverty and parental employment affect children's mental wellbeing. This paper uses nine waves (2005/06-2017/18) of the Growing Up in Scotland (GUS) study to examine how the longitudinal trajectories of poverty and work intensity are associated with the longitudinal trajectories of mental wellbeing in a nationally representative sample of 3994 children (ages 0 to 12). This analysis was conducted via a bivariate multilevel non-linear growth curve model for the widely used Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) subscales of conduct problems and emotional symptoms. Results show that unstable work intensity and poverty trajectories arising from the 2008 financial crisis are associated with substantial changes in the trajectories of conduct and emotional problems, but with key differences between the individual outcomes: increasing work intensity is associated with around a fifth of a standard deviation increase in conduct problems; decreasing work intensity over time is associated with around a fifth of a standard deviation increase in emotional problems; material deprivation is associated with an increase in both conduct and emotional problems, at around a tenth of a standard deviation; and longitudinal income poverty trajectories are associated with up to around a fifth of a standard deviation increase in conduct problems, but not emotional symptoms. These findings are discussed with the purpose of informing policies to tackle the effects of unstable and/or changing socioeconomic circumstances on children's mental health wellbeing in the context of an economic crisis, as well as its implications for the contemporary socioeconomic landscape and the devastating effects expected of the COVID-19 crisis.","Treanor, Troncoso","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115373","20220924","Children's mental health; Conduct problems; Emotional wellbeing; Growing up in Scotland; Growth curve modelling; Multivariate multilevel modelling; Parental work intensity; Poverty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-26","",38307,""
"The potential impact of COVID-19 on women's reproductive and mental health: a questionnaire study","The pandemic has transformed the social and economic certainties of people's lives imposing stay-at-home necessities which began in mid-March 2020. This cross-sectional observational study was performed to study the impact of COVID-19 on the reproductive and mental health of women before and after the pandemic. A digital survey form of 50 questions was developed using the Google platform andshared over 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks in August 2021. Paired <i>t</i>-test was used to compare the variables before and after the COVID-19. Of the 450 respondents, 443(98.44%) completed the questionnaire. There was a significant difference in the average duration of menstruation and the proportion of women with a cycle length of 35-45Ã¢â‚¬â€°days increased from 5 to 8% of women after the pandemic. Painful periods (28.5 to 59.5%, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.002) and weight increased (39.2%, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) after the pandemic. Stress also increased after the pandemic (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). The pandemic has significantly impacted the reproductive and mental health of women. The long-term health significances of this are yet to be determined.Impact Statement<b>What is already known on this subject?</b> The pandemic has transformed the social and economic certainties of people's lives, mainly women. Women's health significantly mental health is affected by the lack of adequate domestic and emotional support which may further consequences like the risk of anxiety and depression.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> Our study shows the effect of COVID-19 on women's reproductive and mental health before and after the pandemic. Inadvertent forfeits women's health and well-being and instabilities in reproductive function as raised pressure causes irregularities in the menstrual cycle.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> Women have suffered from significant mental and reproductive problems during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. But, the long-term effects of these are not unknown.

"CHATogether: a novel digital program to promote Asian American Pacific Islander mental health in response to the COVID-19 pandemic","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, we developed the Compassionate Home, Action Together program, (CHATogether) to support the mental health of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. CHATogether is a culturally informed and virtually delivered support program that harnesses the talents of AAPI teens, young adults, parents, and mental health professionals who share a commitment to serve their local communities. Our objective was to identify the active components, optimal utilization, potential benefits, and pertinent limitations of the CHATogether program during the 3Ã‚Â years since its inception in 2019. By that time, the program had developed six distinct component arms: interactive theater, mental health education, research, peer support and community outreach, collaboration, and AAPI mentorship. To work towards this objective, we conducted a qualitative study using thematic analysis and an inductive approach based on grounded theory (GT), in which we analyzed anonymized transcripts of four focus groups, comprised of 20 program participants (11 females; 9 males). We developed a model of two overarching domains, each with three underlying themes: I. Individual stressors: (1) Family conflict; (2) Cultural identity; and (3) Pandemic impact; and II. Collective stressors: (1) Stigma related to mental health and illness; (2) Pandemic uncertainty; and (3) Xenophobia and societal polarization. Strengths of the CHATogether program include its role as a conduit toward AAPI connectedness and pride as well as purpose in building community. Through support and mentorship, the program cultivates a unique platform that promotes healing and resiliency in response to pandemic stressors and beyond. CHATogether creates a safe space for the AAPI community. Through its methods of storytelling and encouraging creativity, CHATogether facilitates the discussion of challenging topics specific to the AAPI community. Given the national mental health crisis that is further being exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a digital prevention program such as CHATogether holds promise towards providing access to mental health resources and supporting early help-seeking behaviors for individuals in the AAPI community.","Song, Ngo, Vigneron, Lee, Sust, Martin, Yuen","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-022-00508-4","20220923","Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI); Culturally-informed mental health; Qualitative methods; Virtually delivered intervention; and COVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-26","",38309,""
"The longitudinal effects of stress and fear on psychiatric symptoms in mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly difficult for mothers. Women with a history of peripartum depression (PPD) may be vulnerable to relapse. We sought to understand changes in depressive and anxious symptoms throughout the pandemic and which stressors increased symptoms in women with a history of PPD. In June 2020, all US participants with a history of PPD (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12,007) in the global MomGenes Fight PPD study were invited to the COVID-19 follow-up study. Respondents (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2163, 18%) were sent biweekly and then monthly surveys until January 31, 2022. We employed time-varying effects models to evaluate trajectories of depressive (patient health questionnaire, PHQ-9) and anxious (generalized anxiety disorder, GAD-7) symptoms and to estimate longitudinal associations between perceived stress, fears, COVID-19 case rates, and symptoms. Peaks of PHQ-9, GAD-7, PSS, and perceived COVID-19 risk scores corresponded with timing of national COVID-19 case surges. High perceived stress was the strongest predictor of PHQ-9 (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.27; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.48eÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°38) and GAD-7 (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.73; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.19eÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°70). Feeling lack of control and unlikely to survive increased PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores by 2 points. COVID-19 case rates, pandemic restrictions, and region were not independently associated with symptoms. This study suggests that the collective trauma of the pandemic has significantly affected mothers with a history of PPD, exemplified by high levels of perceived stress and the strong association with depressive and anxious symptoms. The next pandemic phase is uncertain, but will continue to influence mental health collectively and dynamically. Interventions must be flexible and responsive and should address fear, trauma, and feelings of control, particularly for mothers with a history of PPD.","Bauer, Guintivano, Krohn, Sullivan, Meltzer-Brody","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00737-022-01265-1","20220923","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Longitudinal; Postpartum; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-26","",38310,""
"Sixteen years on the road: a mobile dental unit for vulnerable communities in Bradford","Introduction As a means of targeting vulnerable populations to offer care outside the traditional clinical setting, mobile clinics exist that permit clinical teams to travel into the community to provide dental care.Aims To highlight some of the inequalities faced by vulnerable populations, to discuss the benefits of a mobile dental unit (MDU) and how it may address some of these inequalities, and to reflect on some of the achievements of the Bradford MDU.Vulnerable populations Vulnerable communities may include the homeless population, those affected by substance misuse, those suffering with mental health problems, asylum seekers, or an amalgamation. Such groups are likely to have lower expectations of healthcare and may not seek help until oral disease is advanced, with a large proportion likely to have already lost their teeth.Bradford MDU The MDU owned by Bradford Community Dental Service is unique in both its longevity of service and populations it serves, and has been providing an outreach dental service to the vulnerable populations of Bradford for the last 16 years. Whilst the COVID-19 pandemic suspended services during the thick of lockdown, the Bradford MDU is slowly re-opening its services, so the care received by these vulnerable populations is no longer compromised.","Marples, Wright","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41415-022-4981-4","20220923","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-26","",38311,""
"A year after COVID-19: its impact on nurses' psychological well-being","Nurses' burnout and psychological well-being are a significant concern during the pandemic. To (i) examine the level of burnout, anxiety, depression, perceived stress and self-rated health for nurses at two time-points, 2020 and 2021; and (ii) examine the socio-demographic characteristics, work-related factors and perceived workplace support factors in relation to the level of burnout. A cross-sectional adopting longitudinal approach. A convenience sample of registered nurses who worked in an acute care tertiary hospital in Singapore were surveyed during two time-points. Participants' health, socio-demographic characteristics, work-related factors and perceived workplace support factors were collected. Among the 179 nurses, there was a significant increase in burnout level, poorer self-rated health and reduced job dedication. A decrease in the percentage of nurses who felt appreciated at work was reported in 2021 (p=0.04). Nurses who felt their team was not working well together were 3.30 times more likely to experience burnout (95% CI 1.12 to 9.69; p=0.03). Nurses who reported that they never felt appreciated by their department/hospital were 8.84 times more likely to experience burnout (95% CI 2.67 to 29.21; p&lt;0.001). Nurses with poorer self-rated health were more likely to report burnout (95% CI: 1.32-6.03; p=0.008). Nurses had an increased experience of burnout, reduced job dedication, and poorer self-rated health after the outbreak. Interventions at the departmental and organizational levels are needed to improve the workplace support. Strategies to support nurses' psychological well-being during the aftermath of COVID-19 are vital to managing nurses' burnout and improving job dedication and self-rated health.","Aloweni, Ayre, Teo, Tan, Lim","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13814","20220923","COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; depression; job dedication; nurses; pandemic; perceived stress; psychological well-being; workplace","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-26","",38312,""
