"Methadone overdoses increased 48% during the COVID-19 epidemic","Background: The United States (US) is in the middle of an opioid overdose epidemic that has spanned over two decades and continues to escalate. Methadone is long-acting full opioid agonist which has been approved to treat opioid use disorder (OUD). Methadone can cause respiratory depression that may result in mortality. The restrictions on methadone availability including take-home dosing were loosened during the COVID-19 pandemic although there have been concerns about the high street value of diverted methadone. This report examined how fatal overdoses involving methadone have changed over the past two-decades including during the pandemic. Methods: The Center for Disease Control and Preventions Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) database, which draws data from death certificates, was used to find the unintentional methadone related overdose death rate from 1999-2020. Unintentional methadone deaths were defined using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD), 10th revision codes: X40-44 with only data which was coded for methadone (T40.3). Data from the Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) on methadone overall use, narcotic treatment programs use, and pain management use was gathered for all states, including the District of Columbia, for 2020 and corrected for population. Results: There have been dynamic changes over the past two-decades in overdoses involving methadone. Overdoses increased from 1999 (0.9/million) to 2007 (15.9) and declined until 2019 (6.5). Overdoses in 2020 (9.6) were 48.1% higher than in 2019 (t(50) = 3.05, p < .005). The correlations between overall methadone use (r(49) = +0.75, p < 0.001), and narcotic treatment program use (r(49) = +0.77, p < 0.001) were positive, strong, and statistically significant. However, methadone use for pain treatment was not associated with overdoses (r(49) = -.08, p = .57). Conclusions: Overdoses involving methadone significantly increased by 48.1% in 2020 relative to 2019. This mortality increase is much larger than the 5.3% elevation in calls involving methadone reported to poison control centers in the year following the March 16, 2020 loosening of methadone take-home regulations. Policy changes that were implemented following the COVID-19 pandemic involving methadone may warrant reconsideration.","Daniel E Kaufman; Amy L Kennalley; Kenneth L McCall; Brian J Piper","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.14.22273870","20220419","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30310,""

"Ã‰tat des connaissances - Organisation des soins et des services pour la prÃ©vention et la prise en charge des affections post-COVID-19","Objectives:Some people who contract severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) experience one or more signs and symptoms that persist for several weeks to several months following infection. Given the number who have contracted the virus, the still-active transmission of the infection, and the impact of these signs and symptoms on quality of life and functional capacities, post-COVID-19 conditions could place additional strain on QuÃ©becâ€™s health-care system. To support its reflection on the offer of services to be recommended to adequately meet these needs, the MinistÃ¨re de la SantÃ© et des Services sociaux asked the Institut national d'excellence en santÃ© et en services sociaux (INESSS) to prepare a state-of-knowledge report on the models of care and service organization currently in use or under development for preventing the persistence of COVID-19 symptoms and managing post-COVID-19 conditions. Conclusions:RESULTS: From the available literature, together with its uncertainties, the contextual information and the consultations, INESSS arrives at the following findings: â€¢ The models that focus on preventing the persistence of COVID-19 symptoms that were found in the literature are intended for individuals who have been hospitalized during the acute phase of the infection and are initiated during the hospital stay or at discharge. They are aimed at preventing the complications associated with the acute phase of the infection and the long-term sequelae. On the other hand, the more general management models that were found are intended for anyone with persistent symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of the infectionâ€™s initial presentation. These models are aimed mainly at reducing persistent symptoms and their impact on the patientâ€™s quality of life. â€¢ The models described in the literature for preventing COVID-19 symptom persistence and managing post-COVID-19 conditions have evolved since the beginning of the pandemic. However, whether focused on symptom persistence prevention or symptom management, these models and those recommended by learned societies and technology assessment agencies have several points in common, such as the need to evaluate the patient, individualized management, the involvement of professionals with different areas of expertise, referring the patient to the appropriate services, and considering at least three areas of intervention, namely, physical health, mental health, functional disabilities or social support. However, there are few data available for assessing the impact of the current models on patients, clinicians and the health-care system. â€¢ In Canada, the organization of care and services for post-COVID-19 conditions varies from province to province. While Ontario seems to focus on integrating the management of patients with functional disabilities directly into the current health-care system, Alberta and British Columbia are relying on a few dedicated post-COVID-19 clinics. In QuÃ©bec, the services available for individuals with post-COVID-19 conditions differ from one facility to another. â€¢ Many of the models identified and described in the literature are based on centralizing the overall evaluation of patients and then referring them to the services that will meet their needs. â€¢ In QuÃ©bec, the services currently available for individuals with a post-COVID condition are focused mainly on rehabilitation. According to the consultations, these services only partially meet their needs, mainly because the capacity of these services falls short of the demand and the areas of intervention do not cover all the aspects of post-COVID-19 conditions, and because of the lack of knowledge about these conditions and the difficulty or time it takes to access a health professional with expertise in rehabilitation, mental health or social support. Some of the other issues raised were staff shortages, the connections between the levels of care and services, the required consult time, and regional differences in demand volume and resource availability. â€¢ Various strategies for optimizing the management of Quebecers with post-COVID conditions were brought up, including addressing the issues mentioned above and providing financial support. In addition, according to the stakeholders consulted, it would be desirable if the government drafted clear guidelines to facilitate the organization of care and services in the different health and social services regions. â€¢ Equity of access to care and services for individuals with complex conditions unrelated to COVID-19 and the costs associated with a new offer of care and services raise some concerns and merit consideration when putting it together. â€¢ According to the stakeholders consulted, setting up a certain number of dedicated clinics would help meet the needs of persons with a post-COVID-19 condition. If this is done, these clinics should be able to rely on professionals with expertise in the different intervention areas mentioned above and be integrated into a defined care and services pathway. In addition, they should be supported by a strong front line, in other words, one that is equipped, trained and supported. CONCLUSION: Current knowledge about the optimal models of care and service organization for individuals with post-COVID-19 conditions is limited. However, the assessment of all the information found has revealed certain components common to the models in place in other jurisdictions, certain weaknesses in the current offer of services, elements that might be applicable and relevant to QuÃ©bec practice, and issues that need to be considered. This information will be used to guide reflection on the organization of care and services in QuÃ©bec for the prevention of COVID-19 symptoms and the management of post-COVID-19 conditions. INESSS will take into account the information presented in this report, particularly the needs and expectations of QuÃ©bec clinicians and patients, when updating its support tool for the clinical management of individuals with a post-COVID-19 condition. Methods:We conducted a systematic review of publications containing scientific and nonscientific data, information, positions and clinical recommendations from the literature on models of care and service organization for preventing the persistence of COVID-19 symptoms and managing post-COVID-19 conditions. Contextual information was also collected from the websites of Canadian governmental and paragovernmental bodies. To gather information on the organization of services in QuÃ©bec, those in charge of institutions, regional departments of general medicine and specific post-COVID-19 services in the health and social services system were invited to complete a questionnaire designed to identify service organization initiatives in progress or in preparation, and the issues and needs perceived by the system's different sectors. All of the results of the information gathering from the literature were discussed with a committee consisting of representatives from various professional bodies, clinicians with different types of expertise, and two individuals with a post-COVID-19 condition.","Morrow, G.","https://www.inesss.qc.ca/covid-19/affections-post-covid-19-covid-19-longue/organisation-des-soins-et-des-services-pour-la-prevention-et-la-prise-en-charge-des-affections-post-covid-19.html","","Database: International HTA Database; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication type: non-conventional","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30318,""
"Post-COVID-19 condition: a condition-level review","Objectives:Post-COVID-19 condition, also referred to as long COVID or post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC), among other names, is a condition characterized by new or persisting symptoms beyond the acute phase of the disease (e.g., for more than 4 or 12 weeks following an initial COVID-19 infection, clinical definition pending). People with post-COVID-19 may experience a range of heterogenous symptoms including fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and cognitive and mental health challenges. Although the clinical pathophysiology of the condition is not yet well-defined, it is increasingly being recognized that is affects multiple organs and may have severe impacts to a personâ€™s well-being and quality of life. CADTH, in consultation with its customers, is undertaking a Condition Level Review on post-COVID-19. A Condition Level Review is an assessment of the evidence on a range of health technologies and emerging issues on all aspects of the condition, including prevention, identification, treatment, and management.","CADTH","https://www.google.com/search?q=Post-COVID-19+condition:+a+condition-level+review","","Database: International HTA Database; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication type: non-conventional","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30319,""
"Ã‰tat des connaissances - Pratiques visant Ã  mesurer ou rÃ©duire les symptÃ´mes psychologiques des personnes qui prÃ©sentent une affection post-COVID-19","Objectives:The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, where the infection can be asymptomatic or result in coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19), was declared an international public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. The prolonged pandemic and health measures aimed at reducing its spread are having different economic, social, health and psychological consequences for the entire population. Beyond the general population, those infected with the virus are more likely to experience a range of effects on their physical and psychological health. The MinistÃ¨re de la SantÃ© et des Services sociaux (MSSS) therefore asked the Institut national d'excellence en santÃ© et en services sociaux (INESSS) to produce a state-of knowledge report on screening tools for psychological symptoms, the best nonpharmacological practices for reducing such symptoms, and the practices to be avoided in individuals with a post-COVID-19 condition. Conclusions:RESULTS: With regards to tools for screening and monitoring psychological symptoms, no scientific studies were found that present validated tools for individuals with a post-COVID-19 condition or, more broadly, for individuals in the acute phase of COVID-19. However, five clinical practice guidelines on post-COVID-19 conditions present various tools which could be relevant with such clientele, including tools commonly used to screen for anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress. There is also a consensus among the experts consulted to the effect that psychological symptoms should be screened and monitored in individuals with a post-COVID-19 condition, the same way as physical and cognitive symptoms. However, these experts are faced with the absence of specific screening and monitoring tools for psychological symptoms in this particular patient population and the lack of psychosocial professionals with the necessary skills to manage them. No scientific studies on nonpharmacological practices for reducing psychological symptoms in individuals with a post-COVID-19 condition were found. However, six scientific studies on the effectiveness of practices to reduce psychological symptoms of individuals in the acute phase of COVID-19 were considered. Among these studies, eleven nonpharmacological practices aiming to reduce psychological symptoms of individuals in the acute phase of COVID-19 were evaluated. When described, these practices are based mainly on 1) the cognitive-behavioural approach, 2) relaxation/meditation activities, and 3) individual psychological care. These practices can be self-administered or carried out by different professionals (a physician, nurse or psychologist). They are generally provided over a brief period of time, and the sessions are short. In general, the use of practices aimed at reducing anxiety symptoms or depressive symptoms seems to be effective for individuals in the acute phase of the infection. However, with the current state of scientific knowledge, we are unable to rule on the effectiveness of practices for reducing posttraumatic stress symptoms in individuals in the acute phase of infection. Moreover, three clinical practice guidelines recommend providing psychological support, as needed, at all stages of the follow-up for post-COVID-19 conditions. The clinical practice guidelines also recommend that psychological services for symptoms of anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress be provided to individuals with a post-COVID-19 condition and moderate to severe psychological symptoms. No publication has reported practices to avoid in the management of psychological symptoms in persons with a postCOVID-19 condition. CONCLUSION: With the current absence of scientific studies specific to individuals with a post-COVID-19 condition, the findings of this report are based on the literature more broadly concerning people infected with COVID-19 to identify screening and monitoring tools for psychological symptoms and nonpharmacological practices for reducing them. Therefore, the work done in this state-of-knowledge report does not allow to rule on the generalizability of the findings to individuals with a post-COVID-19 condition. It should also be noted that little information on the management of psychological symptoms is currently presented in the clinical practice guidelines on post-COVID-19 conditions. As well, the analysis of the perspectives shared by psychosocial and medical experts during consultations makes it possible to document issues relating to the management of psychological symptoms in individuals with a post-COVID-19 condition. However, these consultations do not allow to claim the saturation of the perspectives. Despite certain limitations, this state-of-knowledge reports is a source of information for health and social services network personnel about the screening and monitoring tools and nonpharmacological practices currently in use, and about the issues encountered by stakeholders. Unfortunately, the knowledge from the literature and the consultations is limited, which makes it difficult to recommend tools and practices for managing psychological symptoms associated with post-COVID-19 conditions. Beyond the scientific monitoring for new publications on the subject, further work is needed to determine whether certain tools and practices for individuals with common mental disorders or chronic illnesses could be adapted and used to meet the needs of those with a post-COVID-19 condition. Methods:A synthesis of the available scientific and experiential knowledge was conducted through 1) a literature review (scientific articles and clinical practice guidelines) and 2) consultations with nine medical and psychosocial experts involved with individuals with a post-COVID-19 condition.","Boisvert, I.; Bujold, M.; Saury, S.","https://www.inesss.qc.ca/covid-19/affections-post-covid-19-covid-19-longue/pratiques-visant-a-mesurer-ou-reduire-les-symptomes-psychologiques-des-personnes-qui-presentent-une-affection-post-covid-19.html","","Database: International HTA Database; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication type: non-conventional","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30320,""
"Influence of physical activity on well-being at times of the COVID-19 pandemic: a review Einfluss kÃ¶rperlicher AktivitÃ¤t auf das Wohlbefinden zu Zeiten der COVID-19-Pandemie: eine &Uuml;bersichtsarbeit","Background Physical activity (PA) has been shown to be advantageous to one's health. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown measures have reportedly led to substantial decrease of PA and to drastic reduction of well-being (WB). In light of this, the purpose of this review was to assess the impact of PA on WB during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods In May 2021, Literature search was conducted in Pubmed/Medline. The eligible publication period was one year from the search date. Results Synthesis of results from eight publications reporting on data from around 100 countries showed that PA positively influences diverse dimensions of the multivariate construct of WB, all of them relating to mental health. Young adults and women showed lowest PA concomitant with lowest self-reported WB. Conclusions Reduced PA levels resulted in lower WB levels, which might have a negative impact on mental health. Forthcoming, initiatives will be needed to facilitate PA â€“ ideally whilst promoting joy of moving â€“ in consideration of pandemic circumstances. By this means it will be possible to effectively promote WB and to prevent arising mental health issues. The current findings are fundamental to develop suitable approaches to improve PA in pandemic situations.","Symanzik, Cara, Hagel, Clara, Hotfiel, Thilo, Engelhardt, Martin, John, Swen Malte, Grim, Casper","https://www.google.com/search?q=Influence+of+physical+activity+on+well-being+at+times+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic:+a+review+Einfluss+kÃ¶rperlicher+AktivitÃ¤t+auf+das+Wohlbefinden+zu+Zeiten+der+COVID-19-Pandemie:+eine+&Uuml;bersichtsarbeit","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sports Orthopaedics and Traumatology;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30321,""
"PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND VACCINE NATIONALISM: IMPLICATIONS FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA","The study examined the literature on Psychological and Social Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic and Vaccine Nationalism: Implications for Psychological Services in Sub-Saharan Africa. The researchers used secondary data and mixed method of data collection for the study. On line searching tools, including: African Journals Online, PsycINFO, African Index Medicus, Eastern Mediterranean Index Medicus, PubMed, and Web of Knowledge were used to search for the data used for the study. The results indicated that, the most exposed and vulnerable groups, including: children, college students, health workers, and other frontline professionals, are more likely to develop psychological symptoms, including: post-traumatic stress disorders, anxiety, depression, and other symptoms of distress. Furthermore, the results showed that, the pharmacological and non-pharmacological protocols, put in place to checkmate the Covid-19 pandemic, including: physical and social distancing, travel restrictions, hand washing and sanitizer, wearing of face mask, coughing under a curved elbow and other security measures have impacted people's psychological well-being and interpersonal relationships, as well as their perception of empathy toward others. Also, covid19 and vaccine nationalism have implications on how psychologists and other health care workers manage the pandemic. Psychologists and other frontline health workers have shifted from more traditional-conventional methods of interventions to unconventional methods, using technologies. In doing so, telepsychology and other technological devices assume very important roles in combatting psychological and social impacts of covid-19 pandemic and vaccine nationalism. Findings indicates that, the use of technologies have proved to be very effective, because both clients and health professionals can still participates in scheduled therapeutic sessions unhindered using online technological tools. In doing so, technologies have improve the professionals' psychological interventions and social support skills during the pandemic. Also, technologies have made it possible for psychologists and other health professionals to meet clients' needs working from home or from the workplace, thereby saving money and time and maintaining the interpersonal relationship between therapists and clients. Therefore, it was concluded that, the use of technologies by health professionals should continue even after the pandemic.","Shammah, Monday L.

"Psychological Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic in Cancer Patients on Active Treatment (preprint)","We aimed to determine psychological conditions of cancer patients and to shed light on establishment of early psychological intervention and intervention policies by making specific recommendations. We consecutively evaluated 385 cancer patients under treatment. Post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD) symptoms, depression, anxiety, stress, and associated sociodemographic/clinical characteristics was investigated. We applied depression-anxiety-stress-scale-21 (DASS-21) for mental states, Impact of Event-Scale-Revised (IES-R) for psychological effects of Covid-19. The mean age was 58(18-88). 47.2% were psychologically distressful per DASS-21, 39.3% were traumatic per IES-R scores. 71.9% stated risk of getting COVID-19 was high since they had cancer, 82% stated serious complications would develop if they had COVID-19 infection. Patients diagnosed more than one-year were more stressed, anxious, and depressive. Singles were more stressed, depressed, and traumatized than couples. In multivariate analysis, a significant correlation with being under psychiatric treatment before pandemic was found for depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Having relatives who died or received treatment for COVID-19 and being unmarried predicts PTSD development. When psychological effects of COVID-19 pandemic are manifesting strongly, cancer patients' anxiety and exposure levels are high.

"The effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on mental health care use in South Africa: an interrupted time series analysis (preprint)","Aims:  In March 2020, South Africa introduced a lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, entailing the suspension of all non-essential activities and a complete ban of tobacco and alcohol sales. We studied the effect of the lockdown on mental health care utilisation rates in private-sector care in South Africa. Methods We did an interrupted time series analysis using insurance claims from January 1, 2017, to June 1, 2020 of beneficiaries 18 years or older from a large private sector medical aid scheme. We calculated weekly outpatient consultation and hospital admission rates for organic mental disorders, substance use disorders, serious mental disorders, depression, anxiety, other mental disorders, any mental disorder, and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (OR) for the effect of the lockdown on weekly outpatient consultation and hospital admission rates and the weekly change in rates during the lockdown until June 1, 2020. Results 710,367 persons were followed up for a median of 153 weeks. Hospital admission rates (OR 0.38;95% CI 0.33-0.44) and outpatient consultation rates (OR 0.74;95% CI 0.63-0.87) for any mental disorder decreased substantially after the lockdown and did not recover to pre-lockdown levels until June 1, 2020. Health care utilisation rates for alcohol withdrawal syndrome doubled after the introduction of the lockdown, but the statistical uncertainty around the estimates was large (OR 2.24;95% CI 0.69-7.24). Conclusions Reduced mental health care contact rates during the COVID-19 lockdown likely reflect a substantial unmet need for mental health services with potential long-term consequences for mental health patients and their families. Steps to ensure access and continuity of mental health services during future lockdowns should be considered.","Wettstein, Anja Elisabeth, Tlali, Mpho, Joska, John, Cornell, Morna, Skrivankova, Veronika, Seedat, Soraya, Mouton, Johannes, van den Heuvel, Leigh, Maxwell, Nicola, Davies, Mary-Ann, Maartens, Gary, Egger, Matthias, Haas, Andreas","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.07.22273561","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30329,""
"Mental health and associated factors for Vietnamese migrants in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic: A comparative analysis on resident status (preprint)","Background:  The ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had wide-ranging health and socio-economic effects on the global population. This impact, however, is not uniform across all sections of the population. It has been observed that migrants to other countries, who relocate from their home countries for better living conditions, are more vulnerable to such disruptions than the general population. This study attempts to assess the health and economic challenges faced by Vietnamese migrants living in Japan. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of 589 Vietnamese residents in Japan using a self-administered questionnaire that included a 20-item tool from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies â€“ Depression Scale (CES-D) as well as questions related to the pandemic and socio-demographic information. We examined to what extent and how, (1) pandemic-related risk factors such as COVID-19 infection, access to health care, job and food insecurity;(2) socio-demographic factors such as age, gender, length of stay, language proficiency;and (3) protective factors such as perceived social support, were associated with mental health outcomes. We also investigated who were more vulnerable among this group of migrants. Results The results showed that nearly half the participants had depressive symptoms higher than the general population in Japan. Students reported a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms (47.6%, 16.9 Â± 9.0) than those with other resident statuses. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that more severe depressive symptoms were associated with self-perceived poor health conditions, and difficulties in accessing health facilities. Perceived social support, however, was observed to be a protective factor against depression. Conclusions Although measures are taken to protect people from COVID-19, it has created depression and uncertainty among the Vietnamese migrants, which needs to be addressed immediately. Findings from this study can guide efforts to build more effective public health approaches to reduce the burden of mental health among vulnerable populations within Japan and globally.","Thi, Hue Tran, Kitajima, Tsutomu, Takeshi, Sawada, Hiroko, Miyakubi","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1552849/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30330,""
"Exploring psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 mandates in children with and without autism spectrum disorder (preprint)","Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are particularly at risk for adverse psychosocial consequences as a result of unexpected challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic. These children experience a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety, difficulties with cognitive flexibility, and a reduction in support services during the pandemic. Higher executive function (EF) has been previously found to be protective against negative mental health outcomes. Here we probed the psychosocial impacts of pandemic responses in children with ASD by relating pre-pandemic (EF) measures with mental health outcomes measured several months into the pandemic. We found that pre-existing inhibition and shift difficulties measured by the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function predicted higher risk of anxiety symptoms, with shift difficulties also predicting elevated depressive symptoms during the pandemic. These findings are critical for promoting community recovery and maximizing clinical preparedness to support children at increased risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes.","Romero, Celia, Kupis, Lauren, Goodman, Zachary, Dirks, Bryce, Baez, Adriana, Beaumont, Amy, Cardona, Sandra, Parlade, Meaghan, Alessandri, Michael, Nomi, Jason, Perry, Lynn, Uddin, Lucina","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/rc8y9","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30331,""

Methods Five electronic databases were searched using search terms on deaths of despair and COVID-19. Results The review of 70 publications included indicates that there is no change or a decline in the suicide rate during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. Drug-related deaths such as overdose deaths and liver diseases, however, have been increased compared to the pre-pandemic rate. Findings are mainly from middle-high- and high-income countries and data from low-income countries are lacking. Synthesis of data from subgroup analysis indicates that some groups such as Black people, women and younger age groups would be more vulnerable to socioeconomic disruption during the pandemic. Conclusion Studies included in this review were preliminary and suffered from methodological limitations such as lack of inferential analysis or using provisional data.

"Outpatient and Home Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program Post COVID-19: A study protocol for clinical trial (preprint)","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a widespread, highly contagious inflammatory process that causes respiratory, physical and psychological dysfunction. COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system and evolves in the acute phase from mild cases with common symptoms, such as fever, cough, and fatigue, to the moderate-to-severe form, causing massive alveolar damage resulting in dyspnea and hypoxemia that can rapidly progress to pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The acute form usually causes severe pulmonary sequelae such as pulmonary fibrosis or progression to organ failure, leading to worsening metabolic dysfunction and/or death. Purpose To verify the effects of an outpatient and home pulmonary rehabilitation program (PRP) on clinical symptoms, pulmonary function, physical activity level, functional status, autonomic activity, peripheral muscle strength, static and functional balance, functional mobility, anxiety and depression, post-traumatic stress, health-related quality of life, and survival of patients with sequelae from COVID-19. Methods This study will be a cohort, parallel, two-arm multicentric study, to be carried out in three clinical centers, with blind evaluation, with 06 weeks of training and follow-up. This study was designed according to the recommendations of the CONSORT statement. To be involved in this clinical study, according to the inclusion criteria, women and men aged between 16 and 75 years affected by COVID-19. The proposed PRP is based on the guidelines recommended by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease and, consists of a combination of aerobic and muscle strengthening exercises, lasting six weeks, with a frequency of three times a week. Discussion In patients infected with COVID-19 with persistent symptoms and sequelae, PRP mainly seeks to improve dyspnea, relieve anxiety and depression, prevent, and reduce complications and/or dysfunctions, reduce morbidity and mortality, and improve health-related quality of life.

"Spine fractures caused by suicide jumping and the influence of COVID pandemic (preprint)","Background:  . Suicide is a major problem worldwide, and jumping from a height is a common suicide method in Europe and Germany. This method primarily results in severe spinal fractures. As a maximum-care hospital in Berlin, we observed an increase in severe spine fractures due to suicidal jumping. Objective:  To describe the characteristics of these fractures in suicidal jumpers compared to non-suicidal individuals and analyse their association with the COVID-pandemic. Method:  . We extracted the chart data of patients who suffered severe spine fractures (from thoracic vertebra 1 to lumbar vertebra 5) due to trauma and who were treated surgically in our centre between 01 January 2015 and 31 May 2021. Results: . Seventy-one patients were included in the study. Suicidal jumpers were about 11 years younger (p = 0.008) and more likely to be female (relative risk= 1.3, p = 0.47). The two groups differed in their initial haemoglobin values (mean difference= two g/dl, p &lt;0.001). The lumbar region was twice as affected in suicidal jumpers (p = 0.02). Before the COVID-lockdown within 63 months, there were 19 suicide cases and 38 non-suicidal cases. After COVID-lockdown within 14 months, 11 suicidal cases vs only three non-suicides resulted in a ratio of 2.57 (p-value&lt;0.001). There were no significant differences in radiological and clinical outcomes. Conclusions:  . Spine fractures in suicide jumpers differ from those in non-suicide jumpers in terms of age, initial haemoglobin level, and spine region. These fractures have increased significantly in Berlin since the COVID lockdown. Surgical treatment of these fractures provided the same results in both groups.","Mulhem, Ali, Hammersen, Stefanie, Omran, Ziad, Alsuliman, Abdul Masik, Moskopp, Dag","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1527187/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30334,""
"Exploring the trajectory and correlates of social isolation for veterans across a 6-month period during COVID-19 (preprint)","Social isolation is a relevant problem for veterans who are at risk for disengaging from others as a function of transition stress from military life to civilian life, and given high rates of exposure to trauma and psychological distress. Few researchers have examined social isolation in veterans over time, particularly during COVID-19 that led to significant barriers and restrictions on social interactions. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to assess veteransâ€™ experience of social isolation and its mental health and social functioning correlates during a 6-month period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 188 United States veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, who completed a total of four assessments: one every two months for a total duration of six months. Surveys included measures of global mental health and social functioning as indicated by perceived emotional support, quality of marriage, and couple satisfaction. Multilevel modeling was used to assess 1) growth models to determine whether social isolation changed over time and the trajectory of that change (i.e., linear or quadratic);and 2) whether social isolation was related to both concurrent and prospective indicators of mental health and social functioning. All analyses included person mean centered and grand mean centered isolation to assess for within-and between-person effects. Veterans reported a quadratic trajectory in social isolation that decreased slightly and stabilized over time. Findings indicate that higher social isolation, at both the within- and between-person level, was negatively associated with concurrent emotional support, mental health, quality of marriage, and couple satisfaction. However, all prospective effects were nonsignificant at the within-person level. Results suggest although isolation may decrease over time, veterans report worse mental health and social functioning during times when they report higher levels of social isolation compared to themselves and others. Future work is needed to determine if interventions can be applied during those times to prevent or target those negative associations.","McGuire, Adam, Elmore, Colby, Szabo, Yvette, Kurz, Solomon, Mendoza, Corina, Umucu, Emre, Creech, Suzannah","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/xf3zb","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30335,""
"Influencing factors of humanistic care ability and its dimensions among mental health workers: an online cross-sectional study (preprint)","Background:  In psychiatric services, humanistic care ability significantly affects the quality of therapeutic relationship and thus affects therapeutic outcomes of patients. Mental health workers may face more obstacles in humanistic care during the COVID-19 pandemic, we aimed to explore the level of humanistic care ability among mental health workers and its potential influencing factors. Method:  (s) An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 262 mental health workers working in Chongqing, China, from December 2020 to January 2021. Data were collected by the Caring Ability Inventory (CAI), the Psychological Capital Questionnaire (PCQ-24) and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised, Short Scale for Chinese (EPQ-RSC). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the influencing factors of humanistic care ability. Results:  Mental health workersâ€™ humanistic care ability was at a low level, with a score of 186.47 Â± 21.34. Psychological capital was positively associated with humanistic care ability (ÃŸ[95%CI] = 0.411 [0.464, 0.772], p&lt;0.001) and its two dimensions (cognition: ÃŸ[95%CI] = 0.514 [0.304, 0.465], p&lt;0.001;patience: ÃŸ[95%CI] = 0.478 [0.171, 0.283], p&lt;0.001). Psychoticism was negatively associated with humanistic care ability (ÃŸ[95%CI] = -0.277 [-5.179, -2.513], p&lt;0.001) and its three dimensions (cognition: ÃŸ[95%CI] = -0.124 [-1.567, -0.165], p&lt;0.05;courage: ÃŸ[95%CI] = -0.166 [-1.698, -0.316], p&lt;0.01;patience: ÃŸ[95%CI] = -0.185 [-1.330, -0.358], p&lt;0.01). Extroversion was positively associated with humanistic care ability (ÃŸ[95%CI] = 0.189 [0.686, 2.080], p&lt;0.001) and its two dimensions (cognition: ÃŸ[95%CI] = 0.188 [0.323, 1.051], p&lt;0.001;courage: ÃŸ[95%CI] = 0.268 [0.496, 1.230], p&lt;0.001). Neuroticism was negatively associated with humanistic care ability (ÃŸ[95%CI] = -0.130[-1.366, -0.193], p&lt;0.01) and its one dimension (courage: ÃŸ[95%CI] = -0.252 [-0.977, -0.352], p&lt;0.001). Conclusion:  (s) Research has found that the humanistic care ability of mental health workers is at a low level, and psychological capital and personality traits are significant factors influencing the humanistic care ability and its sub-dimensions. Interventions to improve psychological capital of mental health workers or to promote the change of personality traits that they want are recommended, thereby promoting humanistic practice.","Liu, Xiaolin, Zhu, Hongjin","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1545299/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30336,""
"Assessment of Canadian perinatal mental health services from the perspective of providers: Where can we improve? (preprint)","Purpose: Perinatal mental health disorders are common, and rates have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear where providers may improve perinatal mental health care, particularly in countries lacking national guidelines, such as Canada. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of perinatal health providers was conducted to describe the landscape of perinatal mental health knowledge, screening, and treatment practices across Canada. Providers were recruited through listservs, social media, and snowball sampling. Participants completed an online survey that assessed their perinatal mental health training, service provision types, their patient wait times, and treatment barriers, and COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts. Results: A total of 435 providers completed the survey, including physicians, midwives, psychologists, social workers, nurses, and allied non-mental health professionals. Most (87.0%) did not have workplace mandated screening for perinatal mental illness but a third (66%) use a validated screening tool. Many (42%) providers stated their patients needed to wait more than 2 months for services. More than half (57.3%) reported they did not receive or were unsure if they received specialized training in perinatal mental health. Most (87.0%) indicated there were cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers to accessing services. Over two-thirds (69.0%) reported the COVID-19 pandemic reduced access to services. Conclusions: Survey findings reveal significant gaps in training, screening tool use, and timely and culturally safe treatment of perinatal mental health concerns. There is critical need for coordinated and nationally mandated perinatal mental health services in Canada to improve care for pregnant and postpartum people.","Hicks, Laurel, Ou, Christine, Charlebois, Jaime, Tarasoff, Lesley, Pawluski, Jodi, Roos, Leslie, Hooykaas, Amanda, Fairbrother, Nichole, Carter, Michelle, Tomfohr-Madsen, Lianne","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/cgy8b","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30337,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health of Children: A Longitudinal Survey in the ABCD Study Cohort (preprint)","A large longitudinal study on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in children is limited. This large-scale longitudinal observational study examines the pandemicâ€™s effects on childrenâ€™s mental health while considering the effects of parental care styles. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study is a large-scale, longitudinal multicenter study in the United States. Of the 11,875 children aged 9â€“12 years in its database, 4,885 subjects were selected for this study. The child behavior checklist and parental monitoring questionnaire (PMQ) were used to assess childrenâ€™s mental health and parental support styles, respectively.

Withdrawn/depressed and attention problems significantly worsened during compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic (p &lt; 0.001, Withdrawn/depressed;53.4 Â± 5.7 to 53.7 Â± 5.9, attention problems;53.4 Â± 5.4 to 53.6 Â± 5.6). Simple slope analysis found withdrawn/depressed problems worsened when the PMQ was 1 SD below the mean, and rule-breaking behavior was improved when the PMQ was 1 SD above the mean. While the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated childrenâ€™s depressive symptoms and attention issues, the effects may be minor. Additionally, parental involvement behaviors serve as a protective factor for the childâ€™s mental health even during the pandemic.","Hamatani, Sayo, Hiraoka, Daiki, Makita, Kai, Tomoda, Akemi, Mizuno, Yoshifumi","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1503720/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30338,""
"Examining the Role of Community Resilience and Social Capital on Mental Health in Public Health Emergency and Disaster Response: A Scoping Review (preprint)","The ability of the public to remain psychologically resilient in the face of public health emergencies and disasters (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) is a key factor in the effectiveness of a national response to such events. Community resilience and social capital are often perceived as beneficial and ensuring that a community is socially and psychologically resilient may aid emergency response and recovery. This review presents a synthesis of literature which answers the following research questions: How are community resilience and social capital quantified in research?;What is the impact of community resilience on mental wellbeing?;What is the impact of infectious disease outbreaks, disasters and emergencies on community resilience and social capital?;and, What types of interventions enhance community resilience and social capital? A scoping review procedure was followed. Searches were run across Medline, PsycInfo, and EMBASE, with search terms covering community resilience or social capital, public health emergencies, and mental health. 26 papers met the inclusion criteria. The majority of retained papers originated in the USA, used a survey methodology to collect data, and involved a natural disaster. There was no common method of measuring community resilience or social capital. The association between community resilience and social capital with mental health was regarded as positive in most cases. However, we found that community resilience, and social capital, were initially negatively impacted by public health emergencies and enhanced by social group activities. Several key recommendations are proposed based on the outcomes from the review, which include: the need for a standardised and validated approach to measuring community resilience or social capital;that there should be enhanced effort to improve preparedness to public health emergencies in communities by gauging current levels of community resilience and social capital;that community resilience and social capital should be bolstered if areas are at risk of disasters or public health emergencies;the need to ensure that suitable short-term support is provided to communities with high resilience in the immediate aftermath of a public health emergency or disaster;the importance of conducting robust evaluation of community resilience initiatives deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hall, Charlotte, Wehling, Helena, Stansfield, Jude, South, Jane, Brooks, Samantha, Greenberg, Neil, AmlÃ´t, Richard, Weston, Dale","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1521540/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30339,""
"Using What We Know About Threat Reactivity Models to Understand Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by unprecedented levels of stress and threats in a variety of domains (e.g., health, livelihood). Individual differences in threat reactivity may explain why some individuals are at elevated risk for the development or maintenance of psychopathology during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article describes several prominent models, mechanisms, and components of threat reactivity (e.g., appraisals, intolerance of uncertainty, avoidance) and discusses how they might help improve understanding of changes in psychopathology during and following the COVID-19 pandemic.","Funkhouser, Carter","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/cvzr9","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30340,""
"The Effects of Daily Autobiographical Memory Training on Memory Bias, Mood and Stress Resilience in Dysphoric Individuals (preprint)","Negative memory bias refers to the enhanced recall of negative memories and is a prominent cognitive factor causing and maintaining depression. Surprisingly few studies modify this negative recall. The current study used a smartphone-based autobiographical memory training to increase positive memory recall and thereby alter negative memory bias. A total of 96 dysphoric (= 13 BDI-II) participants were randomly allocated to a positive, sham or no-training condition, conducted over a period of six days. Positive memory bias (i.e., recalled event evaluation) significantly increased from pre- to post-training after positive and sham intervention, suggesting an unspecific training effect. No transfer to memory specificity, implicit memory bias or depressive symptoms was found, nor was the training effect modulated by pre-existing level of positive memory bias. A post-hoc follow-up measurement during the initial COVID-19 crisis revealed that subjects who benefitted most from either of the trainings maintained their stress levels better during a natural stressful period, compared to those who responded least to the training. Future studies should carefully consider the impact of sham training design. Moreover, it is important to examine transfer effects of bias training as practice in daily life.","Bovy, Leonore, Ikani, Nessa, Kraats, Livia N.

"THEMIS: A Framework for Cost-Benefit Analysis of COVID-19 Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (preprint)","Since December 2019, the world has been ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 150 million confirmed cases and 3 million confirmed deaths worldwide. To combat the spread of COVID-19, governments have issued unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), ranging from mass gathering restrictions to complete lockdowns. Despite their proven effectiveness in reducing virus transmission, the policies often carry significant economic and humanitarian cost, ranging from unemployment to depression, PTSD, and anxiety. In this paper, we create a data-driven system dynamics framework, THEMIS, that allows us to compare the costs and benefits of a large class of NPIs in any geographical region across different cost dimensions. As a demonstration, we analyzed thousands of alternative policies across 5 countries (United States, Germany, Brazil, Singapore, Spain) and compared with the actual implemented policy. Our results show that moderate NPIs (such as restrictions on mass gatherings) usually produce the worst results, incurring significant cost while unable to sufficiently slow down the pandemic to prevent the virus from becoming endemic. Short but severe restrictions (complete lockdown for 4-5 weeks) generally produced the best results for developed countries, but only if the speed of reopening is slow enough to prevent a resurgence. Developing countries exhibited very different trade-off profiles from developed countries, and suggests that severe NPIs such as lockdowns might not be as suitable for developing countries in general.","Bertsimas, Dimitris, Li, Michael Lingzhi, Soni, Saksham","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.09.22273656","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30342,""
"Implementation of a pharmacy residency resiliency program for PGY1 and PGY2 residents: Program structure and resident perceptions","In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. To describe the implementation of a pharmacy residency resiliency program (PRRP) for postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) and postgraduate year 2 (PGY2) pharmacy residents, including program structure, strengths and weaknesses/limitations, resident perceptions as captured by a postprogram survey, generalizability to other institutions, and opportunities for future directions. Pharmacy residents face significant pressure, workload, and stressors that put them at risk for burnout and depression. While resiliency has been a major area of focus to help combat these risks for healthcare professionals, little has been published regarding formal, structured resiliency training in pharmacy, especially in pharmacy residency programs. American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) residency standards recommend that programs consider education related to burnout prevention and that mitigation strategies be provided to residents and other pharmacy personnel, but no formal pharmacy-specific programs or strategies have been established. We implemented a 12-month PRRP for PGY1 and PGY2 pharmacy residents and conducted a postprogram survey to assess resident perceptions and to identify areas for growth. Implementation of a PRRP was feasible and could be replicated at other institutions. Residents in our program reported a high level of satisfaction, skills gained, and positive attributes of the addition of the PRRP. Some notable factors contributing to success included the program's longitudinal nature, use of a nonpharmacy facilitator, and impactful content from an established resiliency skills curriculum.","Kneuss, Wolff, Meadors, Reynolds, Hammer","https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxac113","20220419","burnout; pharmacy; residency; resiliency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30343,""
"Microgliosis and neuronal proteinopathy in brain persist beyond viral clearance in SARS-CoV-2 hamster model","Neurological symptoms such as cognitive decline and depression contribute substantially to post-COVID-19 syndrome, defined as lasting symptoms several weeks after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. The pathogenesis is still elusive, which hampers appropriate treatment. Neuroinflammatory responses and neurodegenerative processes may occur in absence of overt neuroinvasion. Here we determined whether intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection in male and female syrian golden hamsters results in persistent brain pathology. Brains 3 (symptomatic) or 14 days (viral clearance) post infection versus mock (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 10 each) were immunohistochemically analyzed for viral protein, neuroinflammatory response and accumulation of tau, hyperphosphorylated tau and alpha-synuclein protein. Viral protein in the nasal cavity led to pronounced microglia activation in the olfactory bulb beyond viral clearance. Cortical but not hippocampal neurons accumulated hyperphosphorylated tau and alpha-synuclein, in the absence of overt inflammation and neurodegeneration. Importantly, not all brain regions were affected, which is in line with selective vulnerability. Thus, despite the absence of virus in brain, neurons develop signatures of proteinopathies that may contribute to progressive neuronal dysfunction. Further in depth analysis of this important mechanism is required.

"Effects of workplace measures against COVID-19 and employees' worry about them on the onset of major depressive episodes: A 13-month prospective study of full-time employees","Workplace measures against COVID-19 may prevent the onset of major depressive episode (MDE) in the working population. This 13-month prospective study aimed to investigate the association of the number of workplace measures against COVID-19 and employees' worry about the measures on the onset of MDE during COVID-19 outbreaks in Japan. Data were collected from employees by using online questionnaires at baseline (May 2020) and the 7th survey (June 2021). The onset of MDE during the follow-up was retrospectively measured at the 7th survey, with a self-report scale based on the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview according to the DSM-IV/DSM-5 criteria. Participants were asked to report the number of workplace measures against COVID-19 in their companies/organizations and their worry about these measures (scored 0-3). Multiple logistic regression was conducted of MDE on the number of workplace measures and worry about these, adjusting for demographic and work-related covariates and psychological distress at baseline. Among 968 respondents employed in May 2020, 827 completed the 7th survey in June 2021 (80%). We excluded 75 respondents who reported they had an MDE in May 2020 or earlier. Worry about workplace measures was significantly associated with the onset of MDE after adjusting for the covariates (OR for 1 score increase, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.02-2.32; pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.042). No significant association was found between the number of workplace measures and the onset of MDE.

"Problematic Internet use and academic engagement during the COVID-19 lockdown: The indirect effects of depression, anxiety, and insomnia in early, middle, and late adolescence","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the transition of online learning introduces challenges for adolescents to engage in learning. The increased access and persistent Internet use could heighten the risk of problematic Internet use (PIU) that has been increasingly recognized as a risk factor for academic engagement. This study aims to investigate the direct and indirect relationships between PIU and academic engagement through psychopathological symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, insomnia) in early, middle, and late adolescence. In all, 4852 adolescents (51.5% females; M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯13.80Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2.38) from different regions of Chinese mainland participated in the study and completed questionnaires. Depression and then insomnia as well as anxiety and then insomnia mediated the relationship between PIU and academic engagement. Anxiety exhibited a double-edged effect, that is, a positive relation with academic engagement directly and a negative relation with academic engagement indirectly through insomnia. Multigroup analyses showed that the indirect effects of PIU on academic engagement through depression and subsequent insomnia in middle and late adolescence were stronger than that in early adolescence, whereas the direct effect in early adolescence was stronger than that in middle adolescence. This study was cross-sectional in design and relied upon self-report measures. These findings improve the understandings of how PIU relates to academic engagement through psychopathological symptoms and highlight developmental differences of adolescence.","Liu, Zou, Zhang, Wang, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.043","20220419","Academic engagement; Age difference; Anxiety; Depression; Insomnia; Problematic Internet use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30346,""

"Assessment of Community-Level Vulnerability and Access to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder","Given that COVID-19 and recent natural disasters exacerbated the shortage of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) services and were associated with increased opioid overdose mortality, it is important to examine how a community's ability to respond to natural disasters and infectious disease outbreaks is associated with MOUD access. To examine the association of community vulnerability to disasters and pandemics with geographic access to each of the 3 MOUDs and whether this association differs by urban, suburban, or rural classification. This cross-sectional study of zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) in the continental United States excluding Washington, DC, conducted a geospatial analysis of 2020 treatment location data. Social vulnerability index (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention measure of vulnerability to disasters or pandemics). Drive time in minutes from the population-weighted center of the ZCTA to the ZCTA of the nearest treatment location for each treatment type (buprenorphine, methadone, and extended-release naltrexone). Among 32Ã¢â‚¬Â¯604 ZCTAs within the continental US, 170 within Washington, DC, and 20 without an urban-rural classification were excluded, resulting in a final sample of 32Ã¢â‚¬Â¯434 ZCTAs. Greater social vulnerability was correlated with longer drive times for methadone (correlation, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.11), but it was not correlated with access to other MOUDs. Among rural ZCTAs, increasing social vulnerability was correlated with shorter drive times to buprenorphine (correlation, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.12 to -0.08) but vulnerability was not correlated with other measures of access. Among suburban ZCTAs, greater vulnerability was correlated with both longer drive times to methadone (correlation, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.24) and extended-release naltrexone (correlation, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.17). In this study, communities with greater vulnerability did not have greater geographic access to MOUD, and the mismatch between vulnerability and medication access was greatest in suburban communities. Rural communities had poor geographic access regardless of vulnerability status. Future disaster preparedness planning should match the location of services to communities with greater vulnerability to prevent inequities in overdose deaths.","Joudrey, Kolak, Lin, Paykin, Anguiano, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.7028","20220419","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30348,""
"The Effectiveness and Cost-effectiveness of Well Parent Japan for Japanese Mothers of Children With ADHD: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder associated with numerous functional deficits and poor long-term outcomes. Internationally, behavioral interventions are recommended as part of a multimodal treatment approach for children with ADHD. Currently, in Japan, there are limited interventions available to target ADHD. Well Parent Japan (WPJ), a new hybrid parent-training program, provides a culturally acceptable and effective way to help support Japanese children with ADHD and their parents. This pragmatic multicenter randomized controlled trial aims to provide preliminary evidence about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of WPJ evaluated against treatment as usual (TAU) within routine Japanese mental health services. Mothers of children (aged 6-12 years) diagnosed with ADHD were recruited from child and adolescent mental health care services at three hospital sites across Japan (Fukui, Fukuoka, and Okinawa). The mothers were randomized to receive immediate treatment or TAU. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of WPJ over TAU at the end of the intervention and at 3-month follow-up will be evaluated. The primary outcome is maternal parent domain stress in the parenting role. The following secondary outcomes will be explored: child behavior, including severity of ADHD symptoms; parenting practices; emotional well-being; and the parent-child relationship and maternal child domain parenting stress. Data analysis will follow intention-to-treat principles with treatment effects quantified through analysis of covariance using multilevel modeling. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the WPJ intervention. Study funding was secured through a proof-of-concept grant in July 2018. Approval by the institutional review board for the data collection sites was obtained between 2017 and 2019. Data collection began in August 2019 and was completed in April 2022. Participant recruitment (N=124) was completed in May 2021. Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analyses are expected to be completed by July 2022 and December 2022, respectively. These timelines are subject to change owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the first multisite pragmatic trial of WPJ based on the recruitment of children referred directly to routine clinical services in Japan. This multisite randomized trial tests the effectiveness of WPJ in children and families by comparing WPJ directly with the usual clinical care offered for children diagnosed with ADHD in Japan. We also seek to assess and compare the cost-effectiveness of WPJ with TAU in Japan. International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number ISRCTN66978270; https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN66978270.

By means of state-of-the-art scientometric approaches, we identified 3,692 relevant research outputs, mainly clustering around the following themes: (a) mental health consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic in children and young people; (b) impact of the pandemic on pre-existing psychiatric disorders; (c) family outcomes (i.e., family violence and parental mental health); and (d) link between physical and mental conditions. Only 23% of the retrieved publications reported new data, the remaining ones being reviews, editorials, opinion papers, and other nonempirical reports. The majority of the empirical studies used a cross-sectional design. We suggest that future research efforts should prioritise: (a) longitudinal follow-up of existing cohorts; (b) quasi-experimental studies to gain insight into causal mechanisms underlying pandemic-related psychopathology in children and young people; (c) pragmatic randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to test evidence-based intervention strategies; and (d) evidence-based guidelines for clinicians and policymakers.","Cortese, Sabe, Solmi","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13615","20220419","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30351,""

Unique disease factors make exploration of social connectedness pertinent, added to by COVID-19, with the CF population potentially facing increased risk for severe illness. Seventeen adults with CF in Western Australia undertook interviews, with findings categorized as overarching themes. In a general sense, participants described social connectedness challenges caused by CF, despite which they reported meaningful connections that benefits their mental and physical health. Within a COVID-19 specific context, participants demonstrated resilience in the face of adversity, highlighted the importance of empathy in relation to the pandemic, and described how social support is both an outcome and enhancer of social connectedness. This study contributes to limited social connectedness literature within CF and chronic illness in general, highlighting the importance of social connectedness awareness raising, assessments and interventions in CF healthcare inside and outside the COVID-19 pandemic.","Harrigan, Bennett, Mulrennan, Jessup","https://doi.org/10.1080/17482631.2022.2062820","20220419","COVID-19; Cystic Fibrosis (CF); Western Australia; belonging; chronic illness; mental health; qualitative; resilience; social connectedness; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30353,""

This study aims to (1) identify individual characteristics associated with COVID-19 contact/symptoms or diagnosis and (2) examine the independent association between COVID-19 contact/symptoms or diagnosis and psychological symptoms. From September 2020 to February 2021, 20,327 adults participated in community-based surveys in Quebec. Using repeated cross-sectional online questionnaire, data were collected on probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depression episode (MDE), using the GAD-7 and the PHQ-9 scales, respectively. Self-reported events of (1) contact with a case or symptoms of COVID-19, and (2) diagnosis of COVID-19 were examined, along with several sociodemographic and pandemic-related factors. COVID-19 contact, symptoms, or diagnosis was more frequent in young adults, healthcare or social services workers, adults living with children, and those reporting a greater sense of threat, stigma, financial losses, or daily stress. COVID-19 contactÃ‚Â orÃ‚Â symptomsÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â diagnosis were associated with probable MDE relative to the unaffected group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:Ã‚Â 1.25, 95% CI: 1.12-1.39Ã‚Â and aOR:1.82, 95% CI: 1.48-2.2, respectively). Suicidal thoughts and psychomotor retardation were the symptoms most closely associated with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Results from this study stress the need for better understanding, recognition, and support for people suffering from psychological symptoms following a COVID-19 diagnosis. RÃƒÂ©SUMÃƒÂ©: OBJECTIFS: Les consÃƒÂ©quences psychologiques dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un contact, de symptÃƒÂ´mes ou dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un diagnostic de COVID-19 sont de plus en plus signalÃƒÂ©es. Peu dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©tudes ont examinÃƒÂ© les effets psychologiques liÃƒÂ©s Ãƒ ces ÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ¨nements en utilisant des groupes non affectÃƒÂ©s et nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ont pas tenu compte des facteurs de confusion tels que la peur et la stigmatisation. Cette ÃƒÂ©tude vise Ãƒ 1) identifier les caractÃƒÂ©ristiques associÃƒÂ©es au contact/symptÃƒÂ´mes ou diagnostic de COVID-19 et 2) examiner lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢association entre un contact/symptÃƒÂ´mes ou diagnostic de COVID-19 et les symptÃƒÂ´mes psychologiques. MÃƒÂ©THODES: Un total de 20 327 adultes ont participÃƒÂ© Ãƒ une enquÃƒÂªte transversale populationnelle au QuÃƒÂ©bec entre septembre 2020 et fÃƒÂ©vrier 2021. Ãƒâ‚¬ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢aide dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un questionnaire en ligne, des donnÃƒÂ©es ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© recueillies sur lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ralisÃƒÂ©e probable (GAD-7) et la dÃƒÂ©pression majeure probable (PHQ-9). Les ÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ¨nements autodÃƒÂ©clarÃƒÂ©s de 1) contact avec un cas ou de symptÃƒÂ´mes de COVID-19 et 2) diagnostics de COVID-19 furent examinÃƒÂ©s, ainsi que plusieurs facteurs sociodÃƒÂ©mographiques et liÃƒÂ©s Ãƒ la pandÃƒÂ©mie. RÃƒÂ©SULTATS: Les contacts, symptÃƒÂ´mes ou diagnostics de COVID-19 ÃƒÂ©taient plus frÃƒÂ©quents chez les jeunes adultes, les travailleurs de la santÃƒÂ©, les adultes vivant avec des enfants, et ceux rapportant plus de stigmatisation, pertes financiÃƒÂ¨res, stress quotidien ou un plus haut niveau de menace perÃƒÂ§ue. Des contactsÃ‚Â ou symptÃƒÂ´mesÃ‚Â de COVID-19 et un diagnostic de COVID-19 ÃƒÂ©taient associÃƒÂ©s Ãƒ de la dÃƒÂ©pression majeure probable comparativement au groupe non affectÃƒÂ© (RCaÃ‚Â : 1,25, IC Ãƒ 95% : 1,12-1,39 et RCa :Ã‚Â 1,82, IC Ãƒ 95%Ã‚Â : 1,48-2,2, respectivement). Les pensÃƒÂ©es suicidaires et le retard psychomoteur ÃƒÂ©taient aussi plus ÃƒÂ©troitement associÃƒÂ©s Ãƒ un diagnostic de COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Les rÃƒÂ©sultats de cette ÃƒÂ©tude soulignent le besoin dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢amÃƒÂ©liorer nos connaissances et notre soutien pour les personnes souffrant de symptÃƒÂ´mes psychologiques suite Ãƒ un diagnostic de COVID-19.","GÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©reux, Landaverde","https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-022-00637-5","20220419","COVID-19; Major depression episode; Pandemic; Psychological response","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30355,""
"Age-friendliness of city, loneliness and depression moderated by internet use during the COVID-19 pandemic","The purpose of this study was to examine the association between age-friendliness of a city, loneliness and depression moderated by internet use among older people during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The survey was from 'The 2020 Survey of Needs Assessment for a Safe Community and Age-Friendly City' in Xinyi District, Taipei, which was conducted by face-to-face interviews with community-based older adults who were aged 65 and above from one district of Taipei City from May to June 2020 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°335). Partial least square structural equation modeling and the SPSS PROCESS macro were used for data analysis. Two domains of an age-friendly city (housing and community support and health services) were found to be associated with reduced loneliness, while one (respect and social inclusion) was associated with decreased depression. The age-friendliness of cities mitigates depression through moderator (internet use) and mediation (loneliness) mechanisms. Although some age-friendly domains of the city reduced loneliness and depression directly, the age-friendliness-loneliness-depression mechanism held true only for older adults who used the internet and not for nonusers. Maintaining the age-friendliness of an environment is beneficial to mental health, and internet use is a necessary condition to gain optimum benefits from age-friendly initiatives. Policy suggestions are discussed.","Ng, Lim, Hsu, Chou","https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daac040","20220419","ICT; elderly; health promotion environment; mental health; structural equation model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30356,""

"Gender-Based Analysis of the Association Between Mental Health, Sleep Quality, Aggression, and Physical Activity Among University Students During the COVID-19 Outbreak","COVID-19 has spread throughout the world, resulting in significant morbidity, mortality, and negative psychological effects among general population. However, university students are particularly vulnerable in terms of mental health. The present study evaluated the association between mental health, quality of sleep, aggression, and physical activity in university students in Mexico after 1Ã‚Â year of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, including a gender-sensitive analysis. Participants (935 university students) completed an online questionnaire which collected information regarding demographic data, psychological distress (IES-R scale), depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS-21), aggressiveness Buss-Perry Aggressive Questionnaire, sleep quality (PSQI) and physical activity (IPAQ-S). Findings showed that female students showed significantly higher scores in psychological distress, anxiety, stress scores and sleep quality, as compared to male students. By contrast, male students showed significantly higher scores on aggressiveness than female students. In addition, on physical activity, females performed significantly higher MET-min/week on moderate and high levels. Finally, liner regression model accounted for approximately 73.5% of the variance in DASS-21 scores, with the body mass index, IES-R, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and IPAQ subscales, emerging as significant individual (positive) predictors. Therefore, the pandemic affected female and male students differently. Female students reported more psychological distress, anxiety, and stress while male students reported higher aggressiveness. The differences observed may be due to physiological differences, the response to stress, and differences in sensitivity to life events.","Vuelvas-Olmos, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-VidaÃƒÂ±a, CortÃƒÂ©s-ÃƒÂlvarez","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941221086209","20220419","COVID-19; aggression; mental health; physical activity; sleep quality; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30358,""
"Influence of mental health on the well-being status among Malaysian adults before and during COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the well-being of individuals worldwide. Due to the scarcity of information in the Malaysian context, this study aimed at investigating the changes in well-being before and during the Movement Control Order (MCO) in Malaysia and its association with mental health status. This cross-sectional study was part of a Malaysian non-probabilistic online survey on psychosocial well-being in Malaysia, under the Personal and Family Coping with COVID-19 Global South Research Consortium. A total of 543 respondents (Ã¢â€°Â¥18Ã‚Â years old) were recruited using snowball sampling. A validated self-administered questionnaire for assessing sociodemographic characteristics, well-being, anxiety, boredom, and loneliness was circulated on social media platforms (such as Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp) and emails. Paired samples t-test, chi-square test, and multinomial logistic regression analyses were applied during data analysis. Results revealed significant changes in the mean scores of well-being, anxiety, boredom, and loneliness before and during MCO (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). When comparing with no change in the well-being group, changes in boredom were less likely to be observed in the decreased well-being group (<i>Adj OR</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.874; <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â 0.003) but were more likely to be observed in the group with increased well-being (<i>Adj OR</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.110; <i>p</i> =Ã‚Â 0.002). The findings indicated that the pandemic did not necessarily create adverse effects. Instead, a different perspective is offered, which can be used as a public health strategy to help individuals cope with their mental health needs more positively.","Cheah, Law, Samy, Chua, Siau, Fitriana, Bono, S, Low","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2063351","20220419","COVID-19 pandemic; mental health; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30359,""
"I'm judging you! Influence of depression on moral judgments of COVID-19 infection control behaviors and policies","Health officials recommended a number of COVID-19 infection control measures, such as social distancing and face covering. This study explores whether depression influences individuals' moral judgments regarding COVID-19 infection control behaviors and policies. In this study, participants (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 340) were US residents, recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk in March of 2020. Participants completed several questionnaires, such as demographics, including political affiliation, a depression screener, and a series of questions designed to capture individuals' moral judgments of infection control behaviors and policies. ANCOVA analyses indicated that, controlling for demographics, political affiliation, and the degree of news following, depression symptom level was consistently inversely related to the likelihood of judging infection control in moral terms. Depression symptom level was also inversely related to sensitivity to manipulation of moral judgments for personal behaviors, but not for policies. Individuals with higher levels of depression symptoms may be less willing to advocate for higher personal safety measures, which could lead to a higher likelihood of disease transmission. Outside of the pandemic, the lower propensity for moral judgment could translate into greater acceptance of morally questionable acts and behaviors from others.","McCorkle, Barrera, Leykin","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2067575","20220419","COVID-19; Depression; morality; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30360,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on depression sufferers: a qualitative study from the province of Zaragoza, Spain","The impact of COVID-19 and its control measures have exacerbated existing mental health conditions. Although the deleterious effects of mental health problems are well known, fewer studies have examined the links between the Social Determinants of Health (SDHs) and depression. This study provides insights into the relationship between SDHs and depression during the first strict lockdown in Spain, which lasted for a period of 7Ã‚Â weeks. Fifty-two structured interviews were conducted with people diagnosed with depression during June 2020 in the province of Zaragoza (Spain). Interviews were conducted by telephone due to lockdown constraints. Inductive thematic content analysis was used to explore, develop, and define emergent categories of analysis, which were mapped against the SDH framework. Listening to people's experiences of living with depression during lockdown provided insights into their concerns and coping strategies, which are greatly influenced by the conditions in which they live, their job and their age. Examples of these factors include access to and quality of physical spaces, including housing conditions and public spaces for socialising, social support, adverse working conditions which include caring responsibilities, and access to digital technologies and healthcare services. SDHs have played a fundamental role in shaping people's health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this study has shown that they have a considerable effect on depression outcomes. Governments should consider implementing social welfare programs to tackle both psychosocial problems and material need during crisis situations.","Aguilar-Latorre, OlivÃƒÂ¡n-BlÃƒÂ¡zquez, Porroche-Escudero, MÃƒÂ©ndez-LÃƒÂ³pez, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Gallego, BenedÃƒÂ©-Azagra, MagallÃƒÂ³n-Botaya","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13083-2","20220419","COVID-19; Depression; Qualitative study; Social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30361,""
"Monthly correlates of longitudinal child mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic according to children and caregivers","Background. Multiple reviews identify the broad, pervasive initial impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children, who may be particularly vulnerable to long-term psychiatric sequelae of the ongoing pandemic. However, limited longitudinal research examines persistence of, or change in, childrenâ€™s distress or psychiatric symptomatology. Methods. From June 2020 through December 2021, we enrolled two cohorts of families of children aged 8 to 13 from Southwestern Ontario into a staggered baseline, longitudinal design that leveraged multi-informant report (N=317 families). In each family, one child and one parent or guardian completed a baseline assessment, 6 monthly follow-up assessments, and one final follow-up assessment 9 months post-baseline. At each assessment, the child and parent or guardian completed the CoRonavIruS health Impact Survey and measures of child anxiety, depressive, irritability, and posttraumatic stress syndromes. Results. Results indicate a broad impact of the pandemic on childrenâ€™s mental health, which fluctuated over the study period. Elevated local monthly COVID-19 prevalence, hospitalization, and death rates were associated with monthly elevations in childrenâ€™s reported worry about contracting COVID-19 and stress related to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI). In turn, both elevated monthly worry about contracting COVID-19 and NPI-related stress were associated with monthly elevations in child- and parent- or guardian-report of childrenâ€™s psychological distress and psychiatric syndromes. Conclusions. This study illustrates the importance of, and informs the potential design of, longitudinal research to track the broad, sustained impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children, who may be particularly vulnerable during the ongoing global crisis.","Lance Rappaport et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0011-7BB-5CC","20220420","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; longitudinal studies; depressive symptoms; anxiety; child; covid-19 pandemic","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30362,""
"Early Impacts of College, Interrupted: Considering First-Year Studentsâ€™ Narratives about COVID and Reports of Adjustment during College Shutdowns","The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened lives and livelihoods, imperiled families and communities, and disrupted developmental milestones globally. Among the critical developmental disruptions experienced is the transition to college, which is common and foundational for personal and social exploration. During college shutdowns (Spring 2020), we recruited 633 first year, US students (M age = 18.83 years; 71.3% cisgender women) to provide narratives about the impacts of the pandemic. We tested the ways narrative features were associated with concurrent and longitudinal COVID stressors, psychosocial adjustment, and identity development. Narrative growth expressed in Spring 2020 was positively associated with psychosocial adjustment and global identity development and was negatively associated with mental health concerns. Associations were supported concurrently and at one-year follow-up. Growth partly explained associations between COVID stressors and studentsâ€™ adjustment. Our findings reinforce the importance of growth for resilience and underscore the importance of connective reasoning as people navigate a chronic stress.","Jordan Ashton Booker et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0171-894-960","20220420","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Self-concept and Identity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; covid-19; growth; well-being; narrative identity; identity development; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30363,""
"Parenting in a Pandemic: A Qualitative Exploration of Parentsâ€™ Experiences of Supporting their Children During the Covid-19 Pandemic","This qualitative study examined parentsâ€™ experiences of supporting their children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventeen parents of children aged 2-16 years from diverse backgrounds, living in the UK, were interviewed one-to-one about their experiences. Ten professionals working with children and families were also interviewed to gain a broader perspective of parentsâ€™ experiences. Using Reflexive Thematic Analysis, we identified four central themes: a) worries and uncertainties; b) mental exhaustion; c) resources available to cope with the challenges; and d) finding the positives. Findings revealed the worries and uncertainties that parents faced regarding how best to support their child and the long-term consequences of the pandemic, as well as feelings of mental exhaustion from juggling multiple responsibilities. The impact of Covid-19 on parentsâ€™ wellbeing was varied and parents identified several factors that determined their ability to support their children, such as space in the home environment, support networks and their personal mental health. Despite the challenges, some parents reported positive experiences, such as strengthened family bonds during the pandemic. Our study emphasizes the importance of flexible work arrangements and family-friendly employment policies, as well as support for parents to enable them to support their children and look after their own wellbeing.","Polly Waite et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00BC-18E-0BE","20220420","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; covid-19; childcare; parenting; mental health; thematic analysis; pandemic; qualitative","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-20","",30364,""
