"Disrupting times in the wake of the pandemic: Dispositional time attitudes, time perception and temporal focus","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has majorly disrupted many aspects of peopleâ€™s lives, provoking psychosocial distress among students. Peopleâ€™s positive and negative attitudes towards the past, present and future were a dispositional preâ€“COVID-19 reality. Faced with a pandemic, people have reported disruptions in the speed of passing time. People can shift their attention more towards the past, present or future when major changes in society occur. These aspects of psychological time would be key to understanding the quality of psychosocial adjustment to the pandemic. We hypothesized that dispositional time attitudes impact psychosocial distress because they would trigger situational changes in our time perception and temporal focus. Methods One hundred and forty-four university students in Uruguay responded to self-report questionnaires online while in-person classes were cancelled. Students reported on shifts in temporal focus, changes in time awareness and dispositional time attitudes. Reactive psychological, social and learning environment distress were reported. Results Students reported substantial changes in time perception and temporal focus. A correlation matrix showed significant relationships between time attitudes, focus and awareness. For example, psychological distress was correlated with negative time attitudes, slower passage of time, boredom, blurred sense of time and shifting focus to the past. Mediation models were derived. The indirect effect of time attitudes on psychological distress was significant through past focus. Discussion Dispositional time attitudes would impact studentsâ€™ capacity to cope with the pandemic. Situational shifts in temporal focus and perception were prevalent and can be viewed as temporal coping mechanisms in the wake of powerful societal change. Our mediation models showed that those with negative time attitudes experienced more psychological distress because they shifted their attention to the past. Future directions for research and practical implications are discussed.","Loose, Tianna, Wittmann, Marc, VÃ¡squez-EcheverrÃ­a, Alejandro","https://doi.org/10.1177/0961463X211027420","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Time & Society; 31(1):110-131, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-21","",30365,""
"Johnsonâ€™s bigger crime is failing to take the nationâ€™s health seriously enough","Wellbeing and quality of life are also important considerations for young people with chronic disease, such as diabetes, who may be reluctant to engage with services (doi:10.1136/bmj.o750).1 And the services they need should include psychological and behavioural interventions to support emotional wellbeing and mental health (doi:10.1136/bmj-2022-070530).2 A new study offers some hope in older age. K Dhana and colleagues looked at the effect of lifestyle factors on life expectancy lived with and without Alzheimerâ€™s dementia and found a longer life expectancy and about a 50% decrease in life years lived with Alzheimerâ€™s disease in people older than 65 years (doi:10.1136/bmj-2021-068390).3 People who exercise enough, have cognitive engagement, eat a healthy diet, are non-smokers, and consume low amounts of alcohol live longer and for more years without Alzheimerâ€™s disease (doi:10.1136/bmj.o885).4 The upper limit of life expectancy has changed little in 1000 years, with improvements in maternal and child health the greatest contributions to increases in average life expectancy. The importance of prevention is also a bitter truth for governments and health systems that continue to ignore systemwide measures, such as â€œavailability interventionsâ€ for food and drink (doi:10.1136/bmj-2021-069848),6 but are quick to acclaim and promote treatments for which evidence is mixed (doi:10.1136/bmj.o926).7 Deterioration in baseline population health, notably in countries that persisted with economic austerity measures, is one reason for the excessive demand now placed on hospital services (doi:10.1136/bmj.o950).8 That excessive demand contributes to the perception that health services are more inefficient than they are (doi:10.1136/bmj.o929).9 But providing a health service with enough resources to meet demand is a delicate balance between rationing, taxation, and collaboration.","Abbasi, Kamran","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.o974","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ : British Medical Journal (Online); 377, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-21","",30366,""

"Improving Global Access to Transgender Health Care: Outcomes of a Telehealth Quality Improvement Study for the Air Force Transgender Program","Purpose: To describe the development of the United States Air Force's (USAF) telehealth program from fall 2017 through fall of 2020 in response to the unique challenges associated with providing care for a global transgender military population. Methods: Telehealth visit completion rates were monitored at time of encounters and through electronic health record reports. Patient satisfaction data were obtained by immediate postvisit survey, across provider care received, logistics of setting up the appointment, and quality of the virtual health system connection. Patient cases highlighting opportunities for transgender telehealth were summarized. Results: Between September 9, 2019 and October 28, 2020, 99 telehealth encounters with video-to-video connection occurred. Twenty-three of the encounters were for gender-affirming hormone therapy, 17 for mental health visits, and 59 for speech therapy. Thirty-five surveys were collected from 20 patients. Overall patients were â€œsatisfiedâ€ or â€œvery satisfiedâ€ with providers' ability to manage their chief complaint through this modality (average 4.9 out of 5 on 1 to 5 scale with 1 being â€œvery dissatisfiedâ€ and 5 being â€œvery satisfiedâ€) and â€œstrongly agreeâ€ that telehealth is an effective means to accomplish care (average score 4.8 on 1 to 5 scale with 1 being â€œstrongly disagreeâ€ and 5 â€œstrongly agreeâ€). Services provided spanned 11 USAF bases worldwide. Conclusions: Telehealth is successful in ensuring ongoing transgender health care services for a global military population. The success of this program may have implications for future military and civilian endeavors to bridge care gaps for transgender patients in resource-poor or distant-site locations.","Smalley, Joshua M.; Lozano, Janelle M.; Chariâ€™, J.

"Social Determinants of Health and Pediatric Mental Health Before and During COVID-19 in New York City Primary Care Pediatrics","In March 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, New York City instituted a shelter-in-place order, dramatically affecting the area's social and economic landscape. Pediatric primary care practices universally screen for social determinants of health (SDOH) and mental health (MH) needs, providing an opportunity to assess changes in the population's needs during COVID-19. To assess changes in SDOH and MH needs of pediatric families before and during COVID-19, the authors conducted a prospective cohort study of patients seen in the hospital's pediatric primary care practices. Baseline data were collected during well visits from March 1, 2019 to March 1, 2020, and included the following outcome measures: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ2) score &gt;0, PHQ9 scores Ã¢â€°Â¥5, pediatric symptom checklist (PSC17) scores Ã¢â€°Â¥15, and SDOH needs. Follow-up pandemic data were collected from June to August 2020. A total of 423 patients (215 [51%] female, 279 [66%] Hispanic, and 248 [59%] primary English speakers) were enrolled in the study. The following SDOH needs significantly increased during COVID-19: food (17%-32%; <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), legal (19%-30%; <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003), public benefits (4%-13.8%; <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and housing (17.2%-26%; <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002). There was no significant change in MH screening results during COVID-19 compared with baseline: positive PHQ2 depression screen (27.9% vs. 34.3%, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.39), positive PHQ9 depression screen (45.5% vs. 64.1%, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.32), or positive PSC17 measuring emotional and behavioral concerns (4.9% vs. 8.2%, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.13). During COVID-19, patients with food, housing, or legal needs had a significantly higher likelihood of having emotional or behavioral difficulties (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01).

"The COVID-19 pandemic - related psychological distress and job burnout among Serbian pharmacy practitioners: a cross-sectional online study","The current COVID-19 pandemic has increased occupational stress for all healthcare providers, making job burnout one of the most common and largely unrecognized mental health issues among healthcare professionals. Besides physicians and nurses, pharmacy practitioners were ""front-line"" healthcare professionals with a critical and unique role in the public health crisis. Considering this, the aim of this study was to examine distress levels and the prevalence of job burnout among Serbian pharmacy practitioners in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional online study was conducted in April and May of 2020. A total of 176 pharmacy practitioners anonymously and voluntarily completed the two-section questionnaire, consisting of Copenhagen burnout inventory, CBI and 4DSQ Distress subscale. The two-section questionnaire was distributed online, among various social-media groups of pharmacy practitioners, as well as by personal contacts following the ""snowball"" sampling method. Results revealed moderately high burnout scores in our sample. The majority of the participants showed signs of personal-related job burnout, followed by work-related and client-related burnout. A strongly elevated distress level was obtained in almost two-thirds of study respondents. In addition, a significant and high correlation of all CBI subscales with distress was found, as well as medium correlations with sleep duration shortening as a mediator between distress and job burnout. Results of our study showed that job burnout significantly increased among pharmacy practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we discovered that stress has an indirect impact on study participants' burnout via insufficient sleep.","Ã…Â½ivanoviÃ„â€¡, Javorac, Stojkov, JevtiÃ„â€¡, KneÃ…Â¾eviÃ„â€¡, BlanuÃ…Â¡a, Ã…Â timac GrbiÃ„â€¡, Paut Kusturica, JovanoviÃ„â€¡ LjeÃ…Â¡koviÃ„â€¡, TodoroviÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202204_28502","20220420","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-21","",30372,""
"A novel home- and community-based mobile outreach detoxification service for individuals identifying problematic substance use: implementation and program evaluation","Substance use remains a pervasive public health issue throughout Canada, exerting substantial economic, social, and political pressure on health care systems, while impacting lives of affected individuals. The advent of COVID-19 has been doubly perilous; it restricts existing programming, while exacting a worsening toll on mental health and substance use fronts across the demographic landscape. In response to the crisis, the Mobile Withdrawal Management Service (MWMS) was established in 2019 through a Winnipeg-based community health centre. MWMS is a community-based outreach withdrawal service that supports individuals for up to 30 days. Clients may choose where services are accessed in the community, including their own home. For those without safe housing, short-term accommodation is offered. Additionally, Indigenous cultural support, peer support, trauma counselling, and linkage to primary care are available. The MWMS approach is resolutely patient-centred. The program meets people where they are at, both figuratively and literally. Agility and adaptability-particularly in the context of substance use treatment-is uniquely advantageous in maintaining service delivery to the broad demographic cross-section revealed in the data. Moreover, relative to inpatient detoxification services, MWMS holds significant potential for system-wide cost savings. The presented approach addresses a significant gap in addiction services. There is substantial capacity for both increased access and system savings with implementation of this approach. Furthermore, the principles behind the program are readily transferable to different contexts and easily modifiable to local conditions. There is particular potential for servicing hard-to-reach populations, with respect to both physical and social geography. RÃƒÂ©SUMÃƒÂ©: LIEU: LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢usage de substances demeure un problÃƒÂ¨me de santÃƒÂ© publique omniprÃƒÂ©sent au Canada; en plus de son impact sur la vie des personnes touchÃƒÂ©es, il exerce une pression ÃƒÂ©conomique, sociale et politique considÃƒÂ©rable sur les systÃƒÂ¨mes de soins de santÃƒÂ©. LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢avÃƒÂ¨nement de la COVID-19 a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© doublement pÃƒÂ©rilleux : il a limitÃƒÂ© les programmes existants tout en aggravant le bilan en matiÃƒÂ¨re de santÃƒÂ© mentale et dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢usage de substances dans toutes les couches de la sociÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ©. INTERVENTION: En rÃƒÂ©ponse Ãƒ la crise, un service mobile de sevrage contrÃƒÂ´lÃƒÂ© (Mobile Withdrawal Management Service Ã¢â‚¬â€œ MWMS) a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© crÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ© en 2019 par un centre de santÃƒÂ© communautaire de Winnipeg. Le MWMS est un service de sevrage de proximitÃƒÂ© qui offre une aide individuelle pendant une pÃƒÂ©riode pouvant aller jusquÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ãƒ 30 jours. Les usagÃƒÂ¨res et usagers peuvent choisir lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢endroit oÃƒÂ¹ recevoir ces services dans la communautÃƒÂ©, y compris Ãƒ leur domicile. Un hÃƒÂ©bergement Ãƒ court terme est offert aux personnes sans logement sÃƒÂ»r. Du soutien culturel aux personnes autochtones, du soutien par les pairs, du counseling traumatologique et un aiguillage vers les soins primaires sont aussi disponibles. RÃƒÂ©SULTATS: La dÃƒÂ©marche du MWMS est rÃƒÂ©solument centrÃƒÂ©e sur la personne. Le programme rejoint les gens lÃƒ oÃƒÂ¹ ils se trouvent, au propre et au figurÃƒÂ©. Son agilitÃƒÂ© et son adaptabilitÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â€particuliÃƒÂ¨rement dans le contexte du traitement de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢usage de substancesÃ¢â‚¬â€lui procurent un avantage unique lorsquÃ¢â‚¬â„¢il sÃ¢â‚¬â„¢agit de maintenir la prestation de services au large spectre dÃƒÂ©mographique rÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ© dans les donnÃƒÂ©es. De plus, comparÃƒÂ© aux services de dÃƒÂ©sintoxication en ÃƒÂ©tablissement, le MWMS peut gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rer des ÃƒÂ©conomies considÃƒÂ©rables Ãƒ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©chelle du systÃƒÂ¨me. CONSÃƒÂ©QUENCES: La dÃƒÂ©marche prÃƒÂ©sentÃƒÂ©e comble une lacune importante dans les services dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢aide aux toxicomanes.

"Mental Health among African American and Latinx Men who have sex with men after the COVID-19 Lockdown in Los Angeles - Findings from the HOPE cohort","This study aimed to examine the depression and anxiety among men of color (primarily African American and Latinx) who have sex with men after the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes included 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and a 10-item COVID-related anxiety measure using a modified H1N1-related anxiety question. Independent variables were food insecurity and belief in government efficiency. Data were analyzed by Regression models with random cluster effects. Food insecurity experiences were significantly associated with higher depression (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), higher anxiety (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and higher pandemic-related anxiety (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Higher levels of belief in government efficiency were significantly associated with lower depression (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), less anxiety (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), and less pandemic-related anxiety (p-valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"A systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of web-based psychosocial interventions among patients with colorectal cancer","To synthesize the effectiveness of web-based psychosocial interventions on self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, quality of life (QoL), non-specific psychological and cancer-specific distress among patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). A systematic review and meta-analysis. Six databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL and CNKI) were searched from inception to December 2021. Experimental/quasi-experimental studies involving patients with CRC for the improvement of aforementioned outcomes were included. Two reviewers screened and extracted the data, and assessed studies' methodological quality using risk of bias tools. Meta-analyses and narrative syntheses were performed. Nineteen studies consisting of 1386 participants were identified. Cognitive-behavioural therapy delivered online was the most common trialled web-based psychosocial intervention. Meta-analyses revealed no positive effect for self-efficacy (standardized mean difference 0.93, 95% CI: 0.52 to 1.35, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) and minimal benefit for QoL (mean difference [MD] 2.83, 95% CI: -0.31 to 5.98, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .08) but significant positive effects for anxiety (MD -2.23, 95% CI: -3.31 to -1.14, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) and depression (MD -2.84, 95% CI: -4.09 to -1.59, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) among CRC survivors in the intervention group as compared with the control group. Narrative synthesis suggested possible benefits in reducing distress. Web-based psychosocial interventions are promising alternatives to conventional delivery methods in reducing patients' anxiety, depression and distress. However, evidence on self-efficacy and QoL remains inconsistent. More adequately powered, well-designed trials with targeted and theory-based interventions are required to ascertain findings. By highlighting the potential of web-based psychosocial interventions in reducing anxiety and depression among CRC survivors, this review has put forth beneficial information supporting the use and acceptance of web-based care delivery in light of COVID-19 restrictions and nationwide lockdowns. Meanwhile, the paucity of empirical support reflects the necessity of more extensive research to test and improve other health outcomes.

"COVID-19-related anxiety: How do coping and optimism relate to substance use in African-American young adults?","The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected college students nationwide. Recent research suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted African-American young adults. The infection case rates, hospitalizations, and death rates in African-American populations are 2-5 times higher than among White populations. The intergenerational trauma and systemic racism that African-Americans have faced in past and present times have fomented conditions that lead to vulnerability within this historically resilient community. These stresses and losses increase the risks of anxiety and substance use. This study examined the relationship between COVID-19-related anxiety and substance use, and how adaptive coping and optimism influence this relationship in African-Americans young adults. Results reveal that COVID-related anxiety predicts alcohol and drug use. Optimism and adaptive coping are related to lower pandemic-related anxiety, alcohol, and drug use among African-American young adults.","Singleton, Johnson, Singleton, Li","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22863","20220420","African-Americans; COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; mental health; optimism; substance use/abuse; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-21","",30376,""
"The global prevalence and its associated factors toward domestic violence against women and children during COVID-19 pandemic-""The shadow pandemic"": A review of cross-sectional studies","Globally, domestic violence affects women across their life span. Domestic violence against women and children during COVID-19 is a critical and substantial public health issue. This review article was aimed to determine the prevalence and its associated factors toward domestic violence against women and children during COVID-19. Several studies showed that the prevalence of domestic violence against women and children has been alarmingly enlarged during this COVID-19. Domestic violence is a significant and essential problem that is occurring all over the world for many years now, but this condition has been augmented during the lockdown situation because of this pandemic. Women and children of the worldwide are facing twin health emergencies that are COVID-19 and domestic violence. The pandemic was found as a threat to commit domestic violence against women and children. This is because, even though the measurements taken to avoid COVID-19 spread are supportive strategies and also the only opportunity to do so, reducing the risk of COVID-19 was found to raise the risk of domestic violence against women and children. Factors associated with domestic violence against women and children were; being housewives, ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°30Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, marriage, husband's age being between 31 and 40Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, physical victimization, and sexual victimization were factors associated with domestic violence. Depression, spending more time in close contact, job losses, financial insecurity, lockdowns, addiction (alcohol or drugs), control of wealth in the family, technology, and quarantine were factors considered as risk factors for domestic violence. This review will serve as a ""call to action"" to address this crisis effectively by coming together since this crisis is the global aspect.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Burnout, Psychological Well-being, and Work Satisfaction in Psychiatry Trainees in Ireland","Prior to the pandemic, trainee doctors were at higher risk of psychological ill health. There is limited evidence measuring the impact of COVID-19 on psychiatry trainees. This study evaluates levels of burnout, work satisfaction, and psychological well-being in psychiatry junior doctors in Ireland and identifies potential contributing factors. The authors carried out a cross-sectional online survey measuring demographic and work-related variables. Questions including exposure to COVID-19 and stress-related factors were included. We evaluated burnout, work satisfaction, and psychological well-being using the Abbreviated-Maslach Burnout Inventory, Basic Needs Satisfaction at Work Scale, and WHO-5 Well-being Index. One hundred and five doctors responded (21%). The biggest stressor reported was reduced face-to-face contact with family and friends (73%). Forty one percent reported weekly supervision changes. Sixty five percent met the criteria for burnout, compared with 36.2% in 2018. Significant factors associated with burnout included staff shortages, longer hours, and less experience. Changes in supervision and working in non-European Working Time Directive compliant rotas were associated with lower scores across all subdomains of the BNSW Scale. The WHO-5 Well-being Index identified 48% scored low in personal well-being, indicating these trainees met the threshold for depression. Changes in regular supervision (p=0.010) were a significant predictor of low personal well-being. High prevalence of burnout and low levels of well-being in this vulnerable cohort, particularly those who are inexperienced, have changes in supervision, and working longer hours is concerning. This study highlights the importance of regular supervision and support for this group.","Mcloughlin, Abdalla, O'Callaghan, Casey, Barrett","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40596-022-01633-0","20220420","Burnout; Education and training; Satisfaction; Supervision; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-21","",30378,""

"Using Telehealth to Provide Behavioral Healthcare to Young Adults and College Students","The suicide rate remains the second leading cause of death for young adults and increased by 33 percent between 1999 and 2019.<sup>1</sup> Also, it is the fourth leading cause of death among people ages 35-44 and the fifth leading cause among people ages 45-54, making suicide a problem not unique to only the university community; it is problem all across the country.<sup>2</sup> The 2021-2022 academic year will also be mentally challenging to students returning to campus and those taking online classes due to COVID-19. The World Health Organization Situation Report published August 1, 2020, reported 4,456,389 confirmed cases and 151,265 deaths.<sup>3</sup> However, most universities reopened their campuses in the fall of 2021. As universities may have limited social events, some students, particularly freshmen, may feel isolated. Social distancing can also cause stress levels among students to increase. This research investigates the perception of students about the need and use of telehealth and virtual appointments to provide students additional opportunities to receive the care they need. Most students were born in the information age and welcome technology as a tool to solve problems.<sup>4</sup> The authors determined that providers can use mobile platforms to solve health problems. Regarding the full-scale replacement of health services with telehealth, the participants did not believe this was helpful and efficient. The authors determined that if healthcare providers implement telehealth, particularly in remote university campuses and rural areas, it will help to improve behavioral health on university campuses.","Ollio, Gyan, Gyan","https://www.google.com/search?q=Using+Telehealth+to+Provide+Behavioral+Healthcare+to+Young+Adults+and+College+Students.","20220420","COVID-19; behavioral health; students; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-21","",30380,""
"Building Best Practices for Telehealth Record Documentation in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Telehealth services for patient visits have substantially surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, there is increased importance and demand for high-quality telehealth clinical documentation. However, little is known about how clinical data documentation is collected and the quality of data items included. This study aimed to identify the current state of and gaps in documentation and develop a best practice strategy for telehealth record documentation. Data were collected from January to February 2021 via a self-designed questionnaire for administrators and managers from physicians' offices and mental health facilities, resulting in 76 valid responses. Survey items included health organization demographic information, use of telehealth policies and procedures, and clinical documentation for telehealth patient visits. Findings from this study can be used to assist government, policymakers, and healthcare organizations in developing best practices in telehealth usage and clinical documentation improvement strategies.","Houser, Flite, Foster, Hunt, Morey, Palmer, Peterson, Pope, Sorensen","https://www.google.com/search?q=Building+Best+Practices+for+Telehealth+Record+Documentation+in+the+COVID-19+Pandemic.","20220420","best practice; clinic data documentation; quality improvement; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-21","",30381,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on patients with chronic pain seeking care at a tertiary pain clinic","Empirical data on the health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic remain scarce, especially among patients with chronic pain. We conducted a cross-sectional study matched by season to examine patient-reported health symptoms among patients with chronic pain pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic onset. Survey responses were analyzed from 7535 patients during their initial visit at a tertiary pain clinic between April 2017-October 2020. Surveys included measures of pain and pain-related physical, emotional, and social function. The post-COVID-19 onset cohort included 1798 initial evaluations, and the control pre-COVID-19 cohort included 5737 initial evaluations. Patients were majority female, White/Caucasian, and middle-aged. The results indicated that pain ratings remained unchanged among patients after the pandemic onset. However, pain catastrophizing scores were elevated when COVID-19 cases peaked in July 2020. Pain interference, physical function, sleep impairment, and emotional support were improved in the post-COVID-19 cohort. Depression, anxiety, anger, and social isolation remained unchanged. Our findings provide evidence of encouraging resilience among patients seeking treatment for pain conditions in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our findings that pain catastrophizing increased when COVID-19 cases peaked in July 2020 suggests that future monitoring and consideration of the impacts of the pandemic on patients' pain is warranted.","Ziadni, You, Cramer, Anderson, Hettie, Darnall, Mackey","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-10431-5","20220420","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-21","",30382,""

"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary care workers: a cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the mental health of healthcare workers, yet studies in primary care workers are scarce. To investigate the prevalence of and associated factors for psychological distress in primary care workers during the first COVID-19 outbreak. This was a multicentre, cross-sectional, web-based survey conducted in primary healthcare workers in Spain, between May and September 2020. Healthcare workers were invited to complete a survey to evaluate sociodemographic and work-related characteristics, COVID-19 infection status, exposure to patients with COVID-19, and resilience (using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), in addition to being screened for common mental disorders (depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks, and substance use disorder). Positive screening for any of these disorders was analysed globally using the term 'any current mental disorder'. A total of 2928 primary care professionals participated in the survey. Of them, 43.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 41.9 to 45.4) tested positive for a current mental disorder. Female sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.61, 95% CI = 1.25 to 2.06), having previous mental disorders (OR 2.58, 95% CI = 2.15 to 3.10), greater occupational exposure to patients with COVID-19 (OR 2.63, 95% CI = 1.98 to 3.51), having children or dependents (OR 1.35, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.76 and OR 1.59, 95% CI = 1.20 to 2.11, respectively), or having an administrative job (OR 2.24, 95% CI = 1.66 to 3.03) were associated with a higher risk of any current mental disorder. Personal resilience was shown to be a protective factor. Almost half of primary care workers showed significant psychological distress. Strategies to support the mental health of primary care workers are necessary, including designing psychological support and resilience-building interventions based on risk factors identified.","AragonÃƒÂ¨s, Cura-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Rivas, Polentinos-Castro, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-San-MartÃƒÂ­n, LÃƒÂ³pez-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Molina-AragonÃƒÂ©s, Amigo, Alayo, Mortier, Ferrer, PÃƒÂ©rez-SolÃƒÂ , Vilagut, Alonso","https://doi.org/10.3399/BJGP.2021.0691","20220420","COVID-19 pandemic; cross-sectional study; health personnel; mental health; primary health care; psychological resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-21","",30384,""
"Associations of youth mental health, parental psychological distress, and family relationships during the COVID-19 outbreak in China","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant changes in society and family life, which could be particularly difficult for parents. The present study examines the relationship between youth mental health and parental psychological distress after the first peak of the COVID-19 Outbreak in China. The parent-child and marital relationships were examined as moderators of the above relationship. Parents and their children aged 10 to 18 years were recruited for this study. The parents completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and a subset of items from the questionnaire of the COVID-19 Supporting Parents, Adolescents, and Children in Epidemics (Co-SPACE) survey of parental mental health, child's psychological symptoms, parent-child, and marital relationship. Several multiple linear regressions were used to analyze the data. The largest variance in parental mental health was explained by the child's psychological symptoms (effect size betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.27). Parent-child (effect size beta = -0.13) and marital relationship (effect size beta = -0.21) were negatively associated with parental mental health. The relationship between child's psychological symptoms and parental mental health was moderated by marital relationship (effect size beta = -0.07). Both parent-child and marital relationships presented with a significant interaction with impact scores, while only parent-child relationships with burden scores. Youth mental health problems were significantly associated with parental psychological symptoms during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic The parent-child and marital relationship moderated the association between youth psychological symptoms and parental mental health. Interventions for alleviating parenting stress and support services that improve family relationships may be particularly effective in reducing parental psychological distress associated with future COVID-19 or related crises.","Bai, Liu, Zhang, Fu, Huang, Hu, Guo","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-03938-8","20220420","COVID-19; Family Relationships; Mental Health; Parents; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-21","",30385,""
"Lessons Learned Recruiting and Retaining Pregnant and Postpartum Individuals in Digital Trials: Viewpoint","In an increasingly connected world and in the midst of a global pandemic, digital trials offer numerous advantages over traditional trials that rely on physical study sites. Digital trials have the potential to improve access to research and clinical treatments for the most vulnerable and minoritized, including pregnant and postpartum individuals. However, digital trials are underutilized in maternal and child health research, and there is limited evidence to inform the design and conduct of digital trials. Our research collaborative, consisting of 5 research teams in the U.S. and Australia, aimed to address this gap. We collaborated to share lessons learned from our experiences recruiting and retaining pregnant and postpartum individuals in digital trials of social and behavioral interventions. We first discuss the promise of digital trials in improving participation in research during the perinatal period, as well as the unique challenges they pose. Second, we present lessons learned from 12 completed and ongoing digital trials that have used platforms such as Ovia, Facebook, and Instagram for recruitment. Our trials evaluated interventions for breastfeeding, prenatal and postpartum depression, insomnia, decision making, and chronic pain. We focus on challenges and lessons learned in 3 key areas: (1) rapid recruitment of large samples with a diversity of minoritized identities, (2) retention of study participants in longitudinal studies, and (3) prevention of fraudulent enrollment. We offer concrete strategies that we pilot-tested to address these challenges. Strategies presented in this commentary can be incorporated, as well as formally evaluated, in future studies.","Parks, Duffecy, McCabe, Blankstein Breman, Milgrom, Hirshler, Gemmill, Segre, Felder, Uscher-Pines","https://doi.org/10.2196/35320","20220420","COVID-19; digital health; digital trials; fraudulent enrollment; maternal and child health; pandemic; parenting; pediatrics; postpartum; pregnant and postpartum individuals; pregnant women; retention and recruitment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-21","",30386,""
