"The impact of ongoing COVID-19 lockdown on family finances and mental health","Objectives: Australia's public health restrictions ('lockdown') in 2020 successfully contained the spread of COVID-19. These included a national 'initial' lockdown (March-May), and 'ongoing' lockdown (July-November) for metropolitan Victorian residents only. Australia's experience offers an opportunity to assess impacts of lockdown on families with children, in the relative absence of disease morbidity and mortality. This study (1) described the experience of initial lockdown and (2) evaluated the impact of ongoing lockdown, on family finances and mental health. Methods: Data were drawn from the June and September 2020 Royal Children's Hospital National Child Health Polls. Caregivers of children from the states of Victoria and New South Wales reported on job/income loss; material deprivation (inability to pay for essential items); income-poverty; mental health (Kessler-6); impact on caregiver/child mental health; and caregiver/child coping. Data from N=1207/902 caregivers in June/September were analyzed; Aim (1) with weighted descriptives; Aim (2) with Difference-in-Difference adjusted linear regression models (New South Wales provided the comparator). Results: Following initial lockdown, one-quarter of families reported job/income loss; one-third reported material deprivation. Negative impacts on mental health were reported for half the caregivers and one-third of children. Few caregivers or children had difficulties coping. During Victoria's ongoing lockdown, job/income loss increased by 11% (95%CI: 3-18%); Kessler-6 poor mental health by 6% (95%CI: 0.3-12%) and negative mental health impacts by 12% for caregivers (95%CI: 6-23%) and 14% for children (95%CI: 4-20%). Female (versus male) caregivers, metropolitan (versus regional/rural) families, and families with elementary school-aged children (versus pre-/high-school) were most affected. Conclusions: Ongoing lockdown had negative impacts on mental health, employment, and income, but not deprivation or poverty, likely because of the government income supplements introduced early in the pandemic. Balancing the benefits and harms of lockdown requires planned responses to outbreaks, and evidence-informed financial and mental health supports.","Anna Price; Diana Contreras-SuÃ¡rez; Anna Zhu; Natalie Schreurs; Mary-Anne Measey; Susan Woolfenden; Jade Burley; Hannah Bryson; Daryl Efron; Anthea Rhodes; Sharon Goldfeld","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.15.21262087","20210820","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-21","",17267,""
"Post-traumatic stress disorder in healthcare workers of emergency departments during the pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Emergency departments (EDs) were the first application center for Covid-19 patients, as in almost all diseases. For this reason, a serious mental burden has arisen for ED workers. This study was conducted to determine the possible rate of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and factors that may be associated with PTSD symptom severity in physicians and nurses working in EDs. This cross-sectional study was conducted with a total of 783 participants, including 406 physicians and 377 nurses working in EDs. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21; and a structured questionnaire on sociodemographic and work-related characteristics were administered to the participants. The probable PTSD rate in the total sample was found to be 19.2%. The rate of probable PTSD in physicians (22.9%) was significantly higher than in nurses (15.1%). However, PTSD symptom total scores and PTSD symptom clusters were higher in physicians than in nurses, but there was no difference between the two groups in terms of depression, anxiety and stress levels. High anxiety level, being diagnosed with COVID-19, high depression level, female gender, and having additional chronic disease were predictors of high PTSD symptom severity in physicians. For nurses, high anxiety level, being diagnosed with COVID-19, working with 24-h shifts, high depression level, low work experience (years), low monthly income and having additional chronic disease were the predictors of high PTSD symptom severity. The results of our study showed that both profession groups are at risk for PTSD, and contrary to the existing literature, this rate may be higher in physicians than in nurses. HCWs in the EDs needed protective and supportive mental health models in terms of PTSD.","Bahadirli, Sagaltici","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.08.027","20210820","COVID-19; Emergency departments; Nurses; PTSD; Physicians","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-21","",17268,""
"The long-term sequelae of COVID-19: an international consensus on research priorities for patients with pre-existing and new-onset airways disease","Persistent ill health after acute COVID-19-referred to as long COVID, the post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, or the post-COVID-19 condition-has emerged as a major concern. We undertook an international consensus exercise to identify research priorities with the aim of understanding the long-term effects of acute COVID-19, with a focus on people with pre-existing airways disease and the occurrence of new-onset airways disease and associated symptoms. 202 international experts were invited to submit a minimum of three research ideas. After a two-phase internal review process, a final list of 98 research topics was scored by 48 experts. Patients with pre-existing or post-COVID-19 airways disease contributed to the exercise by weighting selected criteria. The highest-ranked research idea focused on investigation of the relationship between prognostic scores at hospital admission and morbidity at 3 months and 12 months after hospital discharge in patients with and without pre-existing airways disease. High priority was also assigned to comparisons of the prevalence and severity of post-COVID-19 fatigue, sarcopenia, anxiety, depression, and risk of future cardiovascular complications in patients with and without pre-existing airways disease. Our approach has enabled development of a set of priorities that could inform future research studies and funding decisions. This prioritisation process could also be adapted to other, non-respiratory aspects of long COVID.","Adeloye, Elneima, Daines, Poinasamy, Quint, Walker, Brightling, Siddiqui, Hurst, Chalmers, Pfeffer, Novotny, Drake, Heaney, Rudan, Sheikh, De Soyza","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(21)00286-1","20210820","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-21","",17269,""
"Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease During SARS-COV-2 Pandemic in Peru","To evaluate neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their association with cognition and functionality during lockdown of the COVID-19's first wave. We included 91 patients and caregivers of people with AD from a memory clinic. The RUDAS, M@T, and CDR were administered to patients and NPI/ADCS-ADL to caregivers. Baseline and lockdown measurements scales were analyzed to compare the frequencies at baseline versus lockdown and conditional Odds Ratio (ORc) was calculated for the neuropsychiatric symptoms. During the pandemic, significant increase in the number of cases was observed in depression (23%), agitation (36.8%), aberrant motor activity (12%), sleep disorders (26.3%), and appetite change (12.1%). In worsening of pre-existing symptoms, the most frequent were delusions (75%), followed by sleep disorders (71.7%).

"Social conditions and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown among people who do not identify with the man/woman binomial in Spain","Evidence suggests that non-binary people have poorer mental and physical health outcomes, compared with people who identify within the gender binomial (man/woman). Research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health has been conducted worldwide in the last few months. It has however overlooked gender diversity. The aim of our study was to explore social and health-related factors associated with mental health (anxiety and depression) among people who do not identify with the man/woman binomial during COVID-19 lockdown in Spain. A cross-sectional study with online survey, aimed at the population residing in Spain during lockdown, was conducted. Data were collected between the 8th of April until the 28th of May 2020, the time period when lockdown was implemented in Spain. Mental health was measured using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale for anxiety, and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression. The survey included the question: Which sex do you identify with? The options ""Man"", ""Woman"", ""Non-binary"" and ""I do not identify"" were given. People who answered one of the last two options were selected for this study. Multivariate regression logistic models were constructed to evaluate the associations between sociodemographic, social and health-related factors, anxiety and depression. Out of the 7125 people who participated in the survey, 72 (1%) identified as non-binary or to not identify with another category. People who do not identify with the man/woman binomial (non-binary/I do not identify) presented high proportions of anxiety (41.7%) and depression (30.6%). Poorer mental health was associated with social-employment variables (e.g., not working before the pandemic) and health-related variables (e.g., poor or regular self-rated health). These findings suggest that social inequities, already experienced by non-binary communities before the pandemic, may deepen due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jacques-AviÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ³, LÃƒÂ³pez-JimÃƒÂ©nez, Medina-Perucha, de Bont, Berenguera","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256261","20210820","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-21","",17271,""
"Exploiting Shared Knowledge from Non-COVID Lesions for Annotation-Efficient COVID-19 CT Lung Infection Segmentation","The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious virus and has spread all over the world, posing an extremely serious threat to all countries. Automatic lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. However, the major challenge lies in the inadequacy of annotated COVID-19 datasets. Currently, there are several public non-COVID lung lesion segmentation datasets, providing the potential for generalizing useful information to the related COVID-19 segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-driven collaborative learning model to exploit shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions for annotation-efficient COVID-19 CT lung infection segmentation. The model consists of a general encoder to capture general lung lesion features based on multiple non-COVID lesions, and a target encoder to focus on task-specific features based on COVID-19 infections. Features extracted from the two parallel encoders are concatenated for the subsequent decoder part. We develop a collaborative learning scheme to regularize feature-level relation consistency of given input and encourage the model to learn more general and discriminative representation of COVID-19 infections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that trained with limited COVID-19 data, exploiting shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions can further improve state-of-the-art performance with up to 3.0% in dice similarity coefficient and 4.2% in normalized surface dice. In addition, experimental results on large scale 2D dataset with CT slices show that our method significantly outperforms cutting-edge segmentation methods on all evaluation metrics. Our proposed method promotes new insights into annotation-efficient deep learning for COVID-19 infection segmentation and illustrates strong potential for real-world applications in the global fight against COVID-19 in the absence of sufficient high-quality annotations.","Zhang, Liao, Yuan, Zhu, Xing, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2021.3106341","20210820","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-21","",17272,""

Studies suggest that immediate psychological interventions are needed to protect medical staff during this chaotic situation. However, the importance of mental healthcare for the ""future"" medical staff, such as medical students, remains underestimated compared with that of current medical professionals. Medical students also face potential mental health stressors during their degrees and clinical clerkships, further increasing the risk of their psychological disorders. Hence, they should also be protected from burnout by various measures at governmental, organizational, and individual levels.

"Psychological Well-Being of Trans* People in Italy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Critical Issues and Personal Experiences","The COVID-19 pandemic represents risk to physical health and psychological well-being. Specifically, it causes concerns among minoritized communities, such as transgender/non-binary individuals. The study investigates the experience of this group in Italy during the pandemic and identifies risk factors that exerted negative impacts on psychological well-being and physical health. The study developed an online questionnaire to investigate psychological status, access to medical health services, and factors such as predictors of risk outcomes among transgender/non-binary people during lockdown restrictions. Responses were collected (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°256) on April 2020. Descriptive analysis, univariate analysis of variance, and <i>t</i>-test were conducted. The respondents confirmed several issues, such as worries about the future (58.2%), negative emotions (46.9%), and self-uncertainty (52.7%) during the pandemic. Difficulties in undertaking hormone therapy and access to health facilities were reported. Living with family members represented a significant stressor for psychological well-being, whereas lack of support from LGBTÃ¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°communities was reported. Subjects undergoing psychological therapy during the pandemic reported increases in depression, anxiety, somatization, and lack of privacy in the household.

"Suicidality and Its Associated Factors Among Students in Rural China During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparative Study of Left-Behind and Non-Left-Behind Children","<b>Introduction:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide. The harmful impact of COVID-19 is beyond just physical health concern. The unprecedented public health crisis has also taken its toll on the mental health of adolescents. The present study aims to estimate the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts and investigate the similarities and differences in the influential factors for suicidal ideation and attempts among left-behind children (LBC) and non-left-behind children (NLBC) in rural China during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Method:</b> A total of 761 rural Chinese students, of whom 468 were left behind, completed the cross-sectional questionnaires including demographic data, Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempts. Chi-square test, independent-sample <i>t</i>-test, and logistic regression were performed in the statistical analysis. <b>Results:</b> Overall, 36.4 and 10.4% of rural Chinese students reported suicidal ideation (37.8% for LBC vs. 34.1% for NLBC) and attempts (11.3% for LBC vs. 8.9% for NLBC) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among LBC, parental educational level (adjusted odds ratio, Adj. OR = 1.60), maladaptive strategies (Adj. OR = 1.04), anxious symptoms (Adj. OR = 2.61), and depressive symptoms (Adj. OR = 3.85) were significantly associated with suicidal ideation, while age (Adj. OR = 0.56), maladaptive strategies (Adj. OR = 1.08), symptoms of anxiety (Adj. OR = 3.85), and symptoms of depression (Adj. OR = 2.68) were significantly related to suicidal attempts during the COVID-19 outbreak. Among NLBC, gender (Adj. OR = 2.20), parental educational level (Adj. OR = 1.77), perceived family economic status (Adj. OR = 0.39), anxious symptoms (Adj. OR = 2.38), and depressive symptoms (Adj. OR = 2.77) were significantly associated with suicidal ideation, whereas only anxious symptom (Adj. OR = 5.85) was significantly related to suicidal attempts. <b>Conclusion:</b> Suicidal ideation and attempts are prevalent among students in rural China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our findings also revealed the shared and unique factors for suicidal ideation and attempts among LBC and NLBC during the COVID-19 epidemic. With regard to the differences between LBC and NLBC, the use of maladaptive strategies and age might be vital factors for suicide prevention measures directed specifically toward LBC, whereas interventions sensitive to gender and perceived social economic status should be specifically designed for NLBC amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hou, Mao, Shao, Liu, Dong, Cai","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.708305","20210820","anxious symptoms; depressive symptoms; left-behind children; maladaptive strategies; suicidal attempts; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-21","",17278,""

"Mental health condition of college students compared to non-students during COVID-19 lockdown: the CONFINS study","To estimate the effect of student status on mental health condition during COVID-19 general lockdown in France. Cross-sectional analysis comparing students and non-students recruited in the same study. Participants of the web-based CONFINS study implemented during the general lockdown in France in spring 2020. 2260 participants (78% women) including 1335 students (59%). Through an online questionnaire, participants declared if they have experienced suicidal thoughts, coded their perceived stress on a 10-points scale and completed validated mental health scales (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depressive symptoms, Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety symptoms) during the last 7 days. The effect of college student status on each mental health condition was estimated using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Stratified models for students and non-students were performed to identify population-specific factors. Student status was associated with a higher frequency of depressive symptoms (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.58; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.14), anxiety symptoms (aOR=1.51; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.07), perceived stress (n=1919, aOR=1.70, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.29) and suicidal thoughts (n=1919, aOR=1.57, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.53). Lockdown conditions that could be potentially aggravating on mental health like isolation had a higher impact on students than on non-students. College students were at higher risk of mental health disturbances during lockdown than non-students, even after taking into account several potential confounding factors. A close follow-up and monitoring of students' mental health status is warranted during lockdown periods in this vulnerable population.","Arsandaux, Montagni, Macalli, Texier, Pouriel, Germain, Mebarki, Kinouani, Tournier, Schuck, Tzourio","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053231","20210820","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; epidemiology; mental health; suicide &amp; self-harm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-21","",17280,""

Respondents from a prospective cohort of Southern California young adults (NÃ‚Â = 2,298) reported whether they engaged in various strategies (e.g., substance use, diet, exercise, relaxation) to cope with isolation during the pandemic (each: yes/no). Differences in coping were assessed across five SGM subgroups: heterosexual men and women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, queer (LGBQ) men and women, transgender/nonbinary (TNB) respondents. Negative binomial regressions estimated sexual/gender identity differences in the number of positive or negative behaviors endorsed, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and prepandemic health behaviors. Differences were also tested across individual coping behaviors. Heterosexual women (IRRÃ‚Â = 1.11 [1.01-1.21]), LGBQ men (IRRÃ‚Â = 1.31 [1.12-1.54]), LGBQ women (IRRÃ‚Â = 1.33 [1.19-1.49]), and TNB respondents (IRRÃ‚Â = 1.29 [1.03-1.61]) engaged in more negative coping behaviors than heterosexual men. LGBQ men (IRRÃ‚Â = 1.19 [1.02-1.39]) and LGBQ women (IRRÃ‚Â = 1.20 [1.08-1.34]) also reported more negative coping behaviors versus heterosexual women. Generally, LGBQ men reported the highest prevalence of substance use, while LGBQ women and TNB reported the highest prevalence of adverse eating behaviors and self-harm. SGM young adults may be disproportionately, adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Tailored public health and clinical interventions are needed to decrease pandemic-related SGM health disparities.","Krueger, Barrington-Trimis, Unger, Leventhal","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.07.021","20210820","COVID-19; Coping; Isolation; Sexual and gender minorities; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-21","",17281,""
"Parentsâ€™ and adolescentsâ€™ perceptions of parental involvement and their relationships with depression among Chinese middle school students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Although psychological stress that adolescents may encounter during the COVID-19 pandemic has been of increasing interest to scholars, few studies have examined the profound impact that parents give to adolescents when staying indoors. This study surveyed 1,550 students and their parents from eight middle schools in eastern China. We employed multiple linear regressions with school fixed effects to examine the different perceptions of parental involvement between parents and children, and the relationships between these different types of parental involvement and depression in middle school students. Results indicated that discrepancies existed in their perceptions of behavioral aspects of parental involvement, including parental academic involvement, parent-teacher communication, and parentâ€“child communication. Most saliently, higher levels of parental academic involvement (BÂ =Â 0.051, pÂ <Â 0.05) and lower levels of parentâ€“child communication (BÂ =Â -0.084, pÂ <Â 0.05) perceived by students were associated with higher levels of depression. These findings contribute to the understanding of the association between parental involvement and studentsâ€™ mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2021.106190","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-21","",17282,""
"Home gardens can be more important than other urban green infrastructure for mental well-being during COVID-19 pandemics","The current COVID-19 pandemics is a major threat to human populations. The disease has rapidly spread, causing mass hospitalization and the loss of millions of people mainly in urban areas which are hubs for contagion. At the same time, the social distancing practices required for containing the outbreak have caused an eruption of mental illnesses that include symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. The severity of such mental distress is modulated by the context of media coverage and the information and guidelines from local health authorities. Different urban green infrastructures, such as gardens, parks, and green views can be important for mitigating mental distress during the pandemics. However, it is unclear whether some urban green infrastructures are more efficient than others in reducing mental distress or whether their effectiveness changes with the context. Here we assess the relative importance of different urban green infrastructures on the mental distress of residents of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We show that although urban parks and green views are important, home gardens are the most efficient in mitigating mental distress. This is likely related to the practice of self-isolation seen for the residents of Rio de Janeiro. Information on the efficiency of different urban green infrastructures in mitigating mental distress can be important to help guide programs to inform the public about the best practices for maintaining mental health during the current outbreak. This can also help planning cities that are more resilient to future pandemics.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127268","20210901","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-21","",17283,""
