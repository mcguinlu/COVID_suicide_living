"Predictors of Threat from COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study in the Spanish Population","One of the first measures for fighting the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is social isolation or quarantine. The perceived threat from COVID-19 in this situation, maintained over time, generates uncertainty and fears, etc., which could lead to mental disorders in the population. This study evaluated the perceived threat from COVID-19 in the Spanish population. <b>T</b>he study design was cross-sectional and observational. The sample of 1014 participants recruited in Spain had a mean age of 40.87 (<i>SD</i> = 12.42). The gender distribution was 67.2% (n = 681) women and 32.8% (n = 333) men. Data were collected with an online survey. The instrument used was the Perception of Threat from COVID-19 Questionnaire, validated for the Spanish population. Our data showed a clear correlation between perceived threat with female gender, having children in one's care and level of education. However, no association was observed with age or marital status. Finally, we concluded that there is a greater perception of threat from COVID-19 by women with a lower education who have children in their care, and that they are also more sensitive to minor mental disorders, such as anxiety or stress, appearing.","PÃƒÂ©rez-Fuentes, Herrera-Peco, Jurado, Oropesa, GÃƒÂ¡zquez Linares","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10040692","20210213","COVID-19; coronavirus; public mental health; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-14","",10726,""
"The Psychological Impact of Strict and Prolonged Confinement on Business Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic at a Spanish University","The study was carried out to examine the situation of university students from one month after the beginning of a very strict confinement process in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students responded to a survey which included the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) together with other questions relating to their general well-being from the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS). A total of 198 university students answered the web-based survey. The questionnaire was generated using Microsoft Forms and was explained and distributed online. The results indicated that around 18.7% of students were suffering from severe anxiety and 70.2% were suffering either mild or moderate anxiety at this point of the strict confinement process. The findings show that when emotional well-being (quality of sleep, the perception of feeling fear, death of a relative) is reduced and material well-being is negatively affected (income level) anxiety levels are increased. On the other hand, the results show that having good interpersonal relationships with family members and taking care of personal development (routines and habits that make them feel good) help reduce anxiety levels. The female students in the sample also suffered higher levels of anxiety than males during strict confinement.","Garvey, GarcÃƒÂ­a, Otal Franco, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041710","20210213","COVID-19; GAD-7; anxiety; confinement; global health; mental health; sleep disorder; social support; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-14","",10727,""
"Evaluation of the mental health status of community healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across China and many countries worldwide, and community healthcare workers at the front lines of disease control are under high physical and mental pressure. This study investigated the mental health status of community healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in Sichuan Province, China. This cross-sectional study, which was conducted from February 8 to 18, 2020, involved 450 healthcare workers in 18 community hospitals who had worked for more than 1 year. A self-designed demographic data questionnaire and Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) were provided to the participants through links and quick response codes. The respondents completed and submitted the questionnaires online. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze multiple factors related to the SCL-90 scores of these community healthcare workers in China. For the 450 community healthcare workers who completed the study, the median scores in each SCL-90 factor were lower than the Chinese norms, and 119 (26.4%) participants were SCL-90 positive. Among them, 178 participants were doctors and had the highest scores on most SCL-90 factors except for obsessive compulsiveness, hostility, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism (PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.05). The top 3 positive items for doctors working in the community were obsessive compulsiveness, others, and somatization, and those among nurses were obsessive compulsiveness, others, and hostility. Sex, type of workers, and occupational exposure risk to COVID-19 were independent risk factors for the mental health status of the community healthcare workers. Overall, the community healthcare workers experienced psychological problems during the COVID-19 outbreak in Sichuan Province, China. More attention should be paid to the mental health of these workers, and their mental status should be regularly assessed. Psychological interventions should be provided to those with serious mental problems through networks or telephone visits.","Zhang, Deng, Liu, Xu, Fang","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000024739","20210213","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-14","",10728,""
"Liuzijue is a promising exercise option for rehabilitating discharged COVID-19 patients","Among discharged COVID-19 patients, the health-related quality of life is poor, and patients suffer from significant physical and psychological impairment. This study was designed to investigate the effects of Liuzijue exercise on the rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients. Thirty three eligible patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study after discharge. All the participants practiced Liuzijue exercise once per day for 20 minutes over 4Ã¢â‚¬Å weeks. Data were collected at baseline and the end of the intervention. Primary outcomes involved functional capacity and secondary outcomes involved quality of life. The maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), peak inspiratory flow (PIF), and diaphragm movement in deep breathing (DM-DB) of patients increased significantly after 4Ã¢â‚¬Å weeks of intervention. The dyspnea was also alleviated and exercise capacity was significantly improved. In terms of quality of life, physical functioning and role-physical scores were significantly increased. Moreover, Liuzijue could significantly alleviate the depression and anxiety status of the patients. Liuzijue exercise is a viable alternative home exercise program that produced better functional capacity and quality of life in discharged patients with COVID-19. These findings also showed the necessity of rehabilitation intervention for cured COVID-19 patients.","Tang, Jiang, Shen, Li, You, Liu, Chen, Wang, Zhou, Feng","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000024564","20210213","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-14","",10729,""
