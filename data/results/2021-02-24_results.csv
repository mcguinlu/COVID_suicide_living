"Depression and anxiety before and during the COVID-19 lockdown: a longitudinal cohort study with university students","Background: For young people, just as in the general population, COVID-19 caused many changes in their lives, including an increased risk for mental illness symptoms. We aimed to study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in anxiety and depression symptoms in a cohort of university students. Methods: This study is part of broader longitudinal research on university students' mental health with data of the Portuguese version of The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Portuguese version of the Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) with evaluations on January, May and October 2019 and June 2020, as well as socio-demographic information. Results: 341 university students (257 females and 84 males) were included, with a mean age of 19.91 (SD=1.58). In June 2020, the mean for perceived wellbeing loss was 60.47% (SD=26.56) and 59.54% (SD=28.95) for mental health loss. The proportion of students with scores equal to or above 15 in the PHQ-9 ranged between 22.6% and 25.5% in 2019 and 37.0% in June 2020. The proportion of GAD-7 scores above cut-off ten ranged between 46.0% and 47.8% in 2019 and 64.5% in 2020. Compared with preceding trends, PHQ-9 scores were 3.11 (CI=2.40-3.83) higher than expected, and GAD-7 scores were 3.56 (CI=2.75-5.37) higher. Discussion: COVID-19 impacted negatively depressive and anxiety symptoms, confirming previous studies and young people's vulnerability in such uncertain times.","Virginia Conceicao; Ines Rothes; Ricardo Gusmao; Henrique Barros","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.23.21252284","20210224","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-24","",11061,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among Greek adults: a cross-sectional survey","The COVID19 virus characterised as a pandemic in 2020 at its outbreak around the world has been recorded to have severe effects on the global health and mental health. The current research is accomplished during the first period of the restrictive measures in Greece March and April 2020 and is aiming to evaluate the COVID19 effect on mental health of the population. The STAI and DASS21 questionnaires have been used in order to accomplish the aims of the study. The results (n = 527) show a moderate level on mental health status of the sample STAI-S: 45.8, STAI-T: 40.7, Depression: 4.6, Anxiety: 3.1 and Stress: 6.1. The research shows that women, younger respondents, lower income households and those living on smaller houses suffer from increased depression, anxiety and stress. Additionally, factors of the daily habits within the period of COVID19 such as mask, gloves and use of antiseptic can drastically decrease illnesses of mental health. Such findings can be used from the Greek State in order to reduce the effects of COVID19 in mental health of the population and protect the socially vulnerable groups.","Efthimios Dragotis; Korina Atsopardi; Anastasia Barbouni; Konstantinos Farsalinos; Konstantinos Poulas","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.20.21252129","20210223","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-24","",11062,""
"Health-related quality of life of adult COVID-19 patients following one-month illness experience since diagnosis: findings of a cross-sectional study in Bangladesh","Background: The pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) stances an incredible impact on the quality of life of the patients. The disease not only denigrates the physical health of the patients but also affects their mental health. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients. Methods: The study was conducted at the National Institute of Preventive and Social Medicine (NIPSOM), Dhaka, Bangladesh during the period from June to November 2020. The study enrolled 1204 adult (>18 years) COVID-19 patients diagnosed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and completed the one-month duration of illness. The patients were interviewed with the CDC HRQOL-14 questionnaire to assess their HRQOL. Data were collected by telephone-interview and reviewing medical records using a semi-structured questionnaire and checklist respectively. Informed consent was obtained from each patient before data collection. Results: The majority of the COVID-19 patients were males (72.3%), urban residents (50.2%), and diverse service holders (49.6%). More than one-third (35.5%) of patients had comorbidity including hypertension (55.6%), diabetes mellitus (55.6%), ischaemic heart disease (16.4%), chronic lung (12.4%), kidney (2.8%), and liver (4.2%) diseases. The mean duration of physical illness was 9.83 days, and it was 7.97 days for mental illness. During the one-month disease course, the general health condition was excellent/very good/good in 70.1% of the patients while it was fair/poor in 29.8% of the patients. Older age, sex, and marital status were significantly associated with at least one dimension of HRQOL. Patients having symptoms of COVID-19 and comorbidity had significantly poorer HRQOL. Conclusion: COVID-19 pretenses a significant impact on the HRQOL of the patients including physical and mental illness during the clinical course. Our findings suggest more pragmatic preventive, promotive, and curative measures considering illness experiences of the COVID-19 patients to restore their quality of life.","Md.

"Analyzing Socioeconomic Factors and Health Disparity of COVID-19 Spatiotemporal Spread Patterns at Neighborhood Levels in San Diego County","This study analyzed spatiotemporal spread patterns of COVID-19 confirmed cases at the zip code level in the County of San Diego and compared them to neighborhood social and economic factors. We used correlation analysis, regression models, and geographic weighted regression to identify important factors and spatial patterns. We broke down the temporal confirmed case patterns into four stages from 1 April 2020 to 31 December 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak hotspots in San Diego County are South Bay, El Cajon, Escondido, and rural areas. The spatial patterns among different stages may represent fundamental health disparity issues in neighborhoods. We also identified important variables with strong positive or negative correlations in these categories: ethnic groups, languages, economics, and education. The highest association variables were Pop5andOlderSpanish (Spanish-speaking) in Stage 4 (0.79) and Pop25OlderLess9grade (Less than 9th grade education) in Stage 4 (0.79). We also observed a clear pattern that regions with more well-educated people have negative associations with COVID-19. Additionally, our OLS regression models suggested that more affluent populations have a negative relationship with COVID-19 cases. Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak is not only a medical disease but a social inequality and health disparity problem.","Ming-Hsiang Tsou; Jian Xu; Chii-Dean Lin; Morgan Daniels; Eunjeong Ko; Joseph Gibbons","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.22.21251757","20210223","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-24","",11064,""

"Are biased interpretations of ambiguous social and non-social situations a precursor, consequence or maintenance factor of youth loneliness?","Loneliness is common in youth, with suggestions that these negative emotions confer vulnerability for anxiety and depression  Here, we investigated for the first time whether, consistent with psychological models of loneliness, biased interpretations of social situations could prospectively predict loneliness in youth  104 young people completed measures of loneliness and interpretations of ambiguous social and non-social (bodily or health-related) situations at three time-points with intervals of three months between each  As government-imposed social distancing measures (to control the COVID-19 outbreak) occurred between Times 2 and 3 (but not between Times 1 and 2), this enabled us to assess whether restricted social activity could provoke greater predictive power of biased interpretational styles on loneliness  Using cross-lagged panel models, we showed that after estimating paths representing within-time across-variable (â€œconcurrentâ€) paths and across-time within-variable (â€œstabilityâ€) paths, there were no significant cross-lag â€˜causalâ€™ paths between earlier interpretational style and later loneliness  Between Time 2 and 3, we demonstrated a significant cross-lag â€˜consequentialâ€™ path between earlier loneliness and later threatening interpretations of social situations, but this became non-significant after controlling for concurrent anxiety and depression  Biased interpretational style may reflect a concurrent maintenance factor of youth loneliness","Lau, Jennifer Y.

"Pandemic and mental health of the front-line healthcare workers: A review and implications in the Indian context amidst COVID-19","Pandemic, being unprecedented, leads to several mental health problems, especially among the front-line healthcare workers (HCW)  Front-line HCWs often suffer from anxiety, depression, burnout, insomnia and stress-related disorders  This is mediated to a large extent by the biopsychological vulnerabilities of the individuals;socioenvironmental factors such as the risk of exposure to infection, effective risk communication to HCWs, availability of personal protective equipment, job-related stress, perceived stigma and psychological impact of the isolation/quarantine and interpersonal distancing also play the major roles  Despite the huge magnitude of mental health problems among the front-line HCWs, their psychological health is often overlooked  Some of the potential measures to reduce the mental health problems of the front-line HCWs are effective communication, tangible support from the administration/seniors, mental health problem screening-and interventional-facilities, making quarantine/isolation less restrictive and ensuring interpersonal communication through the various digital platforms, proactively curtailing the misinformation/rumour spread by the media and strict legal measures against violence/ill treatment with the HCWs, and so on  India, along with other countries who lately got affected by the COVID-19, must learn from the experiences of the other countries and also from the previous pandemics as to how to address the mental health needs of their front-line HCWs and ensure HCWs' mental well-being, thereby improving their productivity  Current review attempts to highlight the mental health aspects of the pandemic on the front-line HCWs, discusses some of the contentious issues and provides future directions particularly concerning COVID-19 in the Indian context and other low-resource countries  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Gupta, Snehil, Sahoo, Swapnajeet","https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100284","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: General Psychiatry;33(5):1-10, 2020.; Publication details: General Psychiatry;33(5):1-10, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-24","",11079,""

"Shock digitalisation of education: The perception of participants of the educational process","Introduction  The relevance of the study is determined both by the importance of the problem of digital transformation of education in general, and by the specific conditions, which arose during the crisis caused by COVID-19  The long-term consequences of the emergency transition of Russian education to the distance format, taking into account the ongoing pandemic, have yet to be assessed, but the reaction of the participants in the educational process to the first period of the total distance learning should be analysed immediately as a basis for future management decisions  Aim  The aim of the present research is a comprehensive analysis of the perception of the experience of an emergency transition to a distant education format by the main participants in the educational process  Methodology and research methods  Online survey based on Google forms was employed as the main method  The respondents to the survey included participants in the educational process, mostly permanently residing in the Sverdlovsk region (99% of the respondents)  The survey was conducted in September - October 2020  The survey participation was voluntary and completely anonymous  As a result of the survey conducted, more than 24,500 original responses were received and processed  The data obtained were compared with the results of secondary studies (primarily, with the monitoring studies of the Higher School of Economics)  Results  The research findings demonstrate a number of significant shortcomings in the strategy of digital transformation of education, such as the insufficient development of the digital communication infrastructure in the regions, the technological and competence-based digital inequality, the lack of well-developed methods of using digital educational tools, the lack of high-quality content, the lack of full-fledged integrated educational resources on the market  The shortcomings mentioned above apparently led to a decrease in the quality of education during the period of self-isolation and provoked a reaction of rejection of digital educational forms and an increase in technological pessimism among a significant part of the respondents  The results are presented in correlation with secondary studies, which confirms the reliability of the general conclusions  Scientific novelty  The scientific novelty of the research lies in the attraction, systematisation and analytical generalisation of original material on the urgent problem of digital transformation of education, collected in one of the largest and technologically advanced regions of the Russian Federation  Practical significance  The current article makes it possible to more accurately assess the situation in regional education and provides reference points both for conducting longitudinal research and for making current and strategic management decisions in Russian education at the regional and federal level  Â© 2021 Russian State Vocational Pedagogical University  All rights reserved","Nazarov, V.

"SARS-CoV-2 early infection signature identified potential key infection mechanisms and drug targets","BACKGROUND: The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has caused devastating mortality and posed a significant threat to public health worldwide. Despite the severity of this illness andÂ 2.3 million worldwide deaths, the disease mechanism is mostly unknown. Previous studies that characterized differential gene expression due to SARS-CoV-2 infection lacked robust validation. Although vaccines are Â now available, effective treatment options are still out of reach. RESULTS: To characterize the transcriptional activity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a gene signature consisting of 25 genes was generated using a publicly available RNA-SequencingÂ (RNA-Seq) dataset of cultured cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. The signature estimated infection level accurately in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy and infected patients (mean 0.001 vs. 0.958; P < 0.0001). These signature genes were investigated in their ability to distinguish the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a single-cell RNA-Sequencing dataset. TNFAIP3, PPP1R15A, NFKBIA, and IFIT2 had shown bimodal gene expression in various immune cells from severely infected patients compared to healthy or moderate infection cases. Finally, this signature was assessed using the publicly available ConnectivityMap database to identify potential disease mechanisms and drug repurposing candidates. Pharmacological classes of tricyclic antidepressants, SRC-inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, and drugs such as atorvastatin, ibuprofen, and ketoconazole showed strong negative associations (connectivity score < - 90), highlighting the need for further evaluation of these candidates for their efficacy in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, using the 25-gene SARS-CoV-2 infection signature, the SARS-CoV-2 infection status was capturedÂ in BALF cells, PBMCs and postmortem lung biopsies. In addition, candidate SARS-CoV-2 therapies with known safety profiles were identified. The signature genes could potentially also be used to characterize the COVID-19 disease severity in patients' expression profiles of BALF cells.","Li, Yue; Duche, Ashley; Sayer, Michael R; Roosan, Don; Khalafalla, Farid G; Ostrom, Rennolds S; Totonchy, Jennifer; Roosan, Moom R","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07433-4","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Genomics;22(1): 125, 2021 Feb 18.; Publication details: BMC Genomics;22(1): 125, 2021 Feb 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-24","",11116,""
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and global mental health","The mental health effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may shape population health for many years to come. Failure to address the mental health issues stemming from the pandemic is likely to prolong its impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a significant global challenge and, in lower-income countries, even a disruption of mental health services. Given our experience with previous pandemics, the present COVID-19 crisis can be expected to cause psychological trauma, and steps are needed to address this issue proactively. A focus on the long-term mental health consequences may be at least as important as the measures currently seeking to mitigate the short-term effects of COVID-19 and to save lives. The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for mental health call for a greater focus on the needs of those with mental disorders and on mental health issues affecting health care workers and the general public. Timely preventive and therapeutic mental health care is essential in addressing the psychosocial needs of populations exposed to the pandemic. In addition to specialist care, ""task-shifting"" and digital technologies may provide cost-effective means of providing mental health care in lower-income countries worldwide as well as in higher-income countries with mental health services overwhelmed by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In view of the ever-increasing pressure on global health systems resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, adopting and adapting ""task-shifting"", i.e. the delegation of psychotherapeutic interventions to trained non-specialists, as an element of the provision of mental health services, is overdue. Digital technologies can be used to enhance social support and facilitate resilience to the detrimental mental health effects of the pandemic; they may also offer an efficient and cost-effective way to provide easy access to mental health care.","Lange, Klaus W","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.glohj.2021.02.004","","Country: CN; CHINA; CHINA; CHINA; REPUBLIC OF CHINA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Glob Health J;2021 Feb 13.; Publication details: Glob Health J;2021 Feb 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-24","",11117,""

"Effect of Layperson-Delivered, Empathy-Focused Program of Telephone Calls on Loneliness, Depression, and Anxiety Among Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Randomized Clinical Trial","Loneliness is a risk factor for many clinical conditions, but there are few effective interventions deployable at scale. To determine whether a layperson-delivered, empathy-focused program of telephone calls could rapidly improve loneliness, depression, and anxiety in at-risk adults. From July 6 to September 24, 2020, we recruited and followed up 240 adults who were assigned to receive calls (intervention group) or no calls (control group) via block randomization. Loneliness, depression, and anxiety were measured using validated scales at enrollment and after 4 weeks. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted. Meals on Wheels Central Texas (MOWCTX) clients received calls in their homes or wherever they might have been when the call was received. The study included MOWCTX clients who fit their service criteria, including being homebound and expressing a need for food. A total of 296 participants were screened, of whom 240 were randomized to intervention or control. Sixteen callers, aged 17 to 23 years, were briefly trained in empathetic conversational techniques. Each called 6 to 9 participants over 4 weeks daily for the first 5 days, after which clients could choose to drop down to fewer calls but no less than 2 calls a week. Primary outcome was loneliness (3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, range 3-9; and 6-item De Jong Giervald Loneliness [De Jong] Scale, range 0-6). Secondary outcomes were depression (Personal Health Questionnaire for Depression), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), and self-rated health (Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire). The 240 participants were aged 27 to 101 years, with 63% aged at least 65 years (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°149 of 232), 56% living alone (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°135 of 240), 79% women (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°190 of 240), 39% Black or African American (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°94 of 240), and 22% Hispanic or Latino (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°52 of 240), and all reported at least 1 chronic condition. Of 240 participants enrolled, 13 were lost to follow-up in the intervention arm and 1 in the control arm. Postassessment differences between intervention and control after 4 weeks showed an improvement of 1.1 on the UCLA Loneliness Scale (95% CI, 0.5-1.7; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; Cohen d of 0.48), and improvement of 0.32 on De Jong (95% CI, -0.20 to 0.81; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.06; Cohen d, 0.17) for loneliness; an improvement of 1.5 on the Personal Health Questionnaire for Depression (95% CI, 0.22-2.7; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; Cohen d, 0.31) for depression; and an improvement of 1.8 on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (95% CI, 0.44 to 3.2; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; Cohen d, 0.35) for anxiety. General physical health on the Short Form Health Questionnaire Survey showed no change, but mental health improved by 2.6 (95% CI, 0.81 to 4.4; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.003; Cohen d of 0.46). A layperson-delivered, empathy-oriented telephone call program reduced loneliness, depression, and anxiety compared with the control group and improved the general mental health of participants within 4 weeks. Future research can determine whether effects on depression and anxiety can be extended to maximize clinical relevance.

"Review of the current empirical literature on using videoconferencing to deliver individual psychotherapies to adults with mental health problems","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread adoption of videoconferencing as a communication medium in mental health service delivery. This review considers the empirical literature to date on using videoconferencing to deliver psychological therapy to adults presenting with mental health problems. Papers were identified via search of relevant databases. Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted and synthesized on uptake, feasibility, outcomes, and participant and therapist experiences. Videoconferencing has an established evidence base in the delivery of cognitive behavioural therapies for post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, with prolonged exposure, cognitive processing therapy, and behavioural activation non-inferior to in-person delivery. There are large trials reporting efficacy for health anxiety and bulimia nervosa compared with treatment-as-usual. Initial studies show applicability of cognitive behavioural therapies for other anxiety and eating disorders and obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, but there has yet to be study of use in severe and complex mental health problems. Therapists may find it more difficult to judge non-verbal behaviour, and there may be initial discomfort while adapting to videoconferencing, but client ratings of the therapeutic alliance are similar to in-person therapy, and videoconferencing may have advantages such as being less confronting. There may be useful opportunities for videoconferencing in embedding therapy delivery within the client's own environment. Videoconferencing is an accessible and effective modality for therapy delivery. Future research needs to extend beyond testing whether videoconferencing can replicate in-person therapy delivery to consider unique therapeutic affordances of the videoconferencing modality. Videoconferencing is an efficacious means of delivering behavioural and cognitive therapies to adults with mental health problems. Trial evidence has established it is no less efficacious than in-person therapy for prolonged exposure, cognitive processing therapy, and behavioural activation. While therapists report nonverbal feedback being harder to judge, and clients can take time to adapt to videoconferencing, clients rate the therapeutic alliance and satisfaction similarly to therapy in-person. Videoconferencing provides opportunities to integrate therapeutic exercises within the person's day-to-day environment.","Thomas, McDonald, de Boer, Brand, Nedeljkovic, Seabrook","https://doi.org/10.1111/papt.12332","20210223","cognitive behavioural therapy; telehealth; telemental health; videoconferencing psychotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-24","",11120,""
"Management of Melanoma Patients During COVID-19 Pandemic In An Italian Skin Unit","Due to the COVID-19 crisis, many scheduled medical and surgical activities have been suspended. This interruption to the healthcare system can negatively affect the diagnosis and management of melanoma. Neglecting melanoma throughout the outbreak may be associated with increased rates of mortality, morbidity, and healthcare expenses. We performed a retrospective review of all dermatological and surgical activity performed in our Melanoma Skin Unit between February 23, 2020 and May 21, 2020 and compared these data with those from the same period in 2019. During the lockdown period, we observed a decrease in dermatologic follow-up (DFU) (-30.2%) and in surgical follow-up (SFU) (-37%), and no modification of melanoma diagnosis (-3%). Finally, surgical excisions (SE) (+ 31.7%) increased, but sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) (-29%) and lymph node dissections(LND) (-64%) decreased compared to the same period in 2019. Our experience supports the continuation of surgical and diagnostic procedures in patients with melanoma during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surgical and follow-up procedures for the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma should not be postponed considering that the pandemic is lasting for an extended period.

"COVID-19 threatens maternal mental health and infant development: possible paths from stress and isolation to adverse outcomes and a call for research and practice","The COVID-19 pandemic exposed mothers to stress and social isolation during the pre- and post-natal periods. The deleterious effects of stress on both pregnant women and their infants are well documented, with research suggesting that effects are exacerbated by reduced social support. In this brief report, we summarize evidence linking stress and social isolation to negative outcomes for mothers and infants and present a conceptual model featuring inflammation as a driving mechanism. There is strong evidence that the coronavirus pandemic will affect mothers and infants through immune pathways that, in previous research, have been shown to link stress and social isolation during the pre- and post-natal periods with deficits in maternal mental health and infant well-being and development across developmental stages. We close with recommendations for novel research, policy changes, and integrated clinical care that can address these biological threats to infants and mothers while leveraging the anti-inflammatory effects of social support.","Venta, Bick, Bechelli","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-021-01140-7","20210223","Attachment; COVID-19; Inflammation; Mental health; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-24","",11122,""
"Anxiety among the Sudanese university students during the initial stage of COVID-19 pandemic","Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), many people were facing daily life changes that could predispose them to anxiety. For the Sudanese university students, the situation is even more complicated because of the limited availability of online learning and the difficult economic situation of the country. The <b>objective</b> of this study is to assess the students' anxiety levels. <b>The method</b> we used was a cross-section of the university students in Sudan using a proportionate stratified random sampling technique to assess their anxiety level using Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) during the COVID-19 pandemic through an online self-administered questionnaire. <b>Results</b> indicated that of the 478 participants, 75.1% had a low anxiety level, 15.5% had a moderate anxiety level and 9.4% had a potentially concerning level of anxiety. Experiencing no symptoms during the past 14 days was associated with a low level of anxiety. Moreover, experiencing fever, sore throat, and myalgia or fatigue were associated with low to moderate anxiety levels among the participants. While having a relative or a friend diagnosed or suspected with the disease or having headache were associated with a low anxiety level, Thus <b>the conclusion</b> was that not complying with the curfew measures, and the preventive etiquette of covering mouth while coughing or sneezing were associated with potentially concerning levels of anxiety while experiencing fever, sore throat and myalgia were associated with moderate anxiety levels. More research should be conducted to study the psychological influences of pandemics on students in developing countries.","Abas, Alejail, Ali","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06300","20210223","Anxiety; Coronavirus; Physical distancing; Public mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-24","",11123,""
"Changes in work and life patterns associated with depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: an observational study of health app (<i>CALO mama</i>) users","During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people refrained from going out, started working from home (WFH), and suspended work or lost their jobs. This study examines how such pandemic-related changes in work and life patterns were associated with depressive symptoms. An online survey among participants who use a health app called <i>CALO mama</i> was conducted from 30 April to 8 May 2020 in Japan. Participants consisted of 2846 users (1150 men (mean age=50.3) and 1696 women (mean age=43.0)) who were working prior to the government declaration of a state of emergency (7 April 2020). Their daily steps from 1 January to 13 May 2020 recorded by an accelerometer in their mobile devices were linked to their responses. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Two-Question Screen. On average, participants took 1143.8 (95% CI -1557.3 to -730.2) fewer weekday steps during the declaration period (from 7 April to 13 May). Depressive symptoms were positively associated with female gender (OR=1.58, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.34 to 1.87), decreased weekday steps (OR=1.22, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.45) and increased working hours (OR=1.73, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.26). Conversely, starting WFH was negatively associated with depressive symptoms (OR=0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99). Decreased weekday steps during the declaration period were associated with increased odds of depressive symptoms, but WFH may mitigate the risk in the short term.

"Short-term impact of the COVID-19 confinement measures on health behaviours and weight gain among adults in Belgium","In Belgium, confinement measures were introduced on the 13th of March 2020 to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). These measures may affect health behaviours of the population such as eating habits, physical activity and alcohol consumption, which in turn can lead to weight gain resulting in overweight and obesity, increasing the risk of several chronic diseases, but also of severe COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of confinement measures on health behaviours and their associations with weight gain. Data were derived from the second national COVID-19 health survey. Data were collected between the 16th and the 23rd of April 2020. The recruitment of participants was based on snowball sampling via Sciensano's website, invitations via e-mail and social media. The study sample includes participants aged 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and over with no missing data on the variables of interest (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°28,029). The association between self-reported weight gain and health behaviour changes, adjusted for gender, age group and household composition was assessed through OR's (95% CI) calculated with logistic regression models, using post-stratification weights. Overall, 28.6% reported weight gain after 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks of confinement. Higher odds of weight gain were observed among participants who increased or decreased their consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.39 (1.15-1.68) and 1.29 (1.04-1.60), respectively), among those who increased their consumption of sweet or salty snacks (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.65 (3.27-4.07)), among those who became less physically active (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.91 (1.71-2.13)), and among those who increased their alcohol consumption (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 1.86 (1.66-2.08)). The most important correlates of weight gain during confinement were an increased consumption of sweet or salty snacks and being less physically active. These findings confirm the impact of diet and exercise on short term weight gain and plead to take more action, in supporting people to achieve healthier behaviours in order to tackle overweight and obesity, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Drieskens, Berger, Vandevijvere, Gisle, Braekman, Charafeddine, De Ridder, Demarest","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-021-00542-2","20210223","COVID-19; Change in health behaviours; Confinement; Weight gain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-24","",11126,""
"Gender-related variables for health research","In this paper, we argue for Gender as a Sociocultural Variable (GASV) as a complement to Sex as a Biological Variable (SABV). Sex (biology) and gender (sociocultural behaviors and attitudes) interact to influence health and disease processes across the lifespan-which is currently playing out in the COVID-19 pandemic. This study develops a gender assessment tool-the Stanford Gender-Related Variables for Health Research-for use in clinical and population research, including large-scale health surveys involving diverse Western populations. While analyzing sex as a biological variable is widely mandated, gender as a sociocultural variable is not, largely because the field lacks quantitative tools for analyzing the influence of gender on health outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive review of English-language measures of gender from 1975 to 2015 to identify variables across three domains: gender norms, gender-related traits, and gender relations. This yielded 11 variables tested with 44 items in three US cross-sectional survey populations: two internet-based (N = 2051; N = 2135) and a patient-research registry (N = 489), conducted between May 2017 and January 2018. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses reduced 11 constructs to 7 gender-related variables: caregiver strain, work strain, independence, risk-taking, emotional intelligence, social support, and discrimination. Regression analyses, adjusted for age, ethnicity, income, education, sex assigned at birth, and self-reported gender identity, identified associations between these gender-related variables and self-rated general health, physical and mental health, and health-risk behaviors. Our new instrument represents an important step toward developing more comprehensive and precise survey-based measures of gender in relation to health. Our questionnaire is designed to shed light on how specific gender-related behaviors and attitudes contribute to health and disease processes, irrespective of-or in addition to-biological sex and self-reported gender identity. Use of these gender-related variables in experimental studies, such as clinical trials, may also help us understand if gender factors play an important role as treatment-effect modifiers and would thus need to be further considered in treatment decision-making.","Nielsen, Stefanick, Peragine, Neilands, Ioannidis, Pilote, Prochaska, Cullen, Einstein, Klinge, LeBlanc, Paik, Schiebinger","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13293-021-00366-3","20210223","Biomedical outcomes; Gender measures; Sex differences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-24","",11127,""
