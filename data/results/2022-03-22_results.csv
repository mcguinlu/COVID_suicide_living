"A 16-Month Longitudinal Investigation of Risk and Protective Factors for Mental Health Outcomes Throughout Three National Lockdowns and a Mass Vaccination Campaign: Evidence from a Weighted Israeli Sample During COVID-19","Background. The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global crisis, with a multitude of factors that affect mental health worldwide. Here, we explore potential predictors for the emergence and maintenance of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in the general population in Israel. Methods. Across the span of 16 months, 2,478 people completed a repeated self-report survey which inquired psychiatric symptoms and pandemic related stress factors (PRSF). PRSF were divided into four clusters of environmental stressors: financial, health-related, fatigue and sense of protection by authorities. We applied mixed-effects linear models to assess how each stressor contributes to depression, anxiety and PTSS at each time point, alongside a longitudinal exploration among participants who completed at least two consecutive surveys (n=400). Results. Fatigue was the strongest predictor for depression, anxiety and PTSS at all time points (standardized {beta} between 0.28-0.60, p<.0001), and predicted deterioration overtime ({beta} between 0.22-0.36, p<.0001). Financial concerns associated with depression and anxiety at all time points ({beta} between 0.13-0.26, p<.01), and with their deterioration overtime ({beta} between 0.16-0.18, p<.0001), while health related concerns were uniquely associated with anxiety and PTSS at all time points ({beta} between 0.14-0.29, p<.01) and their deterioration ({beta} between 0.11-0.16, p<.001), but not with depression. Improvement in sense of protection overtime associated with decrease in depression and anxiety ({beta} between -0.09 to -0.16, p<.01). Conclusions. Our findings accentuate the multitude of risk factors for psychiatric morbidity during COVID-19, and the dynamics in their association with different aspects of psychopathology at various time points.","Nimrod Hertz-Palmor; Shachar Ruppin; Noam Matalon; Mariela Mosheva; Shirel Dorman-Ilan; Asia Avinir; Ehud Mekori-Domachevsky; Ilanit Hasson-Ohayon; Raz Gross; Doron Gothelf; Itai Pessach","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.18.22272624","20220321","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28762,""
"Psychological impact on people Due to Pandemic of Covid-19 in selected Areas of Mumbai","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is defined as an illness caused by a novel coronavirus, now called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2;formerly called 2019-nCoV). COVID-19 is an emerging respiratory infection that was first discovered in December 2019, in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China.1 The 2019-nCoV has close similarity to bat coronaviruses, and it has been postulated that bats are the primary source. While the origin of the 2019-nCoV is still being investigated, current evidence suggests spread to humans occurred via transmission from wild animals illegally sold in the Huainan Seafood Wholesale Market.2 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the larger family of ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses, leading to infections, from the common cold, to more serious diseases, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).1 The main symptoms of COVID-19 have been identified as fever, dry cough, fatigue, myalgia, shortness of breath, and dyspnoea.1 COVID-19 is characterized by rapid transmission, and can occur by close contact with an infected person.1 COVID-19 has spread widely and rapidly, from Wuhan city, to other parts of the world, threatening the lives of many people 1. By the end of January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a public health emergency of international concern and called for the collaborative effort of all countries, to prevent its rapid spread. Later, the WHO declared COVID-19 a ""global pandemic"" 1. It is mainly transmitted through respiratory and close contact, which leads to the phenomenon of clustering infection in families and hospitals. Because of the sudden nature of the outbreak and the infectious power of the virus, it will inevitably cause people anxiety, depression and other stress reactions.3 It is necessary to understand and investigate the public psychological states during this tumultuous time.3 The results of the survey are of great practical significance to the information provision, cognition, behavior guidance and psychological support of governments at all levels.3 Understanding and investigating the public psychological states during this tumultuous time is of practical significance.3 Social and family attention and mental health support are essential. 3However, we think that the psychological impact of this pandemic like stress and anxiety among the general population is also a grave concern. Hence, this study attempted to find the psychological impact of COVID 19 on people in selected areas in Mumbai. Objectives: (1) To assess the psychological impact on people due to the pandemic of COVID-19 (2) To find the association between psychological impact and their selected demographic variables (age, gender, religion, marital status, educational status, occupation, family type, income, area of residence, and housing type). Review of literature: 3 sections (1) Studies related to psychological impact of COVID 19 on general population (2) Studies related to psychological impact of COVID 19 on health professionals (3) Studies related to psychological impact of COVID 19 on students. The Conceptual framework for the study was based on Health Promotion Model. Methodology: The Research Design used was descriptive study. The sample size was 200 people from selected areas of Mumbai. The samples were selected by using snow ball method. The data were collected by using selfadministered 4 point Likert scale which was developed by the investigators. The tool was validated by 5 experts. Reliability was established by split half method. (r = 0.8). The main study was conducted in selected areas of Mumbai. The data collected were tabulated, analysed and interpreted using statistical test such as chi square. Findings of the study: The findings of the study revealed that there was severe psychological impact due to the pandemic of COVID-19 among the people. There was no significant association between psychological impact and age, sex, religion, marital status, family type, income, area of residence, and housing type excep educational status and occupation which were significant (chi square values 21.03) for the psychological impact on the people and the rest of the demographic variables are found to be non-significant. Conclusion: The study concluded by stating the fact that, the psychological impact of people due to the pandemic of covid-19 was severe. The findings, recommendation and conclusion were stated adequately.","Michael, Christine","https://doi.org/10.52711/2349-2996.2021.00128","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Asian Journal of Nursing Education and Research; 11(4):541-551, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28763,""
"RESILIENCE, WELL-BEING AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS IN THE LOCKDOWN AND PANDEMIC OF COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures have had a negative impact on mental health. The main objective is to study the role of resilience as a protective factor, against the impact of the pandemic and the confinement ofCOVID-19. The sample consisted of 179 participants with a mean age of 40.85 years (SD = 13.7). The analyzes indicate that resilience is highly predictive of psychological well-being and mood and is a protective factor against post-traumatic stress. Also for the ease of carrying the pandemic, which may be mediated by other factors. The effects of the pandemic and confinement appear to have significantly increased post-traumatic stress symptoms. Women have more post-traumatic stress and less psychological well-being. The age group most affected is that of young people (18-25 years).","Sanchez-Hernandez, O.; Canales, A.; Everaert, N.","https://doi.org/10.33898/rdp.v33i121.1103","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Revista De Psicoterapia; 33(121):253-265, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28764,""
"Impact of Lockdown and Social Isolation on the Life-Styles of People: A Case Study","The present study aims at investigating the impact of lockdown and social isolation on the lifestyles of the people concerning their social, economic, educational life, and psychological aspects. The nature of the study was mixed as both qualitative and quantitative, data were collected through interviews, observation, awareness inventory, and information blanks. In the present study, Luhabaga village was taken as the sample purposively. A total number of 134 families/households were covered randomly and data was collected. Along with this, a sample of 120 students was also taken to gain an understanding of the impact of lockdown and social isolation from educational perspectives. The collected qualitative data was analyzed thematically and quantitative data was analyzed through percentage technique. The study revealed that due to the lockdown the people experienced stress, anxiety, and depression, still they appreciated this step for the benefit of the mass. The educational activities of the children were hampered as the problem of internet connectivity was found during online classes. So far as the awareness of people is concerned most people of the village were highly found to be aware of COVID-19 and they were taking essential measures to minimize the transmission.","Venkateswar, Meher, Pujari, Saswat Chandra","https://doi.org/10.26634/jmgt.16.1.17972","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: i-Manager's Journal on Management; 16(1):36-48, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28765,""
"Systematic review: family efforts in preventing covid-19 on special needs children","Introduction: Indonesia has experienced a crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both adults and children are affected by the crisis. The incidence of COVID-19 in children is not as many as in adults, but prevention efforts need to be done by families. Likewise for children with special needs. The article aims to explain family effort in preventing COVID-19 on children with special needs. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify papers on family efforts to prevent COVID-19 in children with special needs using the PubMed databases between 1(st) of January and 31(st) of December 2020. The search identified 15 relevant scientific papers. Results: Indonesia has 80 million children (about 30 percent of the population), and although the health risk from COVID-19 infection is lower in children compared to the older age group, children are most likely to be severely affected by COVID-19 in both the short and long term. Family efforts during the pandemic COVID-19 aim to provide necessities and care, provide nutritional needs, maintain children learning process, protect children from violence, exploitation, and abuse. Conclusion: Family efforts in preventing COVID-19 include providing knowledge, regional authority, mental health services, finance, nutrition and health, education, and child protection.

"Grounded Theory of Asian American Activists for #BlackLivesMatter","A grounded theory study was employed to identify the conditions contributing to the core phenomenon of Asian American activists (N = 25) mobilizing toward thick solidarity with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in 2020. The findings indicate achieving a collective oppressed identity was necessary to mobilize in thick solidarity with the BLM movement and occurred because of causal conditions: (a) experiences of COVID-19-related anti-Asian discrimination, and (b) George Floyd's murder. Non-action, performative or unhelpful action, and action toward thick solidarity were influenced by contextual factors: (a) alignment with personal and community values, (b) awareness and knowledge, and (c) perspectives of oppression. Mobilization was also influenced by intervening factors, which included affective responses, intergenerational conflict, conditioning of ""privileges"" afforded by White supremacy, and the presence of organized communities. Mental health professionals and social justice advocates can apply these findings to promote engagement in the community organizing efforts of Asian American and Pacific Islander communities with the BLM movement, denounce anti-Blackness, and uphold a culpability toward supporting the Black community.","Litam, Stacey Diane AraÃ±ez, Chan, Christian D.","https://doi.org/10.15241/sdal.11.4.400","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Professional Counselor; 11(4):400-422, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28767,""
"Perceived Social Support, Coping Strategies and Psychological Distress among University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Exploration Study for Social Sustainability in Sabah, Malaysia","Social Sustainability among university students, especially how students deal with psychological distress, is important during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examines the relationship between perceived social support and coping strategies and the psychological distress of depression, anxiety, and stress among the students of the Public University in Sabah during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine the level of depression, anxiety, and stress among the students. The inclusion criteria were: (1) currently an active status university student;(2) absent of visual disability;(3) absent of network coverage issues;and (4) absent of clinical symptoms of psychological distress. The total respondents were 385 students from this university who ranged from 20 to 23 years of age and were collected from all the faculties available at the main campus of Public University in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. The research method applied was a survey method, collecting the data through an online questionnaire platform. Three instruments were used: (1) Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21);(2) Brief COPE Scale (Brief COPE);and (3) Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The result of the descriptive analysis indicated that the levels of both depression and anxiety in students of the Public University in Sabah were mild. In contrast, the stress level was moderate during the pandemic. The results of the inferential analysis indicated the relationship between perceived social support and psychological distress, which focused on depression, anxiety and stress among the university students, to overall having a significantly negative correlation between its subscales (r = between &minus;0.148 and &minus;0.359;p &lt; 0.05). Based on the findings, it is clear how vulnerable university students are to psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it can be overcome with social support and suitable types of coping strategy. Besides, a negative link between depression and problem-focused coping was reported (r = &minus;0.274, p &lt; 0.05). These findings also contribute to social sustainability and the wellbeing of students at the Public University in Sabah, Malaysia.","Rathakrishnan, Balan, Bikar Singh, Soon Singh, Yahaya, Azizi","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063250","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(6):3250, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28768,""
"â€˜Farmers Donâ€™t Retireâ€™: Re-Evaluating How We Engage with and Understand the â€˜Olderâ€™ Farmerâ€™s Perspective","Globally, policy aimed at stimulating generational renewal in agriculture is reported to pay meagre regard to the mental health and wellbeing of an older farmer, overlooking their identity and social circles, which are inextricably intertwined with their occupation and farm. This paper, in probing this contentious issue, casts its net across what could be deemed as disparate literatures, namely connected to transferring the family farm and social gerontology, in order to determine what steps could be taken to reassure older farmers that their sense of purpose and legitimate social connectedness within the farming community will not be jeopardised upon handing over the farm business to the next generation. A number of practical â€˜farmer-sensitiveâ€™ actions that can be taken at both policy and societal level are subsequently set forth in this paper to help ease the fear and anxiety associated with â€˜stepping asideâ€™ and retirement from farming amongst older farmers. A particular focus is placed on social and emotional wellbeing benefits of being a member of a social group reflecting farmer-relevant values and aspirations in later life. The potential of the multi-actor EIP-AGRI initiative and the long-established livestock mart sector in facilitating the successful rollout of a social organisation designed to fit the specific needs and interests of the older generation of the farming community is then outlined. In performing this, the paper begins a broad international conversation on the potential of transforming farming into an age-friendly sector of society, in line with the World Health Organizationâ€™s (WHO) age-friendly environments concept.","Conway, Shane Francis, Farrell, Maura, McDonagh, John, Kinsella, Anne","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14052533","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(5):2533, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28769,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic and Physical Activity: An Observational Study on Sleep Quality and Anxiety","Mental alterations were described during the COVID-19 pandemic and sleep deprivation has been reported as a consequence of social isolation. In Italy, the COVID-19 pandemic spread out at the beginning of 2020 determining severe lockdown periods. The aim of our study was to observe the effects of lockdown on sleep and anxiety in trained non-professional subjects and professional athletes who continued to train during the lockdown period. Forty-six subjects (21 trained non-professional subjects and 25 professional athletes) were recruited from a variety of team and individual sports to complete a battery of previously validated and widely used questionnaires assessing psychometric and anthropometric parameters, physical activity levels, lifestyle habits, and sleep quality. Subjects were aged 27.0 &plusmn;5.14. All items were evaluated as percentages and chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were performed, as appropriate. Our data showed that the prevalence of the difficulty of falling asleep (over 30%), the tendency of nocturnal awakenings (over 30%), and moderate anxiety (over 38%) were at the same extent in the two groups. Of the professional athletes, 72.73% declared snoring during sleep vs 42.86% of non-professional subjects. No other significant differences were found between the two groups except for the perception of being constant in daily activity, significantly more reported by trained subjects (p &lt; 0.005). Our data show a similar scenario of anxiety and sleep disturbances for the two groups, suggesting that lockdown by the COVID-19 pandemic has partially mitigated the known beneficial effects due to physical activity on mental health and sleep quality.

"Efficacy of Adaptogens in Patients with Long COVID-19: A Randomized, Quadruple-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial","Currently, no effective treatment of comorbid complications or COVID-19 long-haulers during convalescence is known. This randomized, quadruple-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed to assess the efficacy of adaptogens on the recovery of patients with Long COVID symptoms. One hundred patients with confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 test, discharged from COVID Hotel isolation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU), or Online Clinics, and who experienced at least three of nine Long COVID symptoms (fatigue, headache, respiratory insufficiency, cognitive performance, mood disorders, loss of smell, taste, and hair, sweatiness, cough, pain in joints, muscles, and chest) in the 30 days before randomization were included in the study of the efficacy of Chisan&reg;/ADAPT-232 (a fixed combination of adaptogens Rhodiola, Eleutherococcus, and Schisandra) supplementation for two weeks. Chisan&reg;decreased the duration of fatigue and pain for one and two days, respectively, in 50% of patients. The number of patients with lack of fatigue and pain symptoms was significantly less in the Chisan&reg;treatment group than in the placebo group on Days 9 (39% vs. 57%, pain relief, p = 0.0019) and 11 (28% vs. 43%, relief of fatigue, * p = 0.0157). Significant relief of severity of all Long COVID symptoms over the time of treatment and the follow-up period was observed in both groups of patients, notably decreasing the level of anxiety and depression from mild and moderate to normal, as well as increasing cognitive performance in patients in the d2 test for attention and increasing their physical activity and workout (daily walk time). However, the significant difference between placebo and Chisan&reg;treatment was observed only with a workout (daily walk time) and relieving respiratory insufficiency (cough). A clinical assessment of blood markers of the inflammatory response (C-reactive protein) and blood coagulation (D-dimer) did not reveal any significant difference over time between treatment groups except significantly lower IL-6 in the Chisan&reg;treatment group. Furthermore, a significant difference between the placebo and Chisan&reg;treatment was observed for creatinine: Chisan&reg;significantly decreased blood creatinine compared to the placebo, suggesting prevention of renal failure progression in Long COVID. In this study, we, for the first time, demonstrate that adaptogens can increase physical performance in Long COVID and reduce the duration of fatigue and chronic pain. It also suggests that Chisan&reg;/ADAPT-232 might be useful for preventing the progression of renal failure associated with increasing creatinine.","Karosanidze, Irina, Kiladze, Ushangi, Kirtadze, Nino, Giorgadze, Mikhail, Amashukeli, Nana, Parulava, Nino, Iluridze, Neli, Kikabidze, Nana, Gudavadze, Nana, Gelashvili, Lali, Koberidze, Vazha, Gigashvili, Eka, Jajanidze, Natela, Latsabidze, Naira, Mamageishvili, Nato, Shengelia, Ramaz, Hovhannisyan, Areg, Panossian, Alexander","https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15030345","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pharmaceuticals; 15(3):345, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28771,""

"Mental Health and Quality of Life for Disaster Service Workers in a Province under COVID-19","Objective: Healthcare workers and disaster service workers have been reported to be vulnerable to mental health problems during outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the psychosocial characteristics of disaster service workers in charge of COVID-19-related work and also identify the factors affecting their quality of life. Methods: From June 2020 to June 2021, a survey was conducted of 526 disaster service workers in charge of COVID-19-related work. This included those working in public health care centers (PHC), 119 rescue and emergency medical services (119 REMS), public servants of city hall (PS), and police officers. The Korean version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-15, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, Connor&ndash;Davidson Resilience Scale, and World Health Organization quality of life assessment instrument brief form were used. A one-way ANOVA was conducted, and a stepwise regression analysis was carried out to determine the factors affecting quality of life. Results: Regarding quality of life, 119 REMS (180.64 &plusmn;26.20) scored significantly higher than PHC (165.76 &plusmn;23.73) and PS (163.90 &plusmn;23.60), while police officers (176.87 &plusmn;23.17) scored significantly higher than PS (163.90 &plusmn;23.60) (F = 12.373, p &lt; 0.001). Resilience (&beta;= 0.897, p &lt; 0.01) was the most significant explanatory variable, and together with insomnia (&beta;= 0.154, p &lt; 0.01), depression (&beta;= &minus;0.152, p &lt; 0.01), and COVID-19 anxiety (&beta;= &minus;0.057, p &lt; 0.01) accounted for 91.8% of the explanatory variance with regard to quality of life.

Therefore, active interventions are needed to improve the resilience of disaster service workers.","Na, Ji-Won, Yang, Chan-Mo, Lee, Sang-Yeol, Jang, Seung-Ho","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11061600","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(6):1600, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28774,""
"Prognostic Factors for Post-COVID-19 Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Evidence shows that a substantial proportion of patients with COVID-19 experiences long-term consequences of the disease, but the predisposing factors are poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify factors present during COVID-19 hospitalization associated with an increased risk of exhibiting new or persisting symptoms (Post-COVID-19 Syndrome, PCS). MedLine and WebOfScience were last searched on 30 September 2021. We included English language clinical trials and observational studies investigating prognostic factors for PCS in adults previously hospitalized for COVID-19, reporting at least one individual prospective follow-up of minimum 12 weeks. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias, which was judged generally moderate. Risk factors were included in the analysis if their association with PCS was investigated by at least two studies. To summarize the prognostic effect of each factor (or group of factors), odds ratios were estimated using raw data. Overall, 20 articles met the inclusion criteria, involving 13,340 patients. Associations were statistically significant for two factors: female sex with any symptoms (OR 1.52;95% CI 1.27&ndash;1.82), with mental health symptoms (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.21&ndash;2.29) and with fatigue (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.32&ndash;1.79);acute disease severity with respiratory symptoms (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.03&ndash;2.68). The I&sup2;statistics tests were calculated to quantify the degree of study heterogeneity. This is the first meta-analysis measuring the association between factors present during COVID-19 hospitalization and long-term sequelae. The role of female sex and acute disease severity as independent prognostic factors must be confirmed in robust longitudinal studies with longer follow-up. Identifying populations at greatest risk for PCS can enable the development of targeted prevention and management strategies.

"Mental Health Screening Approaches for Resettling Refugees and Asylum Seekers: A Scoping Review","Refugees and asylum seekers often face delayed mental health diagnoses, treatment, and care. COVID-19 has exacerbated these issues. Delays in diagnosis and care can reduce the impact of resettlement services and may lead to poor long-term outcomes. This scoping review aims to characterize studies that report on mental health screening for resettling refugees and asylum seekers pre-departure and post-arrival to a resettlement state. We systematically searched six bibliographic databases for articles published between 1995 and 2020 and conducted a grey literature search. We included publications that evaluated early mental health screening approaches for refugees of all ages. Our search identified 25,862 citations and 70 met the full eligibility criteria. We included 45 publications that described mental health screening programs, 25 screening tool validation studies, and we characterized 85 mental health screening tools. Two grey literature reports described pre-departure mental health screening. Among the included publications, three reported on two programs for women, 11 reported on programs for children and adolescents, and four reported on approaches for survivors of torture. Programs most frequently screened for overall mental health, PTSD, and depression. Important considerations that emerged from the literature include cultural and psychological safety to prevent re-traumatization and digital tools to offer more private and accessible self-assessments.","Magwood, Olivia, Kassam, Azaad, Mavedatnia, Dorsa, Mendonca, Oreen, Saad, Ammar, Hasan, Hafsa, Madana, Maria, Ranger, Dominique, Tan, Yvonne, Pottie, Kevin","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063549","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3549, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28776,""
"Time to Sleep?&mdash;A Review of the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Sleep and Mental Health","Sleep is intrinsically tied to mental and overall health. Short sleep duration accompanies the modern lifestyle, possibly reaching epidemic proportions. The pandemic and subsequent lockdowns determined a fundamental shift in the modern lifestyle and had profound effects on sleep and mental health. This paper aims to provide an overview of the relationship between sleep, mental health and COVID-19. Contrasting outcomes on sleep health have been highlighted by most reports during the pandemic in the general population. Consequently, while longer sleep durations have been reported, this change was accompanied by decreases in sleep quality and altered sleep timing. Furthermore, an increased impact of sleep deficiencies and mental health burden was generally reported in health care workers as compared with the adult general population. Although not among the most frequent symptoms during the acute or persistent phase, an increased prevalence of sleep deficiencies has been reported in patients with acute and long COVID. The importance of sleep in immune regulation is well known. Consequently, sleep deficiencies may influence multiple aspects of COVID-19, such as the risk, severity, and prognosis of the infection and even vaccine response.","Neculicioiu, Vlad Sever, Colosi, Ioana Alina, Costache, Carmen, Sevastre-Berghian, Alexandra, Clichici, Simona","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063497","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3497, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28777,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic in Portugal: Psychosocial and Health-Related Factors Associated with Psychological Discomfort","The COVID-19 pandemic is a stressful long-lasting event with an increasingly negative impact upon individuals. This study aimed at assessing the magnitude of depression, anxiety, and stress among adults living in Portugal during the first mandatory lockdown of 2020, and the psychosocial and health-related factors associated with these symptoms. A sample of 484 adults (73% women) with an average age of 40 years old (Standard Deviation, SD = 14.03) responded to an online survey. The survey included measures of depression, anxiety, stress, social support, COVID-19 interference in daily life, attitudes towards COVID-19, and health perception. The impact of the lockdown on psychological well-being was large, with up to 36% of the participants showing signs of at least mild psychological discomfort (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress). Social support, COVID-19 interference on daily life, health perception, and age, explained all the dependent variables. Education level, income, attitudes towards COVID-19, and gender explained some of the dependent variables. These results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has a serious impact on the psychological health of Portuguese adults. The role of the procedures to control the pandemic on the mental health of Portuguese adults should not be underestimated.","Pais-Ribeiro, JosÃ©, Ferreira-Valente, Alexandra, Jarego, Margarida, SÃ¡nchez-RodrÃ­guez, Elisabet, MirÃ³, Jordi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063494","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3494, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28778,""
"Depression before and during-COVID-19 by Gender in the Korean Population","This study explored the association between Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and depression by comparing Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) results pre-pandemic (2019) and after the start of the pandemic (2020). Data of 444,051 participants (200,206 male (45.1%);243,845 female (54.9%)) were obtained from the Korean Community Health Survey conducted from 2019 to 2020. The independent variable of interest in this study was the year, divided into binary categories, 2019 and 2020. The dependent variable was depression, measured by the PHQ-9 scale. This dependent variable was also binary, dividing those who are considered depressed or not by a cut-off score of 10. A logistic regression model was employed to examine the association. Our results reveal that compared to participants in 2019, patients from the study sample of 2020 were marginally more likely to be depressed, especially female patients (male OR: 1.092, 95% CI [0.998 to 1.195], female OR: 1.066, 95% CI [1.002 to 1.134]). Moreover, using the participants from the year 2019 as a reference group, those who appeared anxious in response to the COVID-19-related questions in the survey showed more tendency to have a PHQ-9 score of 10 or more. Compared to participants from the 2019 group, those from 2020 more likely to be depressed were those with no-one to contact in case of emergency due to COVID-19 (male OR: 1.45, 95% CI [1.26 to 1.66], female OR: 1.46, 95% CI [1.33 to 1.60]), and individuals with concerns regarding economic loss (male OR: 1.18, 95% CI [1.07 to 1.30], female OR: 1.11, 95% CI [1.04 to 1.18]) and infection of a vulnerable family member at home due to COVID-19 (male OR: 1.16, 95% CI [1.05 to 1.28], female OR: 1.09, 95% CI [ 1.02 to 1.16]).","Cha, Won-Tae, Joo, Hye-Jin, Park, Yu-Shin, Park, Eun-Cheol, Kim, Soo-Young","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063477","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3477, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28779,""
"Precious Time Together Was Taken Away';: Impact of COVID-19 Restrictive Measures on Social Needs and Loneliness from the Perspective of Residents of Nursing Homes, Close Relatives, and Volunteers","During the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, restrictive measures (e.g., prohibiting physical visits and group activities) were introduced in nursing homes to protect older residents. Although the importance of social contacts and social activities to fulfill social needs and avoid loneliness is known, these were challenged during the pandemic. This qualitative study specifically focused on how residents, close relatives, and volunteers in nursing homes experienced the restrictive measures in retrospect and gained insights into the impact of the restrictive measures on social needs and loneliness, and the lessons that could be learned. Thirty semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with residents and close relatives, and one online focus group with ten volunteers, were conducted. Recruitment took place at psychogeriatric and somatic units in the Northern, Eastern and Southern regions of the Netherlands and Flanders, Belgium. The interviews and focus group were transcribed verbatim, and an open, inductive approach was used for analysis. Alternative ways of social contact could not fully compensate for physical visits. Generally, participants reported that it was a difficult time, indicated by feelings of loneliness, fear, sadness, and powerlessness. A great diversity in loneliness was reported. The most important reasons for feeling lonely were missing close social contacts and social activities. The diversity in the impact of restrictive measures depended on, e.g., social needs, coping strategies, and character. Restrictive COVID-19 measures in nursing homes resulted in negative emotions and unmet social needs of residents, close relatives, and volunteers. During future outbreaks of the COVID-19 virus or another virus or bacterium, for which restrictive measures may be needed, nursing homes should actively involve residents, close relatives, and volunteers to balance safety, self-determination, and well-being.","Noten, Suzie, Stoop, Annerieke, De Witte, Jasper, Landeweer, Elleke, Vinckers, Floor, Hovenga, Nina, van Boekel, Leonieke C.; Luijkx, Katrien G.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063468","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3468, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28780,""
"A Qualitative Study Exploring Access to Mental Health and Substance Use Support among Individuals Experiencing Homelessness during COVID-19","People experiencing homelessness have higher rates of mental ill-health and substance use and lower access to health services compared to the general population. The COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in service delivery across health and social care services, with many adopting virtual or telephone support for service users. This paper explores the experiences of access to community-based mental health and substance use support for people experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with 10 women and 16 men (ages 25 to 71) who self-identified as experiencing homelessness in North East England between February and May 2021. With five individuals with lived experience, results were analysed using inductive reflexive thematic analysis. Reactive changes to support provision often led to inadvertent exclusion. Barriers to access included: physical locations, repetition of recovery stories, individual readiness, and limited availability. Participants suggested creating services reflective of need and opportunities for choice and empowerment. Community mental health and substance use support for people experiencing homelessness should ensure the support is personalised, responsive to need, inclusive, and trauma-informed. The findings of this research have important implications for mental health and substance use policy and practice for individuals who experience homelessness during a public health crisis.","Adams, Emma A.; Parker, Jeff, Jablonski, Tony, Kennedy, Joanne, Tasker, Fiona, Hunter, Desmond, Denham, Katy, Smiles, Claire, Muir, Cassey, Oâ€™Donnell, Amy, Widnall, Emily, Dotsikas, Kate, Kaner, Eileen, Ramsay, Sheena E.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063459","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3459, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28781,""
"COVID-19-Vaccination-Induced Myocarditis in Teenagers: Case Series with Further Follow-Up","Presently, the whole globe is struggling the tough challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination remains the most effective and safe COVID-19 weapon for adults and in the paediatric population. Aside from possible mild and moderate post-vaccination side effects, more severe side effects may occur. We retrospectively analysed a group of 5 teenagers aged from 15 to 17 years with obesity/overweight (BMI ranging from 24.8 to 30) who presented typical myocarditis symptoms following the first or second dose (3 and 2 patients, respectively) of the COVID-19 vaccine. In the whole study group, a significant increase in troponin serum concentration was observed (1674&ndash;37,279.6 ng/L) with a further quick reduction within 3&ndash;4 days. In all patients, ST segments elevation or depression with repolarisation time abnormalities in electrocardiography were noticed. Chest X-ray results were within normal limits. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular diameter (47&ndash;56.2 mm) with ejection fraction between 61&ndash;72%. All patients were diagnosed with myocarditis based on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. During further hospitalisation, swift clinical improvement was notable. Follow-up in the whole study group was obtained after 106&ndash;134 days from initial CMR, revealing no myocarditis symptoms, proper troponin level, and no ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities. At the same time, persistent myocardium injury features were detected in the whole study group, including ongoing myocarditis. COVID-19-vaccine-induced myocarditis seems to be a mild disease with fast clinical recovery, but the complete resolution of the inflammatory process may last over 3 months. Further follow-up and investigation for assessing subsequent implications and long-term COVID-19-vaccine-induced myocarditis is required.","Puchalski, Mateusz, Kaminska, Halszka, Bartoszek, Marta, Brzewski, Michal, Werner, Bozena","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063456","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3456, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28782,""
"Prevalence and Associated Factors for Elevated Depressive Symptoms in 386,924 Primary Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic Normalization in China","We aimed to assess the prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms and its associated factors during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic among primary students in China. We included 386,924 students aged 6&ndash;12 years from three cities in Henan province, China, over the period 21&ndash;27 May 2021. The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was 5.8%. Participants with high depressive symptoms were more likely to be senior urban primary students, and exhibited an insignificant increase in hand washing frequency, non-mask wearing behavior, higher error rates of cognition tests, and greater levels of worry and fear. The associated factors for high depressive symptoms were found to include age, sex, grade, location, worry level, fear level, cognitive status, and change in lifestyle after gaining knowledge about COVID-19. Our results suggest that governments need to focus on factors affecting the mental health of school-age children while combating COVID-19, as it would facilitate better decision making on the international and national level.","Xue, Yuan, Xu, Qingqing, Wang, Juan, Lin, Hualiang, Wang, Chongjian, Lou, Xiaomin, Wu, Cuiping, Mao, Zhenxing, Fu, Xiaoli","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063406","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3406, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28783,""
"Young Adult Carers during the Pandemic: The Effects of Parental Illness and Other Ill Family Members on COVID-19-Related and General Mental Health Outcomes","The mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on young adult carers have been neglected. This study aimed to identify COVID-19 related risk factors for young adult carers and to investigate their mental health relative to non-carer peers. Of the 1823 Italians aged 18&ndash;29 who completed an online survey, 1458 reported no ill family member (non-carers). Young adult carers included 268 with an ill parent, and 97 with an ill non-parent family member. Two mental health outcome categories were measured: COVID-19-related (risky health behaviors, loneliness, home violence, fear of COVID-19) and general (anxiety, depression, wellbeing). Six COVID-19 related risk factors were significantly correlated with poorer mental health in young adult carers. These factors constituted a COVID-19 Context Index. Compared to non-carers, young adult carers reported poorer mental health across all outcomes, as expected. The prediction that young adult carers caring for an ill parent would report poorer mental health than those caring for ill non-parent family members was evident only for the COVID-19-related mental health outcomes. The elevated rates of clinically significant distress and pandemic-related mental health problems among young adult carers highlight this group as a priority for mental health promotion interventions and whole-of-family support across multiple sectors.","Landi, Giulia, Pakenham, Kenneth I.; Grandi, Silvana, Tossani, Eliana","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063391","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3391, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28784,""
"Public Policy Measures to Increase Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Rate in Russia","The total vaccination rate remains relatively low in Russia as of March 2022 (around 55%, with around 20% in some regions). In the paper, we study the reasons for it. We communicate the results of our survey aimed at detecting reasons for the relatively low anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rate in Russia (47.1% as of mid-January 2022) and suggest potential measures to increase the level of confidence in the Russian vaccination campaign. A total of 14,310 users exhibited interest to participate in the research (16.84% of the total number of invitations sent in the Russian social network VKontakte). After the sample set repair, only 5822 (40.68% of those who agreed to participate) responses were suitable for the research, and they composed the final set. The age range of the respondents was 16&ndash;51 years old (y.o.) with a mean of 29.1 &plusmn;10.6 y.o. The proportion of the female gender in responses was 44.23%. A total of 2454 persons (42.15%) expressed their hesitant, cautious, or negative attitude towards vaccine uptake. Of the 2454 persons with cautious attitude towards vaccination, only 928 (37.82%) were concerned about the quality of the Russian vaccines. A total of 1323 individuals (53.91%) supported one or more conspiracy beliefs. A total of 5064 (86.98% of the whole set) showed cautious or negative attitude towards the planned introduction of a nationwide system of vaccination certification/verification based on QR codes. The main social factors that hinder the Russian vaccination campaign are: vexation over the lack of desire of officials to receive feedback from the general population regarding vaccination, wide support for conspiracy beliefs, and controversy over the QR code-based digital system. To elevate the vaccination rate in Russia, the following steps may be taken: social encouragement of those who support vaccination, increase in transparency of the vaccination campaign, acceptance of both digital and paper vaccination certificates, increase in participation of society in vaccination-related discussions, public disclosure of vaccine composition, and avoidance of excessive digitalization of data in the vaccination campaign.","Boguslavsky, Dmitry V.; Sharova, Natalia P.; Sharov, Konstantin S.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063387","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3387, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28785,""
"The Predictors of Psychological Well-Being in Lithuanian Adolescents after the Second Prolonged Lockdown Due to COVID-19 Pandemic","Recent research highlights the impact of prolonged pandemics and lockdown on the mental health of youngsters. The second wave of COVID-19 brought an increase in mental health problems among young people. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the main factors arising from intra-individual, inter-individual, and environmental contexts that predict good psychological well-being in a group of adolescents after a second prolonged period of social restrictions and distance education. The study included 1483 school students from 11 to 19 years old. The survey assessed self-reported students' psychological well-being (WHO-5 index), physical activity, sedentary behavior, school social capital, communication with peers and relationships with parents, existing emotional and behavioral problems. The results indicated that 58% of adolescents were of good psychological well-being in spring 2021, after half a year in lockdown. Almost 19% of adolescents had depression risk. The study revealed that during a period of prolonged isolation, male gender, better relationships between young people and their parents, the absence of serious emotional and behavioral problems, less sedentary behavior, and higher school social capital were found to be significant factors predicting adolescents' psychological well-being. Lower physical activity is an important contributor to students' poor well-being. Finally, the lack of face-to-face communication with peers was revealed as a specific factor in predicting adolescents with depression risk.","Jusiene, Roma, Breidokiene, Rima, Sabaliauskas, Stanislav, Mieziene, Brigita, Emeljanovas, Arunas","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063360","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3360, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28786,""
"The Short- and Long-Term Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Child Maltreatment","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a new threat to child health and safety. Some studies suggest that social isolation and economic stress have exacerbated child abuse and neglect, whereas other studies argue that orders to stay at home are likely to promote parent&ndash;child relationships during this stressful time. Due to a lack of prospective studies including before&ndash;during&ndash;after lockdown assessments, the impacts of lockdown measures on child maltreatment are unclear. Methods: This study retrospectively investigated child maltreatment of 2821 Chinese children and adolescents from 12 to 18 (female, 59%) before, during and after lockdown, and identified risk factors. Potential predictors including socio-economic and individual mental health status were collected. Results: During Chinese lockdown, children and adolescents reported that the proportions of decrease (range 18&ndash;47.5%) in emotional abuse and neglect, physical abuse and neglect, sexual abuse, and witnessing domestic violence were greater than that of increase (range 5.1&ndash;9.1%). Compared with before lockdown (1.6%), the prevalence of sexual abuse significantly increased 8 months (2.9%) after the lifting of lockdown (p = 0.002). Being male, suffering from depression, state anhedonia, and experiencing psychotic symptoms at baseline were associated with increased sexual abuse after lockdown. Conclusions: The impact of lockdown on child maltreatment was beneficial in the short-term but detrimental in the long-term in China.","Long, Mengqing, Huang, Jia, Peng, Yishun, Mai, Yawen, Yuan, Xian, Yang, Xinhua","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063350","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3350, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28787,""
"Coping with the COVID-19 Pandemic: Perceived Changes in Psychological Vulnerability, Resilience and Social Cohesion before, during and after Lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns have posed unique and severe challenges to our global society. To gain an integrative understanding of pervasive social and mental health impacts in 3522 Berlin residents aged 18 to 65, we systematically investigated the structural and temporal relationship between a variety of psychological indicators of vulnerability, resilience and social cohesion before, during and after the first lockdown in Germany using a retrospective longitudinal study design. Factor analyses revealed that (a) vulnerability and resilience indicators converged on one general bipolar factor, (b) residual variance of resilience indicators formed a distinct factor of adaptive coping capacities and (c) social cohesion could be reliably measured with a hierarchical model including four first-order dimensions of trust, a sense of belonging, social interactions and social engagement, and one second-order social cohesion factor. In the second step, latent change score models revealed that overall psychological vulnerability increased during the first lockdown and decreased again during re-opening, although not to baseline levels. Levels of social cohesion, in contrast, first decreased and then increased again during re-opening. Furthermore, participants who increased in vulnerability simultaneously decreased in social cohesion and adaptive coping during lockdown. While higher pre-lockdown levels of social cohesion predicted a stronger lockdown effect on mental health, individuals with higher social cohesion during the lockdown and positive change in coping abilities and social cohesion during re-opening showed better mental health recovery, highlighting the important role of social capacities in both amplifying but also overcoming the multiple challenges of this collective crisis.","Silveira, Sarita, Hecht, Martin, Matthaeus, Hannah, Adli, Mazda, Voelkle, Manuel C.; Singer, Tania","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063290","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3290, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28788,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health Care of Children and Adolescents in Switzerland: Results of a Survey among Mental Health Care Professionals after One Year of COVID-19","Background: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on treatment demand and supply in children and adolescents with mental disorders during the first year of the pandemic from the perspective of child and adolescent psychiatrists and psychologists in Switzerland. Methods: The survey was conducted anonymously, in German or French and online in April/May 2021. Mental health professionals working in child and adolescent psychiatry, psychotherapy services or independent practices were contacted by email. Results: N = 454 professionals completed the survey (176 child and adolescent psychiatrists and 276 psychologists). After an initial period of decreased demand during the lockdown in spring 2020, requests for treatment increased, considerably exceeding the demand pre-pandemic and reaching a peak in January/February/March 2021. The vast majority of professionals (78.2%) estimated that there was currently too little supply during the pandemic, which differed from the evaluation of the pre-pandemic situation (37%). A total of 65% of participants indicated that waiting time until the initiation of treatment increased during the pandemic, 41% reported their current workload to be somewhat higher and 44.5% much higher. Conclusions: For the first pandemic year, youth mental health professionals reported a large increase in the treatment demand and waiting time and a worrisome overload of treatment services.","Werling, Anna Maria, Walitza, Susanne, Eliez, Stephan, Drechsler, Renate","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063252","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(6):3252, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28789,""
"Prevalence of Anxiety and Depression among Psychiatric Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Malaysian Perspective","The psychological distress reported among frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) is concerning. Little is known about the mental health of non-frontline, psychiatric HCWs, who play a central role in handling the mental health crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of anxiety and depression among psychiatric HCWs and evaluate its association with socio-demographic, socio-economic, work-related factors and coping strategies. The authors proposed a cross-sectional study design using the Hospital Anxiety and Depressive Scale (HADS) and Brief-COPE scale. This study found that the prevalence of anxiety and depression were 22.0% and 16.8%, respectively. A multivariate analysis revealed that married psychiatric HCWs had a lower level of anxiety with OR = 0.31 (95% CI: 0.11&ndash;0.83). Psychiatric HCWs who were experiencing financial hardships, were unvaccinated and those who had a shorter duration of service in the psychiatric department had a higher level of depressive symptoms with OR = 0.31 (CI: 1.19&ndash;11.27), 3.21 (CI: 0.97&ndash;10.52), and 1.01 (CI: 1.00&ndash;1.02), respectively. For every increase of one unit of avoidant coping score among respondents, the odds of having anxiety and depression increased by 1.25 times (CI: 1.15&ndash;1.37) and 1.20 times (CI: 1.09&ndash;1.32), respectively, whereas for every increase of one unit of religious coping score among respondents, the odds of having anxiety reduced by 1.42 times (CI: 1.10&ndash;1.84). The authors highlight that psychosocial measures addressing the relatively high levels of anxiety and depression among psychiatric HCWs should be a key priority to ensure the sustainment of mental health services in the face of this prolonged pandemic.","Narendra Kumar, Mehul Kumar, Francis, Benedict, Hashim, Aili Hanim, Zainal, Nor Zuraida, Abdul Rashid, Rusdi, Ng, Chong Guan, Danaee, Mahmoud, Hussain, Nurulwafa, Sulaiman, Ahmad Hatim","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10030532","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(3):532, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28790,""
"Anxiety, Burnout and Depression, Psychological Well-Being as Predictor of Healthcare Professionals' Turnover during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Study in a Pandemic Hospital","Turnover of healthcare professionals' is a rapidly growing human resource issue that affects healthcare systems. During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals have faced stressful situations that have negatively impacted their psychological health. In this study, we explored impacts of the emotional wellbeing of healthcare professionals on their intention to quit their jobs. A cross-sectional survey design was used for this study. The respondents were selected based on simple random sampling. In total, 345 questionaries were returned and used for the analysis. Respondents were healthcare professionals (nurses, doctors, midwives, technicians, etc.) working in a pandemic hospital in Turkey. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to predict the emotions that encouraged the respondents to intend to quit their jobs. Emotions including anxiety, burnout, and depression were measured using validated scales. We found that the COVID-19 situation increased the turnover intention, especially among doctors and nurses (ORnurse/midwife = 22.28 (2.78&ndash;41.25), p = 0.01;ORdoctors = 18.13 (2.22&ndash;2.27), p = 0.01) mediating the emotional pressure it was putting them under. Anxiety related to work-pressure and burnout especially were the main emotional predictors of turnover intention. The more severe the anxiety was, the more the professional considered quitting (ORmoderate = 18.96 (6.75&ndash;137.69), p = 0.005;ORsevere = 37.94 (2.46&ndash;107.40), p = 0.016).

"Examining the Role of Traditional Masculinity and Depression in Men's Risk for Contracting COVID-19","In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic and claims that traditional masculinity may put some men at increased risk for infection, research reporting men's health behaviors is critically important. Traditional masculine norms such as self-reliance and toughness are associated with a lower likelihood to vaccinate or follow safety restrictions. Furthermore, infection risk and traditional masculinity should be investigated in a differentiated manner including gender role orientation, underlying traditional masculine ideologies and male gender role conflict. In this pre-registered online survey conducted during March/April 2021 in German-speaking countries in Europe, 490 men completed questionnaires regarding contracting COVID-19 as confirmed by a validated test, fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19S), and experience of psychological burden due to COVID-19. In addition, depression symptomatology was assessed by using prototypical internalizing and male-typical externalizing depression symptoms. Furthermore, self-identified masculine gender orientation, endorsement of traditional masculinity ideologies, and gender role conflict were measured. A total of 6.9% of men (n = 34) reported having contracted COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. Group comparisons revealed that men who had contracted COVID-19 exhibited higher overall traditional masculine ideology and gender role conflict. Logistic regression controlling for confounders (age, income, education, and sexual orientation) indicated that only depression symptoms are independently associated with the risk of having contracted COVID-19. While prototypical depression symptoms were negatively associated with the risk of having contracted COVID-19, male-typical externalizing depression symptoms were positively associated with the risk of contracting COVID-19. For traditional masculinity, no robust association for an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 could be established, while higher male-typical externalizing depression symptoms were associated with an increased risk of contracting COVID-19.","Walther, Andreas, Eggenberger, Lukas, Grub, Jessica, Ogrodniczuk, John S.; Seidler, Zac E.; Rice, Simon M.; Kealy, David, Oliffe, John L.; Ehlert, Ulrike","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12030080","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 12(3):80, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28792,""
"Acute Cerebellar Inflammation and Related Ataxia: Mechanisms and Pathophysiology","The cerebellum governs motor coordination and motor learning. Infection with external microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi, induces the release and production of inflammatory mediators, which drive acute cerebellar inflammation. The clinical observation of acute cerebellitis is associated with the emergence of cerebellar ataxia. In our animal model of the acute inflammation of the cerebellar cortex, animals did not show any ataxia but hyperexcitability in the cerebellar cortex and depression-like behaviors. In contrast, animal models with neurodegeneration of the cerebellar Purkinje cells and hypoexcitability of the neurons show cerebellar ataxia. The suppression of the Ca2+-activated K+ channels in vivo is associated with a type of ataxia. Therefore, there is a gap in our interpretation between the very early phase of cerebellar inflammation and the emergence of cerebellar ataxia. In this review, we discuss the hypothesized scenario concerning the emergence of cerebellar ataxia. First, compared with genetically induced cerebellar ataxias, we introduce infection and inflammation in the cerebellum via aberrant immunity and glial responses. Especially, we focus on infections with cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, dengue virus, and SARS-CoV-2, potential relevance to mitochondrial DNA, and autoimmunity in infection. Second, we review neurophysiological modulation (intrinsic excitability, excitatory, and inhibitory synaptic transmission) by inflammatory mediators and aberrant immunity. Next, we discuss the cerebellar circuit dysfunction (presumably, via maintaining the homeostatic property). Lastly, we propose the mechanism of the cerebellar ataxia and possible treatments for the ataxia in the cerebellar inflammation.","Parvez, Md.

"Antioxidant Biomolecules and Their Potential for the Treatment of Difficult-to-Treat Depression and Conventional Treatment-Resistant Depression","Major depression is a devastating disease affecting an increasing number of people from a young age worldwide, a situation that is expected to be worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. New approaches for the treatment of this disease are urgently needed since available treatments are not effective for all patients, take a long time to produce an effect, and are not well-tolerated in many cases;moreover, they are not safe for all patients. There is solid evidence showing that the antioxidant capacity is lower and the oxidative damage is higher in the brains of depressed patients as compared with healthy controls. Mitochondrial disfunction is associated with depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders, and this dysfunction can be an important source of oxidative damage. Additionally, neuroinflammation that is commonly present in the brain of depressive patients highly contributes to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). There is evidence showing that pro-inflammatory diets can increase depression risk;on the contrary, an anti-inflammatory diet such as the Mediterranean diet can decrease it. Therefore, it is interesting to evaluate the possible role of plant-derived antioxidants in depression treatment and prevention as well as other biomolecules with high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential such as the molecules paracrinely secreted by mesenchymal stem cells. In this review, we evaluated the preclinical and clinical evidence showing the potential effects of different antioxidant and anti-inflammatory biomolecules as antidepressants, with a focus on difficult-to-treat depression and conventional treatment-resistant depression.","Riveros, MarÃ­a Eugenia, Ãvila, Alba, Schruers, Koen, Ezquer, Fernando","https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox11030540","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Antioxidants; 11(3):540, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28794,""
"Stay at Home Order&mdash;Psychological Stress in Children, Adolescents, and Parents during COVID-19 Quarantine&mdash;Data of the CoCo-Fakt Cohort Study, Cologne","Measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic are particularly stressful for families. Limited data is available regarding the effects of a mandatory quarantine on the psychological stress of children, adolescents and their parents. Quarantined individuals participating in the online-based CoCo-Fakt study had at least one child &lt;3, 3 to &lt;6, 6 to &lt;10, 10 to &lt;14 and 14 to &lt;16 years old (n = 2153). Parents were asked about how often their children felt nervous, anxious, or tense, down or depressed, lonely or physical reactions occur. A relative sum score characterizing psychosocial stress was determined and related to parents' socio-demographic factors, psychosocial distress, coping strategies and resilience. Parents reported significantly higher psychological stress if at least one child was quarantined. Parents' relative psychological stress sum score had the strongest influence on the psychological state of the children across all age groups (&beta;= 0.315&ndash;0.457) besides male sex of the reporting parent, no partnership, low to medium socioeconomic status, lower resilience and coping scores, and parents quarantined as close contacts. The variance in the linear regression models was between 17.8% and 31.4%.

"Psychosomatic syndromes are associated with IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokine in heart failure patients","Psychosomatic syndromes have emerged as an important source of comorbidity in cardiac patients and have been associated with increased risk for adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). Understanding of the mechanisms underlying this connection is limited, however immune activity represents a possible pathway. While there have been numerous studies connecting immune activity to psychosomatic psychopathology, there is a lack of research on patients with HF. We examined forty-one consecutive outpatients affected by HF. We assessed psychosomatic psychopathology using the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15). The Psychosocial Index (PSI) was used for assessing stress and psychosocial dimensions. Depression was evaluated with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha were ascertained. Univariate and multivariable regression models were used to test for associations between inflammatory cytokines and psychosomatic psychopathology (i.e., DCPR syndromes, PHQ-15) and psychological dimensions (i.e., BDI-II, PSI). A significant positive correlation was found between IL-6 levels and psychosomatic psychopathology even when controlling for any confounding variables (i.e., Body-mass index (BMI), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, statin use, aspirin use, beta blockers use, age, and gender). In contrast, the associations between TNF-alpha levels were non-significant. These findings can contribute to research in support of a psychoneuroimmune connection between psychosomatic psychopathology and HF. Findings also suggest the possibility that elevated IL-6 levels are more relevant for the pathogenesis of psychosomatic syndromes than for depression in patients with HF.","Altamura, Mario, Giovanna, Dâ€™Andrea, Angelini, Eleonora, Tortorelli, Fabio M.

Additional questions examined the impact of COVID-19 and restrictions on work setting and personal health.ResultsThe majority of respondents reported moderate or higher levels of BO for personal (n=93;70%) and work domains (n=83;62%). Rates of patient-related BO were lower (n=18;13%). Higher rates of BO were found in staff with self-rated COVID-19 adverse effects on physical (n=50, 38%) and mental health (n=88, 66%) (F (2, 13.019)=16.019, p&lt;0.001). The majority of staff had no stress reduction training at any stage in their career, either professional (60%), on the job (62%) or postpandemic (59%) work. Although most (82%) were aware of occupational health supports, few (30%) reported an intention to access these if needed;65% (n=86) of the respondents seriously considered changing jobs in the last 6â€“12 months.ConclusionHigh level of occupational stress among hospital staff during COVID-19, in the absence of stress reduction training is a risk factor for BO.

"To Explore the Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Mechanism of Chaihu Shugan Powder with the â€œSame Treatment for Different Diseasesâ€ for Insomnia and Depression Based on the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background:  The classic prescription Chaihu Shugan Powder (CHSGP) has been widely used in clinical Chinese medicine treatment and has clear clinical effects in the treatment of emotional diseases. Based on the increasing incidence of emotional diseases such as insomnia and depression in the population during the COVID-19 pandemic, we will explore the mechanism of CHSGP in the treatment of insomnia and depression with â€œSame Treatment for Different Diseasesâ€. Methods: : Using a bioinformatics and network pharmacology platform, protein database and STRING database, we collected CHSGP chemical composition and related target data and constructed a ""component-target"" action network through Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathway enrichment analysis. Molecular docking technology was used to verify key active ingredients and core targets. Results: : A total of 119 active compounds of CHSGP were screened, such as quercetin, kaempferol, and ÃŸ-sitosterol, and 113 common related targets overlapped with insomnia and depression. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis mainly involved immune, inflammation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, endocrine and other related targets and signaling pathways. Molecular docking showed that small molecular compounds (kaempferol, luteolin, quercetin, 7-methoxy-2-methyl isoflavone and beta-sitosterol) had good binding effects with five target proteins (AKT1, IL1B, IL-6, FOS, GSK3B) to play a role in regulating immunity, the inflammatory response, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and endocrine signaling. Conclusions: : Under the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it revealed the complex mechanism of multicomponent, multitarget, and multipathway of the classic CHSGP for insomnia and depression, laying a theoretical foundation for its clinical application of its ""same treatment for different diseases"".","Wang, Liang, Wang, Peng, Chen, Yingfan, Li, Chen, Wang, Xuelin, Li, Mingwei, Luan, Zhenxian, Zhang, Yin, Li, Shaodan, Yang, Minghui","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1332355/v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28805,""
"Veteransâ€™ Ambulatory Care Experience During COVID-19: Veteransâ€™ Access to and Satisfaction with Primary Care Early in the Pandemic (preprint)","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread practice changes to healthcare in all settings, but little is known about veteransâ€™ experience with primary care during the early phase of the pandemic. Objective To characterize how COVID-induced changes affected the ambulatory care experience, specifically access and satisfaction, among Veteran users of primary care at a large urban Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical center. Design: We employed a semi-structured telephone interview consisting of 56 questions to capture quantitative and qualitative data. We randomly selected potential participants from among patients who were scheduled to see any of 31 primary care physicians between March 1 â€“ June 30, 2020 at a single location. We evaluated quantitative data using descriptive statistics and categorized open-ended qualitative responses using a matrix analysis. Participants: The study sample of 40 veterans largely consisted of men, almost equally split between non-Hispanic Whites and African Americans. The majority (22, 55%) of the veterans were members of Priority Group 1, the VHA eligibility group that requires either a greater than 50% disability rating or deemed unemployable. Many of the veterans had other insurance coverage, including TRICARE (21, 52.5%), Medicare (8, 20%), and private insurance (5, 12.5%). Main Measures/Approach: We sought to characterize veteransâ€™ perceptions of access to and satisfaction with their primary care experience at VHA and their non-VHA primary care source. We also explored the context of veterans' daily lives during the pandemic, knowing that many peopleâ€™s mental health, relationships, and employment were impacted. Key Results: Veterans completed (mean 2.6) more appointments than scheduled (mean 2.3) due to urgent or â€˜sickâ€™ visits with a shift to virtual modalities like telephone (mean: 2.1) and video (mean: 1.5). Those who reported decreased access to care (27, 67%) as compared to before the pandemic cited administrative barriers (15, 56%) and lack of physician availability (9, 33%) as key factors. While most veterans (31, 84%) were highly satisfied with their care, 9 (24%) reported a decrease in satisfaction since the pandemic. The few veterans who utilized non-VHA physicians were slightly more satisfied with their care. None of the veterans interviewed contracted COVID-19 during the study period, but many experienced indirect psychosocial effects such as the worsening or development of mental health conditions (6, 15%), anxiety concerning the virus (12, 30%), social isolation (8, 20%). Conclusions While the quantitative data suggests continued adequate access and satisfaction, the numerous comments regarding barriers to care illustrate a disconnect between veteransâ€™ perceived experience and the quantitative findings. Given the VHA systemâ€™s efforts to scale up virtual care and pandemic-related messaging, the comments of this sample of veterans suggest that enhanced or different approaches may be warranted to maintain perceptions of access and satisfaction with primary care during times of crisis.","Thomas, Brice, Thadani, Aanchal, Chen, Patricia, Christie, Israel, Kern, Lisa, Rajan, Mangala, Kadiyala, Himabindu, Helmer, Drew","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1053050/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28806,""
"Investigating the relationship between spiritual intelligence and post-traumatic stress syndrome in health care workers in Covide19 centersÂ  (preprint)","Background:  In December 2019, an infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus (Covid-19) started in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly around the world. Due to the fact that this pandemic, in addition to causing general health concerns in the world, has caused numerous psychological complications. Objectives:  this study was conducted to investigate the relationship between spiritual intelligence and the level of post-traumatic stress syndrome in Health care workers in Iran. Method:  This descriptive-analytical study was performed on 201 health care workers in covid19 centers in Shahroud and Miami in Semnan province. The statistical population included the personnel of different categories of the hospital and was selected by stratified sampling method. Online Demographic questionnaire, IES-R questionnaire for PTSS (POST TRAUMATIC STRESS SYNDROME) and online spiritual intelligence questionnaire were used to collect information. Results:  The mean score PTSS 33.97 Â± 17.57 and the three subscales of avoidance, intrusion and hyperarousal were 13.39Â±6.39, 10.27Â±6.27 and 10.04Â±27, respectively. Also, the mean score of spiritual intelligence was 124.90 Â±16.99. Pearson correlation coefficient showed a negative relationship between spiritual intelligence and PTSS (-0.25), avoidance (-0.16), intrusion (-0.2) and hyperarousal (-0.3), and with increasing spiritual intelligence, people experienced fewer PTSS. Conclusion:  Given the high prevalence of mental health disorders and the high rate of PTSS in covid19 pandemic, and considering the relationship between spiritual intelligence and the extent of PTSS symptoms.

"Evaluation on potential detriments from lockdown-related isolation to mental health among school-aged youth in central China (preprint)","Background:  Home isolation is a generally effective strategy for coronavirus disease control during lockdown periods. This study is to determine the potential adverse consequences of home isolation to mental health among school-aged youth after lifting of major lockdown measures in central China. Methods: : This cohort study assessed the mental health of school-aged children and adolescents enrolled in Wuhan city and nearby areas in Hubei province, China, from July 1 to August 31, 2020. Post-lockdown responses to anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances and post-traumatic stress symptoms were assessed in online questionnaire-based surveys. Participantsâ€™ scores for the Zung self-rated anxiety scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the self-rating scale of sleep and the post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSS) were analyzed. Results: : Questionnaire responses of 730 school children were collected. Among the participants, 6.25% of them had scores above thresholds for PTSS, 5.81% had anxiety, and 48.84% had depression. All subjects reported that they experienced sleep disturbances. Subjects who had anxiety might have a high risk for developing depression [OR: 16.07, p =0.008, 95%CI (2.08-123.94)] and PTSS [OR: 12.97, p &lt;0.001, 95%CI (5.41-31.11)]. Both depression [OR: 17.35, p =0.006, 95%CI (2.28-131.87)] and PTSS [OR: 14.18, p &lt;0.001, 95%CI (6.00-33.47)] were risk factors for developing anxiety among participants. Interestingly, higher educational levels of primary caregivers were a risk factor for developing depression [OR: 1.62, p =0.005, 95%CI (1.16-2.28)] in the participants, but a protective factor against PTSS [OR: 0.47, p =0.048, 95%CI (0.23-0.99)]. Conclusions: : The local youth had less than expected degree of increases in their self-reported PTSS and anxiety, after exiting lockdown-related isolation. As a result of a combination of compensatory mechanisms including internet-based home-schooling and increased intra-familial interactions, home isolation did not affect the mental health of local school-aged youth to an extent as great as expected.

"Physical exercise and economic burden associated with anxiety symptoms in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background:  COVID-19 with high infectivity and high concealment has been widely spread around the world. This major public health event has caused anxiety among the public, including pregnant women. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of anxiety symptoms in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic and its influencing factors. Methods: Using an ongoing prospective pregnancy registry, we performed a single center cross-sectional analysis to investigate the overall prevalence of anxiety symptoms among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Online questionnaires were used to collect information including sociodemographic data, physical activity and economic situations. The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used to assess anxiety symptoms. The univariate regression analysis was performed to detect factors potentially influencing anxiety symptoms among pregnant women. The multivariate regression analysis was also conducted to analyze the association of physical exercise and economic burden with anxiety symptoms by adjusting for other variables. Results: A total of 1,517 pregnant women entered the analysis. The study reported that 31.64% of the respondents had anxiety symptoms. Those with bank loans were at higher odds of suffering from anxiety symptoms compared to those without bank loans [(adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.494, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.181~1.889]. Those who took 2,000~5,000 steps/day (aOR 0.825, 95% CI 0.603~0.875) and &gt;5,000 steps/day (aOR 0.924, 95% CI 0.439~0.945) were at lower odds of suffering from anxiety symptoms compared to those who took &lt;500 steps/day. Similarly, the adjusted odds ratios for anxiety symptoms was 0.750 (95% CI 0.663~0.790) and 0.800 (95% CI 0.226~0.889) lower in participants with exercise frequencies of 4-6, and =7 times/week, compared to those with a frequency of &lt;2 times/week. Conclusions: Three in ten pregnant women experienced anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, and anxiety symptoms showed association with bank loans and physical exercise. To prevent anxiety of pregnant women, the promotion of healthy lifestyles, improvement of mental health services, and expansion of social support should be implemented during epidemics. In parallel, the integration of psycho-educational interventions with mental health services among public health centers is required to minimize anxiety symptoms in pregnancy women.","Hu, Shucheng, Hu, Chunhui, Xu, Ping, Lu, Chen, Wang, Jiaqi, Sun, Junyi, Shou, Shicong, Deng, Jie, Duan, Peng","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-105483/v3","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28810,""
"Lifestyle changes among UAE population: cross-sectional online survey (preprint)","Introduction:  The Covid-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented changes to people's daily activities. The eating and physical activity were challenged by the requirements to practice self-quarantine and isolation. Method This cross-sectional online-based survey study investigated the effect of quarantine on different lifestyle habits. Demographic features and questions related to weight change, lifestyle habits such as physical activity, and smoking were collected. It also included the PHQ2 questionnaire. Adults and children were the targets of the study. Results The general tendency of the weight among the study population was towards weight gain especially in children. Female participants in the housewife group were more likely to lose weight. About a third of the adult population reported high depression scores and 21% of children. Physical activity significantly decreased among adults (p-value 0.018) during the quarantine. Among male smokers, 8.6% reported a decrease in smoking frequency or quitting while 6.8% reported increased frequency. Conclusion Weight changes were more among females especially housewives and had a significant relationship to depression risk.

"Evaluating the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on The Physiciansâ€™ Psychological Health;A Scoping Systematic Review (preprint)","Background:  COVID-19 has endangered healthcare systems at multiple levels worldwide. Published data suggests that moral dilemmas faced during these unprecedented times have placed physicians at the intersections of ethical and unethical considerations. This phenomenon has questioned the physicians' morality and how that has affected their conduct. Our review taps into the spectrum of the transforming optics of patient care during the pandemic and its impact on psychological wellbeing. Methods:  We adopted the Arksey and Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s framework, defining research questions, identifying relevant studies, selecting the studies using agreed inclusion and exclusion criteria, charting the data, and summarizing and reporting results. Databases of PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, CINAHL, and PsycInfo were searched using a predefined search string. The retrieved titles and s were reviewed. Later, a detailed full-text analysis of the studies which matched our inclusion criteria was performed. Results:  Our first search identified 875 titles and s. After excluding duplicates, irrelevant, and incomplete titles, we selected 28 studies for further analysis. The total sample size in 28 studies was 15,509 with an average sample size of 637 per study. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were used, with cross-sectional surveys being utilized in all 16 quantitative studies and the most common qualitative study design used semi-structured interviews. A number of discrete codes were generated which led to the identification of five main themes;mental health, individual challenges, decision-making, change in patient care, and support services. Conclusion:  This scoping review reports an alarming rise in psychological distress, moral injury, cynicism, uncertainty, burnout and grief among physicians during the pandemic. Decision-making and patient care was mostly regulated by rationing, triaging, age, gender and life expectancy. Poor professional controls and institutional services potentially led to physiciansâ€™ crumbling wellbeing. This research calls for the remediation of the deteriorating mental health and restoration of medical professionâ€™s advocacy and equity.","Guraya, Shaista Salman, Menezes, Prianna, Lawrence, Isabell Nelson, Guraya, Salman Yousuf, Rashid-Doubell, Fiza","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1010519/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28812,""
"The youth mental health crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of school closures (preprint)","The youth mental health crisis has become so acute during the COVID-19 pandemic that a coalition of U.S. pediatric health experts has declared it a national emergency1. To which extent this crisis can be attributed to the pandemic or the different pandemic measures is unknown. School closures are among the most heavily debated pandemic measures, with insufficient evidence on their costs2,3,4,5. We seek to narrow this blind spot, by compiling data on the manifold school closure and re-opening strategies implemented across the federal states of Germany at the onset of the pandemic and combining it with data from a nationwide, population-based, longitudinal survey on youth mental health and the largest crisis helpline for children and adolescents. We show that prolonged school closures led to a significant deterioration in youth health-related quality of life, precipitating first signs of mental health problems. Effects were most severe among boys, less mature adolescents, and families with limited living space. Young people also increasingly sought support from crisis helplines to discuss arising family and friendship problems. Importantly, the effects persist even when ing from the overall strain imposed by the pandemic or further pandemic measures. Indeed, school closures explain around two thirds of the aggravation of the youth mental health crisis throughout the first pandemic wave and there is no sign for a swift recovery.","Felfe, Christina, Saurer, Judith, Schneider, Patrick, Vornberger, Judith, Klotzbuecher, Valentin, Erhart, Michael, Kaman, Anne, Sieberer, Ulrike Ravens","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1304103/v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28813,""
"Cross-sectional studies of effects of Covid-19 containment measures on childrenâ€™s mental health through a gender lens (preprint)","Background:  The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the daily life of girls and boys worldwide. Methods: : This online study explored the effects of Covid-19 containment measures on Austrian and Italian childrenâ€™s mental health (threat experience, anxiety, trauma symptoms). Data was collected at three measurement time points (June 2020, December 2020, June 2021) from 558 children (50,2 % girls), and 1.133 adults, who have children aged 7-13. Children and parents reported about the childrenâ€™s mental health. Results: : The findings revealed an inconsistent picture of gender differences and similarities: girls and boys reported a similar amount of threat experience, anxiety and trauma symptoms. Parents also estimated girlsâ€™ and boysâ€™ mental health similarly. Gender differences became apparent when the parentsâ€™ estimations of girlsâ€™ and boysâ€™ trauma symptoms were compared to childrenâ€™s self-reports. Parents underestimated childrenâ€™s trauma symptoms at all measurement time points.

"A profile analysis of problematic smartphone usage among college students duringÂ coronavirus disease 2019: Relations with the impact of news reports (preprint)","Background:  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was the first pandemic to occur in a fully globalized society. The aims of the study were to explore the state of problematic smartphone use (PSU) and its risk factors during this incident. The problematic smartphone usage, impact of news reports, depression, and anxiety of a total of 77,211 college students were surveyed online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results The data were analyzed with latent profile analysis (LPA), chi-square test, ANOVA and multiple logistic regression. We found the most support for a three-class model of subgroups. The results of multiple logistic regression show that college students who were female and younger college who experienced positive or negative impact from news reports, and reported higher depression or anxiety scores were more likely to be included in the moderate- or high-risk PSU group than in the low-risk group. However, the positive impact of news coverage was insignificant when the high-risk group was compared with the moderate-risk group. Conclusions These findings provide insights that may help foster and develop appropriate and effective solutions to prevent PSU among college students (young adults), such as paying more attention to girls and individuals with high levels of anxiety and depression in crisis events and providing more positive news coverage during crises.","Chen, Yaru, Zhan, Qisheng, Eli, Buzohre, Zhao, Yuqing, Huang, Xin, Liu, Zhengkui","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1371958/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28815,""
"Parallel Exploratory And Confirmatory Factor Analysis Of The Hungarian Fear Of Covid-19 Scale In A Large General Population Sample: A Psychometric And Dimensionality Evaluation (preprint)","Background:  The seven-item Fear of Covid-19 Scale (FCV-19S) is the most frequently applied instruments for assessing fear of COVID-19 infection. Our objectives were to develop a Hungarian version of FCV-19S, to evaluate its psychometric properties and dimensionality. Methods: : In May 2021, a sample of adults representative of the Hungarian general population completed an online questionnaire survey with respect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcome measures included FCV-19S, General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depressive severity score. Item characteristics, validity and internal consistency reliability of FCV-19S were determined. Maximum likelihood method EFA was used to measure item-factor relationships (hÂ²;factor loading;eigenvalues), while goodness-of-fit of the FCV-19 was evaluated by comparison of one and two-factor CFA model fits (RMSEA, SRMR, <U+03C7>Â²/df, CFI, NFI, RFI, IFI, TLI). Correlations explored the relationships between fear, anxiety and depression and FCV-19 scores were compared in vaccinated and non-vaccinated subgroups. Results: : Overall, n=2000 responded the online questionnaire. The mean age was 49.1, majority being females (62.2%). EFA identified a maximum of two factors (eig=4.2 and 1.01). Items 3,4,6,7 strongly correlated with Factor 1 (physiological fear) and items 1,2,5 linked to Factor 2 (emotional fear). FCV-19 items showed good internal consistency (Cronbach a=0.88) and correlated moderately or highly, while showing weak to moderate correlation with PHQ-9 (r=0.364) and GAD-7 (r=0.424). Significant differences were observed between vaccinated (14.2) and non-vaccinated (13.1) FCV-19 mean scores. Conclusions: : The Hungarian version of the FCV-19 Scale seems valid and reliable construct to measure fear associated with COVID-19.

"Music in times of COVID-19 (preprint)","In March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced the first global pandemic officially caused by a coronavirus. Public health measures (e.g., increased handwashing, reducing social contacts) were introduced to reduce the rate of transmission, including the closure of spaces and events that would encourage high levels of social interaction along with â€˜lockdowns' confining people to the vicinity of their homes. The scale of the disruption caused by the considerable number of cases, and the implementation of lockdowns led to widespread social and emotional disruption. Uncertainty, and financial insecurity arising from these measures cascaded into widespread increases in stress, fear, anxiety, panic attacks, depression, anger, and sleep disorders. This created a unique situation where music-related behaviours and music therapy played an important role. The current chapter reviews how music was used in a range of contexts and settings to support the social, emotional, and physical needs that developed because of the coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns. We aim to highlight the rapid changes that occurred in relation to music use in the general population and music therapy practices as the world adjusted to the new challenges posed by the unprecedented circumstances.","Howlin, Claire, Hansen, Niels Chr","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/z94fq","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28817,""
"Association between COVID-19 Risk-Mitigation Behaviors and Specific Mental Disorders in Youth (preprint)","Importance Although studies of adults show that pre-existing mental disorders increase risk for COVIDâ€“19 infection and severity, there is limited information about this association among youth. Mental disorders in general as well as specific types of disorders may influence their ability to comply with risk-mitigation strategies to reduce COVID-19 infection and transmission. Objective To examine associations between specific mental disorders and COVID-19 risk-mitigation practices among 314 female and 514 male youth. Design Youth compliance (rated as â€œNever,â€ â€œSometimes,â€ â€œOften,â€ or â€œVery often/Alwaysâ€) with risk mitigation was reported by parents on the CoRonavIruS Health Impact Survey (CRISIS) in January 2021. Responses were summarized using factor analysis of risk mitigation, and their associations with lifetime mental disorders (assessed via structured diagnostic interviews) were identified with linear regression analyses (adjusted for covariates). All analyses used R Project for Statistical Computing for Mac (v.4.0.5). Setting The Healthy Brain Network (HBN) in New York City Participants. 314 female and 514 male youth (ages 5-21) Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) COVID-19 risk mitigation behaviors among youth Results A two-factor model was the best-fitting solution. Factor 1 (avoidance behaviors) included avoiding groups, indoor settings, and other peoplesâ€™ homes;avoidance was more likely among youth with any anxiety disorder (p=.01). Factor 2 (hygiene behaviors) included using hand sanitizer, washing hands, and maintaining social distance;practicing hygiene was less likely among youth with ADHD (combined type) (p=.02). Mask wearing, which did not load on either factor, was not associated with any mental health disorder. Conclusion and Relevance Findingss: uggest that education and monitoring of risk-mitigation strategies in certain subgroups of youth may reduce risk of exposure to COVID-19 and other contagious diseases. Additionally, they highlight the need for greater attention to vaccine prioritization for individuals with ADHD. Key Points Question Are mental disorders among youth associated with COVID-19 risk-mitigation behaviors? Findings Based on the parent CoRonavIruS Health Impact Survey (CRISIS) of 314 females and 514 males aged 5-21, youth with anxiety disorders were more likely to avoid high-risk exposure settings, and those with ADHD (combined type) were less likely to follow hygiene practices. In contrast, mask wearing was not associated with youth mental disorders. Meaning Specific types of disorders in youth may interfere with their ability to employ risk-mitigation strategies that may lead to greater susceptibility to COVID-19.","Conway, Kevin, Bhardwaj, Kriti, Michel, Emmanuella, Paksarian, Diana, Nikolaidis, Aki, Kang, Minji, Merikangas, Kathleen, Milham, Michael","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.03.22271787","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28818,""
"A predictive model for hospitalization and survival to COVID-19 in a retrospective population-based study (preprint)","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly transmissible and has been responsible for a pandemic associated with a high number of deaths. The clinical management of patients and the optimal use of resources are two important factors in reducing this mortality, especially in scenarios of high incidence. To this end, it is necessary to develop tools that allow early triage of patients with the minimal use of diagnostic tests and based on readily accessible data, such as electronic medical records. This work proposes the use of a machine learning model that allows the prediction of mortality and risk of hospitalization using simple demographic characteristics and comorbidities, using a COVID-19 dataset of 86867 patients. In addition, we developed a new method designed to deal with data imbalance problems. The model was able to predict with high accuracy (89-93%, ROC-AUC = 0.94) the patientâ€™s final status (expired/discharged) and with medium accuracy the risk of hospitalization (71-73%, ROC-AUC = 0.75). These models were obtained by assembling and using easily obtainable clinical characteristics (2 demographic characteristics and 19 predictors of comorbidities). The most relevant features of these models were the following patient characteristics: age, sex, number of comorbidities, osteoarthritis, obesity, depression, and renal failure.","Cisterna-GarcÃ­a, Alejandro, GuillÃ©n-Teruel, Antonio, Caracena, Marcos, PÃ©rez, Enrique, JimÃ©nez, Fernando, Francisco-VerdÃº, Francisco, Reina, Gabriel, GonzÃ¡lez-Billalabeitia, Enrique, Palma, JosÃ©, SÃ¡nchez, Ãlvaro, BotÃ­a, Juan","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.02.22271552","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28819,""
"An overview of preventive and control strategies for common mental health disorders during infectious disease epidemics (preprint)","Background:  The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected peopleâ€™s mental health owing to different factors. The primary objective of this review was to systematically summarize available literature on the range of interventions for common mental health disorders during an infectious disease outbreak, specifically focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : We searched PubMed, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, EPPI mapper and Google Scholar to identify English literature published since January 2010. We included scientific research studies and grey literature, extracted the information and summarized results thematically. Results: : A range of common mental health disorders that affected populations from most parts of the world and associated factors were identified. We thematically classified intervention into the following: providing accurate and timely information and ensuring adequate supplies of daily need essentials;developing mindfulness and resilience that can revive self-sufficiency and self-awareness in stress management;early identification;providing necessary mental health care through professionals;and health system strengthening and capacity building interventions. Conclusion:  There is an immediate need for a collective action through inter-sectoral coordination at community, national and international levels. Policymakers and program implementers should be prepared to tackle common mental health disorders amidst the ongoing COVIDâ€“19 pandemic and in future emerging and re-emerging infectious disease outbreaks.","Parsekar, Shradha, Dhyani, Vijayashree, Rajwar, Eti, Krishna, Jisha, Venkatesh, Bhumika Tumkur, Saravu, Kavitha, Brand, Helmut","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.74273.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28820,""

"Why mental health service delivery needs to align alongside mainstream medical services","There is significant individual human suffering and economic burden because of untreated mental health and substance use disorders. There is high psychiatric morbidity in primary and secondary medical care. At least one-fifth of patients attending primary care services in western countries pertain to mental health and one-third of patients attending general hospitals have a comorbid mental disorder. Patients with mental disorders have lower life expectancy than the general population due to various medical conditions and reduced access to physical healthcare. There is a suicide every 40 seconds and the vast majority of those who die by suicide have a diagnosable mental disorder. Despite this, most countries spend less than 2% of their health budgets on mental health. Effective treatments exist for mental disorders, however underfunding, poor integration of services, lack of trained health care professionals and stigma often prevent access to effective treatments. Stigma is a significant barrier to seeking help and receiving treatment. Geographical separation of mental health services from general hospital settings may be perpetuating the stigma of mental illness among the population. In this article, we review the key reasons why mental health services globally need to align with mainstream healthcare services and the longstanding reasons that necessitate the need to make mental health a public health priority.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2022.103053","20220501","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28823,""

"Influence of traveling on social behavior","In the era of the 21st century, people cannot think of living without social network or social media. So, our daily life as well as social behavior is strongly influenced by social media or networks in urban areas. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, people are living online mostly. It is observed from various studies that depression, loneliness, monotonousness, etc., can be overcome easily at home through social media. Human beings never feel alone with good connectivity through social networking. Hence, it may be concluded that social media can stimulate people to be social, friendly, energetic, and also creative. Improvement of social behavior also depends on valuable vacation time and frequent traveling. Three different mental states, i.e., happy, normal or moderate, and depressed, can be easily detected through various exchanges of messages between close friends and the greater circle of friends. Even psychological behavior and various characteristics of people can also be identified through social media for the betterment of society and people. Therefore, the objective of this chapter is to mine travel habits simultaneously through social networking and analyze the social behavior based on the various blogs, photos, and comments related to the same post on social networking sites using machine learning techniques.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-32-385708-6.00014-X","20220120","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28826,""

"Exploring the trajectory and correlates of social isolation for veterans across a 6-month period during COVID-19","Social isolation is a relevant problem for veterans who are at risk for disengaging from others as a function of transition stress from military life to civilian life, and given high rates of exposure to trauma and psychological distress. Few researchers have examined social isolation in veterans over time, particularly during COVID-19 that led to significant barriers and restrictions on social interactions. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to assess veteransâ€™ experience of social isolation and its mental health and social functioning correlates during a 6-month period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 188 United States veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, who completed a total of four assessments: one every two months for a total duration of six months. Surveys included measures of global mental health and social functioning as indicated by perceived emotional support, quality of marriage, and couple satisfaction. Multilevel modeling was used to assess 1) growth models to determine whether social isolation changed over time and the trajectory of that change (i.e., linear or quadratic); and 2) whether social isolation was related to both concurrent and prospective indicators of mental health and social functioning. All analyses included person mean centered and grand mean centered isolation to assess for within-and between-person effects. Veterans reported a quadratic trajectory in social isolation that decreased slightly and stabilized over time. Findings indicate that higher social isolation, at both the within- and between-person level, was negatively associated with concurrent emotional support, mental health, quality of marriage, and couple satisfaction. However, all prospective effects were nonsignificant at the within-person level. Results suggest although isolation may decrease over time, veterans report worse mental health and social functioning during times when they report higher levels of social isolation compared to themselves and others. Future work is needed to determine if interventions can be applied during those times to prevent or target those negative associations.","Adam McGuire et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0015-77D-6C0","20220321","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; social isolation; mental health; veterans; covid-19; social functioning","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-22","",28829,""
