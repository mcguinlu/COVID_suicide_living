"Differential Impacts of Perceived Social Support on Alcohol and Cannabis Use in Young Adults: Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic","Coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdowns provided a unique opportunity to examine how changes in the social environment impact mental health and wellbeing. We addressed this issue by assessing how perceived social support across COVID-19 restrictions alters alcohol and cannabis use in emerging adults, a population vulnerable to adverse outcomes of substance use. Four hundred sixty-three young adults in Canada and the United States completed online questionnaires for three retrospective time points: Pre-Covid, Lockdown and Eased Restrictions. Sociodemographic factors, perceived social support, and substance use were assessed. Overall, alcohol use decreased while cannabis use increased during Lockdown. Interestingly, social support negatively predicted alcohol use and positively predicted cannabis use during Lockdown. These findings suggest a difference in motives underlying alcohol and cannabis use in emerging adults. Importantly, these changes were not sustained when restrictions eased, suggesting that emerging adults exhibit resiliency to the impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on substance use.","Lindsay A.

"Direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality in Switzerland: A population-based study","The direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on population-level mortality is of concern to public health but challenging to quantify. We modelled excess mortality and the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic on mortality in Switzerland. We analyzed yearly population data and weekly all-cause deaths by age, sex, and canton 2010-2019 and all-cause and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths from February 2020 to April 2022 (study period). Bayesian models predicted the expected number of deaths. A total of 13,130 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths were reported. The model estimated that COVID-19-related mortality was underestimated by a factor of 0.72 [95% Credible Interval: 0.46-0.78] resulting in 18,140 [15,962-20,174] excess deaths. After accounting for COVID-19 deaths, the observed mortality was 3% [-1-7] lower than expected, corresponding to a deficit of 4,406 deaths, with a wide credibility interval [-1,776-10,700]. Underestimation of COVID-19 deaths was greatest for ages 70 years and older; the mortality deficit was most pronounced in age groups 40 to 69 years. We conclude that shortcomings in testing caused underestimation of COVID-19-related deaths in Switzerland, particularly in older people. Although COVID-19 control measures may have negative effects (e.g., delays in seeking care or mental health impairments), after subtracting COVID-19 deaths, there were fewer deaths in Switzerland during the pandemic than expected, suggesting that any negative effects of control measures on mortality were offset by the positive effects. These results have important implications for the ongoing debate about the appropriateness of COVID-19 control measures.","Julien Riou; Anthony Hauser; Anna Fesser; Christian L.

"Psychiatric symptoms subsequent to COVID-19 and their association with clinical features: A retrospective investigation","This study explores the association between psychiatric symptoms following COVID-19 and demographic, disease-related and premorbid clinical confounders. Global cognition, depression, anxiety and PTSD features were assessed in 152 post-COVID-19 patients, subdivided into being at risk for brain disorders or not. In both groups, clinically meaningful depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms were mildly-to-moderately frequent (4-45%). No demographic or clinical variables predicted psychiatric measures (except for lower age predicting higher anxiety levels). Depression, anxiety and PTSD measures were associated among each other. Hence, depression-, anxiety- and PTSD-spectrum disturbances in COVID-19 survivors are likely to be unassociated with disease-related and premorbid features.","Fiabane, Pain, Aiello, Radici, Manera, Grossi, Ottonello, Pistarini","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114757","20220806","COVID-19; Psychiatry; Psychometrics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-07","",35726,""
"Feeling lonelier during the early COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional analysis of adults living in the United States","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had many negative consequences, one of which was the increase of loneliness. We aimed to explore associations between sociodemographic, work-related, home-related, and COVID-19-related characteristics and increased feelings of loneliness among adults living in the United States (US). We analyzed cross-sectional baseline data from The Quickly Understanding Impacts of COVID-19 Study (The QUICk Study) collected from May to October 2020 using online surveys completed by a sample of adults living in the US. We used chi-square tests, Fisher exact tests, and logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with increased loneliness. The study sample included 577 adults living in the US. Approximately 37% of the sample reported feeling lonelier than usual over the past month. Younger age, sexual minority status, lower education level, depression, living alone, part-time employment status, and student employment status were significantly associated with increased feelings of loneliness. Depression, younger age, and living alone remained significantly associated with increased feelings of loneliness in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. In the US, young adults, adults with depression, and adults who live alone may have been more likely to experience increased feelings of loneliness during the early COVID-19 pandemic.","Bornstein, Magnus","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114759","20220806","Depression; Mental health; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-07","",35727,""
"Mental and social wellbeing and the UK coronavirus job retention scheme: Evidence from nine longitudinal studies","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to major economic disruptions. In March 2020, the UK implemented the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme - known as furlough - to minimize the impact of job losses. We investigate associations between change in employment status and mental and social wellbeing during the early stages of the pandemic. Data were from 25,670 respondents, aged 17-66, across nine UK longitudinal studies. Furlough and other employment changes were defined using employment status pre-pandemic and during the first lockdown (April-June 2020). Mental and social wellbeing outcomes included psychological distress, life satisfaction, self-rated health, social contact, and loneliness. Study-specific modified Poisson regression estimates, adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and pre-pandemic mental and social wellbeing, were pooled using meta-analysis. Associations were also stratified by sex, age, education, and household composition. Compared to those who remained working, furloughed workers were at greater risk of psychological distress (adjusted risk ratio, ARRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.12; 95%CI: 0.97, 1.29), low life satisfaction (ARRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.14; 95%CI: 1.07, 1.22), loneliness (ARRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.12; 95%CI: 1.01, 1.23), and poor self-rated health (ARRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.26; 95%CI: 1.05, 1.50). Nevertheless, compared to furloughed workers, those who became unemployed had greater risk of psychological distress (ARRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.30; 95%CI: 1.12, 1.52), low life satisfaction (ARRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.16; 95%CI: 0.98, 1.38), and loneliness (ARRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.67; 95%CI: 1.08, 2.59). Effects were not uniform across all sub-groups. During the early stages of the pandemic, those furloughed had increased risk of poor mental and social wellbeing, but furloughed workers fared better than those who became unemployed, suggesting that furlough may have partly mitigated poorer outcomes.","Jacques Wels, Booth, Wielgoszewska, Green, Di Gessa, Huggins, Griffith, Kwong, Bowyer, Maddock, Patalay, Silverwood, Fitzsimons, Shaw, Thompson, Steptoe, Hughes, Chaturvedi, Steves, Katikireddi, Ploubidis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115226","20220806","COVID-19; Furlough; Longitudinal studies; Mental health; Meta-analysis; Temporary unemployment; Unemployment; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-07","",35728,""
"Risk factors for anxiety and depression among pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic - results of a web-based multinational cross-sectional study","Mind-COVID is a prospective cross-sectional study aimed to assess risk factors for anxiety and depression among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study compares outcomes in middle-income economies and high-income economies. 7,102 pregnant women from 12 high-income economies and 9 middle-income economies were included. The web-based survey used two standardised instruments, GAD-7 and PHQ-9. Pregnant women in high-income economies reported higher PHQ-9 (0.18 SD, p&lt;&lt;0.001) and GAD-7 (0.08 SD, p=0.005) scores than those living in middle-income economies. Multivariate regression analysis showed that increasing PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales were associated with mental health problems during pregnancy and the need of psychiatric treatment before pregnancy. PHQ-9 was associated with feeling of burden related to restrictions in social distancing and access to leisure activities. GAD-7 scores were associated with a pregnancy-related complication, fear of adverse outcomes in children related to COVID-19 and feeling of burden related to finances. According to this study, the imposed public health measures and hospital restrictions have left pregnant women more vulnerable during these difficult times. Adequate partner and family support during pregnancy and childbirth can be one of the most important protective factors against anxiety and depression, regardless of national economic status.","Kajdy, Sys, Pokropek, Shaw, Chang, Calda, Acharya, Ben-Zion, Biron-Shental, Borowski, Czuba, Etchegaray, Feduniw, Garcia-Mandujano, Garcia Santacruz, Gil, Hassan, Kwiatkowski, Martin-Arias, Martinez-Portilla, Prefumo, Rabijewski, Salomon, Tiller, Verlohren, Voon, Fernando Yanque-Robles, Yong, Poon, Ajdacka, Andersson, Baranowska, BÃ„â€¦czek, Stiberg Birkelund, Belen Campos Del Castillo, Chalouhi, Ciammella, Demirdjian, Filipecka-Tyczka, Freeman-Rechy, Gliozheni, Hasbini, Aide Hernandez-MuÃƒÂ±oz, Homitsky, Jasiak, KaÃ…Âºmierczak, Lewandowska, Li, Maquieira, Maksym, Medina-Jimenez, Modzelewski, Moren, Murillo-Bargas, Muzyka-PlaczyÃ…â€žska, Olisova, Pawlicka, Juarez PeÃƒÂ±alba, Lucia Pereyra, Qinami, Redondo, Rasmussen, RocÃƒÂ­o Sandoval Paz, Santacruz MartÃƒÂ­n, Schwank, Contino Storz, Tataj-Puzyna","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.14388","20220806","Cross-Sectional Studies; Patient Health Questionnaire; anxiety; covid-19; depression; economic status; mental health; pregnant women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-07","",35729,""
"Life in lockdown: a longitudinal study investigating the impact of the UK COVID-19 lockdown measures on lifestyle behaviours and mental health","The COVID-19 pandemic led to the UK government enforcing lockdown restrictions to control virus transmission. Such restrictions present opportunities and barriers for physical activity and healthy eating. Emerging research suggests that in the early stages of the pandemic, physical activity levels decreased, consumption of unhealthy foods increased, while levels of mental distress increased. Our aims were to understand patterns of diet, physical activity, and mental health during the first lockdown, how these had changed twelve-months later, and the factors associated with change. An online survey was conducted with UK adults (NÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°636; 78% female) during the first national lockdown (May-June 2020). The survey collected information on demographics, physical activity, diet, mental health, and how participants perceived lifestyle behaviours had changed from before the pandemic. Participants who provided contact details were invited to complete a twelve-month follow-up survey (May-June 2021), 160 adults completed the survey at both time-points. Descriptive statistics, T-tests and McNemar Chi Square statistics were used to assess patterns of diet, physical activity, and mental health at baseline and change in behaviours between baseline and follow-up. Linear regression models were conducted to explore prospective associations between demographic and psycho-social variables at baseline with change in healthy eating habit, anxiety, and wellbeing respectively. Between baseline and follow-up, healthy eating habit strength, and the importance of and confidence in eating healthily reduced. Self-rated health (positively) and confidence in eating healthily (negatively) were associated with change in healthy eating habit. There were no differences between baseline and follow-up for depression or physical activity. Mean anxiety score reduced, and wellbeing increased, from baseline to follow-up. Living with children aged 12-17 (compared to living alone) was associated with an increase in anxiety, while perceiving mental health to have worsened during the first lockdown (compared to staying the same) was associated with reduced anxiety and an increase in mental wellbeing. While healthy eating habits worsened in the 12 months since the onset of the pandemic, anxiety and mental wellbeing improved. However, anxiety may have increased for parents of secondary school aged children.","Solomon-Moore, Lambert, Grey, Gillison, Townsend, Busam, Velemis, Millen, Baber, Griffin","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13888-1","20220805","COVID-19; Coronavirus pandemic; Diet; Lifestyle behaviours; Lockdown restrictions; Longitudinal; Mental health; Physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-07","",35730,""
"Dual mediating effects of changes in daily life and anxiety on the relationship between occupation and depression in Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic","A substantial proportion of the world's population experienced social, economic, and mental health challenges, including considerable changes in everyday life, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, these challenges varied in intensity depending upon occupation type and working environment. In this context, this study helps shed light on the effects of occupation type on depression through the mediation of changes in daily life and anxiety as perceived by individual workers through their experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 68,207 adults (aged 19-65Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) working in the ""office"" or ""service"" sectors were analyzed based on the raw data extracted from the 2020 National Community Health Survey conducted by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. Data analysis was performed using PROCESS Macro (Model 6) for SPSS 25 to examine how depression is affected by occupation type through a dual mediation of the changes in daily life and anxiety caused by COVID-19 as perceived by individual workers during the pandemic. First, service workers perceived COVID-19-related changes in daily life more acutely than the office workers. Second, service workers felt more COVID-19-related anxiety than office workers, whereby the higher the level of COVID-19-related changes in daily life perceived by the workers, the higher the level of their COVID-19-related anxiety. Finally, service workers' perceived COVID-19-related changes in daily life more acutely than office workers, which had a positive effect on the level of COVID-19-related anxiety, ultimately increasing depression. It was found that the impact of a special disaster situation, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on the perceived changes in daily life and anxiety varies depending on occupation type, which suggests that different occupations have different effects on mental health outcomes. This highlights the need to develop various customized services and policies to promote mental health according to the type of occupation, considering the working environment and work characteristics of those vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.","Lee, Jeon, Yoon","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13932-0","20220805","Anxiety; COVID-19; Degree of changes in daily life; Depression; Occupation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-07","",35731,""
"Incidence of PTSD in the French population a month after the COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdown: evidence from a national longitudinal survey","In view of experts' warnings about the potential negative mental health consequences of the sudden nationwide lockdowns implemented in many countries to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, we sought to study the incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after traumatic events related to this unprecedented lockdown in the French general population. This longitudinal study among adults (aged =18) consisted of two surveys: the first during the last days of the lockdown and the second a month later. We estimated PTSD incidence with the PCL-5 and ran multiple Poisson regression models to identify factors associated with PTSD. Among the 1736 participants, 30.1% reported at least one traumatic event. PTSD incidence was 17.5% (95% confidence interval CI = 15.7-19.3). It was higher in participants who reported multiple traumatic events, who had high COVID-19-related media use, who had general anxiety disorder (GAD-7) during the lockdown, and who had GAD, depression (PHQ-9), or sleep problems 1 month later. In addition, 43.1% of people with PTSD reported suicidal thoughts. These results should help clinicians to target people who are at high risk of developing PTSD after a pandemic-related lockdown and could benefit from preventive measures. Collaboration between the media and mental health professionals could be envisioned to inform the population about care resources. Follow-up recommendations should also be disseminated to general practitioners to facilitate PTSD screening and ensure that they are aware of the appropriate management.","Alleaume, Peretti-Watel, Beck, Leger, Vaiva, Verger, Peretti-Watel, Seror, Cortaredona, Launay, Raude, Verger, Alleaume, Fressard, Vaiva, Beck, Legleye, LÃƒÂ©ger, L'Haridon, Ward","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13880-9","20220805","COCONEL cohort surveys; Covid-19; Lockdown; PCL-5; PTSD","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-07","",35732,""
"Stigma and Intentions to Seek Psychotherapy Among Primary Care Providers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mediational Analysis","Medical personnel have reported increases in psychological distress and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, many providers, including primary care providers (PCPs), face significant stigma related to personal mental healthcare. However, the process by which stigma affects help-seeking among PCPs is unclear. Between January and May 2020, 112 PCPs completed a survey of perceived public stigma, self-stigma, attitudes, intentions to seek psychotherapy for depression, and a clinical vignette on patient referrals to psychotherapy. Self-stigma and attitudes toward psychotherapy sequentially mediated the relationship between perceived public stigma and intentions to seek psychotherapy. PCPs were more likely to refer a depressed patient to psychotherapy than seek personal psychotherapy, but lower personal help-seeking intentions were associated with lower referral intentions. These results clarify processes by which stigma hinders PCPs' psychotherapy use and highlight interventions to encourage their help-seeking. Addressing cultural and practical barriers in the medical field is needed to reduce stigma.","Trusty, Swift, Higgins","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12529-022-10119-0","20220805","COVID-19; Help-seeking; Primary care provider; Psychotherapy; Stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-07","",35733,""
"Association of compliance with COVID-19 public health measures with depression","Although previous studies have demonstrated increased depression related to COVID-19, the reasons for this are not well-understood. We investigated the association of compliance with COVID-19 public health measures with depression. Data from the 2020 Korea Community Health Survey were analyzed. The main independent variable was compliance with rules based on three performance variables (social distancing, wearing a mask in indoor facilities, and outdoors). Depression was assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores. Of 195,243 participants, 5,101 participants had depression. Bad and moderate performance scores for compliance were associated with depression (Bad score, men: adjusted odds ratio [aOR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.29-3.87; women: aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.42, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.42-4.13; moderate score, men: aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.31, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.02-1.68; women: aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.28, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.07-1.53). In the subgroup analysis, among the quarantine rules, not wearing a mask indoors was the most prominently associated with depression. In participants with a high level of education, non-compliance with quarantine rules was significantly associated with depression. People who do not comply with public health measures are more likely to be depressed. The preparation and observance of scientific quarantine rules can help mental health in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and another infectious disease pandemic that may come.","Byun, Sim, Lim, Jang, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-17110-5","20220805","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-07","",35734,""
