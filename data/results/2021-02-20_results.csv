"Worries about COVID-19 infection and psychological distress at work and while commuting","Objective: This study examined the relationship between worry about COVID-19 infection in general, in the workplace and while commuting to work and psychological distress in the midst of a rapid outbreak of COVID-19 in Japan. Methods: This cross-sectional, internet monitor study was conducted on December 22-26, 2020. Subjects were collected from throughout Japan. Out of a total of 33,302 participants, 26,841 people were included in the study after removing those providing fraudulent responses. The subjects were asked single-item questions about whether they were worried about COVID-19 infection in general, at work and while commuting to work. Kessler 6 (K6) was used to assess psychological distress. The odds ratios (ORs) of psychological distress associated with worry about infection were estimated using a multilevel logistic model nested in the prefecture of residence, with adjustment for sex, age, education, equivalent household income, occupation, number of business establishments, smoking status, alcohol consumption, frequency of telecommuting, use of public transportation, perceived assessment of workplace infection control efforts, presence of infection among acquaintances, and experience of being a close contact. Psychological distress was defined as a K6 score of 5 or higher and 13 or higher. Results: Multivariate analysis showed that the OR of severe psychological distress associated with general worry about COVID-19 infection was 1.10 (95% CI 1.00-1.22). The OR was significantly higher in association with worry about infection in the workplace at 1.71 (95%CI 1.53-1.92) and worry about infection while commuting at 1.49 (95%CI 1.32-1.67). Conclusions: The present study suggests the need for psychological intervention to reduce worry about infection in response to public mental health challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Masamichi Uehara; Tomohiro Ishimaru; Hajime Ando; Seiichiro Tateishi; Hisashi Eguchi; Mayumi Tsuji; Koji Mori; Shinya Matsuda; Yoshihisa Fujino","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21250657","20210219","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10896,""
"Service user experiences and views regarding telemental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a co-produced framework analysis","Background The prominence of telemental health, including providing care by video call and telephone, has greatly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are clear variations in uptake and acceptability, and concerns that digital exclusion may exacerbate previous inequalities in accessing good quality care. Greater understanding is needed of how service users experience telemental health, and what determines whether they engage and find it acceptable. Methods We conducted a collaborative framework analysis of data from semi-structured interviews with a sample of people already experiencing mental health problems prior to the pandemic. Data relevant to participants' experiences and views regarding telemental health during the pandemic was identified and extracted. Data collection and analysis used a participatory, coproduction approach where lived experience researchers, clinical and academic researchers contributed to all stages of data collection, analysis and interpretation of findings. Findings Participants' experiences and preferences regarding telemental health care were dynamic and varied across time, settings, and individuals. Participants' preferences were shaped by the reason for contacting providers, their relationship with the care provider, and both parties' access or acceptability to use remote technology. While face-to-face care tended to be the preferred option, participants identified benefits of remote care including making care more accessible for some populations and improved efficiency for functional appointments such as prescription reviews. Participants highlighted important new challenges around safety and privacy in online settings, and gave examples of good remote care strategies, including scheduling regular phone calls and developing guidelines about how to access remote care tools. Discussion Participants in our study and previous literature have highlighted advantages of telemental health care, as well as significant limitations which hinder mental health support and exacerbate inequalities in access to services. Some of these limitations are seen as potentially removable, for example through staff training or better digital access for staff or service users. Others indicate a need to maintain traditional face-to-face contact at least for some appointments. There is a clear need for care to be flexible and individualised to service user circumstances and preferences. Further research is needed on ways of minimising digital exclusion and to support staff in making effective and collaborative use of relevant technologies.","Norha Vera San Juan; Prisha Shah; Merle Schlief; Rebecca Appleton; Patrick Nyikavaranda; Mary Birken; Una Foye; Natasha Lyons; Luke Sheridan-Rains; Zainab Dedat; Brynmor Lloyd-Evans; Justin J Needle; Alan Simpson; Nicola Morant; Sonia Johnson","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.18.21251978","20210219","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10897,""
"Depression and sexual functions in epilepsy patients: Comparison before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major health problem with a high rate of spread  We aimed to investigate herein the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on depression and sexual dysfunction in patients with epilepsy  Material and Methods: One hundred and sixteen epilepsy patients admitted to our hospital from Octoberâ€“November 2019 were evaluated for sexual functions and depression using the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX) and Beck Depression Scale, respectively  These scales were re-applied in June 2020 and July 2020 to assess the impact of the outbreak on sexual function and depression in the same group of patients  The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded and analyzed in SPSS  Results: During the pandemic period, the total Beck Depression Scale values <U+200B><U+200B>increased significantly in the patients with epilepsy compared to the pre-pandemic period (p=0 048), and depressive symptoms showed an increasing trend (p=0 032)  Although an increase in sexual dysfunction was also recorded, it was not statistically significant compared to the pre-pandemic period  In eight patients (6 9%), seizure frequency increased during the pandemic period  In the multivariate analysis, the only parameter that predicted the increase in seizure frequency was the number of drugs used  The Beck Depression Scale values were positively correlated with total male/female ASEX values, age, marital status, duration of illness, and seizure frequency  Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak caused an increase in the tendency to depression in epilepsy patients and has also had a negative effect on sexual function  During public health outbreaks, clinicians should focus not only on seizure control in patients with epilepsy but also on their mental health  RÃ©sumÃ© Objectif: La nouvelle maladie Ã  coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) est un problÃ¨me de santÃ© majeur avec un taux de propagation Ã©levÃ©  Nous visons Ã  Ã©tudier ici les effets de l'Ã©pidÃ©mie de COVID-19 sur la dÃ©pression et la dysfonction sexuelle chez les patients atteints d'Ã©pilepsie  MatÃ©riel et mÃ©thodes: Cent seize patients atteints d'Ã©pilepsie admis dans notre hÃ´pital d'octobre Ã  novembre 2019 ont Ã©tÃ© Ã©valuÃ©s pour les fonctions sexuelles et la dÃ©pression en utilisant respectivement l'Ã©chelle des expÃ©riences sexuelles de l'Arizona (ASEX) et l'Ã©chelle de dÃ©pression de Beck  Ces Ã©chelles ont Ã©tÃ© rÃ©appliquÃ©es en juin 2020 et juillet 2020 pour Ã©valuer l'impact de l'Ã©pidÃ©mie sur la fonction sexuelle et la dÃ©pression dans le mÃªme groupe de patients  Les caractÃ©ristiques dÃ©mographiques et cliniques des patients ont Ã©tÃ© enregistrÃ©es et analysÃ©es dans SPSS  RÃ©sultats: Pendant la pÃ©riode pandÃ©mique, les valeurs totales de l'Ã©chelle de dÃ©pression de Beck ont augmentÃ© de maniÃ¨re significative chez les patients atteints d'Ã©pilepsie par rapport Ã  la pÃ©riode prÃ©-pandÃ©mique (p = 0,048), et les symptÃ´mes dÃ©pressifs ont montrÃ© une tendance Ã  la hausse (p = 0,032)  Bien qu'une augmentation de la dysfonction sexuelle ait Ã©galement Ã©tÃ© enregistrÃ©e, elle n'Ã©tait pas statistiquement significative par rapport Ã  la pÃ©riode prÃ©-pandÃ©mique  Chez huit patients (6,9 %), la frÃ©quence des crises a augmentÃ© pendant la pÃ©riode pandÃ©mique  Dans l'analyse multivariÃ©e, le seul paramÃ¨tre qui prÃ©disait l'augmentation de la frÃ©quence des crises Ã©tait le nombre de mÃ©dicaments utilisÃ©s  Les valeurs de l'Ã©chelle de dÃ©pression de Beck Ã©taient positivement corrÃ©lÃ©es avec les valeurs ASEX totales des hommes/femmes, l'Ã¢ge, l'Ã©tat matrimonial, la durÃ©e de la maladie et la frÃ©quence des crises  Conclusion: L'Ã©pidÃ©mie de COVID-19 a provoquÃ© une augmentation de la tendance Ã  la dÃ©pression chez les patients Ã©pileptiques et a Ã©galement eu un effet nÃ©gatif sur la fonction sexuelle  Pendant les flambÃ©es de santÃ© publique, les cliniciens devraient se concentrer non seulement sur le contrÃ´le des crises chez les patients atteints d'Ã©pilepsie, mais aussi sur leur santÃ© mentale","Gul, Zeynep Bastug","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.006","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Annales MÃ©dico-psychologiques, revue psychiatrique;2021.; Publication details: Annales MÃ©dico-psychologiques, revue psychiatrique;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10898,""

"Evidence synthesis of digital interventions to mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health: a rapid meta-review","Accumulating evidence suggests negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health. Digital interventions that have been developed and evaluated in recent years may be used to mitigate negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, evidence-based recommendations on the use of existing telemedicine and internet-based (eHealth) and app-based mobile Health (mHealth) interventions are lacking. The aim was to investigate the theoretical and empirical base, user perspective, safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions in public mental health provision (i.e. mental health promotion, prevention and treatment of mental disorders) that may help to reduce the consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic. A rapid meta-review was conducted. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL databases were searched on May 11, 2020. Study inclusion criteria were broad and considered systematic reviews and meta-analyses that investigated digital tools for health promotion, prevention, or treatment of mental health conditions and determinants likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, 815 peer-reviewed systematic reviews and meta-analyses were identified of which 83 met inclusion criteria. The present findings suggest that there is good evidence on the usability, safety, acceptance/satisfaction, and effectiveness of eHealth interventions while evidence on mHealth apps is promising, especially if social components (e.g. blended care) and strategies to promote adherence are incorporated. Although most digital interventions focus on the prevention or treatment of mental disorders, there is some evidence on mental health promotion. However, evidence on process quality, cost-effectiveness, and long-term effects is very limited. There is evidence that digital interventions are particularly suited to mitigating psychosocial consequences at the population level. In times of physical distancing, quarantine, and restrictions on social contacts, decision-makers should develop digital strategies for continued mental health care and invest time and efforts in the development and implementation of mental health promotion and prevention programs.","Rauschenberg, Schick, Hirjak, Seidler, Paetzold, Apfelbacher, Riedel-Heller, Reininghaus","https://doi.org/10.2196/23365","20210219","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10928,""
"COVID Coach: Exploring Usage of a Public Mental Health App Designed for the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted mental health and well-being. Mobile mental health apps can be scalable, useful tools in large-scale disaster responses and are particularly promising for reaching vulnerable populations. COVID Coach is a free, evidence-informed mobile app designed specifically to provide tools and resources for addressing COVID-19 related stress. The purpose of the current study was to characterize overall usage of COVID Coach, explore retention and return usage, and assess whether the app was reaching individuals that may benefit from mental health resources. Anonymous usage data collected from COVID Coach between May 1, 2020 through October 31, 2020 were extracted and analyzed for this study. The sample included 49,287 unique user codes and 3,368,931 in-app events. Usage of interactive tools for coping and stress management comprised the majority of key app events (70.4%) and the majority of app users tried a tool for managing stress (58.8%). COVID Coach was utilized for 3 days or fewer among 80.9% of the sample whose first day of app use occurred within the 6-month observation window. Usage of the key content in COVID Coach predicted returning to the app for a second day. Among those who tried at least one coping tool on their first day of app use, 57.2% returned for a second visit; whereas only 46.3% of those who did not try a tool returned (P &lt; .001). Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD were prevalent among app users. For example, among app users that completed an anxiety assessment on their first day of app use (n = 4,870; 11.4% of users), 55.1% (n = 2,680) reported levels of anxiety that were moderate to severe, and 29.9% (n = 1,455) of scores fell into the severe symptom range. On average, those with moderate levels of depression on their first day of app use returned to the app for a greater number of days (M = 3.72 days) than those with minimal symptoms (M = 3.08 days, (t(1) = 3.01, P = .003) and individuals with significant PTSD symptoms on their first day of app use utilized the app for a significantly greater number of days (M = 3.79 days) than those with fewer symptoms (M = 3.13 days, (t(1) = 2.29, P = .022). As the mental health impacts of the pandemic continue to be widespread and increasing, digital health resources, such as apps like COVID Coach, are a scalable way to provide evidence-informed tools and resources. Future research is needed to better understand for whom and under what conditions the app is most helpful and how to increase and sustain engagement.","Jaworski, Taylor, Ramsey, Heinz, Steinmetz, Pagano, Moraja, Owen","https://doi.org/10.2196/26559","20210219","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10929,""
"The utilization of telehealth services in Libya as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional analysis","Health care systems in developing countries have witnessed an unprecedented challenge in maintaining adequate and continuous provision of healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. In many countries, including Libya, institutions and organizations began to implement telehealth technology for the first time. This was to create an alternative modality for direct doctor-patient interviews to reduce the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. This study aimed to determine the usability of telehealth services in Libya and to provide an overview of the current COVID-19 situation. A cross-sectional study was conducted between April 2020 and May 2020 among the Libyan population using an anonymous online survey. Participants were contacted by sending mobile messages, emails, and via social media. The survey included items that covered sociodemographic characteristics, the availability and accessibility of healthcare services, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care services, mental health assessment, and the feasibility and application of the telehealth system. We obtained 2512 valid responses; the majority (1721, 68.5%) were from females. The mean age (Ã‚Â± standard deviation) was 28.2 Ã‚Â± 7.6 years; 92.9% were &lt; 40 years-of-age and 58.2% were single. With regards to the assessment of healthcare services and accessibility, 31.1% reported that their health status was poor in general, and 19.6% reported having at least one chronic disease confirmed. In addition, 19.9% reported varying degrees of difficulty when accessing healthcare centers, and 62% were unable to access their medical records. Strikingly, 61.6% reported having problems covering medical costs, and 56.9% avoided seeking medical care due to financial concerns. With regards to the feasibility of the telehealth system, approximately 50% agreed on the usefulness of telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 61.5% stated that the system was an effective means of communication and attaining healthcare services. The survey also showed that 57.1% felt comfortable while using the telehealth system and that 44.9% felt that they were able to express themselves effectively. Also, 55.3% found the system easy to understand, and 53.9% reported excellent communication with doctors using the telehealth system. However, only 40.5% reported that communication was better than the usual methods. Our study revealed that the Libyan population reported high levels of usability and willingness to use the telemedicine system as an alternative modality to in-person appointments. These systems is advantageous as it overcomes financial costs, increases access to timed medical care and follow-ups, and, most importantly, reduces the risk of COVID-19 transmission. However, internet connectivity and electricity issues could be a substantial barrier in many resource-limited communities, and further studies should address such obstacles in the future.","Elhadi, Msherghi, Elhadi, Ashini, Alsoufi, Bin Alshiteewi, Elmabrouk, Alsuyihili, Elgherwi, Elkhfeefi, Abdulrazik, Tarek","https://doi.org/10.2196/23335","20210219","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10930,""

We investigate prevalence and correlates of disturbed sleep among subscribers to Text4Hope a daily supportive text message program launched in Alberta to support residents to deal with stress, anxiety, and depression. A survey link was sent to Text4Hope subscribers to assess demographic and clinical variables, including disturbed sleep, stress, anxiety, and depression using the third question on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Perceived Stress Scale, Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, and PHQ-9, respectively. Data were analysed using univariate and logistic regression analyses. Overall, 6041 out of 32,805 Text4Hope subscribers completed the survey (18.4% response rate). Prevalence of disturbed sleep was 77.8%. Subscribers aged 41-60 years were twice as likely to present with sleep disturbance compared to individuals Ã¢â€°Â¤25Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (OR 1.89, 95% CI: 1.27-2.81).

"Cutting Through the Noise: Predictors of Successful Online Message Retransmission in the First 8 Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic","In this paper, we investigate how message construction, style, content, and the textual content of embedded images impacted message retransmission over the course of the first 8 months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States. We analyzed a census of public communications (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°372,466) from 704 public health agencies, state and local emergency management agencies, and elected officials posted on Twitter between January 1 and August 31, 2020, measuring message retransmission via the number of retweets (ie, a message passed on by others), an important indicator of engagement and reach. To assess content, we extended a lexicon developed from the early months of the pandemic to identify key concepts within messages, employing it to analyze both the textual content of messages themselves as well as text included within embedded images (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°233,877), which was extracted via optical character recognition. Finally, we modelled the message retransmission process using a negative binomial regression, which allowed us to quantify the extent to which particular message features amplify or suppress retransmission, net of controls related to timing and properties of the sending account. In addition to identifying other predictors of retransmission, we show that the impact of images is strongly driven by content, with textual information in messages and embedded images operating in similar ways. We offer potential recommendations for crafting and deploying social media messages that can &quot;cut through the noise&quot; of an infodemic.","Renshaw, Mai, Dubois, Sutton, Butts","https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2020.0200","20210219","COVID-19; Epidemic management/response; Public health preparedness/response; Risk communication; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10932,""

"Pregnant Patients Using Opioids: Treatment Access Barriers in the Age of COVID-19","Before the COVID-19 pandemic, many pregnant patients experienced barriers in accessing opioid use disorder (OUD) medication. This project surveyed buprenorphine treatment clinics to determine how many accepted pregnant women before and then during the pandemic. Of those clinics accepting pregnant patients during the pandemic, respondents were asked what services were provided and what forms of payment they accepted. Between July and September 2020, phone contact was made with every sixth unduplicated clinic in North Carolina listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration treatment locator (NÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 490 clinics). The response rate was 53%. Of the 128 clinics responding, 62 clinics (48%) failed to treat pregnant patients both before and during the pandemic, whereas 66 clinics (52%) accepted pregnant patients before the COVID-19 pandemic, with only 44 (66%) of these clinics accepting pregnant patients during the pandemic. Thus, 33% fewer clinics accepted pregnant women for OUD treatment. Of these 44 clinics, 52% provided same-day intake, 45% prescribed naltrexone, and 57% offered detoxification with opioid agonists. Self-pay (95%), private insurance (77%), and Medicaid (55%) were accepted as payment. Clinics commonly reported providing individual counseling (86%). No clinics provided childcare or transportation. Almost half of the buprenorphine clinics in North Carolina turned away pregnant patients before the pandemic. During the pandemic, only 34% accepted pregnant patients, with 33% clinics that had provided medication treatment before the pandemic declining to treat pregnant patients for OUD. Thus, it is critical that policymakers ensure OUD treatment clinics accept pregnant patients.","Lensch, Hairston, Carter, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000826","20210219","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10934,""

"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures on the sexual functions of women treated for vaginismus (genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder)","Female sexual function is influenced by the emotional and hormonal state. COVID-19 has been the major global health crisis of our time with high psychosocial impact. Vaginismus is a form of female sexual dysfunction and a subset of genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder in which any form of vaginal penetration is painful or impossible. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual function of women treated for vaginismus. All women treated using dilators between 2018-2019 were included. Data obtained 3 months after comfortable penetration and during the pandemic via telephone interview were compared. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Golombok-Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction (GRISS), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to evaluate sexual function and depression. Frequency of sexual intercourse and pain was compared using a visual analogue scale. Seventy-seven women were included. Mean duration of treatment and number of treatment sessions were 3.5 Ã‚Â± 2.6 months and 4.2 Ã‚Â± 2.6, respectively. There were significant improvements in the FSFI desire, arousal, orgasm, and pain subscales and total score and in the GRISS infrequency, noncommunication, avoidance, non-sensuality, and vaginismus subscales and total score during the pandemic. The GRISS dissatisfaction and anorgasmia subscales and BDI score significantly worsened. Mean frequency of sexual intercourse was 2.3 Ã‚Â± 1.8/week and did not change significantly. Pain scores decreased during the pandemic (2.7 Ã‚Â± 2.8) compared to post-treatment (6.2 Ã‚Â± 2.9). Although frequency of sexual intercourse was not affected and pain scores and FSFI total and subscale scores improved, satisfaction and orgasm were adversely affected, which may be attributed to increased stress and anxiety during the pandemic.","Gungor Ugurlucan, Yasa, Ates Tikiz, Evruke, Isik, Dural, Akhan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-020-04667-w","20210219","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI); Genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder; Sexual behavior; Vaginismus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10936,""

"Perception of health risk and compliance with preventive measures related to COVID-19 in the Czech population: preliminary results of a rapid questionnaire survey","In the Czech Republic, an outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19) has been decelerated by quickly adopting strict and strongly limiting government measures. In this study, the authors present the preliminary results (April 1-5, 2020) of a public risk perception study of COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19. The online questionnaire survey was announced in the national TV and radio stations with the nationwide coverage. Respondents were recruited through the website of the University of Ostrava during the first 5 days of the survey (N = 7966). The data covered risk perception with a focus on physical and psychological aspects, the current socio-economic situation and adaptation to the lockdown. The authors used Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests, as well as ordered logistic regression, with a significance level of 5% using STATA version 15. From the total sample of the respondents aged 40 years on average (a range of 15-87 years), the present study shows that women (p &lt; 0.001) and elderly people (p &lt; 0.001) perceived the health risk related to COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 as significantly worse than others. Older people (&gt;60 years) perceived their mental health as significantly better than younger participants (p &lt; 0.001). Most of the respondents assessed the adopted measures as adequate (71%) and believed in their effectiveness (69.7%). This study contributes to understanding the risk perception as a public response to the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic.","DaleckÃƒÂ¡, Ã…Â lachtovÃƒÂ¡, TomÃƒÂ¡Ã…Â¡kovÃƒÂ¡, MaÃ„Âar","https://doi.org/10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01747","20210219","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19; health risk perception; mental health; preventive measures; questionnaire survey; risk communication","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10938,""
"A Perspective on Client-Psychologist Relationships in Videoconferencing Psychotherapy: Literature Review","During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have been encouraged to maintain social distance. Technology helps people schedule meetings as remote videoconferencing sessions rather than face-to-face interactions. Psychologists are in high demand because of an increase in stress as a result of COVID-19, and videoconferencing provides an opportunity for mental health clinicians to treat current and new referrals. However, shifting treatment from face-to-face to videoconferencing is not simple: both psychologists and clients miss in-person information cues, including body language. This review proposes a new theoretical framework to guide the design of future studies examining the impact of a computer as a mediator of psychologist-client relationships and the influence of videoconferencing on the relationship process. We conducted a literature review including studies focused on communication and key concepts of the therapeutic relationship and therapeutic alliance. Studies have reported that clients are generally satisfied with videoconference therapy in terms of the relationship with their therapists and the establishment of the therapeutic alliance. Conversely, studies indicate that psychologists continue to highlight difficulties in establishing the same quality of therapeutic relationship and therapeutic alliance. The contrasting experiences might underlie the differences in the type of emotional and cognitive work required by both actors in any therapy session; furthermore, the computer seems to take part in their interaction not only as a vehicle to transmit messages but also as an active part of the communication. A new model of interaction and relationship is proposed, taking into account the presence of the computer, along with further hypotheses. It is important to consider the computer as having an active role in the client-psychologist relationship; thus, it is a third party to the communication that either assists or interferes with the interaction between psychologists and clients.","Cataldo, Chang, Mendoza, Buchanan","https://doi.org/10.2196/19004","20210219","client-psychologist relationships; mobile phone; professional-patient relations; psychotherapy; telehealth; therapeutic alliance; videoconference","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10939,""

All hospital births occurring in the municipality of Rio Grande (southern Brazil) during 2019 were identified. Mothers were invited to complete a standardized questionnaire on sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. Between May and July 2020, we tried to contact all cohort mothers of singletons, living in urban areas, to answer a standardized web-based questionnaire. They completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) in both follow-ups, and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) in the online follow-up. We located 1,136 eligible mothers (n=2,051). Of those, 40.5% had moderate to severe stress due to the current pandemic, 29.3% had depression, and 25.9% had GAD. Mothers reporting loss of income during the pandemic (57.2%) had the highest proportions of mental health problems. Compared to baseline, the prevalence of depression increased 5.7 fold and that of anxiety increased 2.4-fold during the pandemic (both p &lt; 0.001).

"Neurobiology of COVID-19: how can the virus affect the brain?","Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been declared a public health emergency of international interest, with confirmed cases in most countries. COVID-19 presents manifestations that can range from asymptomatic or mild infections up to severe manifestations that lead to hospitalization and death. A growing amount of evidence indicates that the virus may cause neuroinvasion. Postmortem brain study findings have included edema, hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, atrophy, encephalitis, infarcts, swollen axons, myelin loss, gliosis, neuronal satellitosis, hypoxic-ischemic damage, arteriolosclerosis, leptomeningeal inflammation, neuronal loss, and axon degeneration. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic is causing dangerous effects on the mental health of the world population, some of which can be attributed to its social impact (social distancing, financial issues, and quarantine). There is also a concern that environmental stressors, enhanced by psychological factors, are contributing to the emergence of psychiatric outcomes during the pandemic. Although clinical studies and diagnosing SARS-CoV-2-related neurological disease can be challenging, they are necessary to help define the manifestations and burden of COVID-19 in neurological and psychiatric symptoms during and after the pandemic. This review aims to present the neurobiology of coronavirus and postmortem neuropathological hallmarks.","Generoso, Barichello de Quevedo, Cattani, Lodetti, Sousa, Collodel, Diaz, Dal-Pizzol","https://doi.org/10.1590/1516-4446-2020-1488","20210219","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10941,""
"COVID-19-related Traumatic Effects and Psychological Reactions among International Students","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to people's psychological resilience. Students are reported to have greater psychological impacts from COVID-19. This study aimed to survey international students to better understand their traumatic effects and psychological reactions from COVID-19, to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impact during the pandemic. We conducted an online survey that collected information on the demographics, economic conditions, academic conditions, and health statuses of native Chinese students attending university in the U.S. Psychological impact was assessed by the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist Civilian Version (PCL-C) and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. This study included 261 Chinese international students. In total, 37.5% of respondents' PTSD PCL-C scores measured as moderate or severe. International students who were currently in China facing job-hunting or planning to continue studying abroad, severe economic pressure, and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with greater PTSD PCL-C scores and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. During the COVID-19 pandemic, more than one-third of the respondents rated their PTSD PCL-C score as moderate-to-severe and nearly half of them reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors such as future academic plan, economic pressure, and health status are associated with higher levels of psychological impact and worse mental health status. These should receive attention and psychological interventions should be implemented to improve the mental health of international students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Song, Zhao, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.201016.001","20210219","COVID-19; DASS-21; PCL-C; international students; psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10942,""
"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and attitudes in Qatar: A national cross-sectional survey of a migrant-majority population","Vaccine hesitancy is a global threat undermining control of preventable infections. Emerging evidence suggests that hesitancy to COVID-19 vaccination varies globally. Qatar has a unique population with around 90% of the population being economic migrants, and the degree and determinants of hesitancy are not known. This study was carried out to evaluate the degree of vaccine hesitancy and its socio-demographic and attitudinal determinants across a representative sample. A national cross-sectional study using validated hesitancy measurement tool was carried out from October 15, 2020, to November 15, 2020. A total of 7821 adults completed the survey. Relevant socio-demographic data along with attitudes and beliefs around COVID-19 vaccination were collected from the respondents. 20.2% of the respondents stated they would not take the vaccine and 19.8% reported being unsure about taking the prospective COVID-19 vaccine. Citizens and females were more likely to be vaccine hesitators than immigrants and males, respectively. Concerns around the safety of COVID-19 vaccine and its longer-term side effects were the main concerns cited. Personal research around COVID-19 and vaccine were by far the most preferred methods that would increase confidence in accepting the vaccine across all demographic groups. This study reports an overall vaccine hesitancy of 20% toward the COVID-19 vaccine and the influence of social media on attitudes toward vaccination which is in keeping with emerging evidence. This finding comes at a time that is close to the start of mass immunization and reports from a migrant-majority population highlighting important socio-demographic determinants around vaccine hesitancy.","Alabdulla, Reagu, Al-Khal, Elzain, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12847","20210219","COVID-19; COVID-19 vaccine; Qatar; migrant mental health; social media; vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10943,""
"Nursing Professionals' Mental Well-being and Workplace Impairment During the COVID-19 Crisis: Network Analysis","This study investigated the effects of years of nursing experience and mental health on work impairment among nurses during the COVID-19 crisis. During the COVID-19 crisis, nurses experience a greater psychological burden than other health care workers. Studies have not yet investigated the effects of years in nursing and mental health on potential work impairment during the COVID-19 crisis in nurses. A survey was administered to 83 nurses on active duty during the COVID-19 crisis. The graphical LASSO and the DAG helped estimate associations between years of nursing experience, mental health, and work impairment. A moderate negative correlation emerged between years of nursing experience, avoidance, and work impairment. A direct effect was observed between anxiety and work impairment. A moderate positive correlation emerged between anxiety, depression, and work impairment. An indirect effect was observed between depression, burnout, insomnia, years of nursing experience, and work impairment. In the present sample, nurses' work impairment decreased with greater years of nursing experience and increased with higher anxiety, depression, burnout, and avoidance levels. These findings can help design effective infectious disease management programs for students and professionals in nursing to prevent break downs and avoid work impairment.","Tokac, Razon","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13285","20210219","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Nurses; Work impairment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10944,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the medical care and health-care behaviour of patients with lupus and other systemic autoimmune diseases: a mixed methods longitudinal study","The aim was to explore the self-reported impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on changes to care and behaviour in UK patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, to help ensure that patient experiences are considered in future pandemic planning. This was a longitudinal mixed methods study, with a cohort completing baseline surveys in March 2020 and follow-up surveys in June 2020 (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°111), combined with thematic analysis of the LUPUS UK forum and participant interviews (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°28). Cancellations of routine care and difficulties in accessing medical support contributed to some participants deteriorating physically, including reports of hospitalizations. The majority of participants reported that fear of COVID-19 and disruptions to their medical care had also adversely impacted their mental health. Feeling medically supported during the pandemic was correlated with multiple measures of mental health and perceptions of care, including the Warwick-Edinburgh mental well-being score (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.44, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Five themes were identified: detrimental reduction in care; disparities in contact and communication (medical security <i>vs</i> abandonment sub-theme); perceived and actual endangerment; the perfect storm of reduced clinician ability to help and increased patient reticence to seek help; and identifying the patients most vulnerable to reduced medical care. The diversion of resources away from chronic disease care was perceived by many participants to have caused adverse outcomes. Fear about increased vulnerability to COVID-19 was high, contributing to health-care-avoidant behaviours. This study also highlights the influence of clinician accessibility and patients feeling medically supported on multiple measures of physical and mental health.","Sloan, Gordon, Harwood, Lever, Wincup, Bosley, Brimicombe, Pilling, Sutton, Holloway, D'Cruz","https://doi.org/10.1093/rap/rkaa072","20210219","COVID-19; SLE; lupus; pandemic; patient behaviour; patient care; psychology; rheumatology; systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10945,""
"Electrocardiographic Risk Stratification in COVID-19 Patients","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in worldwide morbidity at unprecedented scale. Troponin elevation is a frequent laboratory finding in hospitalized patients with the disease, and may reflect direct vascular injury or non-specific supply-demand imbalance. In this work, we assessed the correlation between different ranges of Troponin elevation, Electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities, and mortality. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively studied 204 consecutive patients hospitalized at NYU Langone Health with COVID-19. Serial ECG tracings were evaluated in conjunction with laboratory data including Troponin. Mortality was analyzed in respect to the degree of Troponin elevation and the presence of ECG changes including ST elevation, ST depression or T wave inversion. <b>Results:</b> Mortality increased in parallel with increase in Troponin elevation groups and reached 60% when Troponin was &gt;1 ng/ml. In patients with mild Troponin rise (0.05-1.00 ng/ml) the presence of ECG abnormality and particularly T wave inversions resulted in significantly greater mortality. <b>Conclusion:</b> ECG repolarization abnormalities may represent a marker of clinical severity in patients with mild elevation in Troponin values. This finding can be used to enhance risk stratification in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Chorin, Dai, Kogan, Wadhwani, Shulman, Nadeau-Routhier, Knotts, Bar-Cohen, Barbhaiya, Aizer, Holmes, Bernstein, Spinelli, Park, Chinitz, Jankelson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.636073","20210219","COVIDÃ¢Ë†â€™19; ECG; mortality; predictors; troponin","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10946,""

Given the health and economic threats posed by the pandemic to the global community, there are concerns that rates of suicide and suicidal behaviour may rise during and in its aftermath. Our living systematic review (LSR) focuses on suicide prevention in relation to COVID-19, with this iteration synthesising relevant evidence up to June 7 <sup>th</sup> 2020. <b>Method:</b> Ã‚Â Automated daily searches feed into a web-based database with screening and data extraction functionalities. Eligibility criteria include incidence/prevalence of suicidal behaviour, exposure-outcome relationships and effects of interventions in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes of interest are suicide, self-harm or attempted suicide and suicidal thoughts. No restrictions are placed on language or study type, except for single-person case reports. <b>Results:</b> Searches identified 2070 articles, 29 (28 studies) met our inclusion criteria, of which 14 articles were research letters or pre-prints awaiting peer review. All articles reported observational data: 12 cross-sectional; eight case series; five modelling; and three service utilisation studies. No studies reported on changes in rates of suicidal behaviour. Case series were largely drawn from news reporting in low/middle income countries and factors associated with suicide included fear of infection, social isolation and economic concerns. Ã‚ <b>Conclusions: Ã‚Â </b>A marked improvement in the quality of design, methods, and reporting in future studies is needed. There is thus far no clear evidence of an increase in suicide, self-harm, suicidal behaviour, or suicidal thoughts associated with the pandemic. However, suicide data are challenging to collect in real time and economic effects are evolving.

"Social Network Structure Is Related to Functional Improvement From Home-Based Telerehabilitation After Stroke","<b>Objective:</b> Telerehabilitation (TR) is now, in the context of COVID-19, more clinically relevant than ever as a major source of outpatient care. The social network of a patient is a critical yet understudied factor in the success of TR that may influence both engagement in therapy programs and post-stroke outcomes. We designed a 12-week home-based TR program for stroke patients and evaluated which social factors might be related to motor gains and reduced depressive symptoms. <b>Methods:</b> Stroke patients (<i>n</i> = 13) with arm motor deficits underwent supervised home-based TR for 12 weeks with routine assessments of motor function and mood. At the 6-week midpoint, we mapped each patient's personal social network and evaluated relationships between social network metrics and functional improvements from TR. Finally, we compared social networks of TR patients with a historical cohort of 176 stroke patients who did not receive any TR to identify social network differences. <b>Results:</b> Both network size and network density were related to walk time improvement (<i>p</i> = 0.025; <i>p</i> = 0.003). Social network density was related to arm motor gains (<i>p</i> = 0.003). Social network size was related to reduced depressive symptoms (<i>p</i> = 0.015). TR patient networks were larger (<i>p</i> = 0.012) and less dense (<i>p</i> = 0.046) than historical stroke control networks. <b>Conclusions:</b> Social network structure is positively related to improvement in motor status and mood from TR. TR patients had larger and more open social networks than stroke patients who did not receive TR. Understanding how social networks intersect with TR outcomes is crucial to maximize effects of virtual rehabilitation.","Podury, Raefsky, Dodakian, McCafferty, Le, McKenzie, See, Zhou, Nguyen, Vanderschelden, Wong, Nazarzai, Heckhausen, Cramer, Dhand","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.603767","20210219","social networks; stroke; stroke recovery; telemedicine; telerehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10948,""
"Early and Mid-Term Implications of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Physical, Behavioral and Mental Health of Healthcare Professionals: The CoPE-HCP Study Protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented strain to healthcare systems worldwide and posed unique challenges to the healthcare professionals (HCPs) and the general public. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health, behavioral, and physical wellbeing of HCPs in the early and mid-term periods of the pandemic in comparison to non-HCPs. Thus, facilitating and guiding optimum planning and delivery of support to HCPs. An observational cross-sectional survey and cohort study aiming to enroll over 1050 participants (minimum, 800 HCPs and 250 controls). Study questionnaires will be completed at baseline and after 6-weeks and 4-months. Recruitment initiated July 2020. The study was designed in London, United Kingdom, but open to participants worldwide. Baseline: Questionnaires comprising of validated self-administered screening tools for depression, anxiety, sleep-related issues, wellbeing, and burnout. The questionnaires also explore changes in behavior and physical wellbeing of the participants. In addition, associations of these mental health and behavioral factors with work-related factors and support will be explored. Six-weeks and 4-months follow-up: Follow-up questionnaires will assess change in symptoms of anxiety and depression, sleep disorders, use of alcohol and other substances, behavioral or interpersonal relationship changes. Physical wellbeing will be assessed through the presence of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection and absence from work. We will also evaluate the impact of variable provision of personal protection equipment (supply and training), extended working hours, and concern for the wellbeing of family members, anxiety levels, and evidence of burnout. The study has 80% power to detect a 10% difference of combined depression and/or anxiety symptoms between the groups using two-sided type 1 error at 0.05 at baseline. Assuming that only 50% of these HCPs agree to be a part of a cohort survey, we will have 80% power to detect around 12% difference in the two groups in reported physical symptoms (20% vs. 32.3%), or prevalence of depression and/or anxiety at the end of the study.

"Reduced Activity in an Inpatient Liaison Psychiatry Service During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Comparison With 2019 Data and Characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 Positive Cohort","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in the way that healthcare was accessed and delivered in the United Kingdom (UK), particularly during the peak of the first lockdown period (the &quot;first wave&quot;) beginning in March 2020. In some patients, COVID-19 is associated with acute neuropsychiatric manifestations, and there is suggestion that there may also be longer term neuropsychiatric complications. Despite this, at the time of writing there are only emerging data on the direct effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatric care. <b>Methods:</b> In this retrospective study we analyzed referrals to an inpatient liaison psychiatry department of a large acute teaching hospital during the first wave of covid-19 in the UK and compared this data to the same period in 2019. <b>Results:</b> We saw a 40% reduction in the number of referrals in 2020, with an increase in the proportion of referrals for both psychosis or mania and delirium. Almost one third (28%) of referred patients tested positive for COVID-19 at some point during their admission, with 40% of these presenting with delirium as a consequence of their COVID-19 illness. Save delirium, we did not find evidence for high prevalence of new-onset acute mental illness in COVID-19 positive patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our data indicate decreased clinical activity in our inpatient psychiatry liaison department during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, although a relative increase in relative increase in referrals for psychosis or mania, suggesting less of a relative decrease in more severe cases of mental illness. The reasons for this are likely multifactorial, including structural changes in the NHS and patient reluctance to present to emergency departments (ED) due to infection fears and Government advice. Our data also supports the literature suggesting the high relative prevalence of delirium in COVID-19, and we support integration of psychiatry liaison teams in acute general hospital wards to optimize delirium management.

"Motivations and methods of dual users to quit vaping: Survey findings from adults who use electronic and combustible cigarettes","Most adults who use electronic cigarettes (ECs) also smoke combustible cigarettes (CCs). Quitting ECs appears common among dual users but little is known regarding adult dual users' motivations and methods to quit ECs or how this relates to quitting CCs. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk, a web-based crowd-sourcing service, to survey 366 US adults with a history of regular EC and CC use. This analysis examined motivations and methods to quit both products among a subset of 204 (55.7%) respondents with dual use and a history of one or more attempts to quit ECs. Most respondents (95%) were using ECs at the time of this survey and had a lifetime median of five EC quit attempts. The most common motivations to quit ECs were health (74%), money/cost (45%), and to reduce risk of COVID-19 (25%). The most common EC quit methods were cutting down (68%), getting advice from a doctor (28%), quitting 'cold turkey' (24%), nicotine replacement therapy (24%), and switching to ECs with less nicotine (24%). Most motivations and methods to quit ECs and CCs were moderately to highly correlated, suggesting similarity in dual users' approach to quitting the two products. Dual users had a range of motivations and methods to quit ECs, most of which were similar to their motivations and methods to quit CCs. These findings support the need to develop treatment for adults motivated to quit ECs and demonstrate that dual users may currently engage in similar strategies to quit both products.","Klemperer, Villanti","https://doi.org/10.18332/tid/132547","20210219","cessation; cigarette smoking; electronic cigarettes; motivation to quit; quit attempt","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10951,""
"The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Graduating Class Students at the University of Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia","A poorly known contagious disease outbreak, like COVID-19, leads to unavoidable stress, fear, and anxiety. During the pandemic, University students suffer from adverse mental health outcomes resulted from the continuous spread of the disease, sensational media reporting, and implementation of social lockdown. Graduating class students are more affected due to cancellation and postponing of anticipated events such as exchange studies and graduation ceremonies. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety, depression, and stress among graduating class students. Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from November 10 to 30, 2020 at the University of Gondar. A simple random sampling technique was employed to select 350 students. Data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire, entered in EPI DATA version 3, analyzed using SPSS version 21, and presented in frequencies, percentages, tables, and graphs. Bivariable and multivariable analysis was investigated using a binary logistic regression model. The prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression among graduating class students was 22.2%, 39.6%, and 40.2% respectively. Living in an urban area, living with a family, sedentary lifestyle, unable to practice COVID-19 preventive measures, and having a contact history increases the risk of developing stress. Living in an urban area, substance use, sedentary lifestyle, and fear of infecting family increase the risk of developing anxiety. Students who came from an urban area, live with a family, study non-health departments, had confirmed cases in the family and did not perform physical exercise had higher odds of developing depression. More than one-fifth, more than one-third, and nearly two-fifths of graduating students had stress, anxiety, and depression respectively. It is better to develop effective strategies and interventions, train students about self-protection, and establish a psychological crisis intervention team to minimize the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mekonen, Workneh, Ali, Muluneh","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S300262","20210219","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; graduating class students; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10952,""
"The Psychological Experience and Intervention in Post-Acute COVID-19 Inpatients","COVID-19 patients faced first-hand the life-threatening consequences of the disease, oftentimes involving prolonged hospitalization in isolation from family and friends. This study aimed at describing the psychological intervention to address the psychological difficulties and issues encountered by the hospitalized post-acute COVID-19 patients in a rehabilitation setting. Patients' demographics, medical diagnosis, and neuro-psychological information were collected from March 2<sup>nd</sup> to May 12<sup>th</sup>, 2020. The main psychological issues and intervention strategies were collected. A total of 181 patients were hospitalized during this period. Among them, the 47.5% underwent psychological assessment (N=86; age: 74.58Ã‚Â±13.39; 54.7% females). The most common psychological issues were acute stress disorders (18.6%), anxious and demoralization symptoms (26.7%), depression (10.5%%), and troublesome grief (8.1%). Once recovered from COVID-19, many patients were discharged home (38.4%), some received further rehabilitation in non-COVID-19 wards (41.9%), mostly due to pre-existent diseases (72.2%) rather than to COVID-19 complications (27.8%). A great number of the hospitalized post-acute COVID-19 patients showed psychological issues requiring psychological intervention, the most common were anxiety, demoralization, acute stress, depression, and grief. The proposed psychological treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients was conducted in a Cognitive Behavioral framework. In particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic, psychological intervention is an important part of rehabilitation in the post-acute phase of the illness to reduce distress symptoms and improve psychological health.","Rossi Ferrario, Panzeri, Cerutti, Sacco","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S283558","20210219","COVID-19 patients; clinical psychology; health psychology; psychological intervention; rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10953,""
"Acute psychological impact on COVID-19 patients in Hubei: a multicenter observational study","We conducted a multicentre cross-sectional survey of COVID-19 patients to evaluate the acute psychological impact on the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during isolation treatment based on online questionnaires from 2 February to 5 March 2020. A total of 460 COVID-19 patients from 13 medical centers in Hubei province were investigated for their mental health status using online questionnaires (including Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-15, and Insomnia Severity Index scales). Among all 460 COVID-19 patients, 187 (40.65%) of them were healthcare workers (HCWs). 297 (64.57%) of them were females. The most common psychological problems were somatization symptoms (66.09%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°304), followed by depression (53.48%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°246), anxiety (46.30%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°213), problems of insomnia (42.01%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°171), and then self-mutilating or suicidal thoughts (23.26%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°107). Of all the patients, 15.65% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°72) had severe somatization symptoms, and 2.83% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13) had severe (almost every day) self-mutilating or suicidal thoughts. The most common psychological problems for HCWs were somatization symptoms (67.84%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°125), followed by depression (51.87%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°97), anxiety (44.92%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°84), problems of insomnia (36.18%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°55), and then self-mutilating or suicidal thoughts (20.86%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°39). Patients with lower education levels were found to be associated with higher incidence of self-mutilating or suicidal thoughts (odds ratio [OR], 2.68, 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.66-4.33 [PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001]). Patients with abnormal body temperature were found to be associated with higher incidence of self-mutilating or suicidal thoughts (OR, 3.97, 95% CI, 2.07-7.63 [PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001]), somatic symptoms (OR, 2.06, 95% CI, 1.20-3.55 [PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.009]) and insomnia (OR, 1.66, 95% CI, 1.04-2.65 [PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.033]). Those with suspected infected family members displayed a higher prevalence of anxiety than those without infected family members (OR, 1.61, 95% CI, 1.1-2.37 [PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.015]). Patients at the age of 18-44 years old had fewer somatic symptoms than those aged over 45 years old (OR, 1.91, 95% CI, 1.3-2.81 [PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001]). In conclusion, COVID-19 patients tended to have a high prevalence of adverse psychological events. Early identification and intervention should be conducted to avoid extreme events such as self-mutilating or suicidal impulsivity for COVID-19 patients, especially for those with low education levels and females who have undergone divorce or bereavement.","Wang, Hu, Zhao, Feng, Wang, Cai, Guo, Xu, Luo, Guo, Zhang, Chen, Zhu, Wang, Chen, Ma, Zhan, Cao, Huang, Yang, Fang, Zhu, Yang","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01259-0","20210219","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10954,""
"Protocol of the COVID-19 Health and Adherence Research in Scotland (CHARIS) study: understanding changes in adherence to transmission-reducing behaviours, mental and general health, in repeated cross-sectional representative survey of the Scottish population","COVID-19 has unprecedented consequences on population health, with governments worldwide issuing stringent public health directives. In the absence of a vaccine, a key way to control the pandemic is through behavioural change: people adhering to transmission-reducing behaviours (TRBs), such as physical distancing, hand washing and wearing face covering. Non-adherence may be explained by theories of how people think about the illness (the common-sense model of self-regulation) and/or how they think about the TRBs (social cognition theory and protection motivation theory). In addition, outbreaks of infectious diseases and the measures employed to curb them are likely to have detrimental effects on people's mental and general health. Therefore, in representative repeated surveys, we will apply behavioural theories to model adherence to TRBs and the effects on mental and general health in the Scottish population from June to November 2020, following the initial outbreak of COVID-19. Repeated 20 min structured telephone surveys will be conducted with nationally representative random samples of 500 adults in Scotland. The first 6 weeks the survey will be conducted weekly, thereafter fortnightly, for a total of 14 waves (total n=7000). Ipsos MORI will recruit participants through random digit dialling. The core survey will measure the primary outcomes of adherence to TRBs, mental and general health, and explanatory variables from the theories. Further questions will be added, enabling more detailed measurement of constructs in the core survey, additional themes and questions that align with the evolving pandemic. Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Life Sciences and Medicine College Ethics Review Board (CERB) at the University of Aberdeen (CERB/2020/5/1942). Results will be made available to policy makers, funders, interested lay people and other researchers through weekly reports and three bimonthly bulletins placed on the CHARIS website and advertised through social media.","Den Daas, Hubbard, Johnston, Dixon, Allan, Cristea, Davis, Dobbie, Fitzgerald, Fleming, Fraquharson, Gorely, Gray, Grindle, Harkess-Murphy, Hunt, Ion, Kidd, Lansdown, Macaden, Maltinsky, Mercer, Murchie, O'Carroll, O'Donnell, Ozakinci, Pitkethly, Reid, Sidhva, Stead, Stewart, Tolson, Thompson, Wyke","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044135","20210219","COVID-19; infection control; mental health; preventive medicine; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10955,""
"Depressive symptoms among Peruvian adult residents amidst a National Lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic","Population health and well-being in Latin America, the current epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, has been severely affected during the past semester. Despite the growing evidence about the link between the pandemic, its control measures, and mental health worldwide, there is still no regional evidence of the potential mental health impact. We describe the prevalence and distribution of depressive symptoms across demographic and socioeconomic risk factors in the Peruvian population amidst a national lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional study conducted during the community transmission phase and national lockdown in Peru (May 4th-16th, 2020). We recorded 64,493 responses from adult Peruvian residents through an opt-in online questionnaire. All analyses were weighted using raking based on proportions of sociodemographic variables from the last Peruvian census in 2017. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was calculated using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score of 10 or more. We identified associated demographic and socioeconomic factors by prior mental health diagnosis. Sensitivity analysis considered an alternative cut-off point for depressive symptoms of PHQ-9Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°14. A total of 57,446 participants were included in the analytical sample. A third of the participants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°23,526, unweighted) showed depressive symptoms in the 2Ã‚Â weeks prior to the study. Participants who reported a previous mental health diagnosis doubled the sample prevalence of depressive symptoms (59, 95%CI 56.7, 61.4%) of those without a prior diagnosis. Psychosocial and functioning reactions were largely more prevalent among females and young adults. A dose-response relationship was found between household income and depressive symptoms across previous mental health diagnosis strata, being as low as 32% less in the wealthiest than the most impoverished group (PR: 0.68, 95%CI 0.58,0.79). Other critical factors associated with a higher burden of depressive symptoms were lower education level, single, unemployed, and chronic comorbidity. An increased burden of depressive symptoms and psychosocial reactions has emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru compared to previous years. The mental health burden disproportionately affects women, the younger population, and those with low income and education. As the country eases the social distancing measures, it is crucial to use local evidence to adjust public health policies and mental health services to the renewed population needs.","Antiporta, CutipÃƒÂ©, Mendoza, Celentano, Stuart, Bruni","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03107-3","20210219","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10956,""
"Social Support and Aggressive Communication on Social Network Sites during the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, use of social networking sites (SNSs) surged in many countries, including the United States.

In addition to analyzing social support, this study examined aggressive communication, which often leads to undesirable mental health outcomes, on Reddit, YouTube, and Facebook during this period. According to the Social Identity Model of Individuation Effects (SIDE), anonymous environments which codify civil communication norms are more likely to yield prosocial behavior. Results indicate that Reddit, YouTube, and Facebook varied significantly in supportive and aggressive communication prevalence. Reddit users more frequently provided social support than did YouTube and Facebook users. Additionally, Reddit users engaged in aggressive communication significantly less than both YouTube and Facebook users. These findings support predictions from the SIDE model, as Reddit both offers users greater anonymity than YouTube and Facebook and codifies supportive, civil communication norms in a rules system called, &quot;Reddiquette.&quot;","Seiter, Brophy","https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2021.1886399","20210219","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10957,""

However, findings regarding social media's impact on young adults' mental health are mixed. There is a need to identify social mechanisms underlying the effect of social media on mental health outcomes. Our study breaks new ground by proposing and testing a moderated mediation pathway from social media use to stress in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a two-wave online panel survey in the context of China. With a general basis of the Street's three-stage model, our results indicated that social media failed to directly affect young adults' stress. Instead, fatalism completely mediated this relationship. Also, one's perceived social media exhaustion negatively moderated this mediation pathway. The findings have significant theoretical and practical implications for the use of social media to promote health, well-being, and quality of life among young people during public health crises.","Ngien, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2021.1888438","20210219","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10958,""

"Supporting youth 12-24 during the COVID-19 pandemic: how Foundry is mobilizing to provide information, resources and hope across the province of British Columbia","Foundry is a province-wide network of integrated health and social service centres for young people aged 12-24 in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Online resources and virtual care broaden Foundry's reach. Its online platform - foundrybc.ca - offers information and resources on topics such as mental health, sexual wellness, life skills, and other content suggested by youth and young adults. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant and unique challenges to the youth and their families/caregivers served by Foundry. Disruptions to school, access to essential healthcare services such as counselling, familial financial security and related consequences has left young people with heightened anxiety. The Foundry team mobilized to respond to these extenuating circumstances and support BC youth and their families/caregivers during this hard time through three goals: (1) to amplify (and translate for young people and their families/caregivers) key messages released by government to support public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) to develop content that supports the needs of young people and their families/caregivers that existed before COVID-19 and are likely to be exacerbated as a result of this pandemic; and (3) to develop and host opportunities through social media and website articles to engage young people and their families/caregivers by creating a sense of community and promoting togetherness and social connection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each goal and plan integrated the leadership, feedback and needs of youth and their families through engagement with Foundry's provincial youth and family advisory committees. Our study evaluated Foundry's media response to the COVID-19 pandemic by recording/measuring (1) the website/social content created, including emerged thematic topic areas; (2) the process of topic identification through engagement with youth and young adults; (3) the social and website analytics of the created content; and (4) the constant, critical team-reflection of our response to the pandemic.

"Individual, social and national coping resources and their relationships with mental health and anxiety: A comparative study in Israel, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands during the Coronavirus pandemic","Employing the salutogenic model, we asked how individuals in different countries cope with the COVID-19 crisis and stay healthy. We were interested in exploring the individual (i.e. sense of coherence) as well as the social and national resources (i.e. social support, sense of national coherence, and trust in governmental institutions) that could explain levels of mental health and anxiety during the outbreak of the pandemic. Data collection was conducted via convenience sampling on online platforms, during the end of March and the beginning of April 2020. The data included four samples: 640 Israeli participants (319 males), 622 Dutch participants (177 males), 924 Italian participants (338 males) and 489 Spanish participants (117 males); age range of 18-88Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. The questionnaires included standard tools (MHC-SF, GAD-7, SOC, SONC). Several questions were adapted to the context of coronavirus and measured levels of exposure to COVID-19, trust in governmental institutions, and social support. The results significantly confirmed the suggested salutogenic model regarding the contribution to individual and national coping resources to anxiety levels and mental health. The patterns of the coping resources in explaining anxiety and mental health were similar in the four samples, and SOC was the main predictor these outcomes. Despite these similarities, a different pattern and also different magnitudes of the predictive value of the coping resources were found for the two different reactions: anxiety vs. mental health. While SOC and situational factors (like financial threat) were significant in explaining anxiety levels, the SOC and national resources were found as significant in explaining mental health levels. The findings support the salutogenic approach in studying reactions during pandemic time. They also shed some light on the difference between pathogenic and salutogenic measures in studying psychological reactions to stressful situations.","Mana, Super, Sardu, Juvinya Canal, Moran, Sagy","https://doi.org/10.1177/1757975921992957","20210219","COVID-19; Social support; anxiety; mental health; sense of coherence; sense of national coherence; stress; trust","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10961,""
"Online Social Connection as a Buffer of Health Anxiety and Isolation During COVID-19","<b>Abstract</b> COVID-19 has given rise to a myriad of social, psychological, and health-related complications. The specific mental health implications of COVID-19 are still being uncovered, but we know that there are likely to be negative outcomes for many people. This is particularly the case for vulnerable members of the community, such as those with high health anxiety, and under conditions where individuals feel isolated or disconnected from others. The objective of this study was to examine whether the level of socially motivated Internet use acts as a buffer of the relationship between health anxiety, isolation behaviors, and depression. Participants (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°473; 67.3 percent female; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°23.03, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.50) from Australia completed self-report measures during the height of the national pandemic restrictions (April-May 2020). A regression analysis revealed positive relationships between health anxiety and isolation behaviors on depression and highlighted a three-way interaction effect. Specifically, health anxiety was significantly negatively associated with depression when participants engaged in fewer isolation behaviors. However, at higher levels of isolation behaviors, the relationship between health anxiety and depression was attenuated for participants with greater levels of online social connection. The findings suggest that online social connection buffered the negative effects of health anxiety under conditions of isolation. These results offer promising avenues to mitigate against vulnerabilities during the pandemic and highlight the need to promote alternate social support mechanisms in the absence of face-to-face connection.","Stuart, O'Donnell, O'Donnell, Scott, Barber","https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0645","20210219","COVID-19; depression; health anxiety; isolation; online social connection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10962,""

"Severe effects of the COVID-19 confinement on young children's sleep: A longitudinal study identifying risk and protective factors","The COVID-19 confinement has dramatically altered daily routines, causing decreased sleep quality in adults. This necessitates careful observation, as sleep plays a crucial role in brain maturation and poor sleep increases the risk of psychopathology, particularly in the young population. Through an online survey with one baseline (April 2020) and two follow-up assessments (May and June 2020), we examined the effect of confinement on sleep quality in 452 babies (0-35Ã‚Â months) and 412 preschool children (36-71Ã‚Â months) from several, mainly European, countries. An acute decrease in sleep quality was found in both groups of children. However, at follow-up assessments, this effect rebounded to the level reported for the period before the confinement. Importantly, caregiver's stress level was identified as a substantial risk factor determining lower sleep quality in both groups of children across assessments. Protective factors conserving children's sleep quality included caregiver's engagement in mindfulness techniques or childcare, and the presence of siblings and pets. In the near future, we may repeatedly experience the circumstances of abruptly enforced confinement. Our findings reveal promising pathways of action to protect young children's sleep, with which to essentially mitigate the long-term consequences of the pandemic on brain development and mental health.","Markovic, MÃƒÂ¼hlematter, Beaugrand, Camos, Kurth","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13314","20210218","bedtime; circadian rhythm; lockdown; sensitive period; sleep regulation; stay-at-home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10964,""

Clinician satisfaction and experiences using telehealth across a variety of services (individual, group or family therapy, initial assessments, evaluation and management, and neuropsychological assessment) were assessed using a mixed-methods approach. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> Across services, a majority agreed/strongly agreed that telehealth provided an opportunity to build rapport with patients (67-88%) and they could treat their patients' needs well (71-88%). The interest in continuing to use telehealth when in-person visits resume varied by type of service provided (50-71%). Group therapy and initial assessment were lowest (50% and 51%, respectively). Clinicians noted telehealth improved access to care for patients with logistical barriers, competing demands, mobility difficulties, and medical concerns; but was more challenging to care for patients with certain psychiatric characteristics (e.g., psychosis, paranoia, catatonia, high distractibility, and avoidance), high symptom severity, or who needed to improve social skills. Telehealth influenced the therapeutic process (e.g., observations of family dynamic, increased patient/clinician therapeutic alliance). <b> <i>Discussion and Conclusions:</i> </b> MH/SUD clinicians who quickly transitioned to telehealth care during the pandemic were largely satisfied with telehealth, but also identified challenges related to specific patient characteristics, or types of MH/SUD services. These observations warrant additional study to better delineate the role for an expanded use of telehealth postpandemic.","Sugarman, Horvitz, Greenfield, Busch","https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0481","20210218","behavioral health; mental health; telehealth; telemedicine; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10968,""
"Unmet Social Needs And Worse Mental Health After Expiration Of COVID-19 Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation","Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) provided unemployment insurance beneficiaries an extra $600 a week during the unprecedented economic downturn during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but it initially expired in July 2020. We applied difference-in-differences models to nationally representative data from the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey to examine changes in unmet health-related social needs and mental health among unemployment insurance beneficiaries before and after initial expiration of FPUC. The initial expiration was associated with a 10.79-percentage-point increase in risk for self-reported missed housing payments. Further, risk for food insufficiency, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms also increased among households that reported receiving unemployment insurance benefits, relative to the period when FPUC was in effect. As further unemployment insurance reform is debated, policy makers should recognize the potential health impact of unemployment insurance.","Berkowitz, Basu","https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.01990","20210218","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10969,""
"Successful Emergency Treatment of Refractory Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome With Electroconvulsive Therapy and a Novel Use of Dexmedetomidine: A Case Report From California in the Era of COVID-19","We describe the case of a patient, hospitalized in a California community medical ICU for over a month, with severe neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), unresponsive to medical management, but responsive to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). We discuss the medical, logistical, and legal challenges in providing ECT in this setting. We also describe a previously unpublished use of dexmedetomidine, which aided in the safe and rapid reduction of benzodiazepines and permitted a successful ECT course. The rapid delivery and efficacy of ECT were essential because of the burgeoning coronavirus pandemic. The patient's treatment required exemplary efforts by providers across multiple disciplines, ongoing medicolegal consultation with the county mental health medical director, as well as consultation with expert members of the International Society for ECT and Neurostimulation. We conclude with a discussion of the unique challenges of providing emergency ECT to patients in California, including during a serious pandemic, when courts are closed. This case illustrates the importance of cultivating and maintaining high-quality ECT expertise in community hospitals and keeping ECT services available even during pandemics. Also, this case demonstrates that ECT is not &quot;merely an elective procedure&quot; but a vital, life-saving treatment, even during the era of COVID-19. To our knowledge, this is the first such published case of emergency ECT performed in California.","Rajan, Sage","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCT.0000000000000725","20210218","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10970,""

Cross-sectional study within a large prospective, multicenter cohort of (ex-)breast cancer patients, i.e., UMBRELLA. All participants enrolled in the UMBRELLA cohort between October 2013 and April 2020 were sent a COVID-19-specific survey, including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. In total, 1051 (66.0%) participants completed the survey. During COVID-19, 284 (27.0%) participants reported clinically relevant increased levels of anxiety and/or depression, i.e., total HADS scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°12. Participants with anxiety and/or depression reported statistically significant higher barriers to contact their general practitioner (47.5% vs. 25.0%, resp.) and breast cancer physicians (26.8% vs. 11.2%, resp.) compared to participants without these symptoms. In addition, a higher proportion of participants with anxiety and/or depression reported that their current treatment or (after)care was affected by COVID-19 compared to those without these symptoms (32.7% vs. 20.5%, resp.). Factors independently associated with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression during COVID-19 were pre-existent anxiety (OR 6.1, 95% CI 4.1-9.2) or depression (OR 6.0, 95% CI 3.5-10.2).

"COVID-19 shelter-at-home and work, lifestyle and well-being in desk workers","Emerging cross-sectional reports find that the COVID-19 pandemic and related social restrictions negatively affect lifestyle behaviours and mental health in general populations. To study the longitudinal impact of COVID-19 on work practices, lifestyle and well-being among desk workers during shelter-at-home restrictions. We added follow-up after completion of a clinical trial among desk workers to longitudinally measure sedentary behaviour, physical activity, sleep, diet, mood, quality of life and work-related health using validated questionnaires and surveys. We compared outcomes assessed before and during COVID-19 shelter-at-home restrictions. We assessed whether changes in outcomes differed by remote working status (always, changed to or never remote) using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Participants (N = 112; 69% female; mean (SD) age = 45.4 (12.3) years; follow-up = 13.5 (6.8) months) had substantial changes to work practices, including 72% changing to remote work. Deleterious changes from before to during shelter-at-home included: 1.3 (3.5)-h increase in non-workday sedentary behaviour; 0.7 (2.8)-point worsening of sleep quality; 8.5 (21.2)-point increase in mood disturbance; reductions in five of eight quality of life subscales; 0.5 (1.1)-point decrease in work-related health (P &lt; 0.05). Other outcomes, including diet, physical activity and workday sedentary behaviour, remained stable (P Ã¢â€°Â¥ 0.05). Workers who were remote before and during the pandemic had greater increases in non-workday sedentary behaviour and stress, with greater declines in physical functioning. Wake time was delayed overall by 41 (61) min, and more so in workers who changed to remote.

"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Frontline Health Care Workers During the Pandemic Surge in New York City","This study sought to assess the magnitude of and factors associated with mental health outcomes among frontline health care workers (FHCWs) providing care during the Spring 2020 COVID-19 pandemic surge in New York City. A cross-sectional, survey-based study over 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks during the Spring 2020 pandemic surge was used to assess symptoms of COVID-19-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in 2,579 FHCWs at the Mount Sinai Hospital. Participants were additionally asked about their occupational and personal exposures to COVID-19. Multivariable logistic regression and relative importance analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with these outcomes. A total of 3,360 of 6,026 individuals completed the survey (55.8% participation), with 2,579 (76.8%) analyzed based on endorsing frontline responsibilities and providing information related to the three outcomes. 1,005 (39.0%) met criteria for symptoms of COVID-19-related PTSD, MDD, or GAD. 599 (23.3%) screened positively for PTSD symptoms, 683 (26.6%) for MDD symptoms, and 642 (25.0%) for GAD symptoms. Multivariable analyses revealed that past-year burnout was associated with the highest risk of developing symptoms for COVID-19-related PTSD (odds ratio [OR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.10), MDD (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.83), and GAD (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.68). Higher perceived support from hospital leadership was associated with a lowest risk of all outcomes [PTSD (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.75), MDD (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.72), and GAD (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.76). In this large sample of FHCWs providing care during the 2020 NYC pandemic surge, 39% experienced symptoms of COVID-19-related PTSD, MDD, and/or GAD and pre-pandemic burnout as well as leadership support were identified as the most highly associated factors. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at reducing burnout and augmenting support from hospital leadership may be appropriate targets to mitigate the risk for developing further psychopathology in this population and others working in the midst of crisis.","Feingold, Peccoralo, Chan, Kaplan, Kaye-Kauderer, Charney, Verity, Hurtado, Burka, Syed, Murrough, Feder, Pietrzak, Ripp","https://doi.org/10.1177/2470547020977891","20210219","COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; depression; frontline; health care workers; posttraumatic stress; psychological symptoms; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10973,""
"Beliefs and Risk Perceptions About COVID-19: Evidence From Two Successive French Representative Surveys During Lockdown","The outbreak of COVID-19 has been a major interrupting event, challenging how societies and individuals deal with risk. An essential determinant of the virus' spread is a series of individual decisions, such as wearing face masks in public space. Those decisions depend on trade-offs between costs (or benefits) and risks, and beliefs are key to explain these. We elicit beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic during lockdown in France by means of surveys asking French citizens about their belief of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) for COVID-19, own risk to catch the disease, risk as perceived by others, and expected prevalence rate. Those self-assessments were measured twice during lockdown: about 2 weeks after lockdown started and about 2 weeks before lockdown ended. We also measured the quality of these beliefs with respect to available evidence at the time of the surveys, allowing us to assess the calibration of beliefs based on risk-related socio-demographics. Finally, comparing own risk to expected prevalence rates in the two successive surveys provides a dynamic view of comparative optimism with respect to the disease. The risk perceptions are rather high in absolute terms and they increased between the two surveys. We found no evidence for an impact of personal experience with COVID-19 on beliefs and lower risk perceptions of the IFR when someone in the respondent's family has been diagnosed with a disease. Answers to survey 1 confirmed this pattern with a clear indication that respondents were optimistic about their chances to catch COVID-19. However, in survey 2, respondents revealed comparative pessimism. The results show that respondents overestimated the probabilities to catch or die from COVID-19, which is not unusual and does not necessarily reflect a strong deviation from rational behavior. While a rational model explains why the own risk to catch COVID-19 rose between the two surveys, it does not explain why the subjective assessment of the IFR remained stable. The comparative pessimism in survey 2 was likely due to a concomitant increase in the respondents' perceived chances to catch the disease and a decreased expected prevalence rate.","Attema, L'Haridon, Raude, Seror, Peretti-Watel, Seror, Cortaredona, Launay, Raude, Verger, Alleaume, Fressard, Beck, Legleye, L'Haridon, Ward","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.619145","20210219","COVID-19; beliefs; comparative optimism; rational learning; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10974,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic: Demographic Predictors of Self-Isolation or Self-Quarantine and Impact of Isolation and Quarantine on Perceived Stress, Anxiety, and Depression","<b>Introduction:</b> With the sudden onset and global dispersal of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many nations including Canada attempted to reduce spread of the resultant COVID-19 syndrome with self-isolation and quarantine, while seeking a cure or vaccine for this disease. Understanding impacts of self-isolation and self-quarantine on stress, anxiety, and depression will help us to mitigate these issues through appropriate development of mental health services. <b>Methods:</b> The sample was drawn from individuals who self-subscribed to Text4Hope, a service that delivers text messages based on a cognitive behavioral therapy framework. Text4Hope was developed to support Albertans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subscribers were asked for demographic information and if they had to self-isolate or self-quarantine during the pandemic via a survey link. Mental health was assessed using the validated instruments: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item scale (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Descriptive statistics and Chi-Square test results were derived using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version-26. <b>Results:</b> 6,041 of 32,805 Text4Hope subscribers (18.4%) completed the survey. Of these respondents, 19.2% had self-isolated or self-quarantined in Alberta as of March 31, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. <i>Post-hoc</i> analysis using adjusted residuals suggested that individuals aged 60 years of age or older, and retirees had a higher likelihood of self-isolation or self-quarantine, compared to respondents with other age or employment characteristics. One-week prevalence rates for self-reported measures of moderate to high stress, likely Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and likely Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were 84.9, 46.7, and 41.4%, respectively. Respondents who had to self-isolate or self-quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly more likely to present with moderate to high stress, significant anxiety symptomatology, and significant depressive symptomatology. <b>Conclusions:</b> Older age and employment status were significantly associated with the likelihood of self-isolation or self-quarantine. We found elevated self-reported levels of anxiety and depression associated with self-reported COVID-19 pandemic-related self-isolation and self-quarantine activity. These findings have mental health implications both during and after the pandemic and demonstrate the need for greater focus on psychological complications of self-isolation and self-quarantine, and development of optimal ways to manage these pandemic consequences.","Nkire, Mrklas, Hrabok, Gusnowski, Vuong, Surood, Abba-Aji, Urichuk, Cao, Greenshaw, Agyapong","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.553468","20210219","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; isolation; pandemic; quarantine; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10975,""
"Keeping young people connected during COVID-19: the role of online groups","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on young people, disrupting education, routines, hobbies and peer interactions and there is concern for longer term effects on physical and mental health outcomes. Young people living with chronic health conditions face additional challenges including reduced or no face-to-face contact with medical teams, shielding and the increased stressors of being in 'at-risk' groups and social isolation. In a climate of social isolation and disconnectedness, online groups could provide a method of delivering healthcare and support that strengthens social connectedness and reduces isolation. Despite the technology being available, uptake and evidence for online groups is limited. This article shares learnings from a paediatric and adolescent psychology service delivering online groups for young people with chronic health conditions and their healthcare teams. Ideas for how to transfer group process to online platforms are considered, with examples and tips. With sufficient staffing, preparation, thought, creativity and innovation, it is possible for face-to-face groups to successfully be offered online. Caution should be exercised trying to run online groups without these provisions in place, as the safety, comfort and experience of young people could be jeopardised. Further research is needed to better understand group processes online and to consider what is lost and what is gained when comparing online to face-to-face groups.","Flannery, Portnoy, Daniildi, Kambakara Gedara, Korchak, Lambert, McParland, Payne, Salvo, Valentino, Christie","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2020-320222","20210218","adolescent health; psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10976,""

Some of these unique interventions in B.C., although in many cases only mere announcements with limited scope, are based on the philosophy of safe supply to illegal street drugs. Despite all the efforts during the pandemic, overdose deaths have spiked by over 100% compared to the previous year. Therefore, we urge the Canadian federal government, specifically the Honorable Patty Hajdu, the federal Minister of Health, to decriminalize simple possession immediately by granting exemption under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

"Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health (Riseup-PPD-COVID-19): protocol for an international prospective cohort study","Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is a new pandemic, declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization, which could have negative consequences for pregnant and postpartum women. The scarce evidence published to date suggests that perinatal mental health has deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the few studies published so far have some limitations, such as a cross-sectional design and the omission of important factors for the understanding of perinatal mental health, including governmental restriction measures and healthcare practices implemented at the maternity hospitals. Within the Riseup-PPD COST Action, a study is underway to assess the impact of COVID-19 in perinatal mental health. The primary objectives are to (1) evaluate changes in perinatal mental health outcomes; and (2) determine the risk and protective factors for perinatal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we will compare the results between the countries participating in the study. This is an international prospective cohort study, with a baseline and three follow-up assessments over a six-month period. It is being carried out in 11 European countries (Albania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Israel, Malta, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom), Argentina, Brazil and Chile. The sample consists of adult pregnant and postpartum women (with infants up to 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of age). The assessment includes measures on COVID-19 epidemiology and public health measures (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker dataset), Coronavirus Perinatal Experiences (COPE questionnaires), psychological distress (BSI-18), depression (EPDS), anxiety (GAD-7) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSD checklist for DSM-V). This study will provide important information for understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health and well-being, including the identification of potential risk and protective factors by implementing predictive models using machine learning techniques. The findings will help policymakers develop suitable guidelines and prevention strategies for perinatal mental health and contribute to designing tailored mental health interventions.

The aim of the investigation is to evaluate the benefits of 20-30 minutes in contact with nature. The Scientific Community, also through the evidence-based design approach, has already demonstrated the importance of greenery and nature on the psychophysical well-being of people and, in a moment of emergency, contact with the nature can be therapeutic and quite influential on the mental health of staff subject to stress. During the lockdown, an Italian multidisciplinary working group promoted an experience-based survey, based on the Profile of Mood States methodology, for measuring the psychophysical well-being of hospital staff. The author collected 77 questionnaires. The benefits that users have obtained from the experience in nature have been investigated by comparing the type of stresses they were subjected to and highlighting various peculiarities in the data analysis associated with the type of green in which they carried out the survey, the healthcare areas in which they worked during the pandemic emergency, and the moment in which the survey was conducted. The study has highlighted that a short break in green spaces strongly influenced the mental and psychophysical well-being of hospital staff, emphasizing the importance of nearby green spaces in architectures for health.

"Prospective Examination of Adolescent Sleep Patterns and Behaviors Before and During COVID-19","Study Objectives: To prospectively examine changes in adolescent sleep before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in adolescents with and without ADHD. Methods: Participants were 122 adolescents (ages 15-17; 61% male; 48% with ADHD). Parents reported on adolescentsâ€™ sleep duration and difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS); adolescents reported on sleep patterns, sleep duration, delayed sleep/wake behaviors, and daytime sleepiness before (September 2019-February 2020) and during (May-June 2020) COVID-19. Adolescents also reported on their health behaviors, COVID-19-related negative affect, and difficulties concentrating due to COVID-19. Results: Parents reported adolescents had more DIMS during COVID-19 than before COVID-19, with clinically-elevated rates increasing from 24% to 36%. Both bedtimes and waketimes shifted later during COVID-19, and adolescents reported more delayed sleep/wake behaviors. Adolescents also reported less daytime sleepiness and longer school night sleep duration during COVID-19. In considering differences between adolescents with and without ADHD, adolescents with ADHD did not experience an increase in school night sleep duration and were less likely to obtain recommended sleep duration during COVID-19. In the full sample, controlling for ADHD status, COVID-19-related sadness/loneliness was associated with increases in DIMS, and spending less time outside and more COVID-19-related worries/fears were associated with increases in delayed sleep/wake behaviors during COVID-19. Conclusions: COVID-19 had negative and positive impacts on adolescent sleep. Adolescents with ADHD did not experience the benefit of increased school night sleep duration during COVID-19 like adolescents without ADHD. Negative affect and health behaviors may be useful intervention targets for reducing negative impacts of COVID-19 for adolescent sleep.","Stephen P.

A prolonged pandemic can harm global levels of optimism, regularity, and sense of meaning and belonging of people, yielding adverse effects on individual's mental health as represented by worry, paranoia, and distress. Here we studied resilience, a successful adaptation despite risk and adversity, in five countries: Brazil, Colombia, Germany, Israel and Norway. In April 2020, over 2500 participants were recruited for an observational study measuring protective and obstructive factors for mental health. More than 800 of these participants also completed a follow-up study in July. We found that thriving, keeping a regular schedule, engaging in physical exercise and less procrastination served as factors protecting mental well-being. Risk factors were financial worries and a more negative mindset, e.g. feeling a lack of control. Longitudinally, we found no increase in distress or paranoia despite an increase in expectation how long the outbreak and the restrictions will last, suggesting respondents engaged in healthy coping and adapting their life to the new circumstances. Thus, our data shines some light on the mostly depressive news during the pandemic. Humans adapt and despite adversity there are protective factors that policy makers should leverage on.","Martin Jensen MÃ¦kelÃ¦ et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46188-7B1-7FE","20210220","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-20","",10983,""
