"Self-reported Memory Problems Eight Months after Non-Hospitalized COVID-19 in a Large Cohort","Background: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 range from ageusia and anosmia, experienced by most patients, to altered consciousness and rare and severe encephalopathy. A direct affection of the central nervous system (CNS) in the disease has been supported by animal models and MRI findings in patients with mild and severe symptoms. Here we report eight-month data on memory problems for non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative patients and untested volunteers. Objective: To explore the association between non-hospitalized COVID-19 eight months previously and self-reported memory problems. Methods: We followed a cohort of 13156 participants that was invited after (1) being tested for SARS-CoV-2 with a combined oropharyngeal- and nasopharyngeal swab or (2) randomly selected from the Norwegian population (untested). Participants completed online baseline- and follow-up questionnaires detailing underlying medical conditions, demographics, symptoms, and items from the RAND-36 questionnaire on health-related quality of life and known confounders for memory problems. Results: After repeated invitations, the participation rate was 40% (N=794) of SARS-CoV-2 positive, 26% (N=7993) of negative, and 22% (N=4369) of untested randomly selected invitees. All participants completed the baseline questionnaire as a part of inclusion. The follow-up period was 248 days (SD=18) from baseline, and the follow-up questionnaire was completed by 75% of SARS-CoV-2 positive participants, 65% of negative participants, and 73% of untested randomly selected participants. At follow-up, 49 (11.5%) of the SARS-CoV-2 positive participants reported memory problems in contrast to 173 (4.1%) of the SARS-CoV-2 negative participants and 65 (2.4%) of the untested randomly selected participants. In a multivariate model, SARS-CoV-2 positivity remained strongly associated with reporting memory problems at eight months follow-up compared to the SARS-CoV-2 negative group (odds ratio (OR) 4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8-5.2) and the untested group (OR 4.9, 95% CI 3.4-7.2). Compared to the other groups, SARS-CoV-2 positive participants also reported more concentration problems and a significant worsening of health compared to one year ago at follow-up. Feeling depressed, less energy, or pain were reported relatively equally by the different groups. Summary: We find that 11.5% of COVID-19 patients experience memory problems eight months after the disease. SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, and the long-term consequences of infections are therefore unknown. Our results show that a relatively high proportion of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients report memory problems eight months after the disease.","Arne Soraas; Ragnhild Ro; Karl T Kalleberg; Merete Ellingjord-Dale; Nils I Landro","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.21252151","20210226","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11186,""
"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices towards SARS-COV-2 Infection in the United Arab Emirates Population: a Cross-sectional Survey-based Study","In the current situation involving the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the disease containment depends mainly on the populations preventive practices and self-isolation. In this study, we explored the adult populations approach towards COVID-19 in UAE between the 4th and 14th of April 2020. We used a community-based, cross-sectional study using a self-administered electronic questionnaire covering five different aspects: demographics, knowledge, practice, attitude, source and trust of information, and a patient health questionnaire (PHQ-2) for depression screening. A total of 1,867 people responded to the survey. Knowledge results were better in people with higher education levels, non-UAE nationals, those with a higher PHQ-2 score, or with a positive contact history with a SARS-COV-2 infected patient. The best practice scores were shown by participants with high knowledge scores and education levels. Depression risk was significantly higher in men, non-UAE nationals, in those with lower knowledge scores, and younger ages. The most followed practices were staying home, handwashing, avoiding social gatherings, limiting three people per vehicle, and avoiding public transportation. The least practiced measures were covering the face while sneezing or coughing and wearing masks. Although staying home was reported by 92.5% of participants, 22.6% mentioned that they were visited by more than 2 people and visited others in 18.4% during the last week. Social media was the source of information for 82.1% of the participants, and most trusted doctors and healthcare providers. A depression risk was present in 18.9% of the participants and the majority of respondents agreed that SARS-COV-2 infection will finally be successfully controlled. The obtained results on knowledge and practices, although satisfactory, could be insufficient to prevent this pandemic from being contained. We recommend the intensification of awareness programs and good practices. Mental health is an area worth further studies.","Hamda Musabbah Alremeithia; Aljazia Khalfan Algheflia; Rouqyah Abdulla Almadhania; Latifa Mohammad Baynouna Alketbi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252331","20210226","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11187,""
"The neurology and neuropsychiatry of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the early literature reveals frequent CNS manifestations and key emerging narratives","Objectives There is accumulating evidence of the neurological and neuropsychiatric features of infection with SARS-CoV-2. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to describe the characteristics of the early literature and estimate point prevalences for neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo and CINAHL up to 18 July 2020 for randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies and case series. Studies reporting prevalences of neurological or neuropsychiatric symptoms were synthesised into meta-analyses to estimate pooled prevalence. Results 13,292 records were screened by at least two authors to identify 215 included studies, of which there were 37 cohort studies, 15 case-control studies, 80 cross-sectional studies and 83 case series from 30 countries. 147 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The symptoms with the highest prevalence were anosmia (43.1% [35.2-51.3], n=15,975, 63 studies), weakness (40.0% [27.9-53.5], n=221, 3 studies), fatigue (37.8% [31.6-44.4], n=21,101, 67 studies), dysgeusia (37.2% [30.0-45.3], n=13,686, 52 studies), myalgia (25.1% [19.8-31.3], n=66.268, 76 studies), depression (23.0 % [11.8-40.2], n=43,128, 10 studies), headache (20.7% [95% CI 16.1-26.1], n=64,613, 84 studies), anxiety (15.9% [5.6-37.7], n=42,566, 9 studies) and altered mental status (8.2% [4.4-14.8], n=49,326, 19 studies). Heterogeneity for most clinical manifestations was high. Conclusions Neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 in the pandemic's early phase are varied and common. The neurological and psychiatric academic communities should develop systems to facilitate high-quality methodologies, including more rapid examination of the longitudinal course of neuropsychiatric complications of newly emerging diseases and their relationship to neuroimaging and inflammatory biomarkers.","Jonathan P Rogers; Cameron Watson; James Badenoch; Benjamin Cross; Matthew Butler; Jia Song; Danish Hafeez; Hamilton Morrin; Emma Rachel Rengasamy; Lucretia Thomas; Silviya Ralovska; Abigail Smakowski; Ritika Dilip Sundaram; Camille Kaitlyn Hunt; Mao Fong Lim; Daruj Aniwattanapong; Vanshika Singh; Zain Hussain; Stuti Chakraborty; Ella Burchill; Katrin Jansen; Heinz Holling; Dean Walton; Thomas A Pollak; Mark Ellul; Ivan Koychev; Tom Solomon; Benedict Daniel Michael; Timothy R Nicholson; Alasdair G Rooney","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252335","20210226","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11188,""
"Heterogeneous Mental Health Development During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United Kingdom","Aim. The COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation measures by governments have upended the economic and social lives of many, leading to widespread psychological distress. However, how distress developed during the pandemic and who was most affected is poorly understood. We explore heterogeneity in trajectories of psychological distress during the first six months of the pandemic in the United Kingdom and relate this heterogeneity to socio-demographic and health factors. Subjects and Methods. We analyze six waves of longitudinal, nationally representative survey data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (N = 15,218), covering the first lockdown in 2020. First, latent class mixture modelling (LCCM) is used to identify trajectories of psychological distress. Second, associations of the trajectories with covariates are tested with multinomial logistic regressions. Results. We find four different trajectories of distress: continuously low, continuously moderate, temporarily elevated, and continuously elevated distress. One-fifth of the population experienced severely elevated risks of distress. Long-term exposure was highest among younger people, women, those who lost income, and those with previous health conditions or COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusion. Given the threat of persistent stress on health, policy measures should be sensitized to the unintended yet far-reaching consequences of non-pharmaceutical interventions.","Lea Ellwardt; Patrick Praeg","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21251565","20210226","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11189,""
"Long COVID neuropsychological deficits after severe, moderate or mild infection","Background: There is growing awareness that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can include long-term neuropsychological deficits, even in its mild or moderate respiratory forms. Methods: Standardized neuropsychological, psychiatric, neurological and olfactory tests were administered to 45 patients (categorized according to the severity of their respiratory symptoms during the acute phase) 236.51 (SD: 22.54) days post-discharge following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Deficits were found in all the domains of cognition and the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms was also high in the three groups. The severe performed more poorly on long-term episodic memory and exhibited greater anosognosia. The moderate had poorer emotion recognition, which was positively correlated with persistent olfactory dysfunction. The mild were more stressed, anxious and depressed. Conclusion: The data support the hypothesis that the virus targets the central nervous system (and notably the limbic system), and support the notion of different neuropsychological phenotypes.","Philippe Voruz; Gilles Allali; Lamyae Benzakour; Anthony Nuber-Champier; Marine Thomasson; Isabele Jacot; Jordan Pierce; Patrice Lalive; Karl-Olof Lovblad; Olivia Brallaird; Matteo Coen; Jacques Serratrice; Jerome Pugin; Radek Ptak; Idriss Guessous; Basile Landis; Frederic Assal; Julie Anne Peron","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252329","20210226","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11190,""
"Genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders and risk of COVID-19","Background Pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders have been associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown, e.g. to what extent genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders contributes to the observed association. Methods The analytic sample consisted of white British participants of UK Biobank registered in England, with available genetic data, and alive on Jan 31, 2020 (i.e., the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK) (n=346,554). We assessed individuals' genetic predisposition to different psychiatric disorders, including substance misuse, depression, anxiety, and psychotic disorder, using polygenic risk score (PRS). Diagnoses of psychiatric disorders were identified through the UK Biobank hospital inpatient data. We performed a GWAS analysis for each psychiatric disorder in a randomly selected half of the study population who were free of COVID-19 (i.e., the base dataset). For the other half (i.e., the target dataset), PRS was calculated for each psychiatric disorder using the discovered genetic variants from the base dataset. We then examined the association between PRS of each psychiatric disorder and risk of COVID-19, or severe COVID-19 (i.e., hospitalization and death), using logistic regression models. The ascertainment of COVID-19 was through the Public Health England dataset, the UK Biobank hospital inpatient data and death registers, updated until July 26, 2020. For validation, we repeated the PRS analyses based on publicly available GWAS summary statistics. Results 155,988 participants (including 1,451 COVID-19 cases), with a mean age of 68.50 years at COVID-19 outbreak, were included for PRS analysis. Higher genetic liability forwards psychiatric disorders was associated with increased risk of both any COVID-19 and severe COVID-19, especially genetic risk for substance misuse and depression. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for any COVID-19 were 1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.31) and 1.26 (1.11-1.42) among individuals with a high genetic risk (above the upper tertile of PRS) for substance misuse and depression, respectively, compared with individuals with a low genetic risk (below the lower tertile). Largely similar ORs were noted for severe COVID-19 and similar albeit slightly lower estimates using PRSs generated from GWAS summary statistics from independent samples. Conclusion In the UK Biobank, genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19, including severe course of the disease. These findings suggest the potential role of genetic factors in the observed phenotypic association between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19, underscoring the need of increased medical surveillance of for this vulnerable population during the pandemic.","Wenwen Chen; Yu Zeng; Chen Suo; Huazhen Yang; Yilong Chen; Can Hou; Yao Hu; Zhiye Ying; Yajing Sun; Yuanyuan Qu; Donghao Lu; Fang Fang; Unnur A.

"Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health: A Longitudinal Study Using Penalized Logistic Regression","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant influence on the public mental health in a stealthy manner. Current efforts focus on alleviating the impacts of the disease on public health and economy, with the psychological effects due to COVID-19 largely ignored. In this paper, we analyze a mental health related dataset from the US to enhance our understanding of human reactions to the pandemic. We are particularly interested in providing quantitative characterization of the pandemic impact on the public mental health, on top of qualitative explorations. We employ the multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) method to deal with missing values and take the logistic regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method to identify risk factors for mental health. The analyses are conducted to a large scale of online survey data from 12 consecutive weeks, so that the longitudinal trend of the risk factors can be investigated. Our analysis results unveil evidence-based findings to identify the groups who are psychologically vulnerable to COVID-19. This study is useful to assist healthcare providers and policy makers to take steps for mitigating the pandemic effects on public mental health.","Jingyu Cui; Jingwei Lu; Yijia Weng; Grace Yun Yi; Wenqing He","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.21.21252159","20210225","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11192,""
"Clustering of Countries for COVID-19 Cases based on Disease Prevalence, Health Systems and Environmental Indicators","The coronavirus has a high basic reproduction number (R0) and has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Prevalence of underlying diseases shows strong correlation with COVID-19 whereas environmental health indicators are weakly correlated with COVID-19.","Amna Rizvi; Muhammad Umair; Muhammad Aamir Cheema","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251762","20210219","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11193,""

"Effect of Layperson-Delivered, Empathy-Focused Program of Telephone Calls on Loneliness, Depression, and Anxiety Among Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Randomized Clinical Trial","Importance: Loneliness is a risk factor for many clinical conditions, but there are few effective interventions deployable at scale. Objective: To determine whether a layperson-delivered, empathy-focused program of telephone calls could rapidly improve loneliness, depression, and anxiety in at-risk adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: From July 6 to September 24, 2020, we recruited and followed up 240 adults who were assigned to receive calls (intervention group) or no calls (control group) via block randomization. Loneliness, depression, and anxiety were measured using validated scales at enrollment and after 4 weeks. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted. Meals on Wheels Central Texas (MOWCTX) clients received calls in their homes or wherever they might have been when the call was received. The study included MOWCTX clients who fit their service criteria, including being homebound and expressing a need for food. A total of 296 participants were screened, of whom 240 were randomized to intervention or control. Interventions: Sixteen callers, aged 17 to 23 years, were briefly trained in empathetic conversational techniques. Each called 6 to 9 participants over 4 weeks daily for the first 5 days, after which clients could choose to drop down to fewer calls but no less than 2 calls a week. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was loneliness (3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, range 3-9; and 6-item De Jong Giervald Loneliness [De Jong] Scale, range 0-6). Secondary outcomes were depression (Personal Health Questionnaire for Depression), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), and self-rated health (Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire). Results: The 240 participants were aged 27 to 101 years, with 63% aged at least 65 years (n = 149 of 232), 56% living alone (n = 135 of 240), 79% women (n = 190 of 240), 39% Black or African American (n = 94 of 240), and 22% Hispanic or Latino (n = 52 of 240), and all reported at least 1 chronic condition. Of 240 participants enrolled, 13 were lost to follow-up in the intervention arm and 1 in the control arm. Postassessment differences between intervention and control after 4 weeks showed an improvement of 1.1 on the UCLA Loneliness Scale (95% CI, 0.5-1.7; P < .001; Cohen d of 0.48), and improvement of 0.32 on De Jong (95% CI, -0.20 to 0.81; P = .06; Cohen d, 0.17) for loneliness; an improvement of 1.5 on the Personal Health Questionnaire for Depression (95% CI, 0.22-2.7; P < .001; Cohen d, 0.31) for depression; and an improvement of 1.8 on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (95% CI, 0.44 to 3.2; P < .001; Cohen d, 0.35) for anxiety. General physical health on the Short Form Health Questionnaire Survey showed no change, but mental health improved by 2.6 (95% CI, 0.81 to 4.4; P = .003; Cohen d of 0.46). Conclusions and Relevance: A layperson-delivered, empathy-oriented telephone call program reduced loneliness, depression, and anxiety compared with the control group and improved the general mental health of participants within 4 weeks. Future research can determine whether effects on depression and anxiety can be extended to maximize clinical relevance.

"Pandemic dreams: quantitative and qualitative features of the oneiric activity during the lockdown due to COVID-19 in Italy","The lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic had a strong impact on daily habits, emotional experience, mental health and sleep. A large body of evidence suggests that dreams are affected by both waking experiences and sleep pattern. In this view, the lockdown should have induced intense modifications in dreaming activity. The aim of the study was to assess dream features during the lockdown in Italy. We used an online survey to collect self-reported demographic, clinical, sleep and dream data. Our sample included 1091 participants. Results point to an increased dream frequency, emotional load, vividness, bizarreness and length during the lockdown, compared to a pre-lockdown period. Higher dream frequency and specific qualitative features were found in females and subjects with poor sleep quality, nocturnal disruptive behaviours and depressive symptoms. Most of the dream features assessed during the lockdown were predicted by age, gender, depressive symptoms, presence/absence of other people at home, and territorial area. A specific focus on sleep features revealed that sleep duration and several sleep quality indexes were the best predictors of dream variables. During the lockdown, dreams were also characterized by increased negative emotions, which were particularly frequent in females, younger adults, and participants with poor sleep quality, nocturnal disruptive behaviours, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Our results confirm the hypothesis of a strong influence of the pandemic on dreaming, supporting both the hypothesis of continuity between wake and sleep mental processes and the view of a crucial influence of sleep quality and duration on dreaming activity.","Gorgoni, Scarpelli, Alfonsi, Annarumma, Cordone, Stravolo, De Gennaro","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.02.006","20210225","COVID-19; Continuity hypothesis; Dreams; Emotions; Lockdown; Sleep pattern","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11228,""

A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between 12th and May 13, 2020. Quota sampling was used to attain equal gender and age distributions representative of the Japanese population. A total of 4127 complete responses were analysed. Higher educational level (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.045, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.002) and household income (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.04, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.009) were associated with a higher increase in preventive measures when comparing before and after the state of emergency was declared. The highest reported social anxiety was a feeling of fear (65.6%), followed by embarrassment (43.8%), keeping infection a secret (41.3%), avoidance (41.3%), and stigma (25.5%). A total of 86.1% of the respondents reported moderate to severe anxiety. The partial least square-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) revealed that being female has the greatest effect (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.246, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.0001) on higher current preventive measures, followed by social anxiety (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.119; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.153; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Perceived susceptibility (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.033, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.020), knowing someone who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.097, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), higher income (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.079, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) and educational level (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.045; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.004) all had a small but significant effect on influencing levels of preventive measures.

"Suicide Presentations to an Emergency Department PreÃ‚Â and During the COVID Lockdown, March-May 2020, in Spain","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown may affect suicide risk and behavior. We compared suicide-related presentations during the national quarantine with pre-COVID data. This observational incidence study compared all suicide-related presentations at the University Hospital Reina Sofia emergency department (ED) in Cordoba, Spain, for the lockdown period from 15 March to 15 May 2020, with the same period in 2019. Descriptive and inferential analyses of case characteristics between 2019 and 2020 periods were conducted, and a multivariable logistic regression model developed. Results: Despite a decrease in overall ED cases during the lockdown, the number of suicide-related presentations stayed the same and represented a significantly larger proportion of cases in comparison to the pre-COVID period (0.42 vs. 0.87%, in 2019 and 2020, respectively; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). The number presenting alone more than doubled during the COVID lockdown, increasing to 42.9% compared with 19.4% in 2019 (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.002). An increase in presentations with a family history of suicide was also found. Conclusions: Suicide cases represented an increased proportion of ED cases during the lockdown. Presenting to ED alone, having a family history of suicide, habitual drug consumption, and hospital admission to ICU differentiated cases between pre and during COVID periods. These findings should be considered in light of the second wave and further implementation of lockdown measures.","Prados-Ojeda, Gordillo-Urbano, Carrillo-PÃƒÂ©rez, VÃƒÂ¡zquez-Calvo, Herrera-CortÃƒÂ©s, CarreÃƒÂ±o-Ruiz, Font-Ugalde","https://doi.org/10.1080/13811118.2021.1887023","20210225","COVID-19; emergency department; pandemic; quarantine; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11231,""
"A wake-up call for burnout in Portuguese physicians during the COVID-19 outbreak: a national survey study","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has put a lot of physical and psychological pressure on healthcare professionals, including physicians at the frontline. Thus, evaluating the mental health status of physicians during the current pandemic is important to define future preventive guidelines from healthcare stakeholders. In this study, we intended to study alterations in the mental health status of Portuguese physicians working at the COVID-19 frontline, and potential sociodemographic factors influencing this status. A national survey was applied from 4 to 25 of May 2020 to infer differences in mental health status (depression, anxiety, stress, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms) between Portuguese physicians working at the frontline of COVID-19 (FRONT) and other physicians that were not working at the frontline (NFRONT). A representative sample of 420 participants stratified by age, sex, and the geographic region was analyzed (200 FRONT participants and 220 NFRONT individuals). Moreover, we explored the influence of several sociodemographic factors on mental health variables (age, sex, living conditions, and household composition). Our results showed that being female (ÃŽÂ² = 1.1, t = 2.5, p = 0.013) and working at the frontline (ÃŽÂ² = 1.4, t = 2.9, p = 0.004) are potential risk factors for stress. In contrast, having a house with green space was a potentially beneficial factor for stress (ÃŽÂ² = -1.5, t = -2.5, p = 0.014) and anxiety (ÃŽÂ² = -1.1, t = -2.4, p = 0.017).

This study examined the interaction of social support and resilient coping in predicting depressive symptoms among PLWH. PLWH residing in Buenos Aires, Argentina and in Miami, Florida (US) were asked to complete an anonymous survey on the impact of COVID-19. Statistical analysis included ordinary least squares regression. A total of 1,554 participants were included. Mean age was 47.30Ã‚Â years; 63.70% were men. A test of three-way interaction of social support Ãƒâ€” resilient coping Ãƒâ€” study site indicated differences by site (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.63, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04, 95%CI [-1.24, -0.02]). In Argentina, higher levels of social support and resilient coping were associated with lower depressive symptoms. Lower levels of social support and resilient coping were associated with higher depressive symptoms. The impact of COVID-19 on mental health illustrates the need for developing innovative strategies to support resilience and to enhance coping with stress and adversity among PLWH.

A national, cross-sectional, web-based survey was distributed to ENT specialists during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (21<sup>st</sup> May 2020-21<sup>st</sup> JuneÃ‚Â 2020). The questionnaire collected sociodemographic and COVID-19 related data. The GAD-7 was utilized to measure symptoms of clinically significant anxiety disorder. Thirty-eight ENT specialists (M/F:24/12, median age, 38.7Ã‚Â years (23-60Ã‚Â years)) completed the survey. About 34% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13) of participants screened positive for an anxiety disorder, of which 2 (5%) had moderate symptoms. The majority of participants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°32, 84%) felt ENT specialists had increased exposure to SARS-CoV-2 compared with other medical specialties. Additionally, 32% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12) felt incapable of protecting themselves from infection. An encouraging proportion of ENT specialists (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°22, 58%) were aware of psychological support available from national and institutional organizations. The long-term psychological sequelae of COVID-19 will be felt as the physical burden eases. As we adjust to new normalities, ENT surgeons must be conscientious of the mental health issues that arise from the working environment. Sources of anxiety emanated from a lack of control over infection risk, increased vulnerability to COVID-19 relative to other specialties and the implications this has for ENT specialists and their families. Future interventions must focus on increasing awareness of the available psychological support services for our healthcare workers.","Crotty, Corbett, Gary, Davey, Hughes, Keogh, Patil, Doherty","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02569-4","20210225","Anxiety; COVID-19; ENT; Mental health; Otolaryngology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11235,""
"Media Influence on Anxiety, Health Utility, and Health Beliefs Early in the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic-a Survey Study","The psychological effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and response are poorly understood. To understand the effects of the pandemic and response on anxiety and health utility in a nationally representative sample of US adults. A de-identified, cross-sectional survey was administered at the end of April 2020. Probability weights were assigned using estimates from the 2018 American Community Survey and Integrated Public Use Microdata Series Estimates. US adults 18-85Ã‚Â years of age with landline, texting-enabled cellphone, or internet access. Seven split-half survey blocks of 30 questions, assessing demographics, COVID-19-related health attitudes, and standardized measures of generalized self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, personality, and generic health utility. State/Trait anxiety scores, EQ-5D-3L Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, and demographic predictors of these scores. Among 4855 respondents, 56.7% checked COVID-19-related news several times daily, and 84.4% at least once daily. Only 65.7% desired SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for themselves, and 70.1% for their child. Mean state anxiety (S-anxiety) score was significantly higher than mean trait anxiety (T-anxiety) score (44.9, 95%CI 43.5-46.3 vs. 41.6, 95%CI 38.7-44.5; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03), with both scores significantly higher than previously published norms. In an adjusted regression model, less frequent news viewing was associated with significantly lower S-anxiety score. Mean EQ-5D-3L VAS score for the population was significantly lower vs. established US normative data (71.4 CI 67.4-75.5, std. error 2 vs. societal mean 80, std. error 0.1; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). EQ-5D-3L VAS score was bimodal (highest with hourly and no viewing) and significantly reduced with less media viewership in an adjusted model. Among a nationally representative sample, there were higher S-anxiety and lower EQ-5D-3L VAS scores compared to non-pandemic normative data, indicative of a potential detrimental acute effect of the pandemic. More frequent daily media viewership was significantly associated with higher S-anxiety but also predictive of higher health utility, as measured by EQ-5D-3L VAS scores.","Greenhawt, Kimball, DunnGalvin, Abrams, Shaker, Mosnaim, Comberiati, Nekliudov, Blyuss, Teufel, Munblit","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-020-06554-y","20210225","COVID-19; EQ-5D-3L; SARS-CoV-2; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; anxiety; health utility; media consumption; social media; state anxiety; trait anxiety; vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11236,""
"COVID-19 pandemic impact on people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases: Insights from patient-generated health data on social media","During the COVID-19 pandemic, much communication occurred online, through social media. This study aimed to provide patient perspective data on how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), using Twitter-based patient-generated health data (PGHD). A convenience sample of Twitter messages in English posted by people with RMDs was extracted between March 1, and July 12, 2020 and examined using thematic analysis. Included were Twitter messages that mentioned keywords and hashtags related to both COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2) and select RMDs. The RMDs monitored included inflammatory-driven (joint) conditions (Ankylosing Spondylitis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Lupus/Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and Gout). The analysis included 569 tweets by 375 Twitter users with RMDs across several countries. Eight themes emerged regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with RMDs: (1) lack of understanding of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19; (2) critical changes in health behaviour; (3) challenges in healthcare practice and communication with healthcare professionals; (4) difficulties with access to medical care; (5) negative impact on physical and mental health, coping strategies; (6) issues around work participation, (7) negative effects of the media; (8) awareness-raising. The findings show that Twitter serves as a real-time data source to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with RMDs. The platform provided &quot;early signals&quot; of potentially critical health behaviour changes. Future epidemics might benefit from the real-time use of Twitter-based PGHD to identify emerging health needs, facilitate communication, and inform clinical practice decisions.","Reuter, Deodhar, Makri, Zimmer, Berenbaum, Nikiphorou","https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keab174","20210225","COVID-19; Twitter; coronavirus; patient-generated health data; rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11237,""
"The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children - A resource for COVID-19 research: Questionnaire data capture April-May 2020","The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a prospective population-based cohort study which recruited pregnant women in 1990-1992. The resource provides an informative and efficient setting for collecting data on the current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In early March 2020, a questionnaire was developed in collaboration with other longitudinal population studies to ensure cross-cohort comparability. It targeted retrospective and current COVID-19 infection information (exposure assessment, symptom tracking and reported clinical outcomes) and the impact of both disease and mitigating measures implemented to manage the COVID-19 crisis more broadly. Data were collected on symptoms of COVID-19 and seasonal flu, travel prior to the pandemic, mental health and social, behavioural and lifestyle factors. The online questionnaire was deployed across the parent and offspring generations between the 9 <sup>th</sup> April and 15 <sup>th</sup> May 2020. 6807 participants completed the questionnaire (2706 original mothers, 1014 original fathers/partners, 2973 offspring (mean age ~28 years) and 114 partners of offspring). Eight (0.01%) participants (4 G0 and 4 G1) reported a positive test for COVID-19, 77 (1.13%; 28 G0 and 49 G1) reported that they had been told by a doctor they likely had COVID-19 and 865 (12.7%; 426 G0 and 439 G1) suspected that they have had COVID-19.Ã‚ Using algorithmically defined cases, we estimate that the predicted proportion of COVID-19 cases fell between 1.03% - 4.19% depending on timing of measurement during the period of reporting. Data from this first questionnaire will be complemented with at least two more follow-up questionnaires, linkage to health records and results of biological testing as they become available. Data has been released as: 1) a standard dataset containing <i>all</i> participant responses with key sociodemographic factors and 2) as a composite release coordinating data from the existing resource, thus enabling bespoke research across all areas supported by the study.","Northstone, Howarth, Smith, Bowring, Wells, Timpson","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16020.1","20210225","ALSPAC; COVID-19; Children of the 90s; birth cohort study; coronavirus; mental health; online questionnaire","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11238,""
"Workforce challenges in digital health implementation: How are clinical psychology training programmes developing digital competences?","Digital practice in psychological services is a rapidly expanding and innovative area which is supporting continuation of clinical provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. Training the workforce to deliver safe and effective online psychological provision is key to service success and relies on accurate mapping of competences and current training needs. This paper discusses the initial stage for developing the first digital mental health competence framework for applied psychology in the UK. It reports on the digital training currently provided nationally and barriers/facilitators to acquiring these competencies. Eighteen of the thirty UK Clinical Psychology Doctoral training programmes completed a 16-item survey. This mapped current digital health teaching and skills acquisition for trainee Clinical Psychologists throughout their 3-year pre-registration training. Furthermore, potential barriers and facilitators to developing these digital skills for both trainee and qualified Clinical Psychologists were investigated. The quantitative analysis highlighted the majority of respondents viewed developing digital mental health competencies with importance, but were not integrating this into teaching or clinical placements activity. The qualitative, inductive content analysis revealed seven key themes influencing the development of digital mental health skills, with the majority of respondents identifying with two themes; the need for practice guidelines (50% of respondents) and opportunities for digital mental health experience. The findings suggest the need for a greater focus on developing the digital health knowledge, skills, and confidence across trainee and qualified Clinical Psychologists. Strategic analysis indicated the need to develop a framework for digital mental health competences across the curriculum and placement experience. Easily accessible learning packages may support the implementation of training nationally.","Pote, Rees, Holloway-Biddle, Griffith","https://doi.org/10.1177/2055207620985396","20210225","Clinical Psychology; Digital Health; competences; training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11239,""

"COVID-19 Prevalence and Related Practices among Dental Hygienists in the United States","<b>Purpose:</b> Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, health care professionals have been challenged to provide appropriate preventive and therapeutic measures while using precautions to minimize disease transmission. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 among United States (US) dental hygienists, describe infection prevention and control procedures and any associated trends in mental health.<b>Methods:</b> Registered dental hygienists (RDHs) licensed in the US were invited to participate in a 30-question web-based survey. COVID-19 infection items included probable and confirmed results, COVID-19 related symptoms experienced in the last month, and level of concern about COVID-19 transmission to patients and themselves. The validated Patient Health Questionnaire 4 screened respondents for depression or anxiety. Personal protective equipment (PPE) use when treating patients was assessed. The research protocol and survey were approved by the American Dental Association IRB and registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04542915). Kruskal-Wallis and X<sup>2</sup> tests were used to test for associations between PPE use, PPE supply, mental health symptoms, and concern about COVID-19 transmission.<b>Results:</b> As of October 8, 2020, a total of 4,776 dental hygienists from all 50 states and Puerto Rico participated in the study. Respondents reported elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression. Of the respondents, 3.1% (n=149) had ever tested positive or been diagnosed with COVID-19. The majority of respondents (99.1%; n=3,328) who practiced dental hygiene reported their primary dental practice had enhanced infection prevention or control efforts in response to the pandemic. PPE use was significantly associated with years of experience as a dental hygienist, level of concern about COVID-19, and level of PPE supplies available (<i>p</i>-values&lt;0.01), but not type of dental practice (<i>p</i>-value 0.1).<b>Conclusion:</b> As of October 2020, the estimated prevalence rate of dental hygienists in the US having had COVID-19 was low.

"Implementation evaluation of staff support and wellbeing programmes at an academic health science centre during COVID-19: study protocol","Evidence from previous pandemics as well as early evidence from COVID-19 suggests risk of adverse mental health and wellbeing outcomes for healthcare workers. In response to these concerns, healthcare systems and organisations rapidly established staff support and wellbeing programmes. While there is emerging literature related to the effectiveness of such interventions, what is less well understood and evaluated is the evidence base regarding how such programmes are implemented; what supports and hinders their implementation; and how or if they are maintained following the initial acute phase of the pandemic. This study addresses this gap by studying the implementation process of COVID-19-related staff wellbeing programmes in the three UK NHS Trusts that make up one of Europe's largest academic health sciences centres, King's Health Partners. We will conduct a prospective, cross-sectional descriptive study using qualitative research methods and non-probability purposive sampling to identify a study participant group representative of the population and implementation activity of interest. We will conduct semi-structured interviews of between 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°min and 1 h. We will identify theory-driven elements in the dataset using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (barriers and drivers), Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment Framework (timeline/chronology/evolution of the implementation and different issues at different times) and Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (implementation strategies). We will then identify indicators of these constructs within the dataset and report them, as well as their inter-relationships. Through this study, we hope to better understand what factors hindered and enabled the implementation of three inter-linked staff support and wellbeing programmes and how/to what extent have these programmes been sustained. We will also explore whether implementation science frameworks are applicable and beneficial in conceptualising and understanding crisis driven and rapidly implemented interventions and in what ways, if any, they need to be adjusted when used in unprecedented circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Krausova, Gnanapragasam, Demetriou, Beck, Pires-Yfantouda, Docherty, Sevdalis","https://doi.org/10.1186/s43058-021-00128-7","20210225","CFIR; COVID-19; Coronavirus; EPIS; ERIC; Formative evaluation; Healthcare workers; Staff support; Staff wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11242,""
"Adapting inpatient addiction medicine consult services during the COVID-19 pandemic","We describe addiction consult services (ACS) adaptations implemented during the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic across four different North American sites: St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia; Oregon Health &amp; Sciences University in Portland, Oregon; Boston Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts; and Yale New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut. ACS made system, treatment, harm reduction, and discharge planning adaptations. System changes included patient visits shifting to primarily telephone-based consultations and ACS leading regional COVID-19 emergency response efforts such as substance use treatment care coordination for people experiencing homelessness in COVID-19 isolation units and regional substance use treatment initiatives. Treatment adaptations included providing longer buprenorphine bridge prescriptions at discharge with telemedicine follow-up appointments and completing benzodiazepine tapers or benzodiazepine alternatives for people with alcohol use disorder who could safely detoxify in outpatient settings. We believe that regulatory changes to buprenorphine, and in Vancouver other medications for opioid use disorder, helped increase engagement for hospitalized patients, as many of the barriers preventing them from accessing care on an ongoing basis were reduced. COVID-19 specific harm reductions recommendations were adopted and disseminated to inpatients. Discharge planning changes included peer mentors and social workers increasing hospital in-reach and discharge outreach for high-risk patients, in some cases providing prepaid cell phones for patients without phones. We believe that ACS were essential to hospitals' readiness to support patientsÃ‚Â that have been systematically marginilized during the pandemic. We suggest that hospitals invest in telehealth infrastructure within the hospital, and consider cellphone donations for people without cellphones, to help maintain access to care for vulnerable patients. In addition, we recommend hospital systems evaluate the impact of such interventions. As the economic strain on the healthcare system from COVID-19 threatens the very existence of ACS, overdose deaths continue rising across North America, highlighting the essential nature of these services. We believe it is imperative that health care systems continue investing in hospital-based ACS during public health crises.","Harris, Peterkin, Bach, Englander, Lapidus, Rolley, Weimer, Weinstein","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13722-021-00221-1","20210225","Addiction; COVID-19; Consult; Homelessness; Inpatient; Social-distancing; Substance use disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11243,""
"Mental health among outpatient reproductive health care providers during the US COVID-19 epidemic","Both inpatient and outpatient providers may be at increased risk of stress, anxiety and depression from their roles as health providers during the COVID-19 epidemic. This study explores how the US COVID-19 epidemic has increased feelings of stress, anxiety and depression among outpatient reproductive health providers. We conducted a survey with open-ended responses among outpatient reproductive health providers across the U.S. engaged in contraceptive care to collect data on their experiences with stress, anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 epidemic. The study population included physicians, nurses, social workers, and other health professions [nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°288]. Data were collected from April 21st-June 24th 2020. We used content analysis of free text responses among providers reporting increased stress, anxiety or depression. Two-thirds (184) of providers reported increased stress and one-third (96) reported increased anxiety or depression related to care provision during the COVID-19 epidemic. The major sources of stress, anxiety and depression were due to patient care, worry about becoming infected or infecting family members, work- and home-related concerns, experiencing provider burnout, and fear of the unknown. Concerns about quality of patient care, providers' changing responsibilities, lack of personal protective equipment, and difficulty coping with co-worker illness and absence all contributed to provider stress and anxiety. Worries about unemployment and childcare responsibilities were also highlighted. Providers attributed their stress, anxiety or depression to feeling overwhelmed, being unable to focus, lacking sleep, and worrying about the unknown. US outpatient providers are experiencing significant stress, anxiety, and depression during the US COVID-19 epidemic. Policy and programmatic responses are urgently needed to address the widespread adverse mental health consequences of this epidemic on outpatient providers, including reproductive health providers, across the US. Both inpatient and outpatient providers may be at increased risk of stress, anxiety and depression from their roles as health providers during the COVID-19 epidemic.

"Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 patients: mid-term follow up by cardiovascular magnetic resonance","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induces myocardial injury, either direct myocarditis or indirect injury due to systemic inflammatory response. Myocardial involvement has been proved to be one of the primary manifestations of COVID-19 infection, according to laboratory test, autopsy, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). However, the middle-term outcome of cardiac involvement after the patients were discharged from the hospital is yet unknown. The present study aimed to evaluate mid-term cardiac sequelae in recovered COVID-19 patients by CMR METHODS: A total of 47 recovered COVID-19 patients were prospectively recruited and underwent CMR examination. The CMR protocol consisted of black blood fat-suppressed T2 weighted imaging, T2 star mapping, left ventricle (LV) cine imaging, pre- and post-contrast T1 mapping, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). LGE were assessed in mixed both recovered COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. The LV and right ventricle (RV) function and LV mass were assessed and compared with healthy controls. A total of 44 recovered COVID-19 patients and 31 healthy controls were studied. LGE was found in 13 (30%) of COVID-19 patients. All LGE lesions were located in the mid myocardium and/or sub-epicardium with a scattered distribution. Further analysis showed that LGE-positive patients had significantly decreased LV peak global circumferential strain (GCS), RV peak GCS, RV peak global longitudinal strain (GLS) as compared to non-LGE patients (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), while no difference was found between the non-LGE patients and healthy controls. Myocardium injury existed in 30% of COVID-19 patients. These patients have depressed LV GCS and peak RV strains at the 3-month follow-up. CMR can monitor the COVID-19-induced myocarditis progression, and CMR strain analysis is a sensitive tool to evaluate the recovery of LV and RV dysfunction.","Wang, Li, Zhou, Jiang, Yan, Tao, Li, Xu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12968-021-00710-x","20210225","COVID-19; Cardiac dysfunction; Cardiac involvement; Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11245,""
"Paradigms about the COVID-19 pandemic: knowledge, attitudes and practices from medical students","As the disease caused by the novel coronavirus has spread globally, there has been significant economic instability in the healthcare systems. This reality was especially accentuated in Ecuador where, the shortage of healthcare workers combined with cultural and macroeconomic factors has led Ecuador to face the most aggressive outbreak in Latin America. In this context, the participation of final-year medical students on the front line is indispensable. Appropriate training on COVID-19 is an urgent requirement that universities and health systems must guarantee. We aimed to describe the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Ecuadorian final-year medical students that could potentially guide the design of better medical education curricula regarding COVID-19. This was a cross-sectional 33-item online survey conducted between April 6 to April 2020 assessing the knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and prognosis toward COVID-19 in Ecuadorian final-year medical students. It was sent by email, Facebook, and WhatsApp. A total of 309 students responded to the survey. Out of which 88% of students scored high (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 70% correct) for knowledge of the disease. The majority of students were pessimistic about possible government actions, which is reflected in the negative attitude towards the control of COVID-19 and volunteering during the outbreak in Ecuador (77%, and 58% of the students, respectively). Moreover, 91% of students said they did not have adequate protective equipment. The latter finding was significantly associated with negative attitudes. Although a large number of students displayed negative attitudes, the non-depreciable percentage of students who were willing to volunteer and the coexisting high level of knowledge displayed by students, suggests that Ecuador has a capable upcoming workforce that could benefit from an opportunity to strengthen, improve and advance their training in preparation for COVID-19. Not having personal protective equipment was significantly associated to negative attitudes. Providing the necessary tools and creating a national curriculum may be one of the most effective ways to ensure all students are trained, whilst simultaneously focusing on the students' most pressing concerns. With this additional training, negative attitudes will improve and students will be better qualified.","Lincango-Naranjo, Espinoza-Suarez, Solis-Pazmino, Vinueza-Moreano, Rodriguez-Villafuerte, Lincango-Naranjo, Barberis-Barcia, Ruiz-Sosa, Rojas-Velasco, Gravholt, Golembiewski, Soto-Becerra, Khan, Ortiz-Prado","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02559-1","20210225","Attitudes; COVID-19; Knowledge; Medical students; Perception; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11246,""
"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic outbreak on education and mental health of Chinese children aged 7-15Ã¢â‚¬â€°years: an online survey","The emerging of psychological problems triggered by COVID-19 particularly in children have been extensively highlighted and emphasized, but original research in this respect is still lagging behind. Therefore, we designed this study to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and the effectiveness and attitudes towards online education among Chinese children aged 7-15Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. A detailed questionnaire, comprising of 62 questions was designed and parents or caretakers of 7 to 15Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old children were invited to participate via WeChat, a multi-purpose messaging, social media and mobile payment app, which is widely used by the Chinese population. A total of 668 parents across different regions of China were included. During COVID-19 pandemic, 20.7 and 7.2% children report experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. PTSD and SMFQ-P scores are significantly higher in middle school and boarding school students compared to primary and day school students. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that school system and province of origin are factors significantly associated with developing PSTD symptoms. 44.3% respondents feel online education is effective in gaining knowledge and improving practical and communications skills. 78.0% believe the online education system is efficient. Overall 79.8% respondents are satisfied and children can adapt to this new education system. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we found 1 in five children have PTSD and 1 in 14 children have depressive symptoms. In summary, COVID-19 epidemic has caused PTSD and depression symptoms among Chinese children aged 7 to 15Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. In general, a large proportion of respondents are satisfied with online education, but still a substantial proportion of students are not comfortable with this new form of learning.

The mental health status of the people was noted to be affected during the COVID-19 outbreak. Assessment of several factors with significant associations with depression, anxiety and stress may aid in developing psychological interventions for vulnerable groups.","Hayat, Haq, Wang, Khan, Rehman, Rasool, Kadirhaz, Omer, Rasheed, Fang","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1884274","20210225","COVID-19; DASS-21; Pakistan; depression; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11248,""
"Emotional and Mental Wellbeing Following COVID-19 Public Health Measures on People Living With Dementia and Carers","To date, there appears to be no evidence on the longer-term impacts caused by COVID-19 and its related public health restrictions on some of the most vulnerable in our societies. The aim of this research was to explore the change in impact of COVID-19 public health measures on the mental wellbeing of people living with dementia (PLWD) and unpaid carers. Semi-structured, follow-up telephone interviews were conducted with PLWD and unpaid carers between June and July 2020. Participants were asked about their experiences of accessing social support services during the pandemic, and the impact of restrictions on their daily lives. 20 interviews were conducted and thematically analyzed, which produced 3 primary themes concerning emotional responses and impact to mental health and wellbeing during the course of the pandemic: 1) Impact on mental health during lockdown, 2) Changes to mental health following easing of public health, and 3) The long-term effect of public health measures. The findings from this research shed light on the longer-term psychological impacts of the UK Government's public health measures on PLWD and their carers. The loss of social support services was key in impacting this cohort mentally and emotionally, displaying a need for better psychological support, for both carers and PLWD.","Hanna, Giebel, Tetlow, Ward, Shenton, Cannon, Komuravelli, Gaughan, Eley, Rogers, Rajagopal, Limbert, Callaghan, Whittington, Butchard, Shaw, Gabbay","https://doi.org/10.1177/0891988721996816","20210225","alzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; anxiety; caregiver burden; dementia; elderly; health services research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11249,""
"Sex Differences in the Association Between Stress, Loneliness, and COVID-19 Burden among People with HIV in the US","Little is known about the psychological implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with HIV (PWH). The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 among men and women with HIV in Miami FL, USA. We hypothesized that the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic will be higher for women , and psychological factors will increase COVID-19 burden among them. People with (n = 231) and without HIV (n = 42) residing in Miami, FL completed a survey assessing psychological outcomes such as loneliness, depression and stress, as well as the burden of COVID-19 on their daily lives. T-tests and Chi-square analyses were used to assess sex differences in study variables. Logistic regression was used to compare the interaction effects predicting stress and loneliness by COVID-19 burden and sex. A total of 273 completed the survey; the outcomes of the study, loneliness and stress, did not differ by HIV status (p = .458 and p = 922). Overall, men and women reported similar prevalence of COVID-19 burden. However, a greater proportion of women reported losing childcare than men (18% vs 9%, p = 0.029, respectively), as well as losing mental health care (15% vs 7%, p = 0.049). There was a significant interaction between COVID-19 burden and sex for loneliness and stress such that the association between COVID-19 burden and loneliness was greater for women (p&lt;0.001) than for men (p =0.353) and the association between COVID-19 burden and stress was greater for women (p = 0.013) than men (p = 0.628). Both men and women with HIV are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but women may experience higher levels of stress and loneliness than men. Sex differences may require tailored interventions to more effectively mitigate the impact of the pandemic on mental health.","Jones, Rodriguez, Salazar, Montgomerie, Raccamarich, Uribe Starita, Barreto Ojeda, Beauchamps, Vazquez, Martinez, Alcaide","https://doi.org/10.1089/AID.2020.0289","20210225","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11250,""
"Preventive behaviors and mental-health related symptoms among immunocompromised adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: an analysis of the COVID Impact Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the continuity of care of U.S. adults living with chronic diseases, including immunocompromised adults. Disruption in care may be a barrier to identifying COVID-19 associated sequelae, such as mental health symptoms, among the immunocompromised. Our objectives were (1) to evaluate COVID-19-related preventive behaviors, with a focus on canceling doctor's appointments as a proxy for continuity of care, and (2) to compare COVID-19-related mental health symptoms among the immunocompromised with the general population. We used nationally-representative data of 10,760 U.S. adults from the publicly-available COVID-19 Household Impact Survey. We defined immunocompromised as adults with a self-reported diagnosis of &quot;a compromised immune system&quot; (n=854,7.6%). We compared adherence to self-reported COVID-19 preventive behaviors among immunocompromised adults compared to others using Ãâ€¡2-tests. We focused on continuity of care and estimated determinants of canceling doctor's appointments among the immunocompromised using multivariable Poisson regression to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We evaluated associations of mental health symptoms with being immunocompromised using multinomial logistic regression. Immunocompromised adults were more likely to adhere to recommended COVID-19 preventive behaviors including washing or sanitizing hands (96.3% vs. 89.8%,Ãâ€¡2&lt;0.001), maintaining social distance (91.9% vs. 83.7%,Ãâ€¡2&lt;0.001), and canceling a doctor's appointment (47.1% vs. 29.7%,Ãâ€¡2&lt;0.001). Hispanic adults (aPR:1.47,95% CI:1.12-1.92) and immunocompromised women (aPR:1.25,95% CI:1.00-1.56) were more likely to cancel doctor's appointments compared to NH-White adults and men, respectively. Immunocompromised adults reported higher odds of feeling nervous/anxious/on edge (cOR:1.89,95% CI: 1.44-2.51), depressed (cOR: 2.81,95% CI: 2.17-3.64), lonely (cOR: 2.28,95% CI: 1.74-2.98), and hopeless (cOR: 2.86,95% CI: 2.21-3.69) 3-7 days in the last week. Immunocompromised adults were more likely to cancel their doctor's appointments and report COVID19-related mental health symptoms. The continuity of care of immunocompromised adults should be prioritized via alternative interventions, such as telehealth.","Islam, Vidot, Havanur, Camacho-Rivera","https://doi.org/10.1089/AID.2020.0302","20210225","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11251,""
"Clinical Science Can Address Rising Eating Disorder Psychopathology during the Covid-19 Pandemic: Comment on Gruber et al, 2020","Eating disorders (EDs) are serious psychiatric disorders that affect 13-18% of young men and women. EDs are associated with substantial psychiatric and medical morbidity and mortality, indicating a critical need for improved identification and treatment. Despite the relatively high prevalence and severity of EDs, they are often omitted from discussions of mental health. This comment is in response to Gruber et al. (2020), who wrote an important article on the challenges and opportunities facing clinical scientists in the time of COVID-19. Our response article extends Gruber et al.â€™s (2020) paper by noting additional challenges facing people with an eating disorder during COVID-19 and recognizing opportunities for improved evidence-based assessment and treatment of this important population.","Kara Alise Christensen et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46086-192-6CE","20210225","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11252,""
"Physical Activity (PA) Improves Positive Moods for International Students During COVID-19: A Multiple Baseline Design Report","Most people have difficulties maintaining mental health during the COVID-19 pandemics. International college students are at increased risk of developing mental disorders, which calls for effective preventive interventions. Previous work found modest effectiveness of physical activity (PA) in preventing and treating depression, whereas whether the intervention is effective among healthy individuals remains unclear. This study aims to design a low-intensify physical training to improve international studentsâ€™ mood status. We used a 22-day multiple baseline design (MBD) with three healthy international students. The visual and randomization test were analyses using the R packages (RcmdrPlugin.SCDA and dependent packages). Results showed that taking mild aerobic exercise helps participants experience more positive moods (happy, energetic, concentrated), whereas PA had no significant effects on reducing negative moods (tired, anxious, depressed, sleepy). We suggest the importance of taking regular and mild exercise for international students at risk of mood disorders during the COVID-19.","Lingyao Tong Miss Miss Miss","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460E1-A7A-D8F","20210226","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; covid-19; mental disorder; physical activity; international students; single-case design; multiple baseline design","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11253,""

"Findings from an online survey on the mental health effects of COVID-19 on Canadians with disabilities and chronic health conditions","Although the COVID-19 pandemic has led to worsening mental health outcomes throughout the Canadian population, its effects have been more acute among already marginalized groups, including people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. This paper examines how heightened fears of contracting the virus, financial impacts, and social isolation contribute to declining mental health among this already vulnerable group. This paper investigates how increases in anxiety, stress, and despair are associated with concerns about getting infected, COVID-19-induced financial hardship, and increased social isolation as a result of adhering to protective measures among people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. This study uses original national quota-based online survey data (n=1,027) collected in June 2020 from people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. Three logistic regression models investigate the relationship between COVID-19's effects on finances, concerns about contracting the virus, changes in loneliness and belonging, and measures taken to combat the spread of COVID-19 and reports of increased anxiety, stress, and despair, net of covariates. Models show that increased anxiety, stress, and despair were associated with negative financial effects of COVID-19, greater concerns about contracting COVID-19, increased loneliness, and decreased feelings of belonging. Net of other covariates, increased measures taken to combat COVID-19 was not significantly associated with mental health outcomes. Findings address how the global health crisis is contributing to declining mental health status through heightened concerns over contracting the virus, increases in economic insecurity, and growing social isolation, speaking to how health pandemics exacerbate health inequalities.","David Pettinicchio et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-A74-BB7","20210226","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Counseling; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Counseling Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Disability and Society; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction; disability; mental health; anxiety; economic security; covid-19","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-26","",11255,""
