We characterized distress, coping, and preferences for support among NYC HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This was a cross-sectional web survey of physicians, advanced practice providers, residents/fellows, and nurses, conducted during a peak of inpatient admissions for COVID-19 in NYC (April 9thâ€“April 24th 2020) at a large medical center in NYC (n = 657). Results Positive screens for psychological symptoms were common; 57% for acute stress, 48% for depressive, and 33% for anxiety symptoms. For each, a higher percent of nurses/advanced practice providers screened positive vs. attending physicians, though housestaff's rates for acute stress and depression did not differ from either. Sixty-one percent of participants reported increased sense of meaning/purpose since the COVID-19 outbreak. Physical activity/exercise was the most common coping behavior (59%), and access to an individual therapist with online self-guided counseling (33%) garnered the most interest. Conclusions NYC HCWs, especially nurses and advanced practice providers, are experiencing COVID-19-related psychological distress. Participants reported using empirically-supported coping behaviors, and endorsed indicators of resilience, but they also reported interest in additional wellness resources. Programs developed to mitigate stress among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic should integrate HCW preferences.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.06.007","20200901","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-27","",2052,""
"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Multi-institutional Study from New York City","Objective To assess clinical characteristics and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Study design Children with MIS-C admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICU) in New York City between April 23 and May 23, 2020 were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Results Of 33 children with MIS-C, the median age was 10 years; 61% were male; 45% were Hispanic/Latino; 39% were black. Comorbidities were present in 45%. Fever (93%) and vomiting (69%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was found in 63% of patients with median EF of 46.6% (IQR 39.5, 52.8). C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in all patients. For treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 18 (54%), corticosteroids in 17 (51%), tocilizumab in 12 (36%), remdesivir in 7 (21%), vasopressors in 17 (51%), mechanical ventilation in 5 (15%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 1 (3%), and intra-aortic balloon pump in 1 (3%). The LVEF normalized in 95% of those with depressed EF. All patients were discharged home with median duration of PICU stay of 4.7 (4, 8) days and hospital stay of 7.8 (6, 10.1) days. One (3%) patient died after withdrawal of care secondary to stroke while on ECMO. Conclusions Critically ill children with COVID-19 associated MIS-C have a spectrum of severity broader than described previously but still require careful supportive intensive care. Rapid, complete clinical and myocardial recovery was almost universal.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2020.06.045","20200614","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-27","",2053,""
