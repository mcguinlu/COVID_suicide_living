"Comparison of the Clinical Characteristics of Pediatric Poisoning Patients Who Visited Emergency Department Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","We aimed to investigate changes in the clinical characteristics of pediatric poisoning patients who visited the emergency department (ED) before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Poisoning cases below age 18 who visited the ED from January 2018 to December 2021 were retrospectively analysed. The study period was then divided into pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 pandemic to compare poisoning patterns. During the study period, 86,153 visits to the pediatric ED had been recorded, with 625 patients being included the final analysis. During the COVID-19 period, the proportion of poisoned patients increased from 0.62% to 0.98%. The average age of the patients was higher in the COVID-19 period, with 53.4% of the cases being intentional (pre-COVID-19, 32.5%; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Moreover, 70.4% of poisoning cases during the COVID-19 period were caused by drugs (pre-COVID-19, 60.6%; <i>P</i> = 0.038). More patients underwent decontamination and laboratory investigation during the COVID-19 period than during the previous period (<i>P</i> = 0.007 and <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, respectively). The length of ED stay and the proportion of hospitalisation were significantly greater during the COVID-19 period. After analysing accidental poisoning cases, we found that antipyretics/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and respiratory drugs were more common in the pre-COVID-19 group, whereas iron/vitamins, cardiovascular drugs and hormones were more common in the COVID-19 group. After analysing intentional poisoning cases, we found that 73.6% and 76.4% of the patients in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 group had a history of psychiatric disease, respectively. Although no difference was observed in the frequency of previous first suicide attempts, 19.0% of the patients in the COVID-19 group attempted suicide more than three times. During the COVID-19 pandemic, intentional poisoning cases, especially in adolescence, increased and were treated more. Many of the patients with intentional poisoning had a history of mental illness or suicide in the past. Therefore, it seems that policy consideration for mentally vulnerable adolescents during this new pandemic period is necessary.","Park, Jeon, Ko, Choi, Yang, Lee","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2022.37.e337","20221206","COVID-19; Emergency Department; Intentional Poisoning; Pediatric, Poisoning; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-06","",42043,""
"Mitigating Rural Adolescent Trauma: Remote Delivery of a Trauma-Informed Yoga Intervention During COVID-19","Given the prevalence of childhood trauma in rural Montana, this project is intended to help mitigate stressors that may contribute to poor behavioral and mental health in high school-aged children, which may be exacerbated by the collective trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic. The immediate goal was to measure physical and mental health outcomes in adolescents resulting from a remotely delivered trauma-informed yoga intervention designed to foster positive youth development. Our study builds on the successes from an initial feasibility pilot study one year prior in order to evaluate a more robust intervention comparing experimental and control group outcomes. Students at a small, rural high school in Montana volunteered to participate in a 6-week, twice-weekly trauma-informed yoga intervention in their physical education class. Validated survey measures, including the PHQ-A, GAD-7, and ACE-Q instruments, were utilized to measure mental health outcomes pre- vs. post-intervention. Salivary cortisol levels were also measured pre-, mid-, and post-intervention. Statistically significant declines in cortisol levels and improvements in sleep duration were noted when comparing experimental vs. control groups. Noteworthy declines in depression and anxiety levels were also seen when comparing the treatment to control groups. Descriptive differences between the control and experimental groups illustrate the mental health benefits of reduced anxiety and depressive symptoms in rural adolescents resulting from a remotely delivered trauma-informed yoga intervention. Our study holds the potential for a long-term public health impact in reducing adolescent rates of anxiety and depression while mitigating trauma in geographically isolated settings.

"Decreased Heart Rate Variability in COVID-19","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which primarily infects the lower airways and binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on alveolar epithelial cells. ACE2 is widely expressed not only in the lungs but also in the cardiovascular system. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 can also damage the myocardium. This report aimed to highlight decreased heart rate variability (HRV) and cardiac injury caused by SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated three COVID-19 patients who died. Patients' data were collected from electronic medical records. We collected patient's information, including baseline information, lab results, body temperature, heart rate (HR), clinical outcome and other related data. We calculated the HRV and the difference between the expected and actual heart rate changes as the body temperature increased. As of March 14, 2020, 3 (2.2%) of 136 patients with COVID-19 in Tianjin died in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. The immediate cause of death for Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3 was cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest and cardiac arrest, respectively. The HRV were substantially decreased in the whole course of all three cases. The actual increases in heart rate were 5 beats/min, 13 beats/min, and 4 beats/min, respectively, less than expected as their temperature increased. Troponin I and Creatine Kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) were substantially increased only in Case 3, for whom the diagnosis of virus-related cardiac injury could not be made until day 7. In all three cases, decreased in HRV and HR changes occurred earlier than increases in cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin I and CK-MB). In conclusion, COVID-19 could affect HRV and counteract tachycardia in response to increases in body temperature. The decreases of HRV and HR changes happened earlier than the increases of myocardial markers (troponin I and CK-MB). It suggested the decreases of HRV and HR changes might help predict cardiac injury earlier than myocardial markers in COVID-19, thus its early identification might help improve patient prognosis.

"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health and Brain Maturation in Adolescents: Implications for Analyzing Longitudinal Data","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant stress and disruption for young people, likely leading to alterations in their mental health and neurodevelopment. In this context, it is not clear whether youth who lived through the pandemic and its shutdowns are comparable psychobiologically to their age- and sex-matched peers assessed before the pandemic. This question is particularly important for researchers who are analyzing longitudinal data that span the pandemic. In this study we compared carefully matched youth assessed before the pandemic (<i>n=</i>81) and after the pandemic-related shutdowns ended (<i>n=</i>82). We found that youth assessed after the pandemic shutdowns had more severe internalizing mental health problems, reduced cortical thickness, larger hippocampal and amygdala volume, and more advanced brain age. Thus, not only does the COVID-19 pandemic appear to have led to poorer mental health and accelerated brain aging in adolescents, but it also poses significant challenges to researchers analyzing data from longitudinal studies of normative development that were interrupted by the pandemic.","Gotlib, Miller, Borchers, Coury, Costello, Garcia, Ho","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsgos.2022.11.002","20221206","COVID-19; adolescent neurodevelopment; analyzing longitudinal data; brain age; youth mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-06","",42046,""
"A Multilevel Investigation of the Effects of Daily Work-Family Interaction on Daily Affect During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This research aimed to examine the effects of daily work-family conflict and work-family enrichment on daily positive and negative affect levels of employees during the first phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. The multilevel structure of the research design makes this study original. 730 day-level data were collected from 146 respondents during five consecutive workdays. One week later, a larger survey was delivered for assessing the person-level variables. The results indicated that both forms of work-family conflict significantly decreased positive affect and increased negative affect. Both types of work-family enrichment significantly increased positive affect; but only daily work to family enrichment significantly decreased daily negative affect. Findings also revealed that positive affect levels of respondents increase while negative affect levels decrease with time. On the days employees worked from distance, lower levels of positive and negative affect were experienced.","&#xc7;etin, Dede, K&#xf6;kalan, Dede","https://doi.org/10.1177/0192513X211044487","20221206","COVID-19 pandemic; daily negative affect; daily positive affect; daily work&#x2013;family conflict; daily work&#x2013;family enrichment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-06","",42047,""
"Workplace Deceptions During the Pandemic: Differences in Conspiracy Beliefs, Psychological Functioning, and Covid-19 Experiences","The global pandemic has disrupted virtually all countries on health, psychological functioning, and economies, to name a few. Accurate information has also fallen victim to the pandemic, which has been rife with misinformation and conspiracy theories. The current study investigated Covid-19 deceptions related to employment. With complete anonymity via MTurk, 389 participants from the United States rated their likelihood of deception regarding hypothetical four workplace scenarios. The first set of analyses examined differences between high and low risk of deceptions for each scenario based on participants' self-appraisals. The largest differences were found for general conspiracy beliefs and affective disorders, specifically major depression and generalized anxiety. The second set of analyses focused across the workplace scenarios on two operationalized groups with Likely-Deceptive (<i>n</i> = 189) vastly outnumbering Likely-Genuine (<i>n</i> = 55). Personal experiences with Covid-19 dramatically increased deceptions. Testing positive for Covid-19 increased the odds of being in the Likely-Deceptive by twelve-fold. Two discriminant models examined cognitive misbeliefs and psychological functioning. When both were combined, depression and Covid-19 misinformation produced the strongest structure coefficients followed closely by general conspiracy beliefs and generalized anxiety. The far-ranging implications of these findings are discussed.","Rogers, Pan, Hartigan, Chang, Donson","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941221144606","20221206","coronavirus; covid-19; infodemic; overreporting; pandemic; underreporting; workplace deceptions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-06","",42048,""
"Changes in Physical Activity Due to Fear of COVID-19 and Its Impact on Depression Among Post-Liver Transplant Patients in Japan: A Longitudinal Survey Study","BACKGROUND Regular physical activity (PA) is important for maintaining mental and physical health after liver transplantation (LT); however, the fluctuations in routine PA during COVID-19 and its putative impacts are currently unknown. This study examined the changes in PA during the COVID-19 pandemic and explored its association with fear and depression during the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS This longitudinal study included 83 LT patients whose PA was measured using the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire before and during COVID-19. Fear of COVID-19 was estimated based on previous studies, and depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Participants were also asked about important sources of information on COVID-19. PA was classified as inactive or active depending on the changes in PA, and logistic regression analyses with PA as a dependent variable were conducted to explore the associations among PA, depression, and fear of COVID-19. RESULTS Moderate and high PA exhibited decreasing trends before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in males. Fear of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, while shopping was significantly higher in females and was significantly independent of inactivity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Only 1 patient reported that their transplant center was their main source of information about COVID-19. Only 4.9% of the LT participants were depressed. CONCLUSIONS Our study results indicate the need to support the provision of accurate information about COVID-19 by health care professionals in transplant centers, especially for patients with low PA, to prevent PA decline in LT patients.","Tanaka, Fujita, Yakushiji, Harada, Yoshizumi","https://doi.org/10.12659/AOT.938239","20221206","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-06","",42049,""

"A Blueprint for Involvement: Reflections of lived experience co-researchers and academic researchers on working collaboratively","Patient and public involvement in health research is important to ensure that research remains relevant to the patient groups it intends to benefit. The UK NIHR funded Blueprint study aimed to develop a 'model' of effective service design for children and young people with common mental health problems. To ensure Blueprint's findings were rooted in lived experience and informed by different perspectives, six young adults with lived experience of mental health issues were recruited, trained and employed as co-researchers to work alongside academic researchers . Blueprint collaborated with a third sector partner (McPin) to recruit, employ and mentor the co-researchers and deliver a bespoke training and mentoring package to support their development. Since Blueprint's scheduled work plan was significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, planned co-researcher activities had to be adapted to accommodate distance learning and remote fieldwork and analysis. Blueprint's co-researchers, academic researchers and a representative of McPin collaboratively used a process of reflexivity and thematic analysis to capture Blueprint's involvement journey. We identified numerous benefits but also challenges to involvement, some of which were exacerbated by the pandemic. Navigating and overcoming these challenges also allowed us to collectively identify key guidelines for involvement for the wider research community which focus on enabling access to involvement, supporting co-researchers and optimising involvement for the benefit of co-researchers and research teams. This paper presents an overview of the Blueprint involvement journey from co-researcher, academic researcher and McPin perspectives, sharing our learning from the recruitment, training, fieldwork and analysis phases in order to inform the knowledge base on lived experience involvement and provide guidance to other researchers who seek to emulate this approach. The Blueprint study worked with young co-researchers with lived experience to explore services in England and Wales for children and young people with common mental health problems like depression, anxiety and self-harm. Blueprint aimed to find out what services exist, how children, young people and their families find out about and access these services, what the services actually do, and whether they are helpful and offer value for money. Blueprint worked closely with McPin, a charity that works to support young people with lived experience get involved in research. Together we developed a training and mentoring package to support the co-researcher&#x2019;s development and their preparation for the role which included research interviews with service users, parents/carers and service providers and data analysis. The co-researchers, research team and McPin worked together to reflect on the successes and challenges of this approach to research and the challenges of carrying out this work during a global pandemic. We have summarised what we have learnt about how best to enable and support co-researcher involvement to provide guidance to other researchers.","Fraser, Carrington, Crooks, Diffey, Evans, Kirk, Lane, McGowan, Naughton, Pryjmachuk, Saund, Temple","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40900-022-00404-3","20221205","Co-production; Co-researcher; Lived experience; Mental health; Patient and public involvement; Qualitative research; Research training; Young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-06","",42051,""
"The challenge of community mental health interventions with patients, relatives, and health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic: a real-world 9-month follow-up study","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to implement protocols that respond to the mental health demands of the population has been demonstrated. The PASMICOR programme started in March 2020, involving a total of 210 requests for treatment. Out of those subjects, the intervention was performed in 53 patients with COVID-19 without history of past psychiatric illness, 57 relatives and 60 health professionals, all of them within the area of Salamanca (Spain). Interventions were carried out by professionals of the public mental health service mostly by telephone. Depending on clinical severity, patients received basic (level I) or complex psychotherapeutic care combined with psychiatric care (level II). The majority of attended subjects were women (76.5%). Anxious-depressive symptoms were predominant, although sadness was more frequent in patients, insomnia in relatives and anxiety and fear in health professionals. 80% of the sample, particularly most of the health professionals, required a high-intensity intervention (level II). Nearly 50% of the people treated were discharged after an average of 5 interventions. Providing early care to COVID-19 patients, relatives and professionals by using community mental health resources can help to reduce the negative impact of crises, such as the pandemic, on the most affected population groups.","Roncero, Gonz&#xe1;lez-S&#xe1;nchez, P&#xe9;rez-Laureano, Ortiz-Fune, D&#xed;az-Trejo, Bersab&#xe9;-P&#xe9;rez, Braquehais, P&#xe9;rez-Rodr&#xed;guez, Maderuelo-Fern&#xe1;ndez, Benito-S&#xe1;nchez","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-25297-w","20221205","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-06","",42052,""
"Cause-specific mortalities in Korea during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic","This study aimed to examine the trends in total mortality between 1998 and 2020 and to compare the changes in a wide range of detailed causes of death between 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and the previous year in Korea. We used registered population and mortality data for the years 1998-2020 obtained from Statistics Korea. The age-standardized all-cause mortality rate and the annual percent change between 1998 and 2020 were determined. The rate ratio and rate difference of the age-standardized mortality rate were calculated between 2019 and 2020, respectively. The age-standardized all-cause mortality rate in Korea has been on a downward trend since 1998, and the decline continued in 2020. In 2020, 950 people died from COVID-19, accounting for 0.3% of all deaths. Mortality was decreased for most causes of death; however, the number of deaths attributed to sepsis and aspiration pneumonia increased between 2019 and 2020 for both men and women. Age-specific mortality rates were decreased or stable between 2019 and 2020 for all age groups, except women aged 25-29. This increase was mainly attributed to an increase in suicide deaths. This study shed light on the issues of sepsis and aspiration pneumonia despite the successful response to COVID-19 in Korea in 2020. The causes of death from sepsis and aspiration pneumonia should be identified and monitored. In addition, it is necessary to develop a proactive policy to address suicide among young people, especially young women.","Bahk, Jung-Choi","https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2022110","20221205","COVID-19; cause of death; mortality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-06","",42053,""

"The prevalence, features, influencing factors, and solutions of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation: a systematic review","During the COVID-19 pandemic, infodemic spread even more rapidly than the pandemic itself. The COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has been prevalent worldwide and hindered pandemic exiting strategies. Misinformation around COVID-19 vaccine is a vital contributor to vaccine hesitancy. However, no evidence systematically summarized COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. To synthesize the global evidence on misinformation related to COVID-19 vaccines, including its prevalence, features, influencing factors, impacts, and solutions for combating misinformation. We performed a systematic review by searching five peer-reviewed databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCO). We included original articles that investigated misinformation related to COVID-19 vaccine and were published in English from January 1, 2020, to August 18, 2022. We excluded publications that did not cover or focus on COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. The Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies, Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool, and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Checklist were used to assess the study quality. The review was guided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021288929). Of 8864 studies identified, 91 observational studies and 11 interventional studies met the inclusion criteria. Misinformation around COVID-19 vaccine covered conspiracy, concerns on vaccine safety and efficacy, no need for vaccine, morality, liberty, and humor. Conspiracy and safety concerns were the most prevalent misinformation. There was a great variation in misinformation prevalence with 2.5~55.4% in general population and 6.0~96.7% in antivaccine/vaccine hesitant groups from survey-based studies, and the prevalence of 0.1~41.3% on general online data and 0.5~56% on antivaccine/vaccine hesitant data from Internet-based studies. Younger age, lower education and economic status, right-wing and conservative ideology, having psychological problems enhanced beliefs in misinformation. The content, format, and source of misinformation influenced its spread. A five-step framework was proposed to address vaccine-related misinformation, including identifying misinformation, regulating producers and distributors, cutting production and distribution, supporting target audiences, and disseminating trustworthy information. The debunking messages/videos were found to be effective in several experimental studies. Our review provided comprehensive and up-to-date evidence on COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and helps responses to vaccine infodemic in future pandemics.","Zhao, Hu, Zhou, Song, Wang, Zheng, Zhang, Hou","https://doi.org/10.2196/40201","20221205","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-06","",42055,""
"Food Insecurity and Stress Among Rural Residents in South Carolina: The Moderating Influences of Household Characteristics, Neighborhood Social Environment and Food Environment","Food insecurity is linked with poor physical and mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression and stress. Rural residents in particular face unique challenges obtaining healthy food; the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the relationship between food insecurity and mental health outcomes. This study examines the relationship between food insecurity and stress, and the moderating influence of household characteristics, neighborhood social environment and food environment on this relationship, using a sample of 630 rural South Carolina (SC) residents during COVID-19. Two measures of stress were used in this study: current levels of stress and changes in stress since COVID-19. Results showed a gradient pattern between food insecurity and stress: rural residents with high food insecurity were 6.1 times more likely and those with moderate food insecurity were 3.4 times more likely to report higher level of general stress than those with low food insecurity; rural residents with high food insecurity were 3.3 times more likely and those with moderate food insecurity were 2.0 times more likely to report greater increase in stress after COVID-19 than those with low food insecurity. Neighborhood social environment and food environment provided a buffering effect on the relationship between food insecurity and stress. A stronger social environment after COVID-19 and higher levels of easiness in food access mitigated the negative impacts of food insecurity on stress. Efforts to ameliorate food insecurity should address these broader contextual variables, involving community-level factors.","Koob, Luo, Mobley, Baxter, Griffin, Hossfeld, Hossfeld","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-022-01176-3","20221205","COVID-19; Food access; Food environment; Stress; food insecurity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-06","",42056,""
"Community engaged research to measure the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable community member's well-being and health : A&#xa0;mixed methods approach","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing income inequality and health disparities in the United States (US). The objective of this study was to conduct timely, community-engaged research to understand the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on historically under-resourced communities with the goal of improving health equity. The initiative focused on priorities identified by Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNA) conducted every 3&#xa0;years per Federal funding requirements. These were access to healthcare, maternal/child health, obesity/food insecurity/physical activity, and mental health/addiction. In the first three quarters of 2021, we developed and employed mixed methods in three simultaneous phases of data collection. In phase&#xa0;1, we used purposive sampling to identify key informants from multiple stakeholder groups and conducted semi-structured interviews. In phase&#xa0;2, we held focus groups with community members from historically marginalized demographics. In phase&#xa0;3, we developed a&#xa0;survey using validated scales and distributed it to diverse communities residing in the geographic areas of our healthcare system across four states. Healthcare systems may use the methodology outlined in this paper to conduct responsive community engagement during periods of instability and/or crisis and to address health equity issues. The results can inform sustainable approaches to collaborate with communities to build resilience and prepare for future crises.","Barwise, Egginton, Pacheco-Spann, Clift, Albertie, Johnson, Batbold, Phelan, Allyse","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00508-022-02113-z","20221205","Community-based participatory research; Health disparities; Mixed methods research; Pandemic; SARS-CoV&#x2011;2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-06","",42057,""
"Disaster Preparedness Among Nurses in China: A Cross-Sectional Study","Increasingly frequent global disasters such as coronavirus disease 2019 pose a threat to human health and life. The World Health Organization has called on countries to formulate detailed plans to prepare for disasters. It is critical to investigate and evaluate the disaster preparedness of nurses. This study was designed to investigate the disaster preparedness and psychological condition of nurses in China and analyze the significant factors influencing their disaster preparedness. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2020, and 1,313 nurses were enrolled using convenience sampling. The study questionnaires were distributed and collected via a networking platform equivalent to Amazon Mechanical Turk. The disaster preparedness of the respondents was measured using the Disaster Preparedness Evaluation Tool, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to evaluate anxiety and depression status, and a self-designed questionnaire developed based on a review of the literature was used to explore the potential factors of influence on disaster preparedness. The average score for disaster preparedness among the participants was 186.34 (SD = 40.80), which corresponded with a moderate level, especially in skill (mean score = 42.01, SD = 12.39). Items with higher scores included support for the government, personal protection, and health education, whereas items with lower scores included nursing leadership in the community, capacity to cope with chemical or biological attacks, and assessment of posttraumatic stress disorder. Disaster preparedness was negatively related with mental health, including depression and anxiety. The main factors affecting disaster preparedness included educational background, nursing specialty, prior disaster training, prior disaster rescue experience, and depression level. The disaster preparedness of Chinese nurses must be improved. More attention should be paid to disaster preparedness in nurses, and future tailored interventions are urgently needed to promote nursing leadership in the community, the ability to cope with chemical or biological attacks, and posttraumatic stress disorder assessments. Moreover, relieving negative emotions to promote the mental health of nurses should receive greater attention.","Wang, Liu, Yu, Wang, Peng, Zhang, Nian, Jia, Li","https://doi.org/10.1097/jnr.0000000000000537","20221205","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-06","",42058,""
"Evaluation of quality of life and physical activity in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 pandemic","The aim of the study is to compare the quality of life, physical activity, anxiety, depression, fear of hypoglycemia, loneliness perception in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and controls. Forty-four patients and 63 controls were included in this cross-sectional study. Quality of life (Short Form 36-SF-36), physical activity level (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short form), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), fear of hypoglycemia (Hypoglycemia Fear Survey), loneliness perception (UCLA Loneliness Scale) were evaluated. Physical role limitations and general health perception subscale scores of SF-36 questionnaire in patients were significantly higher than the controls (p &lt; 0.05). Role limitations due to physical problems and fear of hypoglycemia are increased, and general health perception is impaired in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Physical inactivity is an important symptom in individuals in the pandemic period. In this regard, telerehabilitation approaches will be beneficial for all individuals in increasing physical activity, improving quality of life, and decreasing anxiety, depression and loneliness perception during the pandemic period for all individuals. The importance of a multidisciplinary approach in diabetes management and dealing with problems should be considered in pandemic.","&#xc7;elik, T&#xf6;r&#xfc;ner, G&#xfc;&#xe7;l&#xfc;","https://doi.org/10.20945/2359-3997000000531","20221205","COVID-19; hypoglycemia; mental health; physical activity; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-06","",42059,""
"Weekly Links among Irritability and Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in High-Risk Youth","Previous studies demonstrate a link between irritability and suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) in youth samples. However, they have mostly assessed irritability in community samples and as a largely dispositional (i.e., trait-like) construct. Thus, it remains unclear to what extent links between irritability and STBs reflect within-person processes of elevated risk in clinically meaningful time periods. The present study used clinical data from 689 adolescents aged 12 to 19 years attending a total of 6128 visits at a specialty Intensive Outpatient Program for depressed and suicidal youth to examine patterns in weekly assessments of irritability and STBs throughout treatment, including associations among trends and fluctuations departing from these trends. Youth completed validated self-report measures of irritability, depression and STBs weekly as part of standard IOP clinical care. Overall, two-thirds of variance in weekly irritable mood was accounted for by stable between-person differences, and the remaining portion to weekly fluctuations. After controlling for depression, during weeks when youth were more irritable they experienced increased STBs. At the same time, youth who were generally more irritable also tended to experience more STBs. Rates of change in irritability and STBs tended to track together at early stages of treatment, but these effects were generally accounted for by depression severity. Our results suggest that although changes in STBs are best accounted for by depression, irritability can be understood as a specific, proximal risk factor for youth STBs that exacerbates youth STBs in clinically informative timeframes above and beyond depression.","Aleksandra Kaurin et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01BD-624-61D","20221206","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Therapy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; high-risk youth; emotional dysregulation; youth depression; suicidal thoughts and behaviors; irritability","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-06","",42060,""
