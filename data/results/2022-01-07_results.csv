"Mental health assessment of Israeli adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","The measures used to contain the COVID-19 pandemic caused severe disruption to the lives of children and adolescents, compromising their mental health and wellbeing. In this study we assessed the incidence rates of psychiatric diagnoses and drugs in Israeli adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of health records data of over 200,000 12-17 years old adolescents identified a significant increase in all mental health diagnoses and most psychiatric drugs dispensation during the COVID-19 period compared to a corresponding pre-COVID period. A gender sub-analysis revealed that most of this increase was associated with adolescent girls. Girls exhibited increases of 68% in depression, 67% in eating disorders, 42% in anxiety and 29% in stress-related diagnoses during the COVID-19 period, which are significantly higher rates than those seen in boys and in the pre-COVID period. Sector sub-analysis showed that the increase was mainly in the general Jewish sector with almost no significant increases in the Arab and ultra-orthodox sectors. Our study highlights the mental health burden of Israeli adolescents during the pandemic and suggests that careful consideration should be given to it while deciding on measures to mitigate the pandemic.","Yonatan Bilu; Natalie Flaks-Manov; Maytal Bivas-Benita; Pinchas Akiva; Nir Kalkstein; Yoav Yehezkelli; Miri Mizrahi-Reuveni; Anat Aka-Zohar; Shirley Shapiro Ben David; Uri Lerner; Gilad Bodenheimer; Shira Greenfeld","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.01.06.22268809","20220106","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24608,""
"Personal Resilience, Social Support, and Organizational Support Impact Burnout among Nurses During COVID-19","Background: Nurses have been under heavy workloads since the outbreak of COVID-19 and are at a high risk of infection, leading to a high level of psychosocial risk. This can adversely affect nurses both psychologically and physically. Burnout is caused by prolonged stress during work. In the nursing profession, burnout is common, potentially affecting the well-being of nurses and their productivity. The identification of factors that may contribute to maintaining mental health and reducing burnout among frontline nurses during a pandemic is essential. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore how personal resilience, social support, and organizational support impact burnout among frontline staff nurses. Methods: This study involved 129 registered nurses from a COVID-19 designated hospital using four standardized scales. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 29.46 years (standard deviation = 4.89). The mean number of years respondents worked in this organization was 5.60 years and the nursing profession was 4.16 years. Most of the respondents were female and held a bachelor's degree in nursing. Multiple regression analysis was performed to predict burnout. Burnout was statistically significantly predicted by the multiple regression model (R2 = .420, F (3, 125) = 10.941, p < .0001; adjusted R2 = .406). Personal resilience, social support, and organizational support added statistically significantly to the prediction of burnout (p < .05). Conclusion: Findings from multiple regression analysis showed that nurses with low resilience and those who perceived inadequate social and organizational support had a higher risk of reporting more burnout. As a result of a bivariate analysis, there was no significant correlation between nurse variables and burnout level, except for age, which was negatively correlated with burnout level. Accordingly, young nurses tend to experience burnout, and nurse directors and managers must address this problem.","Hanan Daghash","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.01.05.22268637","20220105","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24609,""
"Relationship between precautionary measures and perceived stress and self-care behaviors in Shahid Beheshti dental school during COVID-19 pandemic: A path analysis study","Background and purpose: Mental health problems can negatively affect oneâ€™s ability to take precautionary measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of perceived stress and self-care behaviors on precautionary measures against COVID-19 among staff and students in shahid Beheshti Dental School. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted after reopening of the school. Information was collected from 830 people (academic members, students, and staff) within two weeks in spring 2020. A questionnaire was designed consisting of items on demographic characteristics, perceived stress, self-care behaviors, and precautionary measures. To calculate the coefficients of the effects of stress and self-care behaviors on precautionary measures, path model analysis was applied. Results: There was a significant relationship between perceived stress and precautionary measures in dental students. In this group, stress had a significant direct effect on preventive social behaviors (P&lt;0.001). On the other hand, the negative effects of perceived stress on both individual and social preventive measures were mediated via self-care measures. In academic members, perceived stress was not found to significantly affect precautionary measures (P=.28). In staff, self-care behaviors had significant positive effects on both individual and social preventive measures (P&lt;.001). Conclusion: Perceived stress as an exogenous variable had both direct and indirect effects on social preventive behaviors. It also affected individual preventive behaviors via self-care measures as an endogenous variable.","Mousavi, M.; Tehranchi, A.; Sadeghipour, M.; Namdari, M.; Dalband, M.; Kermani, M.

"Mental Health at the workplace","Since 2017, with the theme of Mental Health in the work chosen for the World Mental Health Day, there has been a concern for psychological well-being in job contexts. Earlier, in 2014, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work launched the campaign about stress management in order to create healthy workplaces. Later, in 2018, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions warns of the need to identify burnout, recognized in 2019 by the World Health Organization as an occupational phenomenon to be included in the new reformulation of the International Classification of Diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic, declared in March 2020, has radically transformed the lives of citizens, particularly with the restrictions caused by confinement, but, above all, has overwhelmed the tasks of various health professionals, including nurses. It was, then, observed that their mental health worsened, which, in the workplace, manifested itself in the increase of the levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout and post-traumatic stress, among others. This theoretical article aims to contextualize and describe the growing interest in the theme of mental health at workplace, as well as to reflect on its decrease as a consequence of the pandemic. Different national and international studies focused mainly on the themes of stress, anxiety, depression and burnout investigated in health professionals are described, also presenting intervention and prevention strategies for stress/burnout. It is concluded about the need to give attention to mental health at workplace, in order to stress/burnout do not become an epidemic of psychological problems within the current pandemic.","Queiros, C.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+Health+at+the+workplace","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Revista Rol De Enfermeria; 44(11-12):17-25, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24612,""
"Stress and resilience in nurses: a comparative study of portugal/germany in the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: Stress was recognized by the WHO as an epidemic of the 21st century. Studies show that nurses work in a stressful work environment, which impairs their mental health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, research revealed that frontline professionals have great vulnerability to stress, anxiety and depression. However, resilience can be a protective factor and promote psychological well-being. Objectives: This study aim to identify and compare stress and resilience levels in Portuguese and German nurses working in hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to analyze their interrelationship and verify if they vary according to sociodemographic and professional characteristics. Methodology: This is a quantitative, cross-sectional, comparative and correlational study, using Portuguese and German versions of the Nursing Stress Scale and Resilience Scale. The data were collected online using the snowball method, with voluntary participation, between June and December 2020. The convenience sample consisted of 588 nurses with definitive labor bond, being 49.5% Portuguese and 50.5% German, 75% women, 72% with bachelor, 80% working by shifts, with an average age of 35.12 years old and an average of 12.01 years of job experience. Results: We found that, compared to German nurses, Portuguese nurses present greater stress, especially related to dealing with death, work overload and physical environment, and lower resilience, especially in the acceptance of themselves and life. Discussion: There is a different influence of sociodemographic/professional variables in each country. Globally, it can be concluded that stress has been increasing, and the COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated the situation worldwide, especially in health care. However, in each country nurses may have specific vulnerability factors due to different demand and different work organization. Conclusion: The results are useful to develop strategies for an adequate stress management in which individual resilience is a protective factor and helps promotion of mental health during and after the pandemic.","Teixeira, S.; Gomes, D.; Queiros, C.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Stress+and+resilience+in+nurses:+a+comparative+study+of+portugal/germany+in+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Revista Rol De Enfermeria; 44(11-12):73-81, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24613,""

"Loneliness experience through COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown is related with resting-state brain networks functional connectivity","Background The reduction in social interactions often associated with old age frequently initiates or aggravates loneliness, increasing the risk of a number of diseases including depression and dementia (Mushtaq et al., JCDR. 2014;8(9):E01?WE4.). Loneliness has been related to particular patterns of brain resting-state networks (RSNs;Spreng et al., Nat Commun. 2020;11(1):6393). However, the role of RSNs in a resilient response to reductions of social interactions remains unknown and the COVID-19 pandemic provides a unprecedent opportunity to investigate it. Method Repeated loneliness assessments were collected by the Barcelona Brain Health Initiative (BBHI;www.bbhi.cat/en/) using the short UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell et al., J Pers Assess. 1978;42(3):290?294). Two timepoints were measured over two years prior to COVID-19 outbreak and four thereafter (March, April, June and October 2020). We used baseline resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), from 281 participants (mean age 53.91Â±7.35;137 women), acquired within 1-2 years prior to the pandemic to compute resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) for each pair of nodes defined by the Schaefer-Yeo atlas. Then, we utilized partial least squares (PLS) analysis for the decomposition of two multivariate sets (i.e., rs-FC and loneliness scores) into latent variables of maximal covariation. Result We identified two latent trajectories significantly correlated with two latent connectivity patterns, each of them describing approximately opposite baseline rs-FC and loneliness levels during the months with the most severe restrictions (i.e., March and April). The first latent trajectory showed greater baseline loneliness improving during the pandemic, associated with higher within-network connectivity in the limbic and salience networks. The second trajectory captured individuals with baseline loneliness levels similar to the average population, improving in March, at the beginning of outbreak, and worsening in April, which was related to lower baseline within-network connectivity in the DMN and higher in the dorsal attention and visual circuits. Conclusion Present findings reveal specific associations between RSNs? functional connectivity and opposite changes in feelings of loneliness during an unanticipated period of severe social restrictions. Specifically, lower rs-FC of limbic networks combined with high connectivity of salience system at baseline suggested greater resilience to the negative impact during the pandemic on loneliness.","Cabello-Toscano, MarÃ­a R.; MaciÃ , DÃ­dac, Cattaneo, Gabriele, Solana, Javier, Abellaneda-PÃ©rez, Kilian, VaquÃ©-AlcÃ¡zar, LÃ­dia, Tormos-MuÃ±oz, Josep M.; Pascual-Leone, Alvaro, Bartres-Faz, David","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.052657","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S5):e052657, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24615,""
"Effects of lifestyle on the health, depression, and quality of life of middle-aged and elderly before and after COVID-19: Structural equation modeling","Background The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of the lifestyle (physical activity, activity participation, and nutrition) of middle-aged and elderly people on health, depression, and quality of life, and to identify changes before and after COVID-19. In addition, it is intended to establish a structural equation model to confirm the influence coefficients for each path. Method Among those aged 55 and older, the study measured lifestyle, subjective health, depression, and quality of life for a total of 327 people. We used SPSS 25 for general characteristics of subjects, descriptive statistical analysis of variables, and AMOS 20 for validation of variables, affirmative factor analysis, and effectiveness analysis on paths. Result In the case of physical activity, there were significant differences between the two groups in moderate exercise (p&lt;0.001) and walking (p&lt;0.01) before and after COVID-19. The results of participation in activities showed significant differences between leisure activities, social activities and education before and after COVID-19 (p&lt;0.001). For eating habits, significant differences were found in the two observations: carbohydrate (p&lt;0.05) and protein (p&lt;0.05). Comparing the overall mean, there were significant differences between health (p&lt;0.05), depression (p&lt;0.001), and quality of life (p&lt;0.001) before and after COVID-19. The final model was built through normality test and confirmatory factor analysis, and the fit of the final study model was xÂ²=3.306, GFI=0.902, RMR=0.049, RMSEA=0.059, IFI=0.928, TLI=0.917, CFI=0.928, which was appropriate compared to each criterion, showed significance for each path. Conclusion Through this research, it was confirmed that lifestyle affects health, depression, and quality of life for middle-aged elderly people, which is in the same context as prevention-oriented policies currently in place worldwide. In addition, the results of this study show the importance of a healthy lifestyle, suggesting that lifestyle education for middle and high-aged people and customized lifestyle interventions for individual lives are needed. Comparisons between the two periods before and after COVID-19 show that the social isolation caused by COVID-19 has a negative impact on each factor. Through these results, health care is essential for middle-aged and elderly people, and measures should be taken to resolve restrictions on participation in activities caused by social isolation.","Yang, Min Ah, Park, Ji-Hyuk","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.053352","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S10):e053352, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24616,""
"Exploring the unmet needs facing individuals with Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related dementias during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Many adults with ADRD rely on support from friends, family members, social service agencies, and their communities to meet their basic needs. It is unclear if COVID-19 mitigation policies have made it more difficult for individuals with ADRD to receive this support. The objective of this study was to explore the types of unmet needs experienced by adults with ADRD in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the characteristics of adults with ADRD that are experiencing unmet needs. Method We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) summer and fall 2020 COVID-19 supplemental surveys. The MCBS uses complex survey design to provide a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries. There were 20,800 survey participants in total and 4.07% have received a diagnosis with ADRD. Logistic regression was used to examine the characteristics of those reporting one or more unmet need. Result 16.61% Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD reported having one or more unmet needs during the COVID-19 pandemic (vs. 16.52% Medicare beneficiaries without ADRD, p=0.956). While beneficiaries with and without ADRD had no difference in unmet needs surrounding rent/mortgage, food, supplies, and medications, adults with ADRD had higher rates of unmet need for healthcare services (8.86% vs. 5.77%, p=0.008). Adults with ADRD were more likely to report having an unmet need between March-June than between July-November (18.10% vs. 7.84%, p&lt;0.001). Among those with ADRD, individuals with depression (AOR=2.25, p=0.001) and multimorbidity (AOR=1.79, p=0.030) reported significantly higher unmet need, after controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance, and geographic location. As compared with individuals without ADRD, individuals with co-existing ADRD and depression (p&lt;0.001) or co-existing ADRD and multimorbidity (p&lt;0.001) reported higher likelihood of having unmet needs. Conclusion Many adults with ADRD experienced unmet need during the first 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that the ADRD patients with depression and complex health needs who require greatest number of healthcare services were more likely to voice unmet needs. The residual impact of unmet needs during the early pandemic months and on-high risk subpopulations is currently unknown.","Benjenk, Ivy, Chen, Jie","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.053380","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S10):e053380, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24617,""
"The impact of ICT use on feelings of loneliness and isolation during the COVID-19 lockdown among older people","Background Older adults are at risk of psychological consequences along home segregation during COVID-19 pandemic. Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) are crucial in such context even among older people. Aim: to explore the impact of being ICTusers on loneliness and ICTs use among older adults from pre to lockdown period. Methods Data were extracted from the fourth follow-up (2018) of the InveCe.Ab, a multidimensional population-based study (NCT01345110) on 70-75 older people living in Abbiategrasso (Milan, Lombardy) at baseline (2009). Sixty-six of them were trained for SNS use in 2019, as a part of the ANS-SE study (NCT04242628). A telephone interview was administered during the lockdown period (March-May 2020), collecting information on self-perceived loneliness measured by the 3-item UCLA loneliness scale and ICT use [smartphones, computers, internet and Social Network Sites (SNSs)]. Participants in the pre-lockdown assessment reporting use of any ICT were defined as ICTusers. Cross-sectional differences between ICTusers and non-users were explored using Independent Sample t-test or Chi-square test. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was applied to compare the long-term effect of being ICTusers and non-users on loneliness change (UCLA 3-item total and subscales) and ICT use change, including the pre-lockdown measures and being trained for SNSs use as covariates, followed by post-hoc comparisons. Results Pre-lockdown participants with ICT use data available were 623 (163 ICT users, 460 non-users). Table 1 shows that ICTusers were mostly men, more educated, showed fewer depressive symptoms (GDS) and higher global cognition (MMSE) than ICTnon-users. ICTusers felt less total loneliness, fewer feelings of a lack of companionship and isolation from others than ICTnon-users. Pre-lockdown ICT use was on average 2.11 (DS 1.05). Longitudinal significant difference emerged between the two groups on total loneliness, with ICTusers (n=130), showing a decrease (mean difference (SE): -0.382 (0.179);95% CI: -0.733, -0.030;p=0.033) compared to non-users (n=296). ICTusers (n=130), reported fewer feelings of isolation (mean difference (SE): -0.213 (0.068);95% CI: -0.348, -0.079;p=0.002) than non-users (n=300). Conclusions During the COVID-19 lockdown, former ICTusers were protected against feelings of loneliness and isolation. The ICT use did not change in both groups.","Vaccaro, Roberta, Rolandi, Elena, Colombo, Mauro, Abbondanza, Simona, Pettinato, Laura, Poloni, Tino Emanuele, Davin, Annalisa, Guaita, Antonio","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.053411","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S10):e053411, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24618,""

"Lower motor function prior to the Covid-19-imposed lockdown predicts emotional distress in older adults with T2D","Background Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with accelerated cognitive decline and increased dementia risk. Lockdowns imposed due to the Covid-19 outbreak led to unprecedented changes in the life of older adults. However, little is known about emotional distress consequences. We assessed associations of grey matter (GM) volumes (N=179), cognitive and motor functions (N=403) with emotional distress of older adults with T2D from the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline Study (IDCD). Methods During the first Covid-19-related lockdown in Israel, we applied a phone questionnaire, which included information about anxiety (?Over the last two weeks, how much have you been bothered by Feeling anxious or nervous??;Anxiety levels now compared to before Covid-19), depression (?Over the last two weeks, how much have you been bothered by feeling sad, down, or uninterested in life??;sad feelings now compared to before Covid-19), general well-being (?How are you feeling in general??), optimism towards the future (?Are you optimistic towards the future??). Grey matter (GM) volumes (measured by high resolution T1-weighted MRI), cognitive (a global measure summarizing 14 cognitive tests) and motor function (gait speed and grip strength), are routinely assessed by the IDCD study. Spearman correlation adjusting for age, sex, education, HbA1c and duration of T2D (as well as TICV for the GM analyses) examined associations of GM, cognitive and motor functions with emotional distress measures. Results The sample averaged 72 years of age (SD=4.4), and 14 years of education (SD=3.5);40.9% were female. Lower grip strength prior to lockdown was associated with increased sadness (r=-0.21, p&lt;0.001) and anxiety (r=-.011, p=0.020), less optimism (r=0.10, p=0.042) and lower general feeling (r=0.17, p=0.0005). Slower gait speed was associated with increased sadness (r=0.13, p=0.005). Lower GM was associated with greater anxiety during the lockdown (r=-0.19, p=0.011) and compared to before Covid-19 (r=-0.19, p=0.012).

Conclusions Motor function, but not cognitive function, were associated with lockdown imposed emotional distress in older adults with T2D. These associations point to the importance of good motor function and physical conditioning in emotional well-being related to acute stress related to stay-at-home-orders.","Benari, Ori, Ravona-Springer, Ramit, Almog, Ganit, Yore, Iscka, Zadok, Maya, Lin, Hung-Mo, Ouyang, Yuxia, Livny, Abigail, Beeri, Michal Schnaider","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.053734","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S10):e053734, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24620,""
"Sex, caregiver status and amyloid positivity predict increased anxiety and depression during the COVID-19-related confinement","Background Anxiety and depression are more prevalent in women and caregivers and are associated with increased Alzheimer?s disease (AD) risk. We investigated multimodal predictors of increased anxiety/depression during the Covid19-related confinement in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults with an increased risk for AD with a special focus on sex/gender. Method We included 921 CU participants from the ALFA study (Table 1). Anxiety and depression (Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale, HADS), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS) and stress resilience (Brief Resilience Scale, BRS) were measured during Covid19-related confinement. A subgroup completed the HADS (n=767) and underwent [18F]flutemetamol-PET imaging and sMRI (n=254) 2.4Â±0.8 years before confinement. Cross-sectional anxiety/depression measurements and change in anxiety/depression (delta score) from baseline to confinement were our primary outcomes of interest. We considered amyloid status (+/-) and cortical thickness (Cth) from the AD signature regions as imaging biomarkers. First, we investigated sex differences in the variables assessed during confinement. Second, we ran regression models to predict (i) cross-sectional anxiety/depression scores during confinement and (ii) change in anxiety/depression from baseline to confinement. Age, sex, education, APOE-e4 status, caregiver status, stress related-variables and imaging biomarkers were considered as predictors. Result Fifteen percent of the participants were caregivers, 69% of which were women. Women showed increased stress perception relative to men (p=&lt;0.001) ? notably, when they were caregivers (p=0.01). There were no sex-differences in stress resilience (p=0.5). In cross-sectional models, sex (women) and higher stress perception were independent predictors of greater anxiety/depression during confinement (Table 2a). Being a caregiver additionally predicted increase in anxiety/depressive symptomatology from baseline (Table 3a). Finally, in the subsample with biomarkers, amyloid positivity - but not Cth in the AD signature - contributed to predict anxiety/depression both cross-sectionally (Table 2b) and longitudinally (Table 3b) along with sex (women), caregiver status and stress perception. Conclusion Our results showed sex differences in caregiver status and stress perception during the Covid19-related confinement. Further, women, caregivers and those with higher self-perceived stress showed an increase in anxiety/depressive symptomatology. Amyloid pathology prior to confinement was associated with greater levels of anxiety/depression suggesting a role of amyloid pathology in anxiety/depressive symptomatology.","Akinci, Muge, Operto, Greg, Fuentes-Julian, Sherezade, SÃ¡nchez-Benavides, Gonzalo, PeÃ±a-Gomez, CleofÃ©, MilÃ -AlomÃ , Marta, SalvadÃ³, Gemma, Sala-Vila, Aleix, Grau-Rivera, Oriol, Suarez-Calvet, Marc, Cacciaglia, Raffaele, Gramunt, Nina, Molinuevo, Jose, Navarro, Arcadi, MinguillÃ³n, Carolina, Fauria, Karine, Gispert, Juan Domingo, Arenaza-Urquijo, Eider M.","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.053907","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S6):e053907, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24621,""
"Neuroticism is the best predictor of lower emotional resilience during the COVID-19-related confinement periods","Background The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated distancing measures dramatically affect psychoaffective health, and this is accentuated in older adults who are more vulnerable to the situation. In this study, we are interested in the predictors of emotional resilience in healthy older adults, and also on how the repetition of confinement periods could influence this resilience and its predictors. Method 102 cognitively unimpaired older adults from the Age-Well cohort were included. They all completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-42) during each period of national confinement (April and November 2020), used here as a measure of emotional resilience (lower scores indicating greater resilience). Baseline measures from the Age-Well study, all acquired before the pandemic, were used as predictors, including demographics (age, sex, education), personality (Big Five Inventory), psychological (anxiety [STAI-B], depression [GDS]), lifestyle (Lifetime of experience questionnaire), global cognitive functioning (Mattis-DRS) and neuroimaging data (hippocampal volume, brain perfusion, amyloid burden). We ran stepwise regressions to predict emotional resilience during the first confinement. Then, we used paired t-test to assess the evolution of emotional resilience between the two confinements. Finally, we replicated the stepwise regressions to predict changes in resilience over time ('second-minus-first' confinement). Result Neuroticism was the only significant predictor of the DASS-42 score during the first confinement (?=.48;p&lt;.001;Figure-1), lower neuroticism being associated with better resilience. We found the DASS-42 score to increase significantly from the first to the second confinement, indicating decreased emotional resilience over time. Moreover, higher neuroticism (?=.53;p&lt;.001) and higher agreeableness (?=.20;p=.03) were associated with higher DASS-42 increase over time (Figure-2). Conclusion Our study suggests that lower neuroticism is the main predictor of greater emotional resilience to the COVID-19-related confinement. Importantly, the repetition of the confinement situation is associated with a decrease in emotional resilience in older adults, especially if they are prone to experience distress (neuroticism) or have a particularly social personality (agreeableness). Overall, these results underline the increasing need, as the crisis persists, for a psychoaffective support of older adult.","Gonneaud, Julie, Paly, LÃ©o, Delarue, Marion, MÃ©zenge, Florence, Fauvel, SÃ©verine, Lefranc, ValÃ©rie, Cognet, AurÃ©lia, de Flores, Robin, Touron, Edelweiss, Marchant, Natalie L.; Poisnel, GÃ©raldine, Chetelat, GaÃ«l, the Medit-Ageing Research, group","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.053954","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S6):e053954, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24622,""
"Predictors of generalized anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in older African Americans in Detroit","Background The COVID-19 pandemic is a health emergency that has forced a change in the daily life of individuals across all nations, races and socioeconomic groups for over a year. Such a crisis has required social isolation, the closing of businesses, schools and many recreational activities. This abrupt change has had negative effects on mental health, especially in the most vulnerable populations. Method For this study, 164 community-dwelling older African Americans (mean age = 75.6, range = 65-94) were recruited from the Wayne State Institute of Gerontology Healthier Black Elders Center and general Detroit area. Responses were gathered over the phone between July 28, 2020 to January 14, 2021. Generalized anxiety was measured by the GAD-7. Responses to COVID-19 were measured by: positive emotions (eg., gratitude, happiness), negative emotion (eg., anger, fear), unmet needs (eg., food, medical care), and personal issues (eg., economic problems, reduced privacy). Result Of the participants, 12 reported having COVID-19, with 48% reporting a close family member having the virus, 26% had a death in the family and 67% endorse feelings of isolation. Average anxiety on the GAD-7 was 6.2 (SD = 5.4, range = 0-21). Of the 163 participants that completed the scale, 46% reported no anxiety, 28% reported mild anxiety, 17% reported moderate anxiety, and 9 % reported severe anxiety. In a stepwise regression, the following factors were found to predict GAD scores: negative emotions (51% explained variance), positive emotions (3% explained variance) and daily stressors brought on by COVID-19 (1% explained variance). Further analyses were completed to evaluate additional models to assess the interrelationships between predictors and significant COVID-related milestones. Conclusion This current study among older African Americans living in an urban area highlights daily-life risk factors for anxiety during the time of COVID-19. Negative emotions as primary predictors are factors which can be specifically addressed with current psychosocial services. More research is needed in order to fully understand the scope and correlates of anxiety predictors during these challenging times.","Hanna, Sophie, Bass, Dwana, DiCerbo, Loraine M.; Shair, Sarah, Giordani, Bruno, Kavcic, Voyko","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.054606","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S6):e054606, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24623,""
"Behavioral and psychological symptoms of Alzheimerâ€™s disease during the COVID-19 pandemic in underserved settings","Background The behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are characterized by disturbances in perceptions, thought contents, moods, and behaviors. The causes for these symptoms are connected to factors related to the people with dementia (PWD), his/her caregivers, and environmental factors as well as the interrelationship between these three. Disruptions of routine due to confinements during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the onset/worsening of BPSD, thereby increasing distress levels in caregivers, and risks of self-injury, hospitalization, and death for PWD. Our aim is to describe the onset/ worsening of BPSD during COVID-19 pandemic confinement. Method This is a longitudinal study in patients and caregivers of people with Alzheimer?s disease from the Instituto Peruano de Neurociencias in Lima, PerÃº. A structured confinement interview was delivered to caregivers exploring how the caregiver's activities have been affected or modified by the confinement measures. All patients have neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, and functional assessments performed six months before the onset of the confinement. BPSD was assessed using the neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire (NPI). Result A total of 91 patients with Alzheimer?s disease and caregivers participated in the study. The average age of the patients was 73.4 years. Most patients had a CDR score of 0.5-1. Caregivers reported that the pandemic affected their mood by 74%. Percentage of time spent caring increased from 15% to 25% (p&lt;0.001). Worsening and new onset of behavioral and psychological symptoms were reported. The NPI (Fig 1.) and ADCS_ADL scores increased significantly during quarantine from baseline (6.6 and 10, respectively) (p&lt;0.001). Delusions (75%), sleep disorder (71.7%), and hallucinations were the most frequently reported worsening symptoms. Sleep disorder (71.1%), agitation (68.6%) and depression (53.3%) were the most frequently reported new symptoms (p&lt;0.001) (Table 1). Profile of BPSD did not vary according to the CDR score. Conclusion Quarantine induces increases in behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with early stages of Alzheimer?s disease. Caregivers spent more time with the patient with AD and their emotions were affected by the pandemic. We need to plan for strategies in order to address these needs.","Castro-Suarez, Sheila, Failoc-Rojas, Virgilio E.; del Castillo, Rossana Cruz, Montesinos, Rosa, Herrera-Perez, Eder, Custodio, Nilton","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.054780","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S6):e054780, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24624,""
"The dementia policies in Australia relating to the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Australia has a population of 26 million, and on January 28th 2021, 28,794 COVID-19 infections and 909 deaths. 685 deaths were at residential aged care facilities, and data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed that 72.7% of the people who died of the coronavirus in Australia (up to 31 August 2020) had at least one pre-existing chronic condition listed on their death certificate, with dementia the most common (noted on 41% of death certificates). This presentation will present and discuss the key Australian dementia policy interventions implemented during the pandemic. Method A scoping review of published academic, media, policy papers, white papers, and grey literature was conducted. We extracted relevant information pertaining to policies relating to dementia care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Result The Australian government is managing the COVID-19 outbreak as a health emergency, and have developed and funded a comprehensive response. For the older population and those with ADRD, the key policies include the National Health Plans, specific plans for people with disabilities, telehealth expansions, mental health and wellbeing pandemic response plans, home delivery of prescriptions, the establishment of an Aged Care Health Emergency Response Operations Centre, and a National COVID-19 Aged Care Plan. In Victoria, the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre was established. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will be given to priority groups from February 2021, which include aged care and disability care residents and workers (people with dementia account for 52% of all residents in aged care facilities). Strict policies were put in place for aged care facility visitations, and for the aged care workforce, such as the use of personal protective equipment and limiting staff to work in only one facility. Advocacy bodies were also key, and Dementia Australia and Dementia Support Australia, for example, developed advice to support people experiencing behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia during the pandemic. Conclusion There are currently no active cases in residential aged care in Australia, zero locally acquired cases for several weeks, with the (minimal) new cases emerging from the hotel quarantine system. Health policies have managed to limit the spread of COVID-19 infection in Australia.","Goh, Anita M.

"Subjective cognitive decline is associated with higher anxiety and depression during the COVID-19-related confinement","Background Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is often related to affective symptoms and both predict cognitive decline. We investigated whether SCD status predicted higher anxiety/depression during the Covid19-related confinement, along with amyloid positivity in cognitively unimpaired older adults. Method We included 205 participants from the ALFA+ study (Table 1). During the confinement, anxiety and depression (Hospital Depression and Anxiety scale, HADS), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and stress resilience (Brief Resilience Scale) were measured. Participants completed HADS, SCD-Questionnaire, and underwent a [18F]flutemetamol-PET scan on average 2.4 years before confinement (baseline). We ran linear analyses with (i) cross-sectional HADS scores during the confinement as well as (ii) change from baseline to confinement (delta scores) as dependent variables. SCD and amyloid status (+/-, defined with a Centiloid threshold of 12) and their interaction were considered as predictors, and demographics, APOE-e4 status, and baseline HADS (for longitudinal analyses) as covariates. In a second step, perceived stress and stress resilience were considered in the models among covariates. Result Twenty-seven percent (n=56) of the participants were classified as SCD and 12.7% as amyloid positive. When main effects were tested, both SCD (p=0.03) and amyloid positivity (p=0.003) were associated with higher HADS scores during confinement (Table 2a). Further, a significant SCD*amyloid interaction was observed (p=0.001) such that only SCD participants with an amyloid positive scan showed higher HADS scores (p=0.001). SCD participants showed higher perceived stress than non-SCD participants (p=.044), but no differences were found in stress resilience (p=0.6). The inclusion of perceived stress and stress resilience as covariates reduced the SCD effect to a trend (p=0.06) but not the effect of amyloid (p=0.003). Longitudinal analyses with delta scores showed similar results for amyloid but not for SCD main effects (Table 2b). The amyloid*SCD interaction was also significant in longitudinal analyses (p=0.002) with amyloid status predicting an increase in HADS scores only in participants with SCD (p=0.003) (Fig. 1). Conclusion Having SCD and being amyloid positive is synergistically related to increased anxiety/depression during the Covid19-related confinement. Longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate the impact of higher confinement related anxiety/depression in the clinical prognosis of the SCD population.","SÃ¡nchez-Benavides, Gonzalo, Akinci, Muge, MinguillÃ³n, Carolina, Deulofeu, Carme, SalvadÃ³, Gemma, GonzÃ¡lez-de-EchÃ¡varri, JosÃ© MarÃ­a, Brugulat-Serrat, Anna, Suarez-Calvet, Marc, Sala-Vila, Aleix, Grau-Rivera, Oriol, Fauria, Karine, Molinuevo, Jose, Gispert, Juan Domingo, Arenaza-Urquijo, Eider M.; study, Alfa","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.055401","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S6):e055401, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24626,""
"Neuro-COVID: Does severe COVID-19 infection increase the risk for cognitive impairment?","Background Neurocognitive manifestations of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in the acute phase, especially in critically ill patients. The potential mechanisms underlying these symptoms are not fully understood but probably involves the inflammatory, vascular, and neurotropic effect of the coronavirus. While short-, mid-and long-term consequences remain unclear, patients with neurocognitive sequelae reminiscent of other cognitive disorders, including AD have been reported. The aim of this study is to investigate if there is an increased risk for long-term cognitive dysfunction/impairment, biochemical and structural brain changes after a severe COVID-19. Method This is a prospective cohort study of 80 patients surviving intensive-care for COVID-19 at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. They will be examined at 3, 6 and 12 months after hospital discharge using neurological and neuropsychological (NP) tests combined with novel quantitative brain MRI and serial blood sampling to described relevant blood-borne molecular patterns. This presentation focuses on NP testing, cognitive, mental, and neurological aspects at 3 months follow-up. Cognitive testing and questionnaires (NP) include Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test Rey Complex Figure test, Verbal Fluency Test, Category flow, Trail Making Test Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Mental Fatigue Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, RAND-36, AD8 Dementia Screening Interview and Subjective cognitive decline questions. A detailed neurological examination (neurologist), including Expanded Disability Status Scale, an adapted version of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale for extrapyramidal dysfunction, and a brief smell test. Results At present, 28 participants have completed the 3-months follow-up visit, including neuropsychological and neurological examinations. Mean age (SD) at baseline was 57.8 (11.1) years, and 68% were men. Several patients expressed cognitive and/or mental concerns and fatigue. The neuropsychological and neurological examinations have so far revealed varying and mixed patterns. Brain MRI revealed mainly microvascular pathology. Detailed analyses, including blood biomarkers for neuronal injury and astrocytic activation, based on the 3-months examination will be presented. Conclusions Repeated examinations will allow further analyses on longer term impact on cognition and underlying mechanisms. This may identify patients at risk and possible ways to mitigate cognitive complications, which is of great importance to reduce the pandemic's negative effects and socioeconomic burden.","Hagman, GÃ¶ran, Thunborg, Charlotta, Andersen, Pia, Levak, Nicholas, AspÃ¶, Malin, Walles, HÃ¥kan, Jokhader, Elias, KÃ¥hlin, Jessica, Nelson, David, Piehl, Fredrik, Tzortzakakis, Antonios, Zetterberg, Henrik, Granberg, Tobias, Eriksson, Lars I.; Kivipelto, Miia","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.055939","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S6):e055939, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24627,""
"Approaches to engage an aging cohort in rural India during the COVID-19 crisis and the psychological impact of COVID-19 in this cohort","Background The COVID-19 crisis brought most cohort studies around the world to a standstill. India, which had implemented one of the strictest nation-wide lockdowns in the world, was no exception. Owing to this, recruitments and assessments in our aging cohort in rural India, namely, Srinivaspura Aging Neurosenescence and COGnition (SANSCOG), had to be abruptly suspended. Method The SANSCOG study team undertook active measures to keep our subjects engaged remotely during the COVID-19-related lockdown period and also, provided useful services telephonically, to address their anxiety and distress. We collaborated with a local digital health service initiative, to offer counselling on awareness about the disease and safety precautions to be adopted. To assess the psychological impact of the pandemic on our cohort, the study team?s clinicians telephonically administered the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-7) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire to consenting subjects. These instruments are brief, validated and sensitive instruments to screen for depression and anxiety disorder, respectively. Among subjects who had pre-COVID GDS scores (obtained from their baseline clinical assessments), the proportion of subjects having pre-COVID versus post-COVID depression was compared. Result A total of 1890 subjects from the rural (SANSCOG) cohort were contacted during the lockdown period. Our periodic telephone calls to enquire about the subjects? well-being as well as our providing of psychological support and medical advice, when necessary, were appreciated by our subjects. Our collaborative initiative to provide awareness about the pandemic was well-received, as many of our subjects had inadequate awareness about the pandemic. Overall, these strategies resulted in better bonding between our study team and our cohort. On screening for depression and anxiety disorder, 28.4% scored above the threshold score for depressive disorder on GDS-7, whereas 5.5% scored above the threshold score for anxiety disorder on GAD-7. We found that the proportion of subjects with depression had quadrupled after the COVID-19 pandemic (pre-COVID - 7.74%, post-COVID - 28.98%). Conclusion The above approaches of cohort engagement during times of crisis are deemed valuable by subjects and we envisage that this would improve subject retention. This rural Indian cohort had a severe psychological impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sundarakumar, Jonas S.; M L, Abhishek, Hameed, Shafeeq K.

"TMS-induced EEG perturbation as a marker of psychological resilience to deleterious mental health effects during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Social, economic and psychological hardships associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to result in a global burden on mental health outcomes. However, while some individuals suffer from increasing distress and reduced quality of life, others will show no negative effects. A better understanding of brain mechanisms subtending resilience would be helpful in informing future recommendations to individuals and societies facing the present pandemic and future similar events. Here, we compared neurophysiological brain markers between individuals who exhibited resilience or vulnerability to pandemic associated psychological stress. Method 23 participants from the longitudinal study cohort of the Barcelona Brain Health Initiative (Cattaneo et al., Front. Aging Neurosci. 2018;10:321) who underwent concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), were classified as either resilient (n=16) or non-resilient (n=7), based on their scoring in the PHQ-4 questionnaire (Kroenke et al., Psychosomatics 2009;50(6):613?21) along four timepoints;one before COVID-19 outbreak and three spanning 2.5 months during the pandemic. Individuals maintaining a score below 3 across all timepoints were deemed resilient, while those scoring below 3 before pandemic but higher than 2 at any pandemic timepoint were considered non-resilient. TMS-EEG data was collected by delivering 120 single TMS pulses to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). TMS evoked global mean field amplitude and local response at the stimulation site were computed. Result Figure 1 depicts time-series for DLPFC and IPL responses for both groups of subjects. Overall, non-resilient individuals exhibited a larger global response to TMS perturbation during DLPFC stimulation, as well as larger local current density estimates during IPL stimulation. Conclusion These preliminary results revealed that non-resilient individuals were more susceptible to TMS perturbation, shown by global DLPFC and local IPL reactivity. Notably, these targets are nodes of the default mode and cognitive control networks affected by stress (van Oort et al., Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2017;83:281?97), and the left frontal cortex has been proposed as a cognitive resilience hub (Franzmeier et al., J. Alzheimer?s Dis. 2017;59(4):1381?92.). Future studies should investigate and confirm the possibility that these nodes constitute a shared neurophysiological substrate for psychological and cognitive resilience.","PerellÃ³n-Alfonso, Ruben, Redondo-CamÃ³s, MarÃ­a, Abellaneda-PÃ©rez, Kilian, Cattaneo, Gabriele, Delgado-GallÃ©n, Selma, EspaÃ±a-Irla, Goretti, SÃ¡nchez, Javier Solana, Tormos-MuÃ±oz, Josep M.; Pascual-Leone, Alvaro, BartrÃ©s-Faz, David","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.056179","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S5):e056179, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24629,""
"Resilience and perceived stress in cognitively normal older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Psychological resilience, a construct representing a person?s ability to return to their baseline when difficulties occur, can play an important role in determining outcomes in the face of stressors. Resilience is a crucial component to consider during times of prolonged stress, such as experienced during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, given that chronic stress has been associated with cognitive decline and dementia. Here, we investigated whether psychological resilience modified levels of perceived stress (assessed over 7 months), as well as examined the influence of demographic variables and Alzheimer?s disease biomarkers on this relationship. Method In May-November 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic, 39 cognitively normal participants (mean age=78.38;53.85% female) in the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) completed questionnaires assessing stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS) and resilience (only at baseline;Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), higher scores on each measure indicating greater stress and increased resilience, respectively. We used previously collected data to better characterize the cohort, with the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC;mean=0.46, SD=0.79) to assess cognition, and PET imaging data to assess AÃŸ burden. A hierarchical regression model was used to assess whether resilience could predict baseline perceived stress. A separate linear mixed effect model (LME) was used to explore how resilience, time, and their interaction may affect stress. Both models also included age, sex, education, cognition, and AÃŸ status (SUVR&gt;1.324). Result Perceived stress levels were generally low (mean=13.54, SD=8.65, range=0-35), and did not significantly vary over the study period (p&gt;0.5;mean number of timepoints=3.13). Both models demonstrated a main effect of resilience, such that higher resilience was associated with lower stress levels (p&lt;0.001;Figure 1). Perceived stress was not influenced by demographic factors, cognition or AÃŸ status. No significant interaction was found between resilience and time in predicting stress levels longitudinally. Conclusion Our findings confirm that resilience is critical for coping with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that resilience could be an important target for potential interventions in the future. Efforts at increasing resilience could not only help support older adults navigating stressful situations, but may also mitigate negative effects of stress on neurocognitive and mental health.","Kuppe, Madeline K.; Gagliardi, Geoffroy, Gatchel, Jennifer R.; Munro, Catherine E.; Marshall, Gad A.; Sperling, Reisa A.; Amariglio, Rebecca E.; Vannini, Patrizia","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.056361","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S6):e056361, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24630,""
"COVID-19 pandemic: Quantifying the effects of the first lockdown on behavioral and cognitive measures using TASIC","Background Following the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus throughout Quebec, the TRIAD cohort, a longitudinal observational study, evaluated the effects of COVID-19 on it?s aging and vulnerable population and their caregivers. This study aims at investigating the behavioural and psychological effects of COVID-19 and social isolation on the aging population. The TRIAD Assessment of Social Isolation and Cognition (TASIC) was developed to assess these effects on participants of observational trials. Method Pre-pandemic data including, demographical information, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and a Social Support Questionnaire, were collected during in-person visits and take-home questionnaires. Following the onset of COVID-19, TASIC was created to include additional COVID-19 specific scales developed by Dr. Rosa-Neto and Dr. King that include Knowledge of COVID-19 scale, the Montreal Assessment of Stress related to COVID-19 (MASC), as well as the Impact of Events Scale (IESR), the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire (PDEQ) for COVID-19. Assessments were conducted via telephone interviews with TRIAD participants (n=292) and their informants (n=243) by eight trained research assistants from April through June 2020. All participants enrolled in previous TRIAD studies, deemed eligible through detailed screening criteria were contacted. Result As a result of this study, and previous work done by the cohort, a culmination of information is available, with 90% of TRIAD participants having completed the COVID-19 study also having plasma collected. 80% of participants from the COVID-19 study have PET imaging using [18F]AZD4694 and [18F]MK6240 and MRI sequencing. Conclusion The COVID-19 study conducted by TRIAD provides a unique opportunity to understand the effects of a global pandemic on our aging population as well as caregiver burden. This data, in conjunction with other measures available in the cohort, can make important strides in finding ways to help, and better understand those most impacted by the crisis.","Stevenson, Jenna, Lussier, Firoza Z.; Servaes, Stijn, Chamoun, Mira, Rahmouni, Nesrine, Tissot, CÃ©cile, Poltronetti, Nina Margherita, Pascoal, Tharick A.; Benedet, AndrÃ©a Lessa, Bezgin, Gleb, King, Suzanne, Gauthier, Serge, Rosa-Neto, Pedro","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.056573","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S1):e056573, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24631,""
"The WW-FINGERS-SARS-CoV2 initiative: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on brain health and prevention strategies","Background Older adults have higher risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, and they also represent the group most severely affected by the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic in terms of higher morbidity and mortality. The World-Wide FINGERS (WW-FINGERS) global network of multidomain trials for dementia risk reduction and prevention (Kivipelto et al., 2020) provides a unique framework to explore how the pandemic has affected factors related to mental and physical health of populations at increased risk of dementia, while accounting also for country-specific strategies to contain the spread of the infection. Methods The WW-FINGERS-SARS-CoV2 survey has been developed to explore direct and indirect effects of the pandemic in midlife and older age. The questions aim to measure changes in lifestyle factors (e.g., diet, physical activity), management of chronic noncommunicable diseases (e.g., diabetes, hypertension), as well as psychosocial factors - including depressive symptoms, sleep disorders, social isolation - that are relevant to cognition and are expected to be affected by the pandemic. The survey measures also established and possible epidemiologic risk factors for severe COVID-19. To facilitate distribution is different settings, both a pen-and-paper and a digital version of the survey have been developed in several languages. The digital version is supported through REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a secure web-based software that is being also used for harmonized data collection. Results Over 25 countries are taking part in the survey. Local adaptations and piloting are being done to optimize implementation in both clinical-based and population-based settings. Participants are in the at-risk spectrum for dementia: from cognitively normal persons to individuals with pre-dementia cognitive symptoms. An updated report of the survey status will be presented. Conclusion the survey is a joint global action of the WW-FINGERS network which can inform better care of older adults in the context of a pandemic. The survey is also a valuable tool for pre-screening of participants for prevention trials, and results can inform adaptions to ensure successful recruitment and adherence in forthcoming multidomain trials for dementia prevention in older adults.","Mangialasche, Francesca, PÃ©rez, Kristal Morales, Lehtisalo, Jenni, Solomon, Alina, Peltonen, Markku, Ngandu, Tiia, Kivipelto, Miia","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.056732","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S10):e056732, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24632,""
"Psychological status in the participants of the API ADAD Colombia trial assisted by a comprehensive mental health program during COVID 19 pandemic","Background Due to the global SARS-CoV2 pandemic it has been hard to conduct research, including research related to prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. The Alzheimer?s Prevention Initiative (API) Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer?s Disease (ADAD) Colombia trial is being conducted in participants with family history of early-onset dementia due to the PSEN1 E280A mutation who are cognitively unimpaired at baseline. Participants are enduring three stressors: 1) fear of developing dementia;2) logistic changes to the study caused by the public health emergency due to the pandemic;and 3) concern about getting infected by SARS-CoV2. Objective: To describe the frequency of new or exacerbated psychological disorders among the participants of the API ADAD Colombia trial assisted by a comprehensive mental health team during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method Participants in the API ADAD Colombia trial have free access to psychology and psychiatry services, either in person or through teleassistance, as well as psychoeducational offerings. These mental health services are provided by the site, outside of the study protocol, and are supported by Health and Social plans which were created to support participants? wellbeing during the trial. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation and percentages) were used to analyze characteristics and frequency of mental health issues in the participants. Result 66 participants (53 women, 80.3%) were treated by the Mental Health Team from March 1st, 2020 through December 31st, 2020. Mean age was 44.09 (SD 6.97) y.o. Before and after the pandemic onset, the most common psychological problems were anxiety (before 36.4%, after 63.6%) and depression (before 34.8 %, after 37.9%). From people who received psychological and psychiatric services, 70% vs. 81.6% felt that those services helped them, respectively. Among participants who received psychological vs. psychiatric assistance, 71.4% vs. 86.9% of patients with depression, 70.3% vs 75% of patients with anxiety and 60% vs 76.2% of patients with other disorders, felt the services helped them with these conditions.

"EEG power bifurcation in the transition zone beta to gamma â€” from motor function to cognition â€” in Alzheimer and long COVID patients versus healthy controls revealed by quantitative EEG time series analysis of lateral EEG data","Background Similar EEG abnormalities suggest a nexus from Long COVID (LC) to Alzheimer?s (AD) and probably to Parkinson?s disease (PD). Symptoms like memory loss hint to a common cause. Ranasinghe (2020) showed EEG alpha slowing and hyper- and hyposynchrony for AD. In LC generalized EEG slowing (Antony, 2020) was reported. There is evidence that switching between brain hemispheres is necessary for scenery and object processing (Brincat, 2021), being disturbed in AD (Maass, 2020). However, explicitly lateral EEG for AD is rarely investigated. We calculate frontal asymmetry index (FAI) for F4/F3 EEG electrodes, which is normally used at alpha frequency for assessing emotional states in major depression (Davidson, 1998), not only for alpha but for further frequencies of AD patients. This possibly yields new biomarkers for AD and LC. Method FAI := logarithm of quotient between F4/F3 power, calculated for frequencies up to 120Hz of AD data taken from (Valladolid, Abasolo, 2017) and (Naples, Babiloni, 2018). AD and healthy control (HC) resting state EEG data from Valladolid were semi-automatically artifact-corrected and subdivided into 5s-epochs. For AD patients and HCs the average of all 5s-epochs was used for FAI. We recently determined power spectra and FAI from full-length 10min resting-state EEG for an LC patient, suffering from tremor. EEG power was calculated by averaged 5s-epochs of raw-data for F4/F3 for frequencies up to 100Hz. Result In Fig. 1 (Valladolid) FAI for F4/F3 is shown. A definite bifurcation occurs at 30Hz distinguishing AD group from HC. The power spectrum of an LC patient shows also at 30Hz frequency (Fig. 2) a significant increase, revealing high Beta EEG power conforming with severity of PD-symptoms (O?Keeffe, 2020). Changing sign of asymmetry (i.e. FAI ? 0.3) can be observed at 30Hz (Fig. 3). Conclusion The application of FAI in the full frequency range shall further be investigated as a new biomarker for AD and LC. The EEG frequency range from 25Hz to 35Hz appears to be an important transition zone from motor function to cognition. Abnormalities in this frequency range might be linked to AD, PD and LC and could open a new diagnostic window.","Wirner, Frank, Fritsch, Thomas, Scheuplein, Sebastian, Dazian, Dieter","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.057667","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S5):e057667, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24634,""
"The role of physical health on the relationship between subjective memory complaints, anxiety, and depression in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Research demonstrates that subjective memory complaints (SMCs) are associated with anxiety and depression;however, few studies have longitudinally examined the relationship between SMCs and new onset of anxiety and depression symptoms in older adults. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is also important to consider how existing health conditions may impact these associations. We examined (1) if SMCs predict new onset of anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in older adults and (2) if physical health problems exacerbate this association. Method We performed hierarchical linear regression analyses to evaluate associations between SMCs and depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, controlling for age, sex, education, income, baseline anxiety and depression, and cognition. Next, we assessed the interaction between SMCs and health conditions on anxiety and depression symptoms. Result SMCs (?= 0.021, p= .017) and health (?=.165, p&lt;0.001) were directly associated with increased anxiety symptoms;however, the interaction effect was not significant (?=0.002, p=0.697). SMCs (?=0.006, p=0.493) and health (?=0.075, p=0.069) were not directly associated with increased depression symptoms;however, the interaction was significant (?=0.017, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion SMCs and health problems exert independent effects on the development of anxiety symptoms;whereas the effect of SMCs on the development of depression symptoms depends on the presence of health problems. These findings highlight the role health plays in the development of depression and anxiety symptoms in older adults during societal stressors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sheffler, Julia L.; Taylor, Diamond, Saliga, Hollyn","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.057807","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S10):e057807, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24635,""
"Concerns of older adults during second COVID wave in India","Background A second wave of COVID infections in India, lockdown, restriction on services, and strain on an unprepared health system has had significant impact on older adults. It is important to examine impact of the lockdown on the elderly and their caregivers, useful coping strategies and requirements for support going forwards. Method As part of an ongoing community engagement initiative with older adults, an online survey was conducted in 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic investigating mental health and wellbeing of older adults. Participants who shared details were contacted one year later to understand impact of the second COIVD wave on their wellbeing and coping. An in-depth telephonic interview was conducted and General Health Questionnaire 5 item were used for data collection. Audio consent was taken prior to interviews which were recorded and transcribed for thematic analysis. Result Out of 58 participants who shared contact details, 16 % (N=9) agreed to participate in the interview. about 40 % refused mentioning they were unwell/ too busy/or agreed to speak at a later date. One female and 8 males participated in the interview between the ages of 36 to 83 years. All participants held post graduate/ professional degrees. 33 % (N=3) participants obtained a GHQ score of 2 and above on the five item General Health Questionnaire indicating presence of depressive features. As compared to the first lockdown, older adults found the second lockdown more stressful due to deaths of close friends and family members. Increased fears about family members with comorbidities contracting the virus, difficulties managing emotional wellbeing, and challenges helping younger family members manage their routines and follow basic COVID protocols were key concerns. Coping strategies found useful were remaining active and engaged at home, attending online mental wellness sessions, practicing yoga/ meditation and spending time with friends/family. Older adults highlighted a need for more emotional support through creation of social media networks and online platforms. Conclusion Preliminary findings from this study emphasize a need for leveraging technology to support emotional wellbeing of older adults during lockdown and COVID restrictions.","Chopra, Meenakshi, Dasgupta, Jayashree","https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.057871","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Alzheimer's & Dementia; 17(S10):e057871, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24636,""
"Mourning in quarantine","This paper explores the effects of mourning in isolation. The authors posit that the pandemic-induced quarantine has impacted mourning processes in a negative manner, particularly insofar as the relational aspects of mourning are concerned. Through a phenomenological study based on a survey of 56 mental health care professionals, the authors examine individual experiences of living through the pandemic while enduring loss and subsequent bereavement in socially isolative conditions. The data, accompanied by several case examples, suggests that during the pandemic loss and mourning were complicated by isolation, the lack of communal grieving rituals and the presence of an increase in mental health disorders. Furthermore, the authors hypothesize that during the Covid-19 pandemic, the absence of positive relational support will result in a greater number of cases of delayed, stalled, and prolonged mourning, as well as Persistent Complex Bereavement.","Masur, C.; Wertheimer, S.

"Effect effect of online counselling on emotional outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic: An innovative group intervention for university students using the Brain Wave Modulation Technique","Young people's mental health problems are a matter of concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Counselling services for university students by means of telemental support can help them to deal with psychological issues that they may be facing due to the pandemic. The present study investigated the effects of four once-weekly online counselling sessions based on a mind-body technique (the Brain Wave Modulation Technique;BWM-T) on enhancing positive affect and on reducing negative affect and anxiety in a sample of 54 university students (96.3% females;MageÂ =Â 21.31Â years, SDÂ =Â 2.09). An experimental design was conducted: the participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group, which received 15Â min of a guided online BWM-T session, or to the control group, which watched a 15-min video on how to sustain their psychological well-being. The results of a two-factor mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the participants in the intervention group reported a significant increase in positive affect and a decrease in negative affect over time compared to those in the control group. They also reported a slight decrease in state anxiety compared to the control group, although this was just short of statistical significance. The information provided by this study, regarding emotional outcomes among university students after four brief online counselling sessions, suggests that such interventions could be an effective and sustainable way to reinforce young people's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as later in their university careers and adult lives.","Celia, Giovanna, Cavicchiolo, Elisa, Girelli, Laura, Limone, Pierpaolo, Cozzolino, Mauro","https://doi.org/10.1002/capr.12512","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Counselling and Psychotherapy Research; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24638,""

"Heal the Healers: A pilot study evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, and exploratory efficacy of a Transcendental Meditation intervention for emergency clinicians during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","Objective Emergency clinicians face elevated rates of burnout that result in poor outcomes for clinicians, patients, and health systems. The objective of this single-arm pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of a Transcendental Meditation (TM) intervention for emergency clinicians during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to explore the potential effectiveness in improving burnout, sleep, and psychological health. Methods Emergency clinicians (physicians, nurses, and physician-assistants) from 2 urban hospitals were recruited to participate in TM instruction (8 individual or group in-person and remote sessions) for 3 months. Session attendance was the primary feasibility outcome (prespecified as attending 6/8 sessions), and burnout was the primary clinical outcome. Participant-reported measures of feasibility and validated measures of burnout, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and stress were collected at baseline and the 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. Descriptive statistics and linear mixed-effects models were used. Results Of the 14 physicians (46%), 7 nurses (22%), and 10 physician-assistants (32%) who participated, 61% were female (nÂ =Â 19/32). TM training and at-home meditation practice was feasible for clinicians as 90.6% (nÂ =Â 29/32) attended 6/8 training sessions and 80.6% self-reported meditating at least once a day on average. Participants demonstrated significant reductions in burnout (PÂ &lt;Â .05;effect sizes, Cohen's dÂ =Â 0.43?0.45) and in symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep disturbance (P valuesÂ &lt;Â .001;Cohen's dÂ =Â 0.70?0.87). Conclusion TM training was feasible for emergency clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic and led to significant reductions in burnout and psychological symptoms.

"Scenario-based fertility projections incorporating impacts of COVID-19","This paper examines the recent declines in period fertility in the constituent countries of the UK during the past decade and speculates mechanisms through which the COVID-19 pandemic could influence childbearing in the UK. The effects are likely to differ by age and presence of children. Considering potential forces acting on individuals at different ages and family sizes, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will depress fertility, particularly among younger people. Because fertility at all ages was declining before the onset of the pandemic, this could mean a further decline in period fertility to historically low UK levels. We put forward a number of scenarios to examine the possible impact of the pandemic on numbers of live births. Our projections show that for three scenarios out of four, fertility is expected to decline over the next 3?years, leading to significantly fewer births annually compared with the pre-pandemic period.","Berrington, Ann, Ellison, Joanne, Kuang, Bernice, Vasireddy, Sindhu, Kulu, Hill","https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.2546","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Population, Space and Place; n/a(n/a):e2546, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24643,""
"COVID-19 and Resilience in Schools: Implications for Practice and Policy","This is a mixed-methods study of risk and resilience in a sample of over 14,000 students from 49 schools, assessed during the first 3 months of COVID-19 in the United States. Over a third of students were of color and almost a third received financial aid. Participation rates were typically 90?99%. Overall, rates of clinically significant depression and anxiety were lower during distance learning in 2020 as compared to parallel rates documented during 2019, with a few exceptions. Hispanic students did not show reductions in depression rates, nor did gender non-binary youth. Analyses of multiple risk and protective factors showed that in relation to depression, the most potent predictor was parent support, with effect sizes at least twice as high as those for any other predictor. Other robust predictors of depression included efficacy of learning online and concerns heard by school adults. In predicting to anxiety, parent support again had the largest effect sizes, followed by concerns heard at school, students? worries about their futures, and worries about grades. In general, the absence of protective factors was more likely to be linked with high distress among youth of color than White students, and among girls and gender non-binary students as compared to boys. At a policy level, the findings call for concerted attention to the well-being of adults charged with caring for youth. Parents? mental health has been increasingly threatened with the protracted stress linked with the pandemic. Thus, all avenues must be considered toward providing them with support?using feasible, community-based interventions?as this is always the most important step in fostering children's resilience through adversity.Â Additionally, schools? expectations about learning will have to be adjusted. As educators try to make up for academic losses during the pandemic, they must avoid high workloads detrimental for students? mental health (and thus ability to learn). Finally, there must be ongoing institutional mental health support for teachers, counselors, administrators, and staff. Many of these adults have provided critical safety nets for youth since the start of the pandemic and are themselves at high risk for burnout. In conclusion, findings clearly show that if a central societal goal is to maximize resilience among youth through the continuing pandemic-related challenges, we will have to deliberately prioritize an ?upstream? approach, ensuring ongoing support for the adults who take care of them in their everyday lives. There must be ongoing institutional mental health support for teachers, counselors, administrators, and staff. Many of these adults have provided critical safety nets for youth since the start of the pandemic and are themselves at high risk for burnout.","Luthar, Suniya S.; Pao, Lisa S.; Kumar, Nina L.","https://doi.org/10.1002/sop2.16","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Social Policy Report; 34(3):1-65, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24644,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic and Lacan's discourse of the hysteric A discourse characterization using the example of #allesdichtmachen","In this article the video clips uploaded under the hashtag #allesdichtmachen at the end of April 2021 are analyzed as ironically and satirically exaggerated characterizations of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) discourse. Drawing on Lacan's discourse of the hysteric, the following starting point for the analysis is used: the citizens as divided subjects ($) protest and demand that the other (the federal government) delivers (S1) what they desire (e.g. absolute security). The other subsequently produces solutions (S2, e.g. to issue measures against the COVID-19) which, however, do not solve the fundamental lack (a) but actually lead to further demands from the citizens ($). The suppression of object petit a in the discourse of the hysteric is addressed in the video clips as the illusion of absolute security using the example of the inevitability of death. The drifting of desire, which is characteristic of the hysteric's social bond, results in demanding continuously new measures against the corona virus. The self-developed measures which are promoted in many video clips are interpreted as attempts at completion of the other and identification with the master. Anxiety is linked to the hysteric's desire for an unfulfilled desire. The article concludes with a discussion on how the discursive configuration can be challenged and evolves from the discourse of the hysteric to the discourse of the analyst and from the Kleinian paranoid-schizoid position to the depressive position.","Topfer, N.

"Factors associated with depression and anxiety in the adult population of Qatar after the first COVID-19 wave: a cross-sectional study","There is limited data from Arabic-speaking countries on risk factors for depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Country-specific data is necessary given differences in culture, demographics, and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. The main purpose of the study is to identify the factors associated with symptoms of depression-anxiety in the adult population of Qatar during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in Qatar between July and December 2020 after Qatarâ€™s first COVID-19 wave and before the beginning of the second wave. Depression-anxiety was defined as a cut-off of 20 or higher on the Patient Health Questionnaire-Anxiety Depression ScaleÂ (PHQ-ADS). Of 1138 participants, 71.0% were female, 69.0% Arabs, 70.0% Non-Qataris, and 77.0% were &lt; 40Â years (the median age in Qatar is 32Â years). In a fully-adjusted model, six variables were significantly associated withÂ moderate-to-severe levels of depression or anxietyÂ on the PHQ-ADS;Arab ethnicity (OR = 1.67, p = 0.026), never married versus marriedÂ (OR = 1.69, p = 0.015), prior history of psychiatric disorder versus no history (OR = 1.80, p = 0.009), increased worries due to social media use for COVID-related news/updates (OR = 1.72, p = 0.003), a history of COVID-19 (OR = 1.76, p = 0.039), loneliness (OR = 1.91, p &lt; 0.001), and lower levels of religiosity (OR = 0.96, p = 0.039). These associations also pertained in the reduced model, with theÂ exception of religiosity which was only marginally statistically significant (OR = 0.97, p = 0.055).Â The potential risk factors identified may assist with anxiety and depression prevention in future COVID-19 waves, and similar national events, and assist with early intervention to treat sufferers.","Khaled, Salma Mawfek, Amro, Iman, Bader, Lina, Woodruff, Peter, Alabdulla, Majid A.; Bellaj, Tarek, Marzouk, Yousri, Hasan, Youssef, Al-Kaabi, Ibrahim M.; Haddad, Peter M.","https://doi.org/10.1007/S44202-021-00009-Z","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Discover Psychology; 1(1):9-9, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24646,""
"IMPACT (IMpact on PostpArtum Care by Telehealth) Study: a retrospective cohort study","Objective: During the COVID-19 pandemic, institutions turned to telehealth as the primary method of postpartum care delivery. We aimed to determine the impact of telehealth on the completion of postpartum care goals. Study Design: We compared a 14-week period, March-June 2019, before implementation of telehealth to the same calendar months post-implementation during 2020. Patients with a postpartum visit (PPV) scheduled at our institution during the study period were included. Our primary outcome was attendance to the PPV. Secondary outcomes included completion of postpartum depression (PPD) screening, contraception selection, breastfeeding status at PPV, completion of postpartum 2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) for women with gestational diabetes, and cardiology follow-up when recommended. Multivariable logistic regression with backward elimination was used to control for confounders. Results: Of the 1,579 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 780 were in the pre-telehealth group and 799 were in the post-telehealth group. Subjects in the post-telehealth group were 90% more likely to attend a PPV compared to those in the pre-telehealth group, even when controlling for race, prenatal care provider, parity, gestational age at delivery, and insurance status (82.9% vs. 72.4%, p &lt; 0.001;aOR 1.90, 95% CI [1.47-2.46]). Patients in the post-telehealth group were also more likely to get screened for PPD (86.3% vs. 65.1%, p &lt; 0.001). While subjects were as likely to choose a contraceptive method at the PPV, those in the post-telehealth group were less likely to choose long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) or permanent sterilization (26.2% vs. 33.2%, p=0.03). There was no difference in breastfeeding status at the PPV, completion rate of postpartum 2-hour GTT, or attendance to cardiology follow-up appointments between groups. Conclusion: Availability of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased PPV attendance and PPD screening. However, the availability of telehealth was also associated with a decrease in the utilization of LARC or permanent sterilization. [Formula presented]","Arias, M. P.; Wang, E. Y.; Hamm, R.

"Psychosocial stressors of parenting and the postpartum period during COVID-19","Objective: Pandemic-related changes produced a major shift for parental roles, responsibilities, and expectations. Our objective was to identify parenting challenges experienced by low-income postpartum mothers during a global pandemic lockdown. Study Design: In this qualitative investigation, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 40 postpartum individuals who gave birth in a single center in Chicago in the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic (January-March 2020). Interviews addressed issues related to maternal health and well-being, including parental stress, limited access to essential goods, and COVID-related barriers to providing for children. All interviews were conducted via phone, transcribed, and analyzed using the constant comparative method. Results: Of the 40 participants, 50% (n=20) identified as non-Hispanic Black and 38% (n=15) as Hispanic;75% (n=30) were parents of multiple children. The primary parenting-related themes included challenges of parenting multiple children, barriers to self-care, and novel barriers to providing for children (Table). Subthemes within challenges of parenting multiple children include new role as an educator, struggle with entertaining, and time allocation. The barriers to self-care subthemes included lack of free time, changes in self-care and coping strategies, and effects on maternal mental health. The novel barriers to providing for children subthemes included lack of communal support, financial stress, and difficulty obtaining essential needs. Conclusion: Obstetric providers are often a first-line point of contact for postpartum individuals and may benefit from understanding how psychosocial stressors experienced during the pandemic may negatively affect maternal health. Our findings suggest new psychosocial burdens were introduced by the pandemic that challenged individual health and wellbeing during the postpartum period. Findings can inform interventions, which may include enhanced support from the clinical team or connections to community resources, to alleviate postpartum challenges for mothers and their families.

"Technology and mental health among NICU parents during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: Parents of neonates in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) experience many mental health stressors. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these stressors, as pandemic-related restrictions created barriers to resources and newborn bonding. Modern technology offers tools that can help NICU parents maintain their mental and social health remotely. Study Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess self-reported mental health and technology use among parents of infants hospitalized in the NICU at a single institution during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also studied the prevalence of specific COVID-19-related stressors among participants. Participants were asked to rank a series of statements on a Likert scale to describe their mental health, technology use, and COVID-19-related stress. Spearman rank coefficients were calculated to measure strength and direction of associations. Results: A sample of 47 participants completed the voluntary assessment. Mental health was negatively associated with higher COVID-19-related stress (rs-0.40, p=.015). The most prevalent COVID-19-related stressor was hospital visitation restriction, which 31.9% of participants assigned the highest severity stress score. Higher COVID-19-related stress was associated with the use of text and video chat for social support [(rs 0.35, p.016)and ( rs 0.33 p=.025) respectively]. Further, we found that greater enjoyment of technology use and greater access to technology were both positively associated with higher mental health scores [(rs 0.42, p=.003) and (rs 0.38, p=.009), respectively]. Conclusion: Our findings support the value of technology for individuals impacted by the stress of having a newborn who is hospitalized during a global health crisis. Evidence showing clinical benefits of technology supports the expansion of patient access and incentivizing funding for hospital programs, especially as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Postpartum depression in cohorts before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: The start of quarantine for the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 began a prolonged period of isolation from family and crucial social support for many pregnant and postpartum patients throughout the country. The objective of this study was to compare the score of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), breastfeeding, and compliance with postpartum gestational diabetes follow-up in cohorts before and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Study Design: This was a historical cohort study of women presenting for postpartum care in March through May of 2019 and 2020 at a tertiary academic medical center. Demographic information, parity, delivery routes, EPDS scores, maternal mental health history, partner status, and postpartum diabetes screening completion were ed from the electronic medical record. Results were compared between the 2019 and 2020 cohorts. Results: There were 579 women with postpartum visits in the study timeframe, with 260 in 2019 and 319 in 2020. Age, gestational age at delivery, pre-gravid BMI, and partner status were similar between cohorts. (Table 1) There was no difference in history of a mental health diagnosis, history of mental health medication use, or mental health treatment during pregnancy between cohorts. There were more nulliparous patients, cesarean deliveries, African American patients, and Asian patients in 2020. The mean EPDS score was similar between cohorts;there was no difference in breastfeeding or 2-hour glucose tolerance test compliance in women who had gestational diabetes. (Table 2) There was a non-significant trend toward more new postpartum depression treatment in 2020. Conclusion: In our population, the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting social disruption was not associated with a difference between EPDS scores, breastfeeding, completion of gestational diabetes follow up or incidence of initiation of mental health treatment in the postpartum period in our population.

"COVID-19 Vaccination and Mental Health: A Difference-in-Difference Analysis of the Understanding America Study","Introduction: Mental health problems increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Knowledge that one is less at risk after being vaccinated may alleviate distress but this hypothesis remains unexplored. This study tests whether psychological distress declined in those vaccinated against COVID-19 in the U.S. and whether changes in anticipatory fears mediated any association. Methods: A nationally representative cohort of U.S. adults (n=8,090) in the Understanding America Study were interviewed every 2 weeks from March 2020 to June 2021 (28 waves). Difference-in-differences regression tested whether vaccination reduced distress (Patient Health Questionnaire 4 scores), with mediation analysis used to identify potential mechanisms, including perceived risks of infection, hospitalization, and death. Results: Vaccination was associated with a 0.04-SD decline in distress (95% CI= â€“0.07, â€“0.02). Vaccination was associated with a 7.77â€“percentage point reduction in perceived risk of infection (95% CI= â€“8.62, â€“6.92), a 6.91-point reduction in perceived risk of hospitalization (95% CI= â€“7.72, â€“6.10), and a 4.68-point reduction in perceived risk of death (95% CI= â€“5.32, â€“4.04). Including risk perceptions decreased the vaccinationâ€“distress association by 25%. Event study models suggest vaccinated and never vaccinated respondents followed similar Patient Health Questionnaire 4 trends pre-vaccination, diverging significantly post-vaccination. Analyses were robust to individual and wave fixed effects, time-varying controls. The effect of vaccination on distress varied by race/ethnicity, with the largest declines observed among American Indian and Alaska Native individuals (ÃŸ= â€“0.20, p&lt;0.05, 95% CI= â€“0.36, â€“0.03). Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination was associated with declines in distress and perceived risks of infection, hospitalization, and death. Vaccination campaigns could promote these additional benefits of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.","Koltai, Jonathan, Raifman, Julia, Bor, Jacob, McKee, Martin, Stuckler, David","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2021.11.006","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: American Journal of Preventive Medicine;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24655,""

"Profiling office workers based on their self-reported preferences of indoor environmental quality and psychosocial comfort at their workplace during COVID-19","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of office workers were required to conduct their work from home. Little is known about the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) preferences and psychosocial comfort preferences of staff working from home. Therefore this study aimed to cluster office workers working at home based on their self-reported preferences for IEQ and psychosocial comfort at their most used workspace and to identify these preferences and needs of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. A questionnaire was administered to employees of ten offices in the Netherlands, and the 502 respondents were clustered with two models by using TwoStep cluster analysis. The first model was based on variables related to IEQ preferences, while the second was to psychosocial comfort preferences. The analysis revealed four IEQ clusters and six psychosocial comfort clusters. Comparison of these results with other similar studies proposed that the prevalence of anxiety, depression, migraine, and rhinitis, increased for this population during the work-from-home period of the pandemic. Further results suggest that both IEQ and psychosocial comfort preferences are situation- and gender-dependent.","Ortiz, Marco A.; Bluyssen, Philomena M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108742","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Building and Environment;: 108742, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24657,""
"Unemployment and child maltreatment during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Korea","Background Risk factors for child maltreatment have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially due to economic downfalls leading to parental job losses and poor mental health. Objective This study aimed to examine the association between child maltreatment and unemployment rate in the Republic of Korea. Participants and setting Nationally representative data at the province level were used. Methods The monthly excess number of hotline calls related to child maltreatment during the COVID-19 pandemic was estimated for each province. Fixed effects regressions was used to examine the relationship between the excess number of hotline calls and unemployment rate. Results The average excess number of hotline calls was significantly negative in the early stage of the pandemic, but became significantly positive afterwards except for some months with averages not statistically different from zero. The regression results showed that an increase of male unemployment rate by 1% was significantly associated with an increase in the excess number of hotline calls by 0.15â€”0.17 per 10,000 children for most dependent variables for the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The statistical significance of female unemployment rate was mixed with the opposite sign of the coefficient to that of male unemployment. Overall unemployment rate was not significant. Conclusions This study suggests that disruptions in child welfare services should be avoided to prevent underreporting of or delayed responses to suspected cases. Also, policies need to be designed considering potential pathways from economic downfalls, especially male unemployment, to child maltreatment.","Kim, Young Eun","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105474","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Child Abuse & Neglect;: 105474, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24658,""
"Impact of an overdose reversal program in in the context of a safe consumption site in Northern Mexico","Background Drug overdoses are prevalent in low- and middle-income countries but are scarcely reported in the literature. We report on an opioid overdose reversal and naloxone distribution program that was instituted at the first safe consumption site in Latin America. Methods A cross-sectional analysis of witnessed drug overdoses and naloxone distribution between 1 June 2019 and 31 May 2021 in Mexicali, Mexico. Case report forms were entered in an electronic database. Trends in overdose and naloxone distribution were described. Comparisons were made before and after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared in the city. Maps were created to represent the geographic distribution of overdose in the city. Results During the study period 1,534 doses of naloxone were distributed throughout the community. In addition, there were 464 overdoses reported during this period, of which 4 were fatal. There was a 30% increase in reported overdoses from the period before the COVID-19 pandemic to the period after the pandemic was declared (pÂ =Â 0.03). Most common substance reported included heroin (93%), sedatives (21%), methamphetamine (16%) and fentanyl (14%). Naloxone was given in 96% of cases (median 1 dose, IQR 1-2 doses) and emergency services were called in 20% of cases. Conclusions An opioid overdose reversal program in Mexicali, Mexico was able to distribute naloxone and register drug overdoses between 2019 and 2021 as a harm reduction strategy. This adds to the growing body of literature on the impact of community-based programs on preventing fatal overdoses and the potential for implementation in low-resource settings.","Goodman-Meza, David, Slim, Said, Angulo, Lourdes, Gonzalez-Nieto, Pablo, Cambou, Mary C.; Loera, Alejandra, Shoptaw, Steve, Arredondo, Jaime","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dadr.2021.100021","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence Reports;: 100021, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24659,""

"HIV, Psychological Resilience, and Substance Misuse During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multi-Cohort Study","Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted mental health, increasing rates of substance misuse. Resilience is a positive adaptation to stress that may act as a buffer against adverse mental health outcomes. Based on prior knowledge, we hypothesized that PLWH would display higher resilience than HIV-uninfected peers, and that high resilience would be associated with lower risk of substance misuse. Methods This analysis of the Collaborating Consortium of Cohorts Producing NIDA Opportunities (C3PNO) included data from six USA cohorts that administered a COVID-19-related survey with a 3-month follow-up during May 2020 and March 2021. All data was self-reported. The Brief Resilience Scale and General Anxiety Disorder-7 were utilized. Primary analyses consisted of multivariate generalized linear mixed models with random intercepts using binary logistic regression. Results A total of 1,430 participants completed both surveys, of whom 670 (46.9%) were PLWH. PLWH had lower odds of anxiety (OR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.51-0.89) and higher odds of high resilience (OR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.02-1.44) than HIV-uninfected participants, adjusted for covariates. The presence of anxiety was associated with higher risk of misuse of all substances. High resilience was associated with lower risk of anxiety and misuse of substances, adjusted for covariates. Conclusions Psychological resilience was associated with lower risk of anxiety and substance misuse, potentially serving as a buffer against poor mental and behavioral health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is needed to identify pathways of resilience in the context of substance misuse and comprehensive resilience-focused interventions.","Baum, Marianna K.; Tamargo, Javier A.; Diaz-Martinez, Janet, Delgado-Enciso, Ivan, Meade, Christina S.; Kirk, Gregory D.; Mehta, Shruti H.; Moore, Richard, Kipke, Michele D.; Shoptaw, Steven J.; Mustanski, Brian, Mandler, Raul N.; Khalsa, Jag H.; Siminski, Suzanne, Javanbakht, Marjan, Gorbach, Pamina M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109230","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence;: 109230, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24661,""
"Short-term binge drinking, marijuana, and recreational drug use trajectories in a prospective cohort of people living with HIV at the start of COVID-19 mitigation efforts in the United States","Background At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, HIV experts suggested that an increase in mental health diagnoses and substance use among people living with HIV (PLHIV) may be an unintended consequence of COVID-19 mitigation efforts (e.g., limiting social contact). We evaluated short-term trajectories in binge drinking, marijuana, and recreational drug use in a prospective cohort of PLHIV. Methods Data (N = 2,121 PLHIV) consist of survey responses on substance use behaviors from two pre-COVID-19 (October 2018-September 2019) and one COVID-19-era (April 2020-September 2020) timepoints within the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS). We conducted group-based trajectory models, triangulated with generalized linear mixed models, to assess changes in binge drinking, daily marijuana use, and recreational drug use at the start of the pandemic. Controlling for age and race/ethnicity, we tested whether trajectories differed by sex and early-pandemic depressive symptoms, loneliness, and social support. Results Group-based trajectory models yielded two trajectory groups for binge drinking (none vs. any), marijuana (none/infrequent vs. daily), and recreational drug use (none vs. any). Binge drinking and recreational drug use decreased at the beginning of the pandemic. Generalized linear mixed model supported these trends. Consistent with prior research, male sex and having depressive symptoms early pandemic were positively associated with each substance use outcomes. Social support was inversely associated with recreational drug use. Conclusions Contrary to hypotheses, problematic substance use behaviors decreased from pre-pandemic to the post-pandemic follow-up in our sample of PLHIV. Ongoing surveillance is needed to assess whether this pattern persists as the pandemic continues.","Meanley, Steven, Choi, Seul Ki, Thompson, Azure B.; Meyers, Jacquelyn L.; Dâ€™Souza, Gypsyamber, Adimora, Adaora A.; Mimiaga, Matthew J.; Kempf, Mirjam-Colette, Konkle-Parker, Deborah, Cohen, Mardge H.; Teplin, Linda A.; Murchison, Lynn, Rubin, Leah H.; Rubtsova, Anna A.; Weiss, Deborah Jones, Aouizerat, Brad, Friedman, Mackey R.; Plankey, Michael W.; Wilson, Tracey E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109233","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence;: 109233, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24662,""
"What are the effects of energy poverty and interventions to ameliorate it on people's health and well-being?: A scoping review with an equity lens","Several studies have shown how energy poverty (EP) increases morbidity and mortality, being a growing problem worldwide. We conducted a scoping review to synthesize the state of knowledge on the relationship between energy poverty (EP) and health, analysing the results according to different axes of inequality (gender, age, ethnicity/country of birth, social class, territory). We searched different bibliographic databases (MeSH and free-text terms);Eligibility criteria: 1] studies or interventions related to EP or its different expressions (inadequate temperatures;financial strain, inadequate housing conditions, composite indicators, heating and energy efficiency improvements);2] health or health risk outcomes;3] OECD countries;4] English or Spanish language;5] published before July 2020. We selected 38 studies out of 2768 (23 observational and 15 interventions). Almost all were quantitative (89.5%) and almost half were conducted in the UK (47.4%). The most studied EP expression was inadequate temperature. Eleven studies disaggregate the analyses by at least one axis of inequality and 21 target a vulnerable group. The studies linked EP to poorer general health, poorer mental health, poorer respiratory health, more and worse controlled chronic conditions, higher mortality, higher use of health services and higher exposure to health risks, with worse results for vulnerable groups across dimensions of inequality. Current scientific evidence should guide structural changes and immediate interventions to ameliorate EP.

"Supporting Employee Wellness Within a Large Health System During the COVID-19 Crisis","Introduction: During the COVID-19 crisis, medical providers face stress, feelings of isolation and fear. Hence, in April 2020, Cleveland Clinic Community Care, a provider of inpatient and outpatient services, created a â€œWellness and Self-Careâ€ task force to support employee wellness. The objective of this quality improvement report is to describe and evaluate the task force's efforts. Methods: The task force created a list of free wellness resources: daily yoga and guided meditation, snacks, tea and coffee (â€œnourish stationsâ€), continuous access to mental health counseling and organized employees into neighborhood support groups. We evaluated the program in May 2020 using a cross-sectional survey of clinical and non-clinical employees. The survey included questions on responsibility changes related to COVID-19, fulfillment and burnout and wellness services used. Responders were grouped in â€œnone or someâ€ and â€œmost or allâ€ responsibilities changed. We described our results using Pearson's chi-square and Student's t-tests. Results: We received 736 responses, a response rate of 45%. A quarter of responders (27%) needed family care;8% had been quarantined;42% reported that most or all of their work responsibilities changed. The highest level of burnout was reported by those who had most or all of their responsibility changed. Frequently used resources were information tip sheets (51%), online resources (44 %), virtual live yoga and meditation classes (25%), and nourish stations (6%). Conclusions: The task force addressed employee wellness during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Employees with mostly or all changed responsibilities experienced higher levels of burnout compared to those whose responsibilities were minimally or not changed. One year into the pandemic with the responsibilities back to normal or not ""new"" anymore, it is worthwhile to reassess if the groups are less split and if other groups are affected more now.

"COVID-19 Related Occupational Stress in Teachers in Ireland","Background Sporadic school closures and a shift to online teaching have resulted in significant work changes for teachers in Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such rapid changes are likely to compound other personal or family stressors resultant from the pandemic. Method This study examines occupational stress levels during COVID-19 among a national sample of 245 teachers in Ireland using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory as the main outcome measure. Results Moderate or high levels of personal burnout was reported by 82% (n=202) of the sample and 79% (n=193) reported work burnout. COVID-19 related adverse effects were reported by teachers on physical (43%) and mental health (67%), with deterioration in eating (34%), sleeping (70%) and alcohol use (33%). 100 (42%) participants felt unable to keep safe at work. Low levels of job satisfaction were present (66%), negatively correlating with burnout scores (rs= -0.405, p&lt;0.01). 142 (58%) teachers had seriously considered changing jobs in the previous 6-12 months. Conclusion Plans for continued educational access for students must urgently include interventions optimising the occupational environment and resources for teachers. This is necessary to prevent the deleterious impact of personal burnout on teacher wellbeing and to minimise the likelihood of increased staff turnover, early retirement and adverse impacts on teaching quality relating to work burnout.","Minihan, Elisha, Adamis, Dimitrios, Dunleavy, Michele, Martin, Angela, Gavin, Blanaid, McNicholas, Fiona","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijedro.2021.100114","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: International Journal of Educational Research Open;: 100114, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24668,""
"Uptake and effectiveness of a self-guided mobile app platform for college student mental health","Background College students endorse high rates of mental health problems. While many colleges offer on-campus services, many students who could benefit from mental health services do not receive care. Indeed, nearly half of students who screen positive for depression, for example, do not receive treatment. Digital mental health programs, such as those delivered via mobile apps, may help expand access to mental health care and resources. This mixed-methods study aims to examine the uptake and effectiveness of an implementation of IntelliCare for College Students, a self-guided app-based mental health platform, on two university campuses. Methods Data on counseling center utilization was collected prior to the implementation of the app (pre-implementation phase) and while the app was available on campus (implementation phase). Data on app usage was collected throughout the implementation phase. A subset of participants (nÂ =Â 20), along with counseling center staff members (nÂ =Â 10), completed feedback interviews. Results Overall, uptake of the app platform was low. A total of 117 participants downloaded the app and registered their study ID during the implementation phase. Approximately 24% (28/117) of participants used the app only once. The number of days between the first and last day of app use ranged from 0 to 299, with a mean of 35.01Â days and a median of 14Â days. A relatively small portion of the sample (26.5%;31/117) downloaded one or more of the IntelliCare interactive apps. In examining counseling center utilization, there were no significant changes in intake appointments, individual therapy sessions, or crisis appointments observed from the pre-implementation phase to the implementation phase of the study. Feedback interviews highlighted the significant level of disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and shift to remote learning, including challenges disseminating information to students and a preference to spend less time with digital devices outside of class time. Conclusions Findings from this study indicate that there is an ongoing need to identify ways to reach college students and support student mental health and wellness for the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Lattie, Emily G.; Cohen, Katherine A.; Hersch, Emily, Williams, Kofoworola D.

"Stressful events as correlates of depressive and PTSD symptoms in Hong Kong women during social unrest and COVID-19 pandemic","Background : Stressors at the population level affect women more than men. The influence of prolonged stressors on mental disorders in women is yet unknown, especially when social movements and pandemics coexist. Methods : This study analysed data from an online mental health self-help service for women in Hong Kong between May and September 2020. We collected demographic data, PTSD symptoms, and exposure to social unrest-related traumatic events (TEs), pandemic-related traumatic events (PEs), and personal stressful life experiences (SLEs). Multiple logistic regression was performed to examine the links between TEs, PEs, and SLEs and PTSD. Results :Â The study found that 38.4% of 751 women had moderate-to-severe depressive symptomsÂ and 23.8% had probableÂ PTSD. The most common TEs, PEs, and SLEs were violence via media, major physicalÂ health concerns, and plans thwarted due to COVID-19, respectively. Younger age, less education, unemployment, and more stressorsÂ (individually or collectively, except for high TEs and PEs)Â were linked to increased odds of mild-to-severe depressive symptoms. TEs and PEs increased the risk of probableÂ PTSD only when SLEs were present. Limitation : The non-random sample procedure reduced the generalisability to the entire women population. Conclusions : Exposure to social conflicts and pandemics may increase depressive and PTSD symptoms in women. Developing mental health services for women should consider the impact of concurrent major events.","Wong, Stephanie Ming Yin, Wong, Charlotte Wan Chi, Hui, Christy Lai Ming, Chan, Sherry Kit Wa, Lee, Edwin Ho Ming, Chang, Wing Chung, Suen, Yi Nam, Chen, Eric Yu Hai","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.01.002","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24670,""
"COVID-19 News Consumption and Distress in Young People: A Systematic Review","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought challenges for the mental health of young people. The volume, negative content and potential for misinformation within COVID-19 related news can be an additional cause of distress. This systematic review aims to synthesise the research findings on the relationship between COVID-19 news and distress in young people. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases were searched on 24 April 2021 for articles that contained empirical research examining the association between COVID-19 news consumption and mental health in samples of young people with a mean age between 10-24 years. Results: The 13 included studies involved 760,474 participants in predominantly cross-sectional studies, with data collected during COVID-19 lockdowns across seven countries. Increased consumption of COVID-19 news was associated with a decline in mental health (n =12). The results were more consistent for news obtained on social media with variation for traditional media sources. Misinformation may further explain the relationship. Limitations: Heterogeneity across study methodologies, lack of longitudinal research and validated measures of news consumption. Conclusions: The reviewed literature supports the association between increased consumption of COVID-19 related news and decreased mental health in young people. This group may benefit from support to mitigate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 news. Future research should utilise longitudinal designs, ecological momentary assessments, and reliable/valid measures of news consumption to explore the negative mental health associated with COVID-19 news in young people.","Strasser, Michelle A.; Sumner, Philip J.; Meyer, Denny","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.01.007","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24671,""
"Research on sleep status, body mass index, anxiety and depression of college students during the post-pandemic era in Wuhan, China","Objective Wuhan was theÂ firstÂ ChineseÂ cityÂ to be lockdown for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in springtime of 2020. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between sleep status, body mass index, anxiety and depression in college students during the post-pandemic era in the universities of Wuhan, China. Methods A total of 1457 college students completed the online surveys from December 25, 2020 to January 16, 2021. Collected data included gender, age, school name, native place, grade, major, body mass index (BMI), the scores of self-assessment lists of sleep (SRSS), Zung self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and Zung depression self-rating scale (SDS). Results 1445 valid questionnaires (99.18%) were received. Of all the respondents, the prevalence of insomnia, overweight and obesity, anxiety and depression were 32.73%, 19.45%, 15.43% and 62.91%, respectively. Female students were more likely to have insomnia and anxiety than male students. The rate of insomnia, overweight and obesity in postgraduates were higher than undergraduates. Non-medical students were more likely to be overweight and obese than medical students. In addition, insomnia severity was positively correlated to anxiety severity, and BMI was positively correlated to anxiety or depression severity. There was also a positive correlation between the severity of anxiety and depression. Conclusion During the post-pandemic era, insomnia and depression are common problems among college students in Wuhan, suggesting that we should strengthen the sleep education of college students to improve sleeping disorders and psychosomatic health.","Duan, Huiyan, Gong, Minmin, Zhang, Qiong, Huang, Xiaofei, Wan, Baojun","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.01.015","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24672,""
"Housing vouchers reduce residential crowding","Prior research shows that housing vouchers have varying price effects on different parts of the rental housing market, leading to ambiguity in their overall effect on the general housing market. Excessive crowding in homes, dubbed overcrowding, is one measure of quality of life because overcrowding can lead to adverse outcomes such as stunted child development, adverse mental health, and an increased risk in spreading infectious diseases such as COVID-19. This paper makes use of an exogenous increase in the supply of Section 8 housing vouchers in a panel setting to ascertain the effectiveness of a program provided at the federal level in tackling housing overcrowding throughout the nation. Estimation of a linear probability model shows that vouchers reduce the incidence of overcrowding: a 10% increase in the supply of vouchers reduces the likelihood a housing unit is overcrowded by 0.081 percentage points. The mechanism behind the effect is also shown to correspond to anecdotes about overcrowding: households experiencing misfortune, financial difficulties, or similar circumstances double-up with more established households, so that a voucher enables the troubled household to move into more suitable living arrangements.","Kole, Kyle","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhe.2021.101822","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Housing Economics;: 101822, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24673,""
"Maternal Self-Efficacy Buffers the Effects of COVID-19-Related Experiences on Postpartum Parenting Stress","Objective To examine the associations of maternal self-efficacy (MSE) and perceived social support with parenting stress during the postpartum period during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether these two psychosocial factors account for variance in parenting stress in addition to the effects of COVID-19-related experiences and sociodemographic factors. Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting Online survey, the Perinatal Experiences and COVID-19 Effects (PEACE) Study, launched in May 2020. Participants Participants included 310 women who gave birth in the past 24 weeks. Methods The survey included self-report quantitative measures of MSE, social support, COVID-19-related experiences, parenting stress, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a range of sociodemographic factors. Results Hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that MSE and social support were negatively associated with postpartum parenting stress in addition to the effects of COVID-19-related experiences, maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a range of demographic factors. Furthermore, MSE interacted with the COVID-19-related experiences such that higher levels of MSE mitigated the effects of the COVID-19-related experiences on parenting stress.

"Worsening physical functioning in patients with neuroinflammatory disease during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective To quantify changes in psychological wellbeing and physical function as reported by people with neurological inflammatory disease (PwNID) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods 1134 PwNID and 868 control participants were recruited through five major academic medical centers in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic U.S. beginning in April 2020. Participants completed serial surveys throughout the COVID-19 pandemic that aimed to quantify mood symptoms and physical function, analyzed cross-sectionally with a smaller cohort analyzed longitudinally. Results Throughout the pandemic, depression scores were not significantly different between PwNID and controls, although a higher proportion of PwNID reported clinically significant depression at study entry. Depression scores did not worsen over time for either group. Loneliness was the strongest predictor of worse depression, along with older age, male gender in both PwNID and controls, as well as lack of disease modifying therapy use, and disease duration in PwNID only. In contrast, physical disability worsened significantly over time for both PwNID and controls. Age, DMT status and comorbid health conditions emerged as significant predictors of physical function. Conclusions Depressive symptoms remained consistent for both PwNID and controls throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, but physical function worsened significantly over time for both groups. This is particularly impactful for PwNID, who have higher baseline levels of physical disability, and underscores the importance of reinstituting services and interventions that facilitate exercise and reconditioning for this population.","Levit, Elle, Cohen, Inessa, Dahl, Megan, Edwards, Keith, Weinstock-Guttman, Bianca, Ishikawa, Toshinari, Kavak, Katelyn, Leavitt, Victoria, Nelson, Katie, Onomichi, Kaho, Bar-Or, Amit, Perrone, Christopher, Riley, Claire, Venkatesh, Shruthi, De Jager, Philip L.; Xia, Zongqi, Longbrake, Erin E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2021.103482","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders;: 103482, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24676,""
"The impact of covid-19 on cardiovascular health behaviors in student veterans","BACKGROUND AND AIMS Pandemics have previously resulted in increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is unclear if the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will be amplified in individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease, such as military populations, resulting in augmented cardiovascular events in Veterans. The purpose of this study was to determine if traditional behavioral risk factors for cardiovascular disease are amplified due to the COVID-19 pandemic and if risk factors are more prevalent in Veterans compared to non-Veterans. METHODS AND RESULTS Thirty-two student Veterans and 46 non-Veteran students between the ages of 18 and 35 completed a Qualtrics self-report questionnaire assessing health behaviors, physical activity, and mental health both before and during COVID-19. Veterans displayed worse pre-COVID cardiovascular health behaviors such as poor sleep habits, greater use of tobacco, alcohol, and energy drinks, and lower values of social engagement compared to non-Veterans. Many health behaviors remained unchanged in student Veterans during the pandemic. The non-Veteran group exhibited augmentation of cardiovascular health behaviors during COVID-19, shown through the worsening sleep habits, increased anxiety, and reduced physical activity. CONCLUSION Student Veterans demonstrate heightened risk for cardiovascular disease based on the pre-COVID elevation of behavioral risk factors. These behavioral factors continued to remain elevated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-Veteran students displayed amplification of behavioral risk factors for cardiovascular disease due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These results highlight the need for resources and interventions for our student veterans and suggest long-term cardiovascular consequences for all students who suffered through the COVID-19 pandemic.","Canjar, Matthew R.; Richard, Dylan L.; Kappus, Rebecca M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2021.12.017","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24677,""
"Association between lifestyle and emotional aspects of food consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background and aims Adequate nutrition during infectious outbreaks require a personal management strategy, especially when there are emotional factors involved. To evaluate the association between lifestyle and emotional aspects of food consumption during the pandemic COVID-19. Methods and results Cross-sectional study using online self-applied questionnaire with 15,372 active schoolteachers who worked in primary education (kindergarten, elementary and high school) from Minas Gerais, Brazil. Poisson Regression model with robust variance was used to determine the association between lifestyle and emotional aspects and food consumption. Greater adherence to the healthy consumption profile showed a statistically significant association with decreased weight (PR= 1.58;p= 0.000), decreased physical activity (PR= 1.27;p= 0.000), reduced income, (PR= 1.26;p= 0.000), reduced alcohol consumption (PR= 1.22;p= 0.000), and changes in mental health (PR= 1.19;p= 0.000). Unhealthy consumption profile was significantly correlated with weight gain (PR= 1.54;p= 0.000), consuming more alcohol, or started drinking during the pandemic (PR= 1.44;p= 0.000), increased physical activity (PR= 1.43;p = 0.000);increased cigarette consumption (PR= 1.17;p= 0.000), and being a younger adult (PR= 1.17;p= 0.000) Conclusions: the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the food profiles of basic education teachers in the Minas Gerais state education system in a bidirectional manner, favoring the practice of consuming healthy or unhealthy foods.","de Souza Cunha, Chayze, Santâ€™Ana Haikal, DesirÃ©e, Veloso Silva, RosÃ¢ngela Ramos, de Pinho, Lucineia, Pena, GeÃ³rgia das GraÃ§as, Bicalho, Audrey Handyara, de Souza Costa Sobrinho, Paulo, Nobre, Luciana Neri","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2021.12.019","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24678,""
"Higher intakes of nutrients are linked with a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, arthritis, and depression among Korean adults","People with underlying noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are more likely to acquire severe COVID-19 disease and to die from COVID-19. An urgent need for potential therapy to prevent and control NCDs is critical. We hypothesized that higher intakes of multiple individual nutrients, fruits, or vegetables would be linked with a low risk of NCDs in the Korean population. Thus, we aim to explore the association between NCDs, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), arthritis, depression, and dietary factors. 56,462 adults aged 18 years (2009-2019) were included. Dietary factors, including intakes of multiple individual nutrients, fruits, and vegetables, were assessed. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were used to explore the associations between dietary factors and NCDs. Interactions were found between intakes of multiple individual nutrients and sex for T2DM, hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction, arthritis, and osteoarthritis. Only in women was a two-fold increase in daily multiple individual nutrient intake (vitamin A, B1, B2, B3, C, potassium, protein, phosphorus, calcium, iron, MUFA, PUFA, n-3 fatty acid, n-6 fatty acid, and water) associated with a lower prevalence of T2DM, hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction, arthritis, and osteoarthritis. In both women and men, high fruit or vegetable consumption was linked with a lower risk of T2DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, and depression than low consumption. Our findings found higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, and multiple individual nutrients are linked with a lower risk of NCDs in the Korean adult population. Further work is needed to identify whether interactions between intake of multiple individual nutrients, vegetables, and fruits affect the presence of NCDs.","Nguyen, Hai Duc, Oh, Hojin, Kim, Min-Sun","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2021.11.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Nutrition Research;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24679,""
"Moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity among adolescents in the USA during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study aimed to evaluate adolescentsâ€™ moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) during the COVID-19 pandemic by sociodemographic characteristics, and to determine mental health and resiliency factors associated with MVPA among a diverse national sample of adolescents ages 10-14 years. Data were collected during the pandemic in May 2020 from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD, N=5,153), a national prospective cohort study in the U.S. MVPA was quantified as the product of reported duration and frequency (hours per week), which was further summarized as the proportion meeting age-appropriate 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. A similar estimate was generated using MVPA data collected prior to the pandemic. Mental health and resiliency measures were collected during the pandemic. Regression models examined associations between mental health or resiliency measures and MVPA during the pandemic. Median MVPA was 2 hours per week (IQR 0, 6). Overall, the percentage of the cohort meeting MVPA guidelines decreased from 16.1% (pre-pandemic) to 8.9% during the pandemic. Racial/ethnic minorities and adolescents from lower socioeconomic backgrounds were significantly less likely to meet MVPA guidelines during the pandemic. Poorer mental health, COVID-related worry, and stress were associated with lower MVPA, while more social support and coping behaviors were associated with higher MVPA during the pandemic. In this large, national sample of adolescents, the proportion of those meeting MVPA Guidelines was lower during the COVID-19 pandemic, with significant disparities by race and socioeconomic status. Interventions to promote social support and coping behaviors may improve MVPA levels among adolescents during the pandemic.","Nagata, Jason M.; Cortez, Catherine A.; Dooley, Erin E.; Iyer, Puja, Ganson, Kyle T.; Pettee Gabriel, Kelley","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101685","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Preventive Medicine Reports;: 101685, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24680,""

"Depression and anxiety symptoms remained elevated after 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in southern Brazil: findings from the PAMPA cohort","Objective To examine the changes in depression and anxiety symptoms among Brazilian adults over 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Study design The present study used data from wave 1 (June/July, 2020) and wave 2 (December, 2020/January, 2021) of the Prospective Study About Mental and Physical Health (PAMPA) Cohort, a state-level, ambispective longitudinal study with adults from southern Brazil. The frequency of anxiety and depressive symptoms was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Anxiety and depressive symptoms before social distancing were retrospectively assessed during wave 1. Results Most of the 674 participants were classified as non-symptomatic for depressive (85.0%) and anxiety symptoms (73.2%) before the COVID-19 pandemic. At wave 1 there were increases in symptoms of depression (7.6% [95%CI: 7.2%;8.1%]) and anxiety (9.1% [95%CI: 8.6%;9.5%]). These decreased at wave 2 (depression: 6.9% [95%CI: 6.5%;7.2%];anxiety: 7.4% [95%CI: 7.1%;7.8%]) although they were still elevated compared to pre-COVID (depression: 4.5% [95%CI: 4.2%;4.8%];anxiety: 5.8% [95%CI: 5.5%;6.1%]).

"When Mosquito HV bites Biomark HD: an automated workflow for high-throughput qPCR","Automation solutions can significantly improve sample processing efficiency and can be of particular help in core facility settings. Centralized core facilities are being established world-wide aimed at strengthening institutionsâ€™ clinical and research enterprises and at addressing the need to process large volumes of samples on expensive cutting-edge technologies in a limited time. High-throughput qPCR profiling is a service offered by most genomics facilities. Several platforms have been developed to process large numbers of samples in a short time, including the Fluidigm Biomark HD, which has also been proved useful to increase the SARS-CoV-2 testing capacities. Several automation systems are currently available to miniaturize volumes and improve bioanalytical workflows, including the SPT Labtech Mosquito HV system. Here we have applied the Mosquito HV platform for the automation of the sample preparation of the Fluidigm gene expression workflow.

"Postpartum sleep health in a multiethnic cohort of women during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City","Objective/Design Cross-sectional study to examine the determinants of sleep health among postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City (NYC). Setting/Participants A subset of participants recruited as part of the COVID-19 Mother Baby Outcomes (COMBO) cohort at Columbia University (NÂ =Â 62 non-Hispanic White, NÂ =Â 17 African American, NÂ =Â 107 Hispanic). Measurements Data on maternal sleep, COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, sociodemographic, behavioral, and psychological factors were collected via questionnaire at 4 months postpartum. Self-reported subjective sleep quality, latency, duration, efficiency, disturbances, and daytime dysfunction were examined as categorical variables (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]). Associations between sleep variables and COVID-19 status, time of the pandemic, sociodemographic, behavioral, and psychological factors were estimated via independent multivariable regressions. Results Mothers who delivered between May-December 2020, who delivered after the NYC COVID-19 peak, experienced worse sleep latency, disturbances and global sleep health compared to those who delivered March-April 2020, the peak of the pandemic. Maternal depression, stress and COVID-19-related post-traumatic stress were associated with all sleep domains except for sleep efficiency. Maternal perception of infant's sleep as a problem was associated with worse global PSQI score, subjective sleep quality, duration, and efficiency. Compared to non-Hispanic White, Hispanic mothers reported worse global PSQI scores, sleep latency, duration and efficiency, but less daytime dysfunction.

"Delving the role of nutritional psychiatry to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic induced stress, anxiety and depression","Background The distressing COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on public mental health, and the importance of food and nutrients in several aspects of mental health has been recognized. People in isolation or quarantine suffer from severe stress, anger, panic attack, and anxiety. Scope and approach Although, people who have improved and progressed through medications or vaccines have reduced anxiety levels to some extent yet the efficacy of these measures, in the long run, remains a question. The review depicts that such negative emotional reactions were particularly higher in elderly individuals in the first wave than in other phases. The emotional and behavioral response to the COVID-19 pandemic is multifactorial. From different research studies, it has been found that stress scores were considerably higher for those engaging in unhealthy eating practices. This factor relies not only on external components but on personal and innate ones as well. In the present pandemic, the sustainable development of the food system would have been a major issue;this should be carefully restored to avoid a food crisis in the future. Key findings and conclusions Changes in mind-body interactions are triggered by psychosocial stresses such as interpersonal loss and social rejection. Physiological response (in terms of psychological stress) in COVID-19 affected patients varies due to individual physical health status. This review explores the relationship between nutrition and mental health as what we eat and think is interlinked with the gut-brain-axis. The role of dietary components along with the Mediterranean diet, DASH diet and use of psychobiotics in improving psychological distress in pandemic induced stress, anxiety and depression has also been discussed.","Shabbir, Muhammad Asim, Mehak, Fakiha, Khan, Zaira Mumal, Ahmed, Waqar, Haq, Syed Muhammad Abrar Ul, Khan, Moazzam Rafiq, Bhat, Zuhaib F.; Aadil, Rana Muhammad","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2021.12.035","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Trends in Food Science & Technology; 120:25-35, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24688,""
"Spatial statistical analysis of the relationship between self-reported mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown and closeness to green infrastructure","The COVID-19 pandemic has produced alterations in the behaviour and psychological health of people, who have had to learn living under uncertain circumstances escaping their control. This situation has been aggravated in those countries applying strict home confinement rules to try bending their epidemic curve. This is the case of Spain, where the stringent lockdown period was extended over three months. This study aimed at proving a research hypothesis whereby living close to Green Infrastructure (GI) during the confinement period was beneficial for mental health. To this end, La Palma (Canary Islands) and Zaragoza (Peninsular Spain) were taken as case studies, since both locations distributed a questionnaire to address citizenryâ€™s self-reported mental health under strict lockdown conditions. A spatial statistical analysis of the responses collected by these questionnaires revealed that variables such as stress, anger, medication use, alcohol consumption or visits to the doctor significantly decreased if citizens were close to GI, whereas people having very high expectations of enjoying the city after the confinement were positively correlated to proximity of green areas. Although these outcomes are limited by the inferential capacity of correlation analysis, they point out to a sense of relief derived from having visual contact with vegetated landscapes and feeling stimulated about using them for recreation, aesthetical or sporting purposes. The joint consideration of these psychological gains with the social and environmental benefits provided by GI emphasizes the importance of approaching urban regeneration through the design and implementation of interconnected green spaces.","Jato-Espino, Daniel, MoscardÃ³, Vanessa, Vallina RodrÃ­guez, Alejandro, LÃ¡zaro, Esther","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127457","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Urban Forestry & Urban Greening; 68:127457, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24689,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on persons with epilepsy in uganda: a descriptive cross-sectional study","Objective To evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the disease course, lives and psychosocial wellbeing of persons with epilepsy (PWE) in Uganda. Methods From April 2021 till May 2021, we carried out a descriptive cross-sectional study at four hospitals located in four regions of Uganda. PWE presenting at the study sites were offered a structured questionnaire in the local language. We used the PHQ-9 questionnaire to screen for depression and the GAD-7 to screen for anxiety. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with anxiety and depression. Results A total of 370 responses were collected. The median age of the respondents was 20.5 years (IQR 15-29), and 51.9% were males. During the lockdown period, the seizure frequency increased in 87 (23.5%) PWE. Various forms of physical and psychological violence were inflicted upon 106 (28.6%) PWE. Fifty-eight (15.7%) screened positive for anxiety and 65 (17.6%) positive for depression. Both increased seizure frequency and experienced violence were associated with experiencing depression and anxiety. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown impacted seizure frequency and the psychosocial wellbeing of PWE in Uganda. Increased seizure frequency was associated with higher rates of anxiety and depression. This underlines the importance of continued follow-up of PWE and a low threshold to screen for depression, anxiety and domestic violence.","Gumisiriza, Nolbert, Kamoen, Olivia, Boven, Annelies, Dusabimana, Alfred, Nono, Denis, Musisi, Seggane, Colebunders, Robert","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108536","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Epilepsy & Behavior;: 108536, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24690,""
"The Rohingya refugees: a conceptual framework of their psychosocial adversities, cultural idioms of distress and social suffering","Rohingya refugees, a group of religious and ethnic minorities, primarily reside in the South Asian nations. With decades of displacement, forced migration, limited freedom of movement, violence and oppression, they have been termed by the United Nations (UN) as the 'most persecuted minority group' in world history. Literature shows an increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, insomnia, etc., in this population. However, beyond 'medicalisation', the psychosocial challenges of the Rohingyas need to be understood through the lens of 'social suffering', which results from a complex interplay of multiple social, political, environmental and geographical factors. Lack of essential living amenities, poverty, unemployment, overcrowding, compromised social identity, and persistent traumatic stressors lead to inequality, restricted healthcare access, human rights deprivation and social injustice in this group. Even though the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has taken a renewed interest in Rohingya re-establishment with well-researched standards of care, there are several pragmatic challenges in their implementation and inclusion in policies. This paper reviews these multi-dimensional psychosocial challenges of the Rohingyas by synthesising various intersecting conceptual models including minority stress, health-stigma-discrimination framework, refugee ecological model and capability approach. Furthermore, it highlights multidisciplinary interventions to mitigate these adversities, improve their living situation and eventually foster healing via means which are culturally relevant and contextually appropriate. These interventions need to involve various stakeholders from a human rights and dignity based lens, including the voices of the Rohingyas and supported by more research in this area.","Sudheer, N.; Banerjee, D.","https://doi.org/10.1017/gmh.2021.43","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Global Mental Health; 8:15, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24691,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression in community-dwelling older adults: a prospective cohort study","Background There are growing concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of older adults. We examined the effect of the pandemic on the risk of depression in older adults. Methods We analyzed data from the prospective cohort study of Korean older adults, which has been followed every 2 years. Among the 2308 participants who completed both the third and the fourth follow-up assessments, 58.4% completed their fourth follow-up before the outbreak of COVID-19 and the rest completed it during the pandemic. We conducted face-to-face diagnostic interviews using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and used Geriatric Depression Scale. We performed generalized estimating equations and logistic regression analyses. Results The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased depressive symptoms in older adults [b (standard error) = 0.42 (0.20), p = 0.040] and a doubling of the risk for incident depressive disorder even in euthymic older adults without a history of depression (odds ratio = 2.44, 95% confidence interval 1.18-5.02, p = 0.016). Less social activities, which was associated with the risk of depressive disorder before the pandemic, was not associated with the risk of depressive disorder during the pandemic. However, less family gatherings, which was not associated with the risk of depressive disorder before the pandemic, was associated with the doubled risk of depressive disorder during the pandemic. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic significantly influences the risk of late-life depression in the community. Older adults with a lack of family gatherings may be particularly vulnerable.","Oh, D.

"Expanding the Constructs of Grief and Loss in Capturing the Human Experience: Essential Workers in the Meatpacking Industry and the Pandemic","In this unprecedented (Corona Virus Disease) COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists from every country are faced with the challenge of dealing with the myriad grief and losses that are affecting the mental health of many people. Among the many who are suffering are ""essential workers"" in the United States meatpacking industry, who are forced to make a choice between working in an unsafe environment or becoming unemployed with no benefits. Many of these workers are people of color (POC) who encounter unrecognized challenges related to their contextual factors and intersectional identities. This article will discuss contextual and intersectional grief and losses experienced by these ""essential workers"" and how the confluence of their intersectional identities intensifies their pandemic grief and loss. Clinical implications include expansion of the definition of grief and loss beyond death to include experiences that are shaped by extensive contextual factors, work, and intersectional identities that have psychological and mental health implications. Special attention will be given to naming losses to identify the grief, followed by meaning-making and meaning-finding to adapt to changes in mourning. Finally, the addition of grief and loss training requirement to APA programs is advocated to further the values of social justice and incorporation of multiculturalism in the field. Public Significance Statement This article spotlights the grief and loss experienced by workers in the meatpacking industry, who were deemed as ""essential workers"" during the pandemic. For more effective treatment, it suggests that in tandem with pandemic grief and loss, therapists also explore the different types of grief and losses these workers experience based on their specific contexts and multiple identities that may include some dimensions such as race, culture, gender, social class, sexuality, age, and immigration status.","Kim, J.

"Global Health, Human Rights, and Neoliberalism: The Need for Structural Frameworks When Addressing Mental Health Disparities","In this paper we argue that the field of psychology-and the psy-disciplines generally-need to embrace an interdisciplinary approach if they are to be relevant and contribute to global social justice initiatives. We focus on two such initiatives: The Global Mental Health movement and calls for increasing access to mental health services for immigrants. We suggest that a stronger focus on the upstream causes of ill-health, a deeper appreciation for the ways in which neoliberalism deflects attention away from these upstream determinants, and a greater engagement with the field of human rights and other disciplines will lead to more substantive gains in population mental health. Public Significance Statement This paper discusses the ways in which neoliberal ideology advances the medicalization of distress, by emphasizing individual responsibility. For immigrants, refugees, and asylum-seekers, increasing the provision of psychological services and/or psychotropic drugs in response to structural violence is an insufficient response by the psy-disciplines. Committing to an interdisciplinary and human rights approach to Global Mental Health and to immigrant and refugee health issues will allow us to advance psychology's social justice initiatives.","Herrawi, F.; Logan, J.; Cheng, C.

"Harnessing Virtual Reality for Disaster Mental Health: A Systematic Review","Widespread disasters, such as hurricanes, terrorist attacks, and viral outbreaks, represent a unique class of stressors that increase the demand for mental health care but also limit access to services. During the course of COVID-19, an unprecedented global pandemic, the detrimental effects of fear, uncertainty, and social isolation have particularly strained existing structures for psychological care. Virtual reality (VR) represents a promising means to address this still-growing need. Although VR has been applied in medical settings for decades, no existing literature has synthesized the strength of empirical support for VR's acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy in the context of disaster mental health. In an attempt to fill this urgent need, the present systematic review summarizes the findings of 21 diverse studies of VR as a tool for disaster-related psychological resilience training, psychological first aid, or counseling. With an eye toward VR's potential utility to address the incredible need for services created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we offer recommendations for key future directions and methodological considerations in the context of disaster mental health.","Boydstun, C.

We aimed to describe the characteristics of children more severely affected and our clinical approach. We retrospectively collected clinical, treatment, and early outcomes data during a 3-month period in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. Twelve children who fulfilled the Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health case definition were hospitalized, seven needed PICU admission. Median age was 13 years and three were overweight, with no other comorbidity. All had positive immunoglobulin G antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. All presented with prolonged fever, asthenia, hypotension, and shock. Other prominent symptoms were abdominal complaints and rash. All patients had leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and marked elevation of inflammatory markers. Cardiac involvement was observed in all patients with elevated levels of troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide along with left ventricular hypokinesis. Depressed left ventricular function was observed in four patients. All patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone, low-dose aspirin, and vasoactive medications. Four patients received prophylactic enoxaparin. All patients needed supplementary oxygen;however, high-flow oxygen therapy and noninvasive ventilatory support with positive end-expiratory pressure were required in three and two patients, respectively. Five patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. The mean duration of PICU stay was 7.1 days. The median Pediatric Risk of Mortality-III score was 9 and no mortality was observed. PIMS-TS demands a prompt and multidisciplinary approach. Risk factors, best clinical pathway, and long-term complications are still unknown.","Miranda, J.; Grilo, M.; Baptista, C.; Melo, A. R.

"The impact of Covid-19 on Belgian mental health care: A Delphi study among psychosocial health professionals, patients, and informal caretakers","The Covid-19 pandemic is primarily viewed as a threat to physical health, and therefore, biomedical sciences have become an integral part of the public discourse guiding policy decisions. Nonetheless, the pandemic and the measures implemented have an impact on the population's psychosocial health. The impact of Covid-19 on the psychosocial care system should be thoroughly investigated to mitigate this effect. In this context, the present study was conducted to establish a consensus about the impact of Covid-19 on psychosocial health and the care system in Belgium. Using the Belgian Superior Health Council's expert database, a three-round Delphi consensus development process was organized with psychosocial experts (i.e., professionals, patients, and informal caregiver representatives). Overall, 113 of the 148 experts who participated in round 1 fully completed round 2 (76% response rate). Consensus (defined as &gt;70% agreement and an interquartile interval (IQR) of no more than 2) was reached in round 2 for all but three statements. Fifty experts responded to round 3 by providing some final nuances, but none of them reaffirmed their positions or added new points to the discussion (44.25% response rate). The most robust agreement (&gt;80%) was found for three statements: the pandemic has increased social inequalities in society, which increase the risk of long-term psychosocial problems;the fear of contamination creates a constant mental strain on the population, wearing people out;and there is a lack of strategic vision about psychosocial care and an underestimation of the importance of psychosocial health in society. Our findings show that experts believe the psychosocial impact of Covid-19 is underappreciated, which has a negative impact on psychosocial care in Belgium. Several unmet needs were identified, but so were helpful resources and barriers. The Delphi study's overarching conclusion is that the pandemic does not affect society as a whole in the same way or with the same intensity. The experts, thereby, warn that the psychosocial inequalities in society are on the rise.","Van den Cruyce, N.; Van Hoof, E.; Godderis, L.; Gerard, S.; Van Leuven, F.","https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-01008-0","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Humanities & Social Sciences Communications; 8(1):9, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24697,""

"Remote learning and its implications toward study-life conflicts and the mental health of university students: does studying at home or campus matter?","University students learning remotely from various locations has initiated a unique challenge for higher education institutions (HEIs), especially in managing both teaching and students' wellbeing amidst the COVID-19 pandemic due to the increased conflicts that occur when juggling study and life demands. However, little discussion is available to understand how remote learning influences the occurrence of study-life conflicts among students and its consequence to their mental health. Little evidence is also found regarding the role of students' residency status in influencing this relationship. Hence, a study to address both shortcomings was conducted using a sample of 1005 university students in Malaysia. Findings suggested that studying remotely was related to greater occurrences of study-life conflicts, which adversely impacted the students' mental health. Overall, study-to-life conflict had a greater influence on mental health as compared to life-to-study conflict. However, residency status did not moderate the relationship between study-life conflicts and mental health, indicating that students experienced the same level of mental health issues regardless of where they were staying. The findings offer valuable insights and suggestions on how to improve remote learning practices and student wellbeing services during and post pandemic period.","Badri, S. K.

"Posttraumatic stress phenomena in critical illness and intensive care survivors","The intensive care unit (ICU) within a hospital is typically thought of as a place for the provision of patient care for a life-threatening emergency. Less frequently do we consider it an integral part of disaster response. The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health disaster that has caused surges of critically ill patients requiring treatment in intensive care units (ICUs). However, it is important to bear in mind that survival of a critical illness can come at a cost, including to mental health. Being critically ill and requiring life-saving treatments is extremely stressful, and survivors frequently have substantial decrements in physical functioning, cognition, and emotional health. Remarkably, one in five critical illness survivors has clinically significant symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Risk factors, or markers of risk, include prior anxiety and depression, high doses of sedative medications in the intensive care unit (ICU), memories of nightmare-like experiences in the ICU, and emotional distress in early recovery. As with PTSD in other contexts, social support is a protective factor. ICU follow-up clinics, in-ICU psychological interventions, ICU diaries, post-ICU telephonic and computer-based cognitive-behavioral interventions, and virtual reality interventions all show promise in preventing long-term PTSD in critical illness survivors, perhaps particularly in those with substantial emotional distress in early recovery. However, awareness regarding this problem is still growing, as are changes to post-ICU care delivery. Hopefully, improved awareness on the part of the psychiatric community will help with recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic disaster.","Bienvenu, O.

"Hair, machines, sanitary pads and diary: The sentimental intimacy of truth during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has been unfolding in the age of post-truth. Named as 2016's word of the year by the Oxford Dictionary, post-truth is defined as ""relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief"" (Mcintyre 2018, p. 5). This article considers the enduring - if not intensified - feeling of and for truth in the face of the uncertainties and competing narratives of the pandemic. As I will show, this feeling of and for truth takes a specific affective expression, which I call sentimental intimacy. Zooming in on four case studies in the Chinese context - cutting or shaving off female nurses' hair, machines and workers at hospital construction sites, the shortage of sanitary pads, and the controversy over Fang Fang's diary - I argue that the sentimental intimacy of truth concerns an irreducible attachment to an imagined inside whose close/d-ness undergoes constant negotiation.","Xin, L.","https://doi.org/10.1080/10130950.2021.1996775","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Agenda-Empowering Women for Gender Equity;: 11, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24702,""

Family Foundations (FF), a 10-week couple/parent-based intervention targeting parent mental health, conflict and co-parenting was delivered via video-conferencing during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to: (1) explore parents' and clinicians' experiences and perceived benefits of FF, and (2) assess pre-post intervention changes in parent mental health, interparental conflict and co-parenting behaviour. A mixed methods evaluation was conducted with 62 families with young children experiencing parent mental health difficulties and/or parental conflict. Qualitative interviews with parents and FF clinicians were conducted, and intervention outcomes were assessed using mother-report surveys. Maternal stress and anxiety symptoms decreased and co-parenting support and parenting warmth increased following FF. Parents expressed high satisfaction with FF despite the perceived limited cultural and family structure diversity in the videos. Although some activities were modified and clinicians were more directive in their style of delivery, FF was implemented with fidelity. Importantly, telehealth delivery made FF accessible to meet the needs of families during the pandemic when in-person services were not available. These findings will inform further development and evaluation of telehealth FF during community-wide crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Giallo, R.; Fogarty, A.; Seymour, M.; Skinner, L.; Savopoulos, P.; Bereznicki, A.; Talevski, T.; Ruthven, C.; Bladon, S.; Goldfeld, S.; Brown, S.

"Innovative Play-Based Strategies for Teletherapy","An accelerated need for effective and accessible therapy for children has become more evident in 2020 by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) pandemic. This global health crisis has exacerbated an existing mental health care crisis for children, particularly for those of color and low income who have a history of being disproportionately underserved. Teletherapy may address some of the barriers that prevent many children from receiving mental health services. Play-based strategies can be creatively integrated in teletherapy to maintain a relational, developmentally appropriate, and evidence-based approach to working with children in a virtual setting. In this article, creative ways to facilitate virtual play-based strategies are provided. Specific information about set-up, accessibility, selectability, scaffolding technology, developmental and cultural considerations, limit setting, and documentation for virtual sessions is discussed. Access to creative and theoretically informed teletherapy practices will strengthen the mental health response needed to reduce disparities in care.","Bolton, C. A.; Thompson, H.; Spring, J.

Method: Participants completed online questionnaires to assess PA and MH. Results: No difference in MH was identified between LGBQAP and heterosexual participants prior to lockdown, however LGBQAP participants reported significantly worse mental health during lockdown. No group differences were found in PA, but all participants exhibited a decline in PA during lockdown. Conclusion: This study highlights the differential impact of social restrictions on marginalized populations.","Mullin, E. M.; Hutchinson, J. C.; Mellano, K. T.; Bird, J. M.; Karageorghis, C.

"Children's indoor and outdoor play as potential correlates of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran: a brief report on national survey","Over the past 16 months, Iranian children have had their schools closed. Prolonged COVID-19-related restrictions and limited play activities can have significant mental health consequences in children. Using a cross-sectional design, a sample of Iranian parents (n = 1182) of children aged between 5 and 11 years completed an online survey including: Children's Play Scale (CPS), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form (I-PANAS-SF), and the Strength and Difficulties Questionaries (SDQ). Parents reported that their child spent significantly longer time playing outside at home and inside at home than anywhere else. Children were also reported to spend the minimum number of hours at indoor play centres, near water, green spaces, and playgrounds. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 context, significant declines in outdoor play activities during the pandemic were reported for 83% of children. Findings revealed that there are significant but small negative correlation between mental health difficulties and total CPS scores (r = -.427, p &lt; .0001). Correlations of CPS scores with Positive and Negative affect were weak but significant (r = .211, and r = -.294, respectively;p &lt; .0001). Results indicate that it is necessary to find strategies to increase children's outdoor play activities, especially when they return to their schools with wider-spread social and emotional needs than before.","Rajabi, M.; Afrooz, G.

"Creative Hobbies as a Protective Factor Against Stress During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Older Adults","The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically impacted our way of life, leading to increased rates of anxiety and depression (Panchal et al., 2021). The implications may be worse for older adults who account for 80% of all COVID deaths (Freed et al., 2020). Meanwhile, prior to the pandemic, Adams-Price and colleagues (2018) found that creative hobby participation provided slightly different benefits for middle-aged and older adults. Specifically, evidence suggested that middle-aged adults may use their creative hobby more for stress relief than older adults. Using a sample of 239 women, aged 40 to 84 years old (M = 59.7), we examined whether the degree to which viewing oneâ€™s creative hobby as a component of oneâ€™s identity related to perceived stress, health anxiety, and depressive symptoms. In addition, we wanted to know whether these relationships were moderated by age. Single moderation models suggest that viewing oneâ€™s creative hobby as a part of their identity was related to higher health anxiety and reporting more depressive symptoms. In addition, age was related to reporting lower perceived stress, health anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Lastly, age provided a significant moderation effect to the relationship between degree of identity associated with oneâ€™s creative hobby and perceived stress such that middle-aged adults with a high degree of identification with their creative hobby reported the most perceived stress while older adults with a high degree of identification with their creative hobby reported the least perceived stress. Implications for older adultâ€™s well-being and adaptiveness to the COVID-19 pandemic will be discussed.","Israel, Sarah, Mackenstadt, Darby, Adams-Price, Carolyn","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.051","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):14-14, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24712,""
"Understanding the Complexities of Community-Dwelling Older Adultsâ€™ Lived Experiences During COVID-19","Since December 2019, COVID-19 has spurred rapid and extensive research, but this research has focused on some perspectives with others understudied. In particular, studies have not yet explored the complexities of community-dwelling older adultsâ€™ lived experiences during the pandemic. This study aimed to address this gap. Community-dwelling older adults living in Central Texas (N = 200;age, 65â€“92 years, M = 73.6Â± 6.33) responded to open- and closed-ended questions over the telephone during Juneâ€“August 2020. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. We identified three key themes. (1) Positive experiences, with 4 subthemes: perception that the pandemic has not changed oneâ€™s lifestyle;adjusting wellâ€”particularly with the aid of technology;being positive in perspective;and a â€œloner advantageâ€ (being a â€œlonerâ€ pre-pandemic was advantageous during the pandemic). (2) Mixed experiences, with 4 subthemes: doing okay but unhappy about changing lifestyle routines;doing okay but unhappy about loss of in-person interactions with family and friends;doing okay but frustrated by witnessing absence of social distancing or facemask use by others;and maintaining physical health with fluctuating symptoms of depression or anxiety. (3) Negative experiences, with 3 subthemes: bitter about others/society/government not caring for older adults;feeling isolated, bored, and powerless;and worsening as time goes by. A thematic map was subsequently developed. These findings reveal the complexities of community-dwelling older adultsâ€™ lived experiences, illustrating effective coping and resilience during the pandemic and dissatisfaction owing to the pandemicâ€™s effects on their lives and to their observations of othersâ€™ behaviors.","Xie, Bo, Shiroma, Kristina, de Main, Atami Sagna, Davis, Nathan, Fingerman, Karen, Danesh, Valerie","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.052","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):14-14, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24713,""
"Using Ecological and Twitter-Based Assessments to Examine Impacts in Temporal and Community Context","In March 2020, Bronx County (NY) saw one of the first U.S. COVID-19 outbreaks. This outbreak coincided with the ongoing Einstein Aging Study (EAS), which involved older adults living in Bronx County completing annual two-week intensive data collection â€œbursts.â€ Thus, it serves as a natural experiment to study pre-COVID to early pandemic-related changes in the daily well-being of participants who were at risk both due to their age and their location. We examined within-person change in self-reported negative thoughts, affect, stress, and loneliness from a subsample of 78 EAS participants. Participantsâ€™ data from a two-week â€œburstâ€ of momentary surveys during 2019 were compared with their data from the corresponding timeframe during the early COVID-19 period (February-June 2020). Personality and mild cognitive impairment were examined as predictors of change. Average momentary loneliness significantly increased from 2019 to 2020. Participants with greater neuroticism increased more in thought unpleasantness and depressed feelings. To understand the community context, community distress markers were analyzed using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based assessments of public Twitter posts from Bronx County during the same periods. These Twitter posts also showed a surge of COVID-related topics at the onset of the Bronx outbreak. Language analysis showed a 2019-2020 increase in Bronx community markers of anxiety, depressivity, and negatively-valenced affect extracted from Twitter. We observed 2019-2020 change in both individualsâ€™ well-being (via intensive reports) and in their communities (via Twitter). Contextualizing these with the increased COVID-19 discussion online suggests that these may reflect common pandemic effects.","Bouklas, Isabella, Ferguson, Giselle, Pasquini, Giancarlo, Vu, Huy, Zamani, Mohammadzaman, Zhaoyang, Ruixue, Scott, Stacey, Schwartz, H.

"Everyday Life Experiences of Swedes Age 70+ During the COVID-19 Pandemic","As many other countries Sweden has been hit hard by the Corona pandemic, with high numbers of dead in the older population. Since march 16, 2020, the authorities have encouraged people 70+ to voluntarily quarantine and avoid contacts outside the household. How has this affected older peopleâ€™s everyday lives? This study reports on results from a web-survey on the everyday life experiences of Swedes 70+ carried out between May 28 and July 13, 2020 (n=1 926). The presentation focuses answers to an open-ended question: â€œDescribe with your own words how your life has been affected by the Corona pandemicâ€. A qualitative content analysis was used to investigate changes in the everyday lives of the respondents and their appreciations of these changes. Results show that older Swedes have mostly adhered to public recommendations of self-isolation and withdrawn from social and family contacts, as well as paid and volunteer work. The vast majority (76%) of the respondents describe what they see as negative life changes, such as loss of structure in their everyday life, loss of contact with children/grandchildren and friends, loss of meaningful activities, loss of abilities due to forced unemployment and experiences of ageism. Experiences of loneliness, depression and drop in quality of life are common. Some positive changes were reported. We argue that the experience of the 70+ population during Corona needs to be understood in relation to the promise of the third age, where everyday restrictions are experienced as a forced disengagement into a fourth age life style.","Bildtgard, Torbjorn, Ã–berg, Peter","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.079","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):23-23, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24715,""
"Information Seeking During the Pandemic: The Role of Age, Agency, and Fake News Concerns","COVID-19 brought rapid changes to the way in which people understand and process news, including both information and misinformation about the pandemic. This cross-sectional study was designed to examine personsâ€™ experiences during the earliest months of the pandemic. The sample included 871 adults ages 20-79 (M=38.27 years, SD=11.40). Online surveys were collected between March and May, 2020 using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants completed a series of questionnaires, including a measure of agency from the Midlife Development Inventory, a questionnaire that assessed level of skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e. fake news beliefs), a depression scale, a question about their level of anxiety about developing COVID-19, and questions about the frequency in which they sought information about the pandemic from different sources (e.g., TV, social media). A multiple regression using information seeking frequency as the outcome variable revealed several significant relationships. Specifically, younger adults, people with higher agency, and people with higher fake news beliefs all reported higher levels of COVID-19-related information seeking. In addition, there was a significant 3-way interaction between age, agency, and fake news beliefs. Disentangling this interaction revealed that older adults with low agency were least likely to engage in information seeking. There were, however, no age differences in information seeking in participants with high agency and fake news beliefs, but large age differences in participants with low agency but high fake news beliefs. Findings suggest agency is an important predictor of information seeking behavior, particularly for older adults with high levels of skepticism about the pandemic.","Pearman, Ann, Hughes, MacKenzie, Coblenz, Clara","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.080","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):23-23, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24716,""
"Moving Online: Evidence-Based Programming During COVID","The COVID pandemic disrupted the way evidence-based health promotion programs (EBPs) are delivered to older adults who were the most at-risk group in terms of mortality and faced unprecedented threats to their independence and physical and mental health. Many organizations stopped in-person EBPS causing older adults to lose access to key social networks and health resources. It is a top public health priority to find new ways to keep older adults connected to their EBPs. Fit & Strong! (F&S!) is a group exercise/health education EBP for older adults with arthritis offered by CBOs in 32 states. CBOs stopped offering F&S! in-person in March 2020. Since the lockdown, we have worked closely with our provider network to develop and pilot a version that is remote/online and live, titled â€œF&S! @Homeâ€. Instructors deliver F&S! @Home to older adults with minimal technological resources. We created a staging website for both providers/instructors and participants that is used to initiate the classes, enable providers to manage participants, collect data, and share support materials. The pilot began September 2020;since that time 15 classes have been offered to 147 participants. Administration on Community Living falls and arthritis outcomes data are being collected. Preliminary analyses of 45 participants and 8 instructors demonstrate a high rating of the program (mean score of 90.2 out of 100) with no adverse outcomes to date.

"Optimizing the Geriatric Mental Health Workforce Through Innovative Approaches","The drastic demand for geriatrics-trained providers in medical and mental healthcare persists years after the Institute of Medicine first highlighted this need (2008;2012). New innovative approaches must instead optimize the current workforce through leveraging existing geriatric expertsâ€™ knowledge and skills related to working aging adults. This symposium will highlight four approaches spanning post-licensure education to using technology to deliver specialized services and training. First, Dr. Gregg will discuss the evaluation of an advanced topics workshop in Geropsychology which has significantly enhanced depth of Geropsychology competencies for psychologists working in primarily rural areas. Next, Dr. Asghar-Ali will describe the multi-modal interactive geriatric educational opportunities for interprofessional staff developed by the South East Texas Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program (SETx GWEP). He will discuss how these training opportunities have been tailored to address the impact of COVID-19 and healthcare disparities among older adults. Third, Dr. Filips will present an evaluation of a consultation model in which a geriatric psychiatrist provides tele-consultation in a 5-state region to rural aging Veterans with complex medical and behavioral comorbidities. Finally, Dr. Beaudreau will describe adaptations to a national VA Problem Solving Training program for mental health clinicians of older Veterans with complex comorbidities. Dr. Karel, VA National Geriatric Mental Health Director, will serve as discussant and comment on the ways in which these novel approaches are meeting the ever-growing need for competent geriatric mental health providers.","Alfaro, Ana Jessica, Rodriguez, Rachel, Karel, Michele","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.106","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):29-30, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24718,""

This presentation will summarize PST implementation adaptations during COVID-19, and compare Veteran treatment outcomes before (2019) and during COVID-19 (2020). Sixty-one clinicians attended a workshop and small-group consultation for two training cases. Consultants provided ongoing feedback to program leadership about pandemic-related implementation challenges. Program adaptations during COVID-19 addressed challenges related to delivering treatment by telephone, video, or in-person and recruitment barriers. Veterans in both cohorts (N = 122) had significant reductions in mental health symptoms from baseline to posttreatment in paired t-test comparisons (ps &lt; .01).

"Social Connection in Times of Physical Distancing","COVID-19 has been especially devastating to older adults. To prevent the spread of the virus, physical distancing has become the norm. As a result, there are fewer opportunities available for face-to-face interaction and social activities, which may be particularly harmful to older adults, given their existing loneliness levels. Thus, this symposium brings together a collection of papers that exemplify the interplay of social connection, activities, and mental health outcomes among older adults facing loneliness. The first paper will discuss how activity diversity is linked to higher loneliness and depressive symptoms among heterosexual and LGBTQ older adults. The second paper will present findings on the changes in social connectedness due to physical distancing and their associated impact on the mental health outcomes among older adults. The third paper will present qualitative findings on the effect of physical distancing on older adults' social connectedness using a mixed-method study. The final paper discusses the challenges faced by older adults in their use of digital media for social connection in the present pandemic and highlights some of the population's untapped strengths, which can be leveraged to help them live prosperous online lives. All papers will address practical tips and recommendations for actions, which key stakeholders can take to support older adults during the pandemic. The discussant, Dr. Kahana, will integrate the four papers and highlight the potential and limits of the current effort to address these issues and consider future inquiry routes.","Lee, Jeongeun","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.132","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):36-36, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24721,""
"Can We Replace Our Human Connection With Technology?","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to social distancing protocols, subsequently increasing social isolation for older adults. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between social connectedness and mental health outcomes. Leveraging NHATS, a nationally representative study (n = 2,558, Mage = 79.20, SDage = 6.25), we examined the association between the method of social connectedness and mental health outcomes. Descriptive analyses revealed older adults are using various methods (e.g., in-person, phone, and video calls) to remain connected with their social networks during COVID-19. Findings from all of the linear regression analyses indicated phone or video calls are associated with negative affect, whereas in-person visits are associated with lower levels of negative affect. These findings suggest substituting in-person visits with video calls or phones may not be sufficient to relieve their loneliness and negative affect. Future studies should investigate this effect on physical or emotional health outcomes.","Cone, Nicholas, Lee, Jeongeun","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.134","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):36-36, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24722,""
"Social Connection Planning for Lonely or Socially Isolated Older Adults","Social connections are important for maintaining health and well-being with age. Behavioral interventions to promote connectedness hold promise, but there is limited evidence to guide effective modifications in the context of physical distancing or quarantine restrictions, such as those required during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present evidence for a brief (1-2 session) social connection intervention, â€œConnections Planning,â€ to enhance social connectedness for older adults. We first describe a cognitive-behavioral model of loneliness, which served as the framework for developing the intervention. We then present two case examples to demonstrate the application of the intervention with older adults in a community mental health clinic during physical distancing restrictions. Finally, we present initial findings from a pilot study to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention delivered remotely with up to 10 community-dwelling older adults who endorse clinically significant loneliness.

Less is known how coping has changed for older adults after experiencing months-long pandemic precautions. We explore differences in coping between the initial pandemic declaration in March 2020, and 9 months later, via an internet survey fielded in November 2020 (n= 781). We present summary data, using chi-square tests for subgroup analyses. A majority of respondents (aged M=66 yrs, range 60-89) were women (64%) and White (94%). When asked to compare their feelings to the beginning of the pandemic, 44.8% were more frustrated, 38.7% were more stressed, and 32.7% were more anxious. However, 38.3% were more appreciative. Women were significantly more likely than men to report increases in feeling frustrated, angry, scared, stressed, sad, and hopeless. Introverts were significantly more likely than extroverts to report an increase in loneliness and stress. Since the first few weeks of the pandemic, respondents reported more communication through video calls (45.2%), texting (40.2%), and phone calls (28.8%). Additionally, 61.5% spent more time on computers/tablets, 47.2% spent more time watching TV, and 24.5% spent more time praying. Extroverts were significantly more likely than introverts to report an increase in time with TV, phones, and computers/tablets. Women were significantly more likely than men to report increased texting and praying. These data provide further understanding of the impact of long-term pandemic precautions on older adults and suggest particular subgroups of older adults may benefit from public health and mental health interventions.","Emerson, Kerstin, Kim, Deborah, Mois, George, Beer, Jenay","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.137","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):37-37, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24724,""
"Social Isolation and Well-Being Among Middle-Age and Older Adults: Before and During the COVID-19 Outbreak","This symposium brings together five studies that examined the relationship between social isolation and well-being. Two used pre-COVID data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). One aimed to identify patterns of social isolation trajectory in a 9-year period, where social isolation was conceptualized as a multidimensional construct. It identified four distinct patterns, and the pattern had a gradient relationship with health outcomes. Another examined the association between self-perceptions of aging (SPA) and social well-being among older adults. It found that positive SPA predicted increased social connectedness and reduced loneliness in four years. Two other studies were based on a longitudinal survey (COVID-19 Coping Survey) that began in April 2020. One reports that adults 55+ with comorbidity at pandemic onset had persistently elevated depressive symptoms in a 6-month period, regardless of their social isolation level. Another paper suggests that physical isolation at pandemic onset was associated with elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness throughout the following six months. The fifth paper was based on two-wave dataâ€”2019 survey and 2020 COVID supplementâ€”from the National Aging and Health Trend Study (NAHTS). It found that older adults who were very socially isolated and completely homebound before the pandemic experienced less psychological distress during the outbreak than those who were very socially integrated and not homebound. The five studies highlight the multiple dimensions of social isolation, their antecedents and development over time, and their role in shaping mental health in a pandemic context.","Li, Lydia","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.141","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):38-38, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24725,""
"Associations Between Comorbidity and Depressive Symptoms During COVID-19: Variation by Social Isolation?","Adults with comorbidities are at high COVID-19 risk and may experience elevated depressive symptoms during the pandemic. We aimed to investigate the associations between comorbidity at pandemic onset and subsequent depressive symptoms and whether social isolation modified this association. Data were from monthly online questionnaires in the COVID-19 Coping Study of US adults aged =55 from April/May-September/October 2020 (n=4,383). Depressive symptoms were measured by the 8-item CES-D, and social isolation as â€œhighâ€ vs. â€œlowâ€ based on contact with family, friends, social organizations, and living alone. In multivariable mixed-effects models, comorbidity (=2 vs. &lt;2 chronic conditions) was associated with greater depressive symptoms at baseline (ÃŸ=0.50;95% CI: 0.36-0.64), this association varied negligibly by social isolation. Differences in depressive symptoms by comorbidity status at pandemic onset were consistent over the six-month follow-up. This study indicates that middle-aged and older US adults with comorbidities experienced persistently elevated depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cheng, Jianjia, Kobayashi, Lindsay","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.144","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):39-39, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24726,""
"Physical Isolation and Mental Health Among Older US Adults in the COVID-19 Coping Study","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has set an urgent need to understand the impact of physical isolation on mental health. We aimed to investigate the relationships between physical isolation during the period when many US states had shelter-in-place orders (April-May 2020) and subsequent longitudinal trajectories of mental health in middle-aged and older adults (aged 55+, N=3,978) over a six-month follow-up (April to October 2020). We used population and attrition-weighted multivariable linear mixed-effects models. At baseline, 7 days/week of physical isolation (vs. 0 days/week) was associated with elevated depressive symptoms (ÃŸ=0.82;95% CI: 0.04-1.60), and all of 1-3, 4-6, and 7 days/week of physical isolation (vs. 0 days/week) were associated with elevated anxiety symptoms and loneliness. Physical isolation was not associated with changes in mental health symptoms over time. These findings highlight the need to prioritize opportunities for in-person connection for middle-aged and older adults when safe to do so.","Joseph, Carly, O'Shea, Brendan, Finlay, Jessica, Kobayashi, Lindsay","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.145","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):39-39, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24727,""
"Pre-Pandemic Social Isolation: Protection or Vulnerability in the Time of COVID?","How do older adults at risk of social isolation before the pandemic fare during the COVID-19 outbreak? Using data from two waves (Round 9 [2019] and COVID-19 Supplement) of the National Health and Aging Trend Study (NHATS), we examined the relationship between pre-pandemic social isolation and psychological distress during the outbreak among community-living older adults (age 65+). Results show that the most socially integrated respondents had more PTSD (ÃŸ=1.47, SE=.37, p&lt;.001) and depression/anxiety (ÃŸ=.34, SE=.11, p=.002) symptoms than the most isolated. Older adults who were not homebound had more PTSD (ÃŸ=2.0, SE= .76, p=.01) and depression/anxiety (ÃŸ=1.05, SE=.20, p&lt;.001) than the completely homebound. With shelter-in-place and social distancing requirements, older adults who have been socially active and integrated may experience high-stress levels and may need extra support to adjust to the changes. Relatively, those who have been very isolated and homebound may experience fewer changes in their lives.","Li, Lydia","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.146","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):39-39, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24728,""
"A Transitional Care Model for Veterans With Complex Needs During COVID: The Behavioral Recovery Outreach (BRO) Team","The Veterans Health Administrationâ€™s Care for Patients with Complex Problems (CP)2 Program developed a national infrastructure to disseminate promising practice models to improve care for Veterans with complex medical, mental health, and/or neurocognitive conditions, who may also have behaviors disruptive to care. A strategic priority is improving safe and effective transitions to community care for Veterans with complex care needs, many of whom have historically been limited to VA settings as a result of behavioral concerns. The Behavioral Recovery Outreach (BRO) Team was the first model identified for national dissemination and evaluation at partner sites. Developed at VA Central Iowa, BRO is an interdisciplinary team model that identifies Veterans in long-term VA care settings with complex care needs to engage in individualized behavioral programing to manage/stabilize behaviors and safely transition them to more appropriate and less costly community settings. This symposium will describe the BRO team model, highlight the facilitators and barriers to nationally disseminating the BRO model with VA partner facilities, discuss adaptations in continuing community transitions following the COVID-19 pandemic, and describe program outcomes. The first speaker will discuss development of the BRO model and outcomes of a regional dissemination. The second speaker will present results from the program evaluation of the national dissemination. The final speaker will describe BRO Team expansion and lessons learned from the perspective of a VA partner facility. The (CP)2 Program Director will integrate findings and highlight implications for scaling and evaluating promising models for national dissemination for policy, practice, and future research.","Matthews, Kathleen, Vinson, Latrice","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.172","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):46-46, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24729,""
"Seven-State Study of Assisted Living and Healthcare Providersâ€™ Responses to COVID-19","COVID-19 has inordinately affected assisted living (AL), such that the proportion of fatalities to cases has been 21% in AL versus 2.5% for the general population. Understanding how AL administrators and medical and mental health providers have responded to COVID-19 can inform health care going forward. Using a seven-state stratified random sample of 250 communities, administrators were interviewed and providers completed questionnaires regarding COVID-19 practices. Preliminary data indicate that 79%, 44%, and 62% of administrators reported serving meals in rooms to segregate residents, using telemedicine, and providing extra pay for staff, respectively. Perceived use/effectiveness of practices differed based on dementia case-mix (e.g., face coverings, social distancing). Providers reported less access to patients (82%), more telehealth (63%), and less ability to provide care (43%). However, they uniformly reported high confidence in AL staff ability to prevent (94%) and respond to outbreaks (96%).

"In Their Own Words: A Study on COVID-19-Related Concerns and Perceptions of Risk Among Older University Employees","The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine COVID-19-related concerns and risk perceptions among older employees aged 50+ related to reopening a large state university campus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment focused on older employees from diverse backgrounds and job classifications. Six focus group interviews, with a total of 24 participants, were conducted using Zoom video conferencing. Interviews were transcribed using Zoom and were double-checked for accuracy. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using ATLAS.ti 9 after establishing inter-rater reliability among two coders. During the campus reopening, older employees reported several concerns and perceptions of risk focused on COVID-19 exposure and transmission to others, individual health and health of other household members, mental health and stress, and job security. Findings were used to inform the development of intervention strategies and resources to promote the health and well-being among older employees during the pandemic.","Sokan, Amanda, Yuan, Nicole, Felix, Mariana, Wager, Mark, O'Neill, Lisa, Chen, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.249","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):65-65, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24731,""
"Predictors of COVID-19 Related Stress Among Custodial Grandmothers","This paper examined predictors of COVID-19 stressors among 316 custodial grandmothers raising school-aged grandchildren using regression. Grandmothers, who were participants in two nationwide behavioral RCTs, completed an online questionnaire in Spring 2020. Predictors included grandmother demographics, depressive symptoms, perceived caregiving stress and reward, stress management strategies, and grandchild factors. Outcomes included grandmothersâ€™ stress related to using bad coping habits (r2=.24), grandchildrenâ€™s remote learning(r2=.39), household conflict (r2=.29), COVID-19 fear and uncertainty (r2=.28), and finances(r2=.24). Regression results indicated that grandmothersâ€™ pre-existing depressive symptoms predicted all outcomes except remote learning stress. Higher caregiving stress was associated with all outcomes, except concerns about using bad coping habits. Grandmothers with less perceived access to care reported greater concern about bad coping habits and remote learning stress, while minority grandmothers reported more financial stress and COVID-19 fear and uncertainty. Findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has compounded the stress experienced by already burdened custodial grandmothers.","Jeanblanc, Alexandra, Dolbin-MacNab, Megan, Musil, Carol, Smith, Gregory","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.317","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):83-84, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24732,""
"Changing Family Relationships During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Case of Elder Abuse","Since the first confirmed case being identified in January 2020, authorities in Hong Kong have implemented various measures in an attempt to control the spread of the disease. These measures include compulsory quarantining of infected persons and those suspected of exposure, temporary closure of high-risk premises, and suspension of public activities and services, encouraging work-from-home arrangement etc. These measures, however, may exacerbate the impact of known risk factors and create new avenues for elder mistreatment. Life stress, financial strains and work-from-home arrangements increase chances of family conflicts, cessation of public services increases burden in the already stressed caregivers. This study examines the changing intergenerational family relations in the midst of the pandemic. A total of 1200 community dwelling senior citizens participated through responding to a telephone survey. Information was collected on participantsâ€™ demographic characteristics, perceived disruptions brought about by COVID-19, family relations, physical and mental health, etc. Family conflicts and abuse were commonly reported: 27.8% reported family conflicts, 14.5% psychological abuse, 3.1% physical abuse, 3.9% financial abuse. A large proportion of participants (41.8%), however, also reported improved family relations during the pandemic. Results of logistic regression indicate that advanced age, female gender, poor financial situation were significant predictors for family conflicts and abuse. Contrary to our expectations, pandemic related disruptions in daily lives and perceived safety in the community were not associated in family conflicts and abuse in the present sample.","Yan, Elsie, Lai, Daniel, Lee, Vincent","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.334","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):87-88, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24733,""
"Growth Mindset and Older Adultsâ€™ Well-Being During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Growth mindset, the belief that abilities and attributes are improvable, may help buffer against older adultsâ€™ feelings of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it may foster effective self-regulation and resilience. This study examined the effects of growth mindset on older adultsâ€™ well-being and adjustment, compared to younger and middle-aged adults. Participants self-reported on their growth mindset, depression, well-being, and daily habits amid the pandemic. For older adults (N = 178, 82% female, M age = 70.42, SD age = 6.50, range 60-90), regression analyses (controlling for gender, education, income, and age) revealed that growth mindset was associated with decreased depression (ÃŸ = -.29, p = .001) and increased well-being (ÃŸ = .38, p &lt; .001). In addition, a logistic regression showed that older adults with a higher growth mindset were more likely to adjust their daily tasks during the pandemic (e.g., using technology to remotely socialize;OR = 1.77, p = .012). The same set of analyses in samples of younger (N = 235, 72% female, M age = 29.84, SD age = 5.89, range 18-39) and middle-aged adults (N = 188, 74% female, M age = 50.02, SD age = 6.10, range 40-59) revealed that growth mindset was associated with decreased depression and increased well-being. However, in these groups, growth mindset did not predict the likelihood of adjusting daily tasks. Findings suggest that while growth mindset is linked to enhanced well-being during the pandemic, its effect on adjusting to new circumstances might be salient in older adulthood.","Kyeong, Yena, Sheffler, Pamela, KÃ¼rÃ¼m, Esra, Ferguson, Leah, Davis, Elizabeth, Strickland-Hughes, Carla, Wu, Rachel","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.355","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):94-94, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24734,""
"Changes in Health and Well-Being in COVID-19 Clinically Vulnerable Older English People During the Pandemic","People with specific health profiles and diseases (such as diabetes, lung and heart conditions) have been classified as â€˜clinically vulnerableâ€™ (CV) to Covid-19, i.e. at higher risk of severe illness and mortality from Covid-19, and were targeted for shielding. However, there is as yet little evidence on how the pandemic and shielding impacted the health and social well-being of CV older people. Using data from Wave 9 (2018/19) and the first Covid-19 sub-study (June/July 2020) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we investigated changes in health and well-being during the pandemic by clinical vulnerability. We also explored the interactions between CV and age-group (50s, 60s, 70s, 80+), and between CV and shielding. Results suggest that CV older people (~39% of the sample) were more likely to report worse health and social well-being outcomes during the pandemic compared to non-CV participants, even considering pre-pandemic levels of health and well-being. However, changes in health were not uniform across age groups, with those in their 50s and 60s more likely to report greater deterioration in mental health than those in their 70s and over 80. Moreover, older adults who were shielding and were CV reported the most substantial rises in anxiety, depression, receipt of formal care as well as decreases in well-being and physical activity. While policies focussing on shielding CV older people reduce rates of hospitalisation and death from Covid-19, policymakers should address the wider needs of this group if their long-term health and social well-being are not to be compromised.","Gessa, Giorgio Di, Price, Debora","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.359","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):95-95, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24735,""
"Comparison of Embedded Sensor Data for Long-Term Care Residents Before and After Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Older adults have experienced greater isolation and mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. In long-term care (LTC) settings, residents have been particularly impacted due to strict lockdown policies. Little is known about how these policies have impacted older adults. This study leveraged existing research with embedded sensors installed in LTC settings, and analyzed sensor data of residents (N=30) two months pre/post the onset of the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic (1/13/20 to 3/13/20, 03/14/20 to 5/13/20). Data from three sensors (bed sensors, depth sensors, and motion sensors) were analyzed for each resident using paired t-tests, which generated information on the residentâ€™s pulse, respiration, sleep, gait, and motion in entering/exiting their front door, living rooms, bedrooms, and bathrooms. A 14.4% decrease was observed in front door motion in the two months post-onset of the pandemic, as well as a 2.4% increase in average nighttime respiration, and a 7.6% increase in nighttime bed restlessness. Over half of our sample (68%) had significant differences (p&lt;0.05) in restlessness. These results highlight the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing policies on older adults living in LTC. While it is not surprising that significant differences were found in the front door motion sensor, the bed sensor data can potentially shed light on how sleep was impacted during this time. As older adults experienced additional mental health concerns during this time, their normal sleep patterns could have been affected. Implications could help inform LTC staff, healthcare providers, and self-management of health approaches among older adults.","Robinson, Erin, Wu, Wenlong, Park, Geunhye, Tefera, Gashaye M.; Lane, Kari, Skubic, Marjorie, Keller, James, Popescu, Mihail","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.360","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):95-96, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24736,""
"Cross-National Analysis of Bereavement From COVID-19 and Depressive Symptoms Among Older Adults in Europe","The COVID-19 pandemic has left older adults around the globe grieving the sudden death of relatives and friends. We examine if COVID-19 bereavement corresponds with older adultsâ€™ depressive symptoms in 27 countries, and test for variation by gender and country context. We analyzed the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) COVID-19 data collected from N=51,383 older adults (age 50â€“104) living in 27 countries between June-August 2020, of whom 1,363 reported the death of a relative or friend from COVID-19. We estimated pooled-multilevel logistic regression models to examine if COVID-19 bereavement was associated with depressive symptoms and worsening depressive symptoms for older men and women, and we tested whether the national COVID-19 mortality rate in their country had an additive, or multiplicative, influence. COVID-19 bereavement from the death of a relative or friend is associated with significantly higher odds of reporting depressive symptoms, and reporting that these symptoms have recently worsened since the outbreak of COVID-19. Net of personal loss, living in a country with the highest COVID-19 mortality rate corresponds further with womenâ€™s depressive symptoms;however, living in the midst of more COVID-19 deaths does not alter the implications of personal loss for depressive symptoms. COVID-19 deaths have lingering mental health implications for surviving older adults. Even as the collective toll of the crisis is apparent, bereaved older adults are in particular need of mental health support.","Wang, Haowei, Verdery, Ashton, Margolis, Rachel, Smith-Greenaway, Emily","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.361","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):96-96, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24737,""
"Heterogeneity in Vulnerability and Resilience Among Centenarians","Given their exceptional longevity, centenarians have long been considered as examples of successful aging. Yet, with increases in empirical studies, findings suggest that they may show vulnerability and resilience at the same time. This symposium offers a more in-depth perspective on both constructs in centenarians. Zaccaria and colleagues investigated the link between social isolation and loneliness within the Fordham Centenarian Study. Results indicate the existence of four subgroups combining expressions of isolation and loneliness, suggesting different vulnerability patterns in centenarians. Uittenhove and colleagues analyzed patterns of coping strategies in the Second Heidelberg Centenarian Study. Cluster analysis identified two coping profiles, one characterized by a wide coping repertoire including problem-directed and internal strategies, while the other showed low problem-solving. Lampraki and Jopp examined the effects of (lacking) resources and psychological strengths (optimism) on depressive symptoms in the Fordham Centenarian Study. Findings suggest that the effect of resources is mediated by psychological strengths, demonstrating their beneficial value in very old age. Jopp and colleagues report findings from the ongoing SWISS100 Study. Based on telephone interviews conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, they found that centenarians did not feel vulnerable. While half of the centenarians and their proxies reported no changes in everyday life, the other half experienced substantial challenges due to lack of activities and absence of social contacts due to governmental regulations. In sum, centenarians are vulnerable and resilient at the same time, highlighting the future research needs on its predictors, and the application of this knowledge within the context of crisis.","Jopp, Daniela, Lampraki, Charikleia, Spini, Dario","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.415","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):109-110, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24738,""
"Emotion Regulation Resources Explain Middle-Aged and Older Adults' COVID-19-Related Distress","As the pandemic caused widespread disruption across the world, studies suggested younger adults were faring more poorly than other adults. We hypothesized that younger adults might possess fewer emotion regulation resources and skills, accounting for their greater distress. In a national sample of 1528 adults, we examined how baseline resources (in mid-April, during initial peak infections) predicted distress (depression, anxiety, PTSD symptoms) five weeks later, when states began initial reopenings. Younger adults reported greater distress and less social support, mindfulness, and emotion regulation skills than did middle aged and older adults.. Controlling for stress exposure, younger adultsâ€™ distress was predicted by impulsivity and lack of perceived strategies while middle-aged and older adultsâ€™ distress was predicted by acceptance of negative emotions;perceived social support was related to lower distress for both groups but mindfulness was unrelated.

Social distancing and lockdown to prevent contagion may result in social isolation and feelings of loneliness, which can have adverse effects on health. We examined how depressive symptoms were associated with between-person differences and within-person variations in loneliness, social contacts, and daily physical problems during 8 weeks. We sampled 247 older adults (Mage = 71.1, SD = 7.3, range = 51 - 95), who participated at micro-longitudinal online surveys (baseline and 7 weekly follow-ups) from April 28 to June 23. Multilevel modeling analysis controlling age, gender, marital status, and education showed that depressive symptoms were significantly decreased during 8 weeks. Further, depressive symptoms were positively coupled with both loneliness and physical problems for both the within-and between-person levels. Increase in social contact was related to decreases in depressive symptoms only at the between-person level.","Choun, Soyoung, Aldwin, Carolyn, Lee, Dylan","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.502","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):131-131, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24740,""
"Moderating Effects of Loneliness on COVID-19-Related Stress and Anxiety in Middle and Later Life in South Korea","Many people have suffered from psychological distress in the form of stress, loneliness, and anxiety resulting from the COVID-19 epidemic (Havnen et al., 2020;Luchetti et al., 2020). Along with these factors, physical health (hereafter health), resilience, and living arrangements as protective factors were examined. The research aims were to investigate 1) factors affecting the association between COVID-19-related stress (hereafter stress) and anxiety, and 2) moderating effects of loneliness on this association. Data was collected on 450 middle-aged and older adults (ages 45 through 76) living in South Korea during COVID-19. A multi-group path analysis was employed. Measurement invariance was examined by comparing unconstrained and fully constrained models. Both models fit. Moderating effects of loneliness existed. Stress was negatively associated with health and living arrangements for people with both higher and lower levels of loneliness. Health was positively associated with resilience for both groups. Resilience was negatively associated with anxiety for both groups. For people with higher levels of loneliness only, stress and health were negatively associated with resilience and anxiety, respectively. The association between stress and anxiety was significant for both groups. However, the impact of stress on anxiety was significantly larger for people with higher levels of loneliness than for people with lower levels of loneliness. Health practitioners and service providers should develop programs to maintain and promote resilience, social support, and good health among middle-aged and older adults in South Korea to mitigate negative mental health consequences during the pandemic.","Yoon, Sukyung, Choi, Soo Chan","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.539","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):141-141, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24741,""
"Changes In Mental Health, Social Engagement, and Physical Activities During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The current COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly changed our behaviors and health, especially vulnerable community-dwelling older adults. This symposium includes three presentations that evaluated the pandemicâ€™s impacts on mental health, social engagement and physical activity in healthy community-living older adults and those with dementia. Dr. Wenjun Li and his team examined the pandemic impact on mental health and social engagement among relatively healthy older adults residing in suburban and rural neighborhoods in Central Massachusetts, USA. The study reported significant variations in pandemic impacts by sex, age, race, income, living arrangement, and neighborhood housing density, suggesting the pandemic has had disproportionally negative impacts on socially and economically disadvantaged vulnerable older adults. Dr. W. Quin Yow and her team evaluated the impacts of government mandated social distancing and lockdowns on older adults with dementia and their caregivers in Singapore. The study found significant increases in irritability, aggression and hallucinations among older adults with dementia, and possible deterioration of health conditions and heightened moderate level of stress. The results suggest that social distancing may have resulted in negative outcomes in this vulnerable population with dementia and their caregivers. Dr. Ladda Thiamwong reported her teamâ€™s efforts on forming an international aging research collaborative to mitigate heath consequences of COVID-19 crisis from the international perspective. The team consists of ten scholars from five countries, including Hong Kong, Nepal, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States. They collect data using combinations of online and face-to-face surveys. Their important findings will be discussed in detail in this symposium.","Li, Wenjun, Hou, Su- I.","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.541","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):141-142, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24742,""
"Changes In Social Isolation, Anxiety and Depression Among Older Adults During The COVID-19 Pandemic","Social distancing and business lockdowns may have severe negative impact on daily living, mental and physical health of community-living older adults. Our Healthy Aging and Neighborhood Study surveyed 370 older adults in Central Massachusetts in 2020 and 2021. Participants were queried about pre-post pandemic changes in social and physical activities, mental and physical health, and lifestyle factors including food purchasing, diet and physical exercise;and attitude towards and receiving of vaccination. The study is ongoing and data are being accumulated. Preliminary analysis suggested that social distancing and lockdowns have negative impacted social engagement, communications with close friends, relatives and family members, food purchasing, frequency of outdoor exercises, especially group activities. The impact appeared to differ by sex, advancing age, and living arrangement. In summary, social distancing and business lockdowns may have negative impacts on most older adults while the impacts were more severe in those older and socioeconomically disadvantaged.","Churchill, Linda, Siden, Hannah, Aquirre, Annabella, Procter-Gray, Elizabeth, Li, Wenjun","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.542","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):142-142, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24743,""
"COVID-19 Lockdown Measures: Impact On Older Adults With Dementia And Their Caregivers In Singapore","Family caregivers typically rely on community-based services and social support networks to supplement their caregiving of older adults with dementia (OAwD). In April 2020, the Singapore government implemented a partial lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19. We assessed the policy's impact on the physical and mental health of caregivers and their OAwD. As part of a larger study, 30 caregivers were interviewed and rated the stress they experienced when caring for an OAwD during the partial lockdown. Qualitative analyses found significant behavioral changes in OAwD such as irritability, aggression and hallucinations, which led some caregivers to believe their dependentsâ€™ condition had deteriorated, as well as heightened levels of caregiving stress. Overall, our preliminary results suggested that although social distancing measures may be effective in containing the spread of COVID-19, these measures could lead to negative outcomes on vulnerable populations such as OAwD and their caregivers.","Lokanathan, Tharshini, Chen, Hui-Ching, Yow, W.

"An International Aging Research Collaboration During The COVID-19 Crisis: Mitigating Global Health Consequences","There are several reasons for forming an aging international research collaboration;however, creating a successful and productive research team during the global crisis may require extensive planning and efforts. Our team consists of ten scholars from five countries, including Hong Kong, Nepal, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States. To accomplish this initiative, we employ ten simple rules for establishing international research collaborations proposed by R. de Grijs (2015). We aim to examine impacts of the pandemic on physical activity, frailty, falls, depression and social networks in diverse older adults. We collect data by online survey and/or face-to â€“face survey using questionnaires including fear of the COVID, face mask use, Social Network, Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity, a simple frailty questionnaire, CDC fall risk checklist, short Fall-Efficacy Scale International and Patient Health Questionnaire-9.

"Caregiving Challenges During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings From the National Poll on Healthy Aging","The COVID-19 pandemic posed new challenges for caregivers. This study examines the prevalence of pandemic care challenges (e.g., decreasing care to reduce virus spread, difficulty accessing medical care) and their associations with caregiver mental health and interpersonal well-being in a nationally representative sample of 311 caregivers who participated in the June 2020 National Poll on Healthy Aging. We consider seven care challenges and supports as key predictors of caregiver mental health (care-related stress, self-reported mental health, three depressive symptoms) and interpersonal well-being (lack of companionship, isolation) in bivariate tests and ordinary least squares regressions. Each care challenge/support was endorsed by between 13-23% of caregivers. Difficulty getting needed medical care was the most predictive challenge associated with increased caregiver stress, depressive symptoms, and worsened interpersonal well-being. All care challenges predicted an increase in caregiver stress. Effective caregiver tools and supports must consider changing policies and care needs, especially during a pandemic.","Carmichael, Alicia, Leonard, Natalie, Jackson, Jeannette, Solway, Erica, Kirch, Matthias, Singer, Dianne, Gonzalez, Richard, Leggett, Amanda","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.672","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):178-178, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24746,""
"Memory Problems During COVID in Low-Income Older Adults","Prevention, with widespread lifestyle risk reduction at the community-level, is considered an effective method to decrease Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). Diverse low-income older adults in Virginia managing either diabetes/cardiovascular symptoms, were offered weekly lifestyle telephone-health coaching for 12-weeks, providing education, motivations, self-efficacy, and referral services for AD lifestyle risk. Participants provided positive anecdotal feedback and the need for continued health coaching during COVID-19. Thirty participants (predominantly African American/Black female) consented for continued health coaching during the pandemic with 47% reporting memory problems. Findings indicated poorer health status associated with reporting memory problems for poor physical health days, poor mental health days, total mental/physical health poor days, sad days, worried days, tired days, feelings of emptiness, feelings of rejection, feelings of failure, little interest/pleasure, and feeling down. This preliminary work creates the impetus for future large-scale AD prevention investigations to improve the lives of AD-risk, low-income, diverse older adults reporting memory problems.","Zanjani, Faika","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.751","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):198-198, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24747,""
"Major Disastersâ€™ Impacts on Long-Term Care Settings, Vulnerable Older Adults, and Care Providers","The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately negatively affected older adults, and has specifically devasted older adults who are minorities and those who reside in long-term care (LTC) facilities. For professionals working in LTC facilities, major stressors and challenges due to the pandemic must be navigated, sometimes in parallel with the effect that major disasters like hurricanes can have on LTC facilities. This symposium will focus on the impact major disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic and Hurricane Irma, had on LTC settings and those who live and work there, as well as older adults who are minorities and their communities. First, Dr. Roma Hanks will present findings from a study of community members and leaders in a majority African-American community in the United States (US) about their experiences with and challenges faced related to the pandemic. Second, Dr. Lisa Brown will share experiences and perceptions of mental health clinicians from across the US who worked in LTC settings before and during the pandemic. Third, Dr. Ella Cohn-Schwartz will describe how the pandemic impacted Holocaust survivors ages 75+ in Israel compared to older adults who did not experience the Holocaust. Fourth, Dr. Lindsay Peterson will present findings from interviews with nursing home and assisted living community representatives in the US regarding vulnerabilities LTC facilities experienced related to Hurricane Irma in 2017. As a whole, these presenters will provide insights into experiences of older adults, care providers, LTC facilities, and communities as they navigated challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and a major hurricane.","Haverhals, Leah, Cherry, Katie","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.770","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):201-201, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24748,""
"Perceptions of Mental Health Clinicians Working in Long-Term Care Facilities During the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health clinicians were initially not considered essential workers, and most were prevented from entering long-term care (LTC) facilities. This study investigated the perceptions and experiences of licensed clinicians who were providing services in LTC settings before and during the pandemic. Respondents included 126 clinicians from 31 states who completed a 90-item survey to assess the impact of COVID-19. Visitor restrictions were perceived to have had a negative effect on patients' emotional, behavioral, and cognitive status. The pandemic adversely impacted clinicians financially, personally, and emotionally, with more than half (67%) reporting that they experienced burnout. This study found that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted clinicians working in LTC settings, their patients' wellbeing, and the delivery of mental health services. Understanding the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on LTC patients and clinicians alike has implications for the provision of services during future pandemics.","Ward, Rachel, Rose, Savannah, Lind, Lisa, Hanks, Roma, Brown, Lisa","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.772","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):202-202, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24749,""
"Mental Health of Holocaust Survivors and Other Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Israel","Holocaust survivors could be especially vulnerable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic due to their early life traumas. Thus, the current study examines the effects of the pandemic on the mental health of Holocaust survivors in Israel, compared to adults who did not experience the Holocaust. We collected quantitative data from 305 adults aged 75+ (38% Holocaust survivors) in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate that Holocaust survivors were worried to a greater extent from COVID-19 and reported greater depression which became worse during the pandemic. On the other hand, despite these differences, the two groups were similar in their will to live. In conclusion, Holocaust survivors seem to be more vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthening the vulnerability hypothesis, while also showing resilience in their will to live. Policy makers and practitioners should pay special attention to this particularly vulnerable population during these difficult times.","Bachner, Yaacov, Carmel, Sara, Cohn-Schwartz, Ella","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.773","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):202-202, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24750,""
"Novel Strategies to Reach and Engage Older Veterans During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures to prevent its spread have important implications for the health and wellbeing of older Veterans. Prior to the pandemic, social isolation was already recognized as a risk for older adults, contributing to increased risk of depression, physical inactivity, and mortality. Stay-at-home orders, social distancing, and transitions to new ways of delivering care have meant that many of the ways in which older Veterans connect with VA and others have changed. Older Veterans and Veterans with serious mental illness (SMI) are especially vulnerable to experience negative impacts from social isolation and loneliness. This symposium will present on four novel and adapted strategies for engaging with older Veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: 1) VA Connection Plans, a whole health intervention to promote social connections for older Veterans with and without SMI (Peeples);2) telehealth adaptations to PEER, an in-person, peer-delivered exercise intervention for older Veterans with SMI (Muralidharan);3) VA Compassionate Contact Corps, a VA Voluntary Service program to connect older Veterans with friendly volunteers via telephone (Sullivan);and 4) group telehealth interventions to foster social connection among older Veterans and their families (Weiskittle).

"Older Adult Technology Use During a Global Pandemic: A Study of Mental Health, Social Supports, and Resiliency","Older adults have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led many to isolate during this time. Technology enables people to remain connected, however little is known about how older adults have used technology and the impact it has had on their mental health and connectedness. This study was to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced older adult mental health and social connectedness, with a particular emphasis on how technology has played a role. One-on-one interviews (N=29) were conducted with adults aged 65+ (Mean age=71.5;86% female) via phone/Zoom. Participants were asked open-ended questions about the impact social distancing has had on their quality of life, health, and social connectedness as well as their technology use to remain connected. Findings highlight the mental health stressors experienced by older adults during the pandemic, as well as much resiliency and innovation. In speaking of the isolation and its effect on her mental health, one participant said, â€œI thought fighting cancer was bad, but this is worse.â€ Nearly all of the participants had used technology in some form to remain connected to others, which the most common being a smart phone to call, text, and video-interface. One participant commented, â€œYou canâ€™t beat an iPhone. How in the world could we ever live without an iPhone?â€ Many participants had learned a new technology during the pandemic, such as Zoom. Our findings raise the possibility that technology may be a good strategy for enhancing well-being of aging population amid the pandemic.","Park, Geunhye, Robinson, Erin, Tefera, Gashaye M.","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.841","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):219-220, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24752,""
"Use and Disuse of Technology Among Persons With Memory Concerns and Their Caregivers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Social distancing and shelter-in-place orders designed to curb the spread of COVID-19 increased isolation among persons with memory concerns (PWMC) and increased the burden on individuals providing their care. Technology, such as smartphones or tablets, has demonstrated potential to improve the social connections and mental health of older adults;however, older adults historically have been reluctant to adopt new technology. We aimed to understand why some PWMC and their caregivers used new technology to adapt to lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic while others did not. In this study, we used data collected in 20 qualitative interviews from June to August, 2020 with PWMC and their family caregivers to assess changes in and barriers to technology use. Qualitative thematic analysis identified three themes which explained motivations for using new technology during a pandemic: 1) seeking relief from caregiver burden, 2) alleviating boredom, and 3) maintaining social connection. Results further revealed lingering barriers to PWMC and caregiver adoption of technologies, including: 1) PWMC dependence upon caregivers, 2) a lack of familiarity with technology, and 3) difficulties using technology. This in-depth investigation suggests that technology has the ability to provide caregivers relief from caregiving duties and provide PWMC with more independence during periods of pronounced isolation","Millenbah, Ashley, Albers, Elizabeth, Mikal, Jude, Finlay, Jessica, Jutkowitz, Eric, Mitchell, Lauren, Horn, Brenna, Gaugler, Joseph","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.843","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):220-220, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24753,""
"Living With HIV Through the COVID-19 Pandemic: Impacts on Older Adults in New York City","New York City was among the first to institute physical distancing and shutdowns to curb community spread of COVID-19. The pandemic has amplified issues related to isolation.

"COVID-19 and the Intersection of Race, Ethnicity, and Sexual Minority Status","The COVID-19 virus has caused millions of deaths and impaired physical and mental health and social disconnection for countless persons around the world;concomitantly, the pandemic has exposed and exacerbated the pervasive effects of racism and stigma experienced by Black, Indigenous, or People of Color (BIPOC) and other marginalized/stigmatized groups. This study adopts an intersectional perspective examining multiple marginalized identities (i.e., the combination of LGBTQ and BIPOC status) and COVID-19 pandemic health stressors. We report on data from an online survey (conducted between Aug 10 and Oct. 10, 2020) focusing on current experiences and future planning during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. LGBTQ respondents (n=415) indicated significantly higher levels of depression, loneliness, sadness, and isolation in comparison to heterosexuals (n=3916). Heterosexual white respondents (n=3446) reported significantly higher levels of acceptance in their community and reported greater happiness but also higher rates of feeling of isolation than heterosexual BIPOC heterosexuals (n=470) who reported significantly higher rates of feeling judged/shamed by others than the heterosexual white respondents. In contrast to our expectations, white LGBTQ respondents (n=366) reported significantly more depression, loneliness, anxiety, and sadness than their BIPOC LGBTQ peers (n=49). These findings are interpreted as reflecting a complex mix of the effects of marginalization (as experienced by LGBTQ persons in general), and privilege and relative deprivation (as experienced by heterosexual and LGBTQ white persons) along with resilience and the moderated expectations and experiences of BIPOC LGBTQ persons.","Beringer, Robert, de Vries, Brian, Gutman, Gloria, Gill, Paneet, Dault, Helena","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.891","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):232-232, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24755,""
"Changes in Modifiable Health Behaviors During the Pandemic and Effects on Mental Health: Evidence From England","COVID-19 mitigation efforts (including lockdowns and advice to stay at home as much as possible) are likely to have resulted in changes in health behaviours such as the amount of sleep, physical exercise, alcohol use, and eating. To date, little is known about how and to what extent these changes in health behaviours since the beginning of the pandemic are related to mental health. Using pre-pandemic data from Wave 9 (2018/19) and from two Covid-19 sub-studies (with data collection in June/July and November/December 2020) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we investigate how changes in health behaviour during the initial months of the pandemic are associated with subsequent mental health among older people. In our regression analyses, we considered depression and anxiety and controlled for pre-pandemic measures of mental health. Between March and June/July 2020, about a third of older people reported less physical activity;one in five less sleep;and one in ten eating less food and drinking more. Compared to respondents who did not change their behaviours, those who reported sleeping and eating both more and less, and who mentioned less physical activity were more likely to report depression and anxiety, even taking into account pre-pandemic mental health. An increase in drinking was also marginally associated with higher depression. Policymakers should encourage older people who have engaged in unhealthier behaviours to modify them to reduce the negative long-term effects on their mental health.","Gessa, Giorgio Di, Zaninotto, Paola","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.904","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):236-236, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24756,""
"Mental Health Among Informal Caregivers of Older Adults in Asia","The purpose of this symposium is to highlight the mental health needs and factors associated with mental health among informal caregivers of older adults in Asia. The symposium consists of five papers. The first paper explores the perceived role, needs, and rewards of informal caregiving among caregivers of residents in independent long-term care facilities in South India. The second paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis on the association between long-term care service use and informal caregiver burden, depression, and health status. The third paper examines the association between caregiversâ€™ characteristics and quality of life among informal caregivers of older adults with cognitive impairment in China. The fourth paper examines the association between coping strategies and caregiver burden and depression among Chinese caregivers of older adults with cognitive impairment. The last paper examines the association between cohort, meaning making, and depression among adult caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. Taken together, these five papers underscore of the mental health needs and protective and risk factors of mental well-being among caregivers in Asia. Findings of those papers inform the development and adaptation of culturally sensitive interventions to improve mental health outcomes among informal caregivers in Asia. The disccuant will comment on the strengths and limitations of these papers in terms of their contributions to the theory, research, and practice on mental health among informal caregivers in Asia.","Gao, Xiang, Wang, Kaipeng, Sun, Fei","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.938","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):244-244, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24757,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on Meaning Making of Dementia Caregivers in Hong Kong: From the Generational Perspectives","This study examined the impact of COVID-19 on meaning making among adult children dementia caregivers and the association with caregiver mental well-being. Adult caregivers (n=601) from two generations, 1946-1964 (Baby Boomers) and 1965-1980 (Generation X), were recruited in Hong Kong between October 2019 and June 2020. Participants were assessed on depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) and meaning making (Finding Meaning Through Caregiving Scale-FMTC). Generation X scored higher on sense of loss (p = 0.04) and lower on provisional meaning of FMTC (p=0.017). Moreover, an interaction effect (p=0.003) between generation and COVID-19 were found. During the pandemic, Generation X caregivers were more likely to suffer from higher losses, higher depressive symptoms (&gt;23.2% moderate to severe) and lower provisional meaning (p=0.03) compared to their boomer counterparts. The level of meaning making is more important to Generation X caregivers, especially in COVID-19 situation. Government should consider generation-responsive services and education support in guiding service implementation.","Leung, Reynold, Vivian, W. Q.

"The Importance of Social Support Networks on Mental Health Status of Custodial Grandparents","This symposium presents a collection of papers that examine the concept of social support and its effect on custodial grandparentsâ€™ (CG) mental health state. Each paper explores a different perspective about grandparentsâ€™ access to and/or use of social support networks and mental health outcomes;several papers view social support within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nadorff and colleagues explore social support by middle-generation family members and its effects on grandparentsâ€™ stress and depressive symptoms. Musil and colleagues report on psychosocial and social support predictors of self-appraised healthcare and financial security by CG during the Covid-19 pandemic. Whitley and Kelley describe current social networks relied upon by a preliminary sample of CG while managing the daily stresses and strains associated with COVID-19 and its restrictive mandates. The final two papers report the use of specialized technology and support services delivered to homebound CG during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee and colleagues describe a telemental health model using Solution-Focused Brief Therapy to serve socially isolated grandparents experiencing mental health distress as during the pandemic. Mendoza and Park report on program challenges and outcomes of implementing a support service for grandparents living under COVID-19 restrictions. The highlights of the papers will be discussed by Yanfeng Xu and give attention to the ways scholars and practitioners can build upon these works to maximize the mental health outcomes of CG, while managing to live in socially restrictive and challenging environments.","Whitley, Deborah, Lee, Youjung, Xu, Yanfeng","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1002","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):261-261, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24759,""
"Living With COVID-19: Descriptions of Custodial Grandparents' Mental Health Stress and Social Support Networks","Research suggests custodial grandparents (CG) with chronic health conditions, limited economic resources, and restricted social connections are at risk for adverse mental health outcomes. The growing uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 seems to accentuate these findings. This paper presents preliminary descriptions of mental stress by a small sample of CG (n=26) surveyed after the onset of COVID-19. They described the social groups comprising their networks, and the methods used to engage with them. A majority of the sample (96.2%) reported experiencing mental stress since the onset of the virus;based on Brief Symptom Inventory results, five CG scored in the clinical range for stress. Food access, fear of getting sick, and grandchildrenâ€™s school requirements are leading sources of stress. Despite such challenges, CG report varying levels of social engagement with their support networks. The reported descriptions give preliminary insight how CG can maximize their social networks to build/sustain positive mental health well-being.","Kelley, Susan, Whitley, Deborah","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1003","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):261-262, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24760,""
"Connecting Grandparent Caregivers Through Telemental Health During COVID-19","Since the COVID-19 outbreak, children and their caregivers throughout the world are experiencing unprecedented long-term social isolation. For too many, especially grandparent-headed families, underrepresented minorities, and those living in poverty, this precipitates and exacerbates mental health conditions including anxiety and depression. Despite these familiesâ€™ increased needs for mental health services during the pandemic, professionals often lack experience and expertise in telemental health, which is a safe and effective way to provide these services. In this symposium, we will present a telemental health model for working with grandparent-headed families that draws upon Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT), an evidence-based approach focusing on strengths. This SFBT-based telemental health training program prepares mental health professionals to implement this safe and innovative intervention, enabling them to effectively serve isolated and marginalized grandparent caregivers and their families when providing in-person services is not possible.","Bronstein, Laura, Cook, Kelley, Lee, Youjung","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1004","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):262-262, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24761,""
"Delivering Person-Centered Care During a Pandemic: Stakeholder Perspectives","Person-centered care (PCC) is an approach to care that both nursing homes (NH) and assisted living (AL) communities strive to provide. PCC is a philosophy that recognizes knowing the person and honoring individual preferences. However, when COVID-19 emerged, the NH and AL environments were ground zero for infection spread and disproportionate numbers of deaths among residents. As a result, many practices changed dramatically in efforts to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in these communities. The purpose of this symposium is to discuss several projects that can speak to the impact of the pandemic on stakeholder efforts to provide PCC. First, Dr. Roberts presents feedback from residents and family members on the challenges COVID-19 created for family involvement in care conferences. In the second study, Dr. Behrens examines focus group data from direct-care nurses on their perceptions of delivering PCC related to risk of harm to staff and residents. The third study presents the voices of activities professionals who were implementing a PCC quality improvement project to communicate resident preferences, which illustrates both the importance of PCC during the pandemic, but also the challenges implementing during the pandemic. Fourth, the Kansas PEAK 2.0 program used provider feedback to direct and inform program responses through components such as consistent staffing. Finally, Dr. Zimmerman presents qualitative data from over 100 AL administrators, medical, and mental health care providers on their experiences pivoting during COVID-19. Our discussant will explore the implications of these studies in terms of the future of PCC in residential settings.","Abbott, Katherine, Corazzini, Kirsten","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1037","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):269-270, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24762,""
"Older Adults and Family Discord or Violence During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results of a Canada-Wide Survey","Child abuse and intimate partner violence rates are known to increase during and in the aftermath of disasters. Research on elder abuse during disasters, including the current pandemic, is limited. As part of an online survey that explored older Canadiansâ€™ current experiences and future care plans during the COVID-19 pandemic, we aimed to determine the prevalence, contributing factors and potential outcomes of frequent family discord involving physical violence (FFD/PV) as a proxy for elder abuse. The survey was conducted between Aug 10 and Oct 10, 2021. Respondents (n=4380) were recruited using social media, direct email, Facebook advertising and with the assistance of 85 local community, regional and national organizations. The sub-sample reporting FFD/PV (n=76, 1.8%) was compared with other survey respondents regarding socio-demographic characteristics, negative and positive emotions, difficulty accessing basic needs, food, health care and support. Respondents experiencing FFD/PV were found to be significantly younger and less educated and were more likely to be non-white and not working than other respondents. The subgroup sustaining FFD/PV reported significantly higher rates of feeling depressed, lonely, isolated, anxious, sad, and judged/shamed and felt less happy, relaxed and accepted in their community. They also reported higher rates of challenges in accessing basic material needs such as food, support, medical care, mental health treatment and experienced more changes in life routines. Although only a small percentage reported FFD/PV, our results highlight a disturbing pattern that merits serious attention of adult protection agencies, seniors' advocates and disaster response organizations.","Gutman, Gloria, de Vries, Brian, Beringer, Robert, Gill, Paneet, Dault, Helena, Karbakhsh, Mojgan","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1060","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):274-274, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24763,""
"Experiencing the COVID-19 Pandemic at Age 85 and Over: An MIT AgeLab Study With the 85+ Lifestyle Leaders Panel","The oldest of older adults remain at the highest risk of developing severe illness, requiring hospitalization, or dying if infected with COVID-19. As a result, the discourse about the COVID-19 pandemic has centered on short-term sacrifices to â€œprotectâ€ older adults. Yet much remains to be known about the prolonged impact of the pandemic on the over-85 age demographic. This symposium shares findings from a longitudinal, mixed methods study with the MIT AgeLabâ€™s 85+ Lifestyle Leaders panel, a panel of octogenarians and nonagenarians convened since 2015. This symposium offers an update to a 2020 GSA session shared regarding the initial, cross-sectional work conducted in March 2020 with this panel. Findings will be drawn from a series of 85 interviews with 15 participants, 14 focus groups (xÂ¯ participants=19.3), and three surveys (March 2020, N=28;August 2020, N=18;November 2020, N=16) conducted with the panel regarding the impact of the pandemic on this group over the past year. The first presentation covers the Lifestyle Leadersâ€™ adoption and use of technology throughout the pandemic, with a focus on telehealth. The second takes an in-depth look at the unique lived experiences of Lifestyle Leaders living in senior housing communities during the pandemic. The third explores the Lifestyle Leadersâ€™ perspectives on cultivating resilience and caring for their mental health while in a pandemic. Finally, the fourth presentation shares the Lifestyle Leadersâ€™ experiences with social isolation and loneliness during the pandemic, with a focus on how family relationships and engagement in intergenerational programming have changed.","Patskanick, Taylor, D'Ambrosio, Lisa","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1068","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):276-276, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24764,""
"Mental Health and Resilience Among the 85+ Lifestyle Leaders Throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic","Recent research suggests older adults may be uniquely able to cope and cultivate psychological resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. This presentation will describe how the Lifestyle Leadersâ€™ overall mental health (including worries and experiences of social isolation and loneliness) and thoughts about the future have changed throughout the pandemic, as well as the ways in which they remained resilient throughout. For example, a survey in March 2020 indicated that 68% of Lifestyle Leaders were very or extremely worried about COVID-19, compared to only 33% in November 2020. Interviews with Lifestyle Leaders revealed that the pandemic led many to engage in more focused thinking about their own mortality and, for some, presented or compounded challenges of older age (e.g., widowhood, downsizing, etc.). The presentation will also highlight ways in which Lifestyle Leadersâ€™ past experiences and current activities have contributed to their mental health and fortitude during the ongoing pandemic.","Miller, Julie","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1070","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):276-277, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24765,""
"Changes in Dementia-Related Behavioral Symptoms Observed by Hospice Staff During COVID-19","COVID-19 infection control precautions (e.g., social distancing) and associated isolation and changes to routines can worsen dementia-related behavioral symptoms. A cross-sectional online survey was administered to 101 hospice staff (95% female;mean age 49) to investigate what dementia-related behavioral symptoms in their care recipients had changed from before to after the COVID-19 outbreak. Of the 101 participants, 47 (46.5%) reported changes in symptoms, three (3%) had not been able to physically observe/assess their care recipients, two (2%) reported changes in routines, and 49 (48.5%) reported no changes. The most common changes in symptoms were increased agitation (N=19), depression (N=16), confusion (N=10), and anxiety (N=6). Some participants (N=14) also commented on potential causes, including not having visitors and inability to go outside for normal activities while not understanding why.

"Innovative Multidisciplinary Care Models Provided via Telehealth During the COVID Pandemic","Integrated and collaborative care lead to better care. Addressing the behavioral and mental health care needs of patients results in better health outcomes. Interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary approaches to health care delivery yield more effective health care planning. A holistic approach to healthcare sees the individual as more than the sum of diseases. Research studies have supported these assertions and yet, in actual practice, they are often more aspirational than actualized. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it even more difficult to implement collaborative care delivered by varied professional disciplines. This symposium describes efforts to provide more holistic and multidisciplinary care in the primary care geriatrics practice of the Dept. of Geriatrics & Palliative Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine. This New York City practice has 4,500 patients with diverse backgrounds and a median age of 85. In the first paper, Baharlou and her colleagues describe the establishment of an IMPACT collaborative care depression model in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was adapted to be provided by telephone and uses a different psychosocial intervention than is usually implemented. Hinrichsen and Leipzig outline the successful integration of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia into geriatrics primary care to improve insomnia in older adults and deprescribe sleep medications. Munoz and her colleagues describe the ALIGN program which is an interdisciplinary team effort, informed by the social determinants of health framework, to facilitate access to an array of services delivered virtually because of the pandemic.","Baharlou, Shahla, Lindquist, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1084","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):280-280, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24767,""
"Improving Mood Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment (IMPACT) Program in Geriatrics Primary Care","Improving Mood Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment (IMPACT) is a well-established model for the treatment of depression in primary care. The COVID pandemic has caused increased distress and depression among the older patients in our New York City geriatric practice. This paper describes the establishment of a virtual IMPACT model during the pandemic in which IMPACT services have been provided via telephone. This effort was a multidisciplinary collaboration among geriatric medicine, geriatric psychiatry, social work, and geropsychology. Our IMPACT program uses a brief form of Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) for depression as the psychosocial component instead of Problem Solving Treatment. Delivery of IMPACT by telephone appears to have enhanced engagement and sustained involvement in the program compared with prior efforts to deliver it by in-person meetings. IPT as a psychosocial modality was well-received by patients. To date, treatment outcomes have been favorable and will be reported in this presentation.","Hinrichsen, Gregory, Munoz, Lizette, Currey, Katherine, Barton, Sheila, Kahan, Fay, MacKenzie, Blair, Soleimani, Laili, Baharlou, Shahla","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1085","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):280-281, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24768,""
"COVID-19, Older Peopleâ€™s Alcohol Use and Engagement With Support: A Rapid Evidence Synthesis","COVID-19, and associated restrictions, have likely impacted older peopleâ€™s alcohol use and related support needs, given disrupted routines and stress increase alcohol use in older populations. This rapid evidence synthesis aimed to examine older peopleâ€™s (aged 50+) alcohol use, and engagement with alcohol support services during COVID-19. Seventy-six articles were identified through systematic database searches, reporting 63 survey, five qualitative, three pilot, and five hospital admission studies;of general and service-user populations of older drinkers. Data were drawn together through narrative synthesis. Alcohol use increased for up to 32% of older people, including service-users;particularly older women. Increased use was linked to anxiety, depression and emotional distress. Decreased use was more common in some older populations;particularly Mediterranean. Barriers such as web access and safe transport affected older service-usersâ€™ engagement with support. Support to address hazardous alcohol use amongst older people must be prioritised in wake of the pandemic.","Kaner, Eileen, Spencer, Liam, O'Keefe, Hannah, Hanratty, Barbara, Bareham, Bethany","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1113","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):288-288, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24769,""
"Leveraging Disruptions to Create an Equitable, Age-Friendly, Learning Health System","In a learning health system, the systemâ€™s own data and the experiences of its workforce are integrated with external evidence to provide better care. In an age-friendly health system, core principles of age-friendly care are integrated into every point in the system. Disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the innovations that addressed them, present an opportunity to discuss how these two frameworks may be combined and leveraged to transform care for older adults. We will present examples of pandemic-related disruptions, including rapid changes in how patients and providers move within and between facilities and the significant toll on healthcare workersâ€™ mental health. We will also highlight innovative solutions to these disruptions that could transform healthcare systems. Critical to these points is a discussion of how these disruptions have disproportionately impacted healthcare workers and patients of color and how the innovations must be implemented using an anti-racist, health equity lens.","Lenze, Eric, Carpenter, Brian, Morrow-Howell, Nancy, Prusaczyk, Beth","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1124","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):291-291, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24770,""
"Senior Centers and LGBT Participants: Engaging Older Adults Virtually in a Pandemic","Upon the outbreak of COVID-19, recommendations to cease all non-essential in-person social services were mandated across the United States to prevent transmission to non-infected individuals. As a result, approximately 96% of all senior centers in the United States were closed to in-person programming (National Council on Aging, 2020). LGBT older adults in particular were at higher risk of isolation and declines in overall health as they were more likely to live alone, experience loneliness or have less immediate family support systems when compared to non-LGBT older adults (Yang, Chu & Salmon, 2017). The purpose of this presentation is to explore how LGBT older adult participants in senior centers transitioned to virtual programming during the pandemic. Using a risk-resiliency theory framework, the purpose of this presentation is to share the impact of virtual programming on the health and well-being of LGBT community-dwelling older adults. An exploratory, cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing an online survey to understand their needs, concerns and experiences. Participants reported a relatively easy adaptation to technology, steady participation in programs and services, satisfaction with virtual senior center programming and a consistent sense of engagement with their peers. Higher levels of engagement with senior center programs were associated with greater perceptions of social support. Additionally, stronger perceptions of social support and participation in exercise and fitness programming were associated with higher life satisfaction and lesser symptoms of depression and anxiety. Strategies for outreach, engagement and service provision will be presented.","Marmo, Suzanne, Pardasani, Manoj, Vincent, David","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1139","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):295-295, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24771,""
"Dementia Caregivers' Trajectories of Well-Being Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Residents of long-term care settings and their family caregivers have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The present mixed-methods study examines trajectories of well-being pre- and post-pandemic onset for caregivers of persons with dementia living in residential long-term care. Participants were taking part in, or had recently completed, an ongoing intervention trial to support families transitioning a relative into long-term care. Beginning in summer 2020, we started assessing caregiversâ€™ COVID-19-related experiences and added three surveys spanning 4-months beyond the 12-month parent study period to capture caregivers' adjustment throughout the pandemic. Using latent growth curve models, we estimated caregivers' (N = 104) trajectories of depressive symptoms, burden, and self-efficacy before and during the pandemic. We also tested whether the counseling intervention had protective effects for participants in the treatment group, and examined moderators including long-term care facility size, care recipient's dementia and health status, and quality of staff interactions.","Albers, Elizabeth, Birkeland, Robyn, Peterson, Colleen, Drake, Anna, Gaugler, Joseph, Mitchell, Lauren","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1207","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):311-312, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24772,""
"Environmental Gerontology During COVID-19: Aging in Place Since the Pandemic Onset","The COVID-19 pandemic is fundamentally changing neighborhood landscapes as we shelter in place and adjust our lifestyles. To age-in-place is to live in oneâ€™s home and/or community â€œsafely, independently, and comfortably.â€ The ability to age-in-place is a public health priority for all, regardless of income or health status, and requires a variety of community resources to be sustainable. Since the pandemic onset, access to neighborhood resources was limited to reduce transmission risks. Changes to economic arrangements and socio-spatial norms have profoundly impacted daily life, though how these influence health and well-being is largely unknown. It is likely that these effects may vary in different communities and contexts;for example, neighborhoods that are able to self-organize to safely provide social support and resources may fare better. This symposium brings together cutting-edge studies in urban and rural U.S. places to explicate how the pandemic is transforming aging-in-place experiences and perspectives. The first presentation shows how rapidly community-based services have adjusted operations to meet the needs of their communities. The second presentation explores strategies to provide social support in rural communities. The third presentation highlights the social health needs of a subset of older adults who had not formed friendships with their neighbors. Together, these studies suggest that close examinations of aging-in-place conditions and mechanisms from organizational, socio-spatial, and social network perspectives are evermore important amid a pandemic. We discuss the implications of these empirical findings in relation to emerging theories within environmental gerontology.","Cannon, Melissa, Finlay, Jessica, Rowles, Graham","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1228","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):316-316, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24773,""
"Social Contact Prior to COVID-19 and Longitudinal Mental Health Trajectories During COVID-19 Among Adults Ages =55","Social support protects mental health during a crisis. We examined whether prior contact with social organizations and friends/neighbors was associated with better trajectories of loneliness, depression and self-rated memory during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted latent class analysis and regression analysis on longitudinal data from the COVID-19 Coping Study of US adults aged =55 from April-October 2020 (n=3105). Overall, prior contact with friends(B=-.075,p&lt;.001), neighbors(B=-.048,p=.007), and social organizations(B=-.073,p&lt;.001) predicted better mental health amid COVID-19. Three classes were identified: Class1 had the best outcomes, whereas Class3 had the worst outcomes and were most likely to live alone(B=.149,p&lt;.001). For Class1, prior contact with social organizations(B=-.052,p=.044) predicted decreasing loneliness. For Class2, prior contact with friends(B=-.075,p&lt;.001) predicted decreasing loneliness and better memory(B=-.130,p=.011).

"ESPO and Behavioral and Social Sciences Section Symposium: Addressing the Needs of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) Communities Throughout the Stage Model","Behavioral interventions have been successfully deployed to prevent and manage chronic conditions among older persons, improve mental health, and support caregiversâ€™ ability to cope with care stressors. However, intervention effects may not be equally distributed among populations, nor equally acceptable or accessible among Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities. In this symposium, we will discuss how behavioral interventions can better meet the needs of BIPOC older adults and caregivers, who may not equally benefit from advancements in behavioral interventions due to issues such as a reliance on non-diverse study samples and lack of cultural tailoring. This symposium will be structured in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Stage Model of Behavioral, and will feature researchers whose work address BIPOC needs across the trajectory of intervention development. Representing Stage 1 research, Fayron Epps, PhD, RN, will describe her use of a community advisory council to develop a faith-based toolkit to support African Americans living with dementia and their caregivers. Next, Laura Gitlin, PhD, MA, will describe her experiences testing a Stage 3 intervention to lower depression among African Americans, including challenges advancing the culturally-tailored program to Stage 4. Lastly, Shanae Rhodes, BSN, RN will describe her Stage 2 evaluation of a conversation group created and attended by women of color to socially connect in response to COVID-19. Although speakers will describe research projects that represent specific research Stages, this symposium will have a large discussion-based component and will cover all parts of the Stage Model of Behavioral Intervention.","Sprague, Briana, Meyer, Kylie, Mingo, Chivon","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1232","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):317-317, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24775,""
"Changes in Grandparenting During the Pandemic and Effects on Mental Health: Evidence From England","Policies aiming at reducing rates of hospitalisation and death from Covid-19 encouraged older people to reduce their physical contacts. For grandparents in England, this meant that provision of care for grandchildren was allowed only under very limited circumstances. To date, evidence on changes in grandparenting during the pandemic is scarce and little is known about whether and to what extent reduction in grandchild care provision impacted grandparentsâ€™ mental health. Using pre-pandemic data from Wave 9 (2018/19) and the second Covid-19 sub-study (November/December 2020) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we first described changes in grandparenting since the start of the pandemic. Then, using regression models, we investigated associations between changes in grandparenting and mental health (depression, quality of life, life satisfaction, and anxiety) during the pandemic, while controlling for pre-pandemic levels of the outcome variables. Almost a third of grandparents reported that the amount of grandchild care during the pandemic reduced or stopped altogether, whereas 10% provided as much or more care compared to pre-pandemic levels, mostly to help parents while working. Compared to grandparents who provided grandchild care at some point during the pandemic, those who stopped altogether were more likely to report poorer mental health, even taking into account pre-pandemic health. A reduction in grandparenting was only marginally associated with higher depression. Although policies to limit physical contacts and shield older people reduced their risks of getting ill from Covid-19, our study shows the consequences of stopping childcare provision in terms of poorer mental health among grandparents.","Gessa, Giorgio Di, Bordone, Valeria, Arpino, Bruno","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1240","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):319-319, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24776,""
"Preexisting Comorbidities Predicting COVID-19 and Mortality in the UK Biobank Community Cohort","Hospitalized COVID-19 patients tend to be older and frequently have hypertension, diabetes or CHD, but whether these co-morbidities are more common than in the general older population is unclear. We estimated associations between pre-existing diagnoses and hospitalized COVID-19 alone or with mortality (during the first COVID-19 outbreak, tests performed between March 16 and April 26, 2020). In 269,070 UK Biobank participants aged 65+, 507 (0.2%) became COVID-19 hospital inpatients, of which 141 (27.8%) died. Common preexisting co-morbidities in hospitalized inpatients were hypertension (59.6%), history of falls/fragility fractures (29.4%), CHD (21.5%), T2 diabetes (19. 9%) and asthma (17.6%). However, in adjusted models, pre-existing diagnoses of dementia, T2 diabetes, COPD, pneumonia, depression, atrial fibrillation and hypertension emerged as independent risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization, the first five remaining statistically significant for related mortality. There are specific high risk pre-existing co-morbidities for COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths in community based older men and women.","Masoli, Jane, Delgado, Joao, Pilling, Luke, Kuo, Chia-Ling, Kuchel, George, Melzer, David, Atkins, Janice","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1329","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):344-345, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24777,""
"Vietnamese Families' Strength and Resilience and Healthcare Professionalsâ€™ Role During the Pandemic","Traumatic escape from Vietnam in 1975 brought 1.3 million Vietnamese refugees to the U.S. Today, Vietnamese are the largest Asian subethnic group in Houston, Texas (81,000+), making Houston the 3rd largest Vietnamese-populated city in the U.S. Despite these numbers, health research on Vietnamese population is limited. To address this gap, we developed the Vietnamese Aging and Care Survey and collected data on Vietnamese older adults (=65 years) and their caregivers (N=199). The purpose of this study was to examine the association between caregiversâ€™ caregiving characteristics and care recipientsâ€™ mental health (N=58 dyads). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used. Caregivers were on average 53 years-old, Vietnam-born (97%), and working (66%). The majority (84%) lived with their care recipients and provided care for 20+ hours/week (69%) in good/excellent health (76%). Care recipients were on average 75 years-old, Vietnam-born (100%) in fair/poor health (81%). Regression results showed stressed caregivers with more-depressed care recipients (OR=1.47, 95%CI:1.02, 2.13) but positive caregiving experiences (OR=0.85, 95%CI:0.74, 0.97) and burdened caregivers (OR=0.79, 95%CI:0.65, 0.96) with less-depressed care recipients. We found the association between stressed caregivers and depressed care recipients (Life Stress Paradigm), but care recipients becoming a â€œhelpful companyâ€ reduces caregiver burden and care recipientsâ€™ depression (Social Exchange Theory). Vietnamese families live in multigenerational households within ethnic enclaves and remain a tightly-knit family unit showing resilience to their low socioeconomic status (=25K, 91%). Leveraging a family as their strength, healthcare professionals should take a caregiver-care recipient dyad approach when planning COVID-19 pandemic interventions in Vietnamese communities.","Miyawaki, Christina, Liu, Minhui, Markides, Kyriakos","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1383","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):358-359, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24778,""
"COVID-19 Outbreaks and Control Measures Are Associated With Depression Risk Among Older Adults","Local COVID-19 outbreaks and infection control measures may affect mental health in older persons. This study aims to investigate the effects of COVID-19 outbreaks and control measures on depression risk in community-dwelling older adults in Hong Kong. With rolling cross-sectional design, telephone screenings for depressive risk were conducted among 8163 older people using Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) from February to September 2020. COVID-19 outbreaks across thirty weeks were measured using real-time effective reproductive number (Rt), infected new cases, and change of infected new cases by week. Infection control measures were assessed using four policy indices, including government response, government stringency, containment and health, and economic support. Linear regressions were used to test the associations of depression risk with COVID-19 outbreaks and control measures. We found that being female and higher Rt were associated with higher depression risk in the overall sample. In older adults without pre-existing mental health issues, higher depression risk were related to older age (t=-1.974, 95%CI[-0.006, 0.000], p&lt;0.05), a higher level of government stringency (t=2.954, 95%CI[0.007, 0.033], p&lt;0.01), and less stringent containment and health-related policy (t=-2.599, 95%CI[-0.041, -0.006], p&lt;0.01). In older adults with pre-existing mental health issues, greater changes in newly infected cases were related to higher depression risk (t=2.813, 95%CI[0.002, 0.010], p&lt;0.01). In conclusion, the effects of COVID-19 infection risk and control measures on depression risk differ among older Chinese by pre-existing mental health issues. Future public health communication could build on resilience to balance awareness of infection risks and mental health risks in older persons.","Peng, Man-Man, Liu, Tianyin, Au, Walker Siu Hong, Lum, Terry Y.

"Validation Study of the Spanish Version of the Marital Satisfaction Questionnaire for Older Persons","Interpersonal relationship quality is relevant for older adults' well-being and mental health. Studies focused on methods to evaluate marital satisfaction in older adults and the relationship of this variable with psychological correlates are scarce. This study examined the psychometric properties of the Spanish version (Castro-DÃ­az et al., 2012) of the Marital Satisfaction Questionnaire For Older Persons (MSQFOP;Haynes et al., 1992) in a sample of middle-aged and older adults from Spain. Participants were 130 individuals (60.8% women) 40 years or older (M= 60.31, SD=11) involved in a marital/partner relationship. The assessed variables were marital satisfaction (MSQFOP), marital warmth, positive emotions, frequency of arguments, perceived stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. The results from the exploratory factor analysis yielded a three factor structure (compatibility, communication, and sex) explaining 77.8% of the variance. Even though the factor structure was the same as that of the original version, some items loaded on other factors. The internal consistency (Cronbachâ€™s alpha) was 0.97. The results revealed significant (p &lt; .001) positive associations between marital satisfaction, marital warmth, and positive emotions. In addition, significant negative associations were found between marital satisfaction and frequency of arguments, stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and anxious and depressive symptomatology (p &lt; .05). The findings suggest that Spanish version MSQFOP has good psychometric properties that recommend its use with middle-aged and older adults. Marital satisfaction seems to be a relevant construct for understanding stress, well-being, and mental health in middle-aged and older adults.","Fernandes-Pires, JosÃ© AdriÃ¡n, Losada-Baltar, AndrÃ©s, Pedroso-Chaparro, MarÃ­a del Sequeros, Gallego-Alberto, Laura, Cabrera, Isabel, JimÃ©nez-Gonzalo, LucÃ­a, MÃ¡rquez-GonzÃ¡lez, MarÃ­a, Guardia, Jorge GonzÃ¡lez","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1572","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):407-407, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24780,""
"Food Insecurity and Mental Health Trajectories During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Evidence","The extent to which food insecurity impacts changes in mental health outcomes over time in the context of Covid-19 remains unknown. Using longitudinal data from a nationally representative survey, the objectives of the present study were to: (1) assess the prevalence of food insecurity among U.S. adults amid the Covid-19 pandemic;and (2) investigate the relationships between food insecurity statuses and changes in mental health outcomes over time as the pandemic unfolds. Longitudinal data from the Internet-based Understanding Coronavirus in America survey collected bi-weekly between April and December 2020 were used (n=4,068, 15 repeated measures). Adult respondents (aged =18) were asked about their food insecurity experiences and stress/anxiety/depressive symptoms. Linear mixed-effect models examined changes in mental health outcomes over time among groups with various food insecurity statuses. Overall prevalence of food insecurity was 8%. Food insecurity was consistently associated with higher levels of stress/anxiety/depressive symptoms (p&lt;0.001). Stress/anxiety/depressive symptoms declined over time among food-secured U.S adults. However, mental health trajectories of respondents with various food insecurity categories, including food insecurity status, persistent food insecurity, and food insecurity of higher severity and longer duration, remained stable or worsened over time. Moreover, the mental health gap between food-secured and food-unsecured participants widened over time. Food insecurity represents a pressing public health problem during the Covid-19 pandemic with substantial mental health implications. Persistent and severe food insecurity may contribute to mental health disparity in the long term. Food insecurity reduction interventions may alleviate the estimated alarming mental health burden as the pandemic unfolds.","Kong, Dexia, Lu, Peiyi, Kozlov, Elissa, Shelley, Mack","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1578","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):408-409, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24781,""
"Global Rise of Depression Prevalence Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic","The immense burden of depressive disorders is on the rise, with global prevalence estimates in 2017 ranging from 4% to 13%. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is likely to impact the established risk factors for depressive disorders. Thus, a rapid increase in depression prevalence can be expected amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Using epidemiologic data (N=111,225) derived from an extant online survey â€œMeasuring Worldwide COVID-19 Attitudes and Beliefsâ€ (launched by Fetzer and colleagues, March-April 2020) in 178 countries, we examined age-dependent global prevalence of depression and assessed the impact of social factors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on depressive symptomatology. Point prevalence of depression was measured using the PHQ8 standard cut-off score (i.e., =10). Correlates of depressive symptoms were analyzed with hierarchical regression modeling separately in three age groups, i.e., 18-34, 35-54 and 55+ years. We found that nearly 20% of individuals globally revealed significant symptoms of depression, including 27% of young, 15% middle-aged, 9% adults aged 55+. These data suggest that the prevalence of depression is 2-5 times higher than global estimates preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. Regression modeling explained approx. 50% variability in depressive symptoms across the three age groups. Increased risk of depression was found in females, single or divorced individuals, and those who presented poorer health and higher anxiety. Social restrictions amid the COVID-19 pandemic were marginal risks for depression. Together, this study highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of people of different ages and urges the development of increased access to psychological interventions.","Egbert, Anna, Karpiak, Stephen, Havlik, Richard, Cankurtaran, Sadiye, Ozturk, Sirinnaz","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1579","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):409-409, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24782,""
"Mental Health and Well-Being Among Individuals With a Sensory Loss During COVID-19 Lockdown Measures","Hearing and vision impairment are highly prevalent chronic conditions and are associated with poorer mental health and well-being. Mental health problems may be exacerbated by COVID-19-related lockdown measures and limitations of in-person contacts may affect those with sensory impairments more severely. We aimed to determine whether hearing and/or visual impairment were associated with worse mental health and psychological well-being during lockdown measures in Spring/Summer 2020 in Wisconsin. We included 1341 (64% women, aged 20-92 years) Survey of the Health of Wisconsin participants of a COVID-19 survey (May-June, 2020). We assessed self-reported current mental health and psychological well-being and vision and hearing impairment. Logistic regression models with vision and hearing impairments as determinants and multiple mental health and well-being outcomes were used and adjusted for age, gender, race, education, heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes. In preliminary analyses, we found associations of vision impairment with increased odds of generalized anxiety disorder (odds ratio=2.10;95% confidence interval=1.32-3.29) and depression (2.57;1.58-4.11). Individuals with a vision impairment were more likely to be taking medication for depression (1.75;1.13-2.68), report being lonely (1.65;1.00-2.64) and report hopelessness (1.45;1.01-2.08). Individuals with a hearing impairment were more likely to be taking depression medications (1.72;1.07-2.73) and to report being lonely (1.80;1.05-2.98). Sensory impairment was not associated with stress levels or sense of purpose in life. Individuals with sensory impairment may represent a particularly vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Trauma, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, and Treatment Among Middle-Aged And Older Women","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is twice as prevalent in women as in men, and is an established risk factor for chronic disease, but few studies have comprehensively assessed lifetime PTSD in middle-aged and older civilian women. We surveyed 33,328 women aged 54-74 from the Nursesâ€™ Health Study II from August 2018 to January 2020 to understand trauma exposure, PTSD based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Version 5, and trauma-related treatment use. The majority (82.2%) of women reported one or more lifetime traumas. 10.5% of those with trauma had lifetime PTSD and 1.5% had past-month PTSD. The most common trauma types were sudden or unexpected death of a loved one (44.9%) and interpersonal or sexual violence (43.5%). Almost 30% experienced occupational (nursing-related) trauma. Interpersonal or sexual violence event types explained the largest proportion of PTSD cases (33.6%) out of seven categories of events assessed. Only 25% of women with trauma ever accessed trauma-related treatment, but this proportion was higher (66.4%) among those with diagnosable PTSD, and among those with current depression (35.9%). Treatment was most common among women who experienced interpersonal/sexual violence and lowest among those with occupational trauma, but treatment satisfaction did not vary by worst trauma type. Psychotherapy was the most common type of treatment. These results demonstrate that trauma is nearly universal in middle-aged to older women, which has important implications for their long-term health and well-beingâ€”particularly in the era of COVID-19 which is likely to produce additional trauma in this population.","Sampson, Laura, Jha, Shaili, Ratanatharathorn, Andrew, Roberts, Andrea L.; Kubzansky, Laura D.; Rimm, Eric B.; Koenen, Karestan C.","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1587","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):411-412, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24784,""

We conducted a needs assessment of SDoH among 1400 patients in several ambulatory care clinics to explore the impact among older adults, across different clinical populations. Among older adults with HIV (OAH), we found lower rates of food and housing insecurity compared to older adults without HIV. Despite higher levels of COVID knowledge and prevention adherence, we also found significantly higher levels of isolation, loneliness, depressive symptoms, and anxiety among OAHs compared to those without HIV.

Data from the special midterm release of the 2020 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) were used to examine the relationship between chronic conditions and delayed care, as well as between delayed care and mental health outcomes and preventative care among Americans aged 50+ (N=3,266). Approximately 30% of respondents said yes when asked â€œSince March 2020, was there any time when you needed medical or dental care, but delayed getting or did not get it at all?â€ Of those, 55% said their provider cancelled, closed or suggested rescheduling, 28.5% decided it could wait, and 20.8% were afraid to go. Results from OLS and logistic regression, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, indicate that those with lung disease and those with a heart condition had significantly higher odds of delaying care. Delaying care was associated with significantly higher odds of poor self-rated health and feeling depressed, as well as significantly higher average hopelessness, loneliness and negative affect and significantly lower average positive affect. Surprisingly, delaying care was not associated with receiving a flu shot, cholesterol test, colonoscopy, mammogram or prostate exam in the previous two years. It is likely that the full effects of delaying health care during the pandemic have yet to be felt and there is a need to study the implications of such delays.","Wheaton, Felicia, Scatliffe, Terika, Johnson, Matilda","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1762","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):456-457, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24790,""
"Effects of a Movement-Based Mind-Body Intervention in Managing Osteoarthritis Symptoms in Older Adults","In a secondary analysis, this study examined differences in age (younger vs. older geriatric groups), gender, and living arrangement (living alone vs. living with others) in elderly patients with osteoarthritis (OA) who utilized chair yoga (CY) as an type of movement-based mind-body intervention (MMBI) for symptom management. A two-arm, assessor-blinded, randomized control trial was used to examine effects of CY (twice-weekly 45-minute sessions for 8 weeks) on pain interference, physical function, and psychosocial outcomes by gender, age, and living arrangement in older adults with OA who could not participate in traditional exercise. A total of 112 older adults completed CY or a health education program (HEP) and participated in five data collection points. Older women in the CY group showed greater reduction in pain interference during the CY intervention than those in HEP, F(4, 86) = 3.255, p = .016, <U+03B7>2 = .131. The younger group (ages 61 to 74) had decreased depression scores during the intervention, F(4, 87) = 2.598, p = .042, <U+03B7>2 = .107. Regardless of the intervention (CY or HEP), depression scores in older adults who were living alone decreased substantially during the intervention. Group-based and supervised CY interventions are recommended for older adults with OA to reduce pain interference, reduce depressive symptoms, and develop social networks. Online-based synchronous CY sessions may address physical activity needs and improve mental well-being in this population in light of physical distancing practices due to COVID-19.","Park, Juyoung, Herron, Carson","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1767","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):458-458, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24791,""
"Recruitment and Retention in Diverse Cohorts: Lessons From Community-Engaged Efforts","Effective behavioral interventions and associated trials reflect the complexity and context of the communities with which they are tailored and the behaviors they seek to address. Community-engaged methodology can serve to capture these complexities, particularly when focusing on health inequities. Significant health and healthcare disparities persist among racial/ethnic minorities and representation of racial/ethnic minorities is lacking within trials that reflects the diversity of the U.S. population. Novel approaches are needed to increase the diversity of participants within behavioral intervention research. This symposium covers the unique barriers and facilitators related to recruitment and retention across a range of populations, including African American and Hispanic/LatinX older adults with hearing loss to diverse dementia family caregivers and community-dwelling Korean American older adults. Beyond the challenges and opportunities, the symposium will focus on effective recruitment strategies. The discussion will include 1) findings from 10 years of recruiting older Korean Americans into community-based trials, 2) lessons in tailoring recruitment efforts to dementia family caregivers, 3) the integration of human-centered design into a community-engaged hearing care intervention targeting low-income and African American older adults, 4) successful recruitment and retention efforts in a community-based participatory research trial in a borderlands community, and 5) the deployment of strategies to recruit Latino, Asian, and African American older adults with depression and anxiety in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. This symposium seeks to build the evidence related to recruitment of older racial/ethnic minorities in diverse settings, which is fundamental to addressing health inequities through behavioral intervention research.","Nieman, Carrie, Han, Haera, Rebok, George","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1821","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):473-473, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24792,""
"Community Recruitment of Asian, Latino and African American Older Adults With Depression Symptoms During COVID-19","Recruitment and engagement of racial/ethnic minority older adults in clinical trials is crucial to expand implementation of evidence-based interventions for disability prevention. Public Health measures to counteract COVID-19 pandemic have increased the challenges on reaching this population. This study seeks to comprehensively evaluate a set of recruitment strategies to enroll Latino, Asian and African American older adults with symptoms of depression and anxiety during the first year of a randomized clinical trial. A partnership of three academic sites across the U.S. (NYC, MA and PR) involving several collaborations with community agencies recruited racial/ethnic minority older adults using different strategies involving bilingual interviewers calling from hospital research dataset and community agenciesâ€™ list of clients, referrals from primary care providers or psychotherapy waitlist.

"Discrimination and Mental Health During the Black Lives Matter Movement and the COVID-19 Pandemic","Discrimination has been more prevalent since the pandemic. Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement flourished in the summer of 2020 as protests against police brutality and racial injustice. However, the extent to which individualsâ€™ discrimination experiences and associated mental health outcomes change amid a global pandemic and a dramatic societal movement in American society remains unknown. This study examines the dynamic relationship of racism and/or Covid-19-related discrimination with changes in mental health in the context of BLM and Covid-19. Data were from U.S. adults (age =18) who completed the online Understanding Coronavirus in America survey in June and September of 2020 (n=3,502). Respondents were asked to attribute their discrimination experience to 8 main reasons: (1) Covid-19;(2) national origin/race/skin color;(3) gender/sexual orientation;(4) age;(5) physical feature;(6) education/income;(7) health condition;and (8) religion/other. Quasi-Poisson regression models examined the associations between discrimination and anxiety/depression/stress. Results indicated about 33% of respondents reported discrimination in June compared to 21% in September. Racism was significantly associated with more anxiety/depression/stress in June, but not in September or in the longitudinal trend. Covid-19-related discrimination was associated with elevated levels of anxiety/depression/stress in September and in the longitudinal trend, but not in June 2020. We concluded that individualsâ€™ discrimination experiences are shaped by societal contexts. Specifically, racism was the dominant discrimination attribution in June 2020 when BLM was at its peak. However, Covid-19 discrimination overtook racism as the primary attribution and showed a significant relationship with poorer mental health over time.","Lu, Peiyi, Kong, Dexia, Shelley, Mack","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1858","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):483-483, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24794,""
"Disparities in COVID-19 Related Worry Among Older Adults in the United States","Racial disparities in COVID-19 exposure, illness, hospitalization and mortality have been well-documented, however, less is known about whether African Americans and other minorities experience greater worry related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from the special midterm release of the 2020 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) were used to examine the relationship between race (white, African American, and other) and ethnicity (Hispanic/Non-Hispanic) and COVID-19 related worry among older Americans (N=2,069). Participants were asked, â€œbecause of the coronavirus pandemic how worried are you about 1) your own health, 2) the health of others in your family? 3) Your financial situation? 4) Being able to get help if you needed it from family, friends, or others? 5) What will happen in the future?â€ (0=not at all worried and 10=very worried). Results from OLS regression controlling for age, gender and education showed that compared with whites, African Americans had significantly higher average worry for all items except the last (other race did not differ). On the other hand, Hispanics had significantly lower worry, on average, for each of the five items. In addition, women had significantly higher average worry, while age was negatively associated with all items except the first. These findings indicate that in addition to the previously documented disparities in COVID-19, older African Americans experienced more worry. This has important implications for long-term physical and mental health.","Wheaton, Felicia, Scatliffe, Terika, Johnson, Matilda","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1859","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):483-483, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24795,""
"Enhancing Behavioral Health Competencies: Interprofessional Collaboration Between Social Work and Medicine","This presentation will describe the creation and findings from an interprofessional curriculum in behavioral health developed by social work faculty for medical students. Training in behavioral health is needed more than ever during a time of increased isolation and fear during the COVID pandemic. Older adults with untreated behavioral health concerns are a vulnerable population, which can result in negative effects, including emotional distress, reduced physical health, increased mortality, and suicide (IOM, 2012). Healthcare is increasingly complex with a need to focus on the physical, social, and behavioral aspects of daily living, and providers are realizing the importance of interprofessional collaboration. Towards that aim, I created a module for 4th year medical students in mental health and older adults, which is now part of their medical education curriculum. I will present outcomes in: (1) satisfaction;(2) acquired knowledge and skills (post-test);(3) application of knowledge and skills (pre-post competency assessment and comfort around asking about depression);and (4) patient outcomes (frequency of depression screening and number of referrals to social worker). Feedback from the 143 medical students is positive with 95% strongly agreeing or agreeing that this expanded their knowledge and understanding in mental health issues among older adults. At baseline, 17% of medical students were moderately to very comfortable in asking questions on the GDS compared to 42% at post-assessment. After completing the course, almost 25% of medical students made a referral to social work during their rotation. This collaboration resulted in curriculum that is both rigorous and impactful.","Keefe, Bronwyn","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1881","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):489-489, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24796,""

"Material Hardship Among Custodial Grandparents and Grandchildren's Physical and Mental Health in COVID-19","COVID-19 has increased economic hardship for many families, including custodial grandparent-headed families. We aim to examine latent classes of material hardship among custodial grandparent-headed families, to assess predictors associated with identified classes, and to investigate associations with grandchildrenâ€™s physical and mental health outcomes during COVID-19. Data was collected from a cross-sectional survey in June 2020. The sample comprised of 362 grandparents. Latent class analysis and logistic regression were conducted. Three latent classes of material hardship were identified: Class 1 (n = 232;64.1%) low overall hardship with high medical hardship, class 2 (n = 52;14.4%) moderate overall hardship with high utility hardship, and class 3 (n = 78;21.5%) severe overall hardship. Factors, such as race, household income, labor force status, financial assistance status, and trigger events to raise grandchildren, were associated with class membership. Class 2 (OR = 0.19, p &lt; 0.05) compared to Class 1 was significantly associated with grandchildrenâ€™s physical health. Our findings suggest that material hardship is heterogeneous among custodial grandparents during COVID-19, and children in households experiencing utility hardship have a higher risk for poorer physical health outcomes. Results highlight the needs to meet grandparentsâ€™ material needs and call for future research to examine the mechanism that explains the link between material hardship and grandchildrenâ€™s outcomes.","Xu, Yanfeng, Zhao, Qianwei, Schuler, Brittany, Levkoff, Sue","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.1902","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):495-495, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24798,""

"COVID-Related Perceptions of the Future and Well-Being Among Older Canadian Women","Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (SST;Carstensen, 1993) posits that time horizons - or Future Time Perspective (FTP) - change with age and/or the priming of endings. Fung and Carstensen (2006) found that SARS-CoV in 2003 naturalistically primed fragility, with consequences for both FTP and well-being. The current SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic provides a similar context: During the early months of COVID-19, age and time horizon were related to greater emotional well-being for American adults (Carstensen et al., 2020);Dozois (2020) found that, for Canadian adults, anxiety and depression rose. The current study examines relationships between FTP, COVID-19 impact, and psychological well-being in older Canadian women (N = 190;Mage = 70.38). We found that COVID-19 impact and FTP were both related to well-being;additionally, COVID-19 impact moderated the relationship between FTP and well-being.

"Testing Online Menâ€™s Groups to Promote Psychological Well-Being and Reduce Despair During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Suicide prevention is a healthcare and social justice priority. Older adults have the highest rates of suicide and the highest COVID-19 fatality rates in North America. The combined impacts of social isolation, fear of infection, apathy, and hopelessness could amplify suicide risk among older adults, as appears to have been the case during the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. Innovative interventions are thus needed to promote social interaction and reduce risk for suicide in these challenging times. We are currently testing an online version of our Meaning-Centered Menâ€™s Group (MCMG;Heisel et al., 2020), an upstream psychological intervention designed to promote psychological well-being and reduce suicide risk among men struggling with the transition to retirement, in the context of pandemic-related public health restrictions.

"Disruption to Substance and Opioid Use Disorder: The Deep South Substance and Opioid Use Rural Training Grant","The primary objective of this symposium is to describe our integrated, interprofessional behavioral health training program in substance use and opioid use disorders (SUD/OUD) across the adult lifespan (19 to 80) within our clinical psychology graduate program in the Deep South. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our assessment, treatment, and prevention delivery has occurred via telehealth. The first paper describes our Clinical Training Model in two federally qualified health centers (one peri-urban and one rural) and one residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. Graduate and undergraduate students provide prevention, assessment, and treatment with an emphasis on 1) mindfulness-based relapse prevention, 2) literacy-adapted treatment for chronic pain, and 3) trauma and recovery. The second paper describes the participant population. Specifically, participants (N = 105) receiving prevention, assessment and treatment services report high levels of substance and opioid use and are underserved, impoverished, and have low levels of education and health/mental health literacy. The third paper explores the relation of age, adverse childhood experiences, and PTSD symptoms within the context of substantial or severe SUD/OUD. The final paper describes issues surrounding telehealth delivery in the rural south with underserved populations. The discussant, an expert in integrated, interprofessional telehealth delivery across the adult lifespan, will provide insight on program sustainability and dissemination. Given the pronounced need for SUD/OUD treatment in underserved populations with attention to the intersection of age and urban/rural residence, this project is poised to make a substantive impact across the adult lifespan.","Allen, Rebecca, Jacobs, Lindsey, Rybarczyk, Bruce","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2018","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):527-527, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24802,""

"Changes in Modes of Social Contact and Their Links With Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing has been emphasized for older adults because of their greater physical health risks. Using data from the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP), we examined how older adults may have changed their frequency of contact with others via various modes (i.e., in-person, phone calls, messages, and video calls) since the pandemic started, and how these choices may be impacting their mental health. From September 2020 through January 2021, NSHAP respondents (N=2,554 age 50-94 with data from 2015-16) completed a survey via web, phone, or paper-and-pencil. Although some older adults reported reducing their in-person contact with out-of-household family (38%) and friends (40%) since the pandemic started, some also increased contact with them via remote modes such as phone calls (25% and 16% with family and friends respectively);emails, texts, or social media messages (26 and 21%);and video calls (24 and 18%). Net of demographics, living alone, survey mode, and 2015-16 levels of the respective mental health variables, those who decreased in-person contact with family were less happy (B=-0.12, SE=0.06, p=.035), had higher loneliness scores (B=0.23, SE=0.09, p=.011), and more frequently felt depressed (B=0.10, SE=0.05, p=.055). In the presence of decreased in-person contact, increases in remote modes of contact had no net remediating impactâ€”a pattern also found when analyzing contact with friends. Results indicate a persistent adverse effect of reduced in-person contact on mental health despite increased contact with family and friends via remote means.","Finch, Laura, Hawkley, Louise","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2061","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):539-539, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24804,""
"Loneliness and Isolation Versus Wisdom and Compassion During the Pandemic","Our studies of US national-level samples across adult lifespan as well as older adults in California and in Italyâ€™s Cilento region have found a consistently strong inverse correlation between loneliness and wisdom, especially its compassion component. Loneliness and social isolation are associated with worse physical and mental health while the reverse is true for wisdom and compassion. Follow-up of older adults in San Diego during the Covid-19 pandemic showed no change in this pattern. While the effects of the pandemic and the necessary social distancing were heterogeneous, older adults generally handled these stresses better than younger adults, with less loneliness and greater compassion. Our recent studies assessing EEG responses to emotional stimuli as well as alpha and beta diversity in gut microbiome showed opposing biological patterns characterizing loneliness and wisdom.

This study aimed to 1) examine changes in older adult technology use during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2) determine if technology use moderates the relationships between decreased in-person communication/activity and the mental health of older adults during the pandemic. Data were taken from the NHATS COVID-19 Round 10 (n= 3,188). Older adults engaged in more technology-based activity (b= .237, p&lt;0.001), technology-based healthcare communication (b=.112, p&lt;0.001), and technology-based food acquisition (b= .214, p&lt;0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to before. Technology use did not moderate the relationship between decreased in person personal communication (b= .021, p= 0.662)/activity (b= .045, p= 0.749) and mental health during the pandemic. Although older adults are utilizing technology more during the pandemic, it might not be protective against negative mental health outcomes from physical distancing.","Drazich, Brittany, Perrin, Nancy, Samuel, Laura, Hladek, Melissa diCardi, Szanton, Sarah, Cudjoe, Thomas, Taylor, Janiece, Li, Qiwei","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2163","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):567-567, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24807,""
"Online Dignity Therapy and Photo Collages: The Narratives of Israeli and Italian Older Adults in the COVID-19 Era","The social isolation imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic has significantly affected older adults, and has impacted both their physical and mental health. The pandemic has led to an increase in ageism associated with poorer mental health and a lower sense of dignity, self-esteem and contribution to society. This cross-cultural study involved 24 participants from Italy and Israel aged 79 to 92. The aim was to develop a brief art-based online intervention to enhance the participantsâ€™ sense of dignity and sense of meaning in life during this time of crisis. The process focused on the creation of digital photo-collages that captured the participantsâ€™ values through three perspectives: their past experiences, legacy, and future perspectives. It employed an arts-based research methodology to explore the participantsâ€™ experiences by analysing their relationship with the artistic expression, the photo collage, and its creative process.","Keisari, Shoshi, Elkarif, Talia, Mola, Giada, Testoni, Ines, Piol, Silvia","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2169","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):568-568, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24808,""
"Emerging Telehealth Advances for Mental and Cognitive Health in Late Life","Over the last year, mental health services offered virtually have increased significantly in response to COVID-19. The rapid adoption of telehealth practices has raised many questions about how to develop and deliver effective interventions for older adults targeting their mental and cognitive health. In this symposium, we present on the feasibility of mental and cognitive health interventions for older adults using telehealth methods with particular focus on how adoption of these telehealth tools have been impacted by the current pandemic. Dr. Touchett and colleagues will present data on the telehealth utilization disparities among older veterans with comorbid disabilities and discuss ethical considerations when providing care for older adults. Dr. Kornblith and colleagues will present pilot data on the feasibility of GOALS, a video telehealth cognitive remediation group intervention for older adults with cognitive and emotional dysfunction related to traumatic brain injuries. Dr. Gould and colleagues will present pilot data on the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a brief video-delivered self-management intervention BREATHE for older veterans with anxiety disorders. Dr. Weiskittle and colleagues will present their work on the development and dissemination of a brief 8-week telephone group intervention for homebound older adults targeting social isolation. Dr. Jacobs and colleagues will share their findings of a telephone delivered mindfulness intervention for caregivers and persons with dementia. Finally, the discussant, Lauren Moo, MD, an expert in assessing the efficacy of telehealth interventions will tie findings together and provide directions for future research and innovation.","Woolverton, Cindy, Bamonti, Patricia, Moo, Lauren","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2171","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):568-569, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24809,""
"Ushering in the Silver Age of Telehealth: Addressing Telehealth Disparities for Older Adults With Disabilities","One silver lining of COVID-19 has been the ushering in of â€˜the golden age of telehealthâ€™. However, this unplanned rapid conversion to telehealth left many providers and clinics unprepared to address systemic barriers that adversely affect older adults, particularly those with disabilities. Data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse suggest that the rapid adoption of telehealth in mental health clinics during COVID-19 widened telehealth utilization disparities for older Veterans (65+) with disabilities. With 4.5 million Veterans 55+ who have at least one disability more attention to addressing this widening gap is needed. For those with hearing, vision, and complex mobility impairments, there are unique challenges to initiating telehealth services. Dr. Touchett will present preliminary findings while discussing ethical and contextual considerations when using telehealth with older Veterans who have disabilities, while discussing ways to facilitate robust clinical encounters for this population.","Touchett, Hilary","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2175","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):569-570, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24810,""
"Dissemination of a COVID-19 Rapid Response Telehealth Group Addressing Worry and Social Isolation Among Older Adults","In response to the urgent need for virtual mental health treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic, an 8-week group intervention deliverable over video or telephone was developed and disseminated in March 2020. Manual content addressed social isolation and information related to COVID-19. In August 2020, a national web-based provider feedback survey was disseminated to evaluate feasibility of the manual. Respondents (n = 21) across a variety of geriatric mental health clinics reported this intervention to be effective and clinically useful with their patients in providing social support and in mitigating COVID-19 anxieties.

"Social Isolation in Long-Term Care Facilities Related to COVID-19: Effect on Resident Anxiety and Care","Loneliness is a common problem in long-term care. It has been associated with a higher risk of depression, aggressive behaviors, and anxiety and may be a risk factor for cognitive decline. Loneliness can exacerbate social isolation. The COVID-19 emergency brought on measures in Florida, beginning in March 2020, to separate nursing home (NH) and assisted living community (ALC) residents from each other and family members to limit virus spread. This study examines results of a survey with Florida NH (N=59) and ALC (N=117) administrators concerning effects of these measures. Scaled (1-5, lowest to highest) data indicate that resident anxiety was higher in NHs (M=3.40) than ALCs (M=3.17). Care disruptions related to limited resident-to-resident contact also were worse in NHs (M=3.74) than in ALCs (M=3.21), while care disruptions related to loss of family support were higher among ALCs (M=3.19) than in NHs (M=2.86). Implications of these findings will be discussed.","Sakib, Nazmus, June, Joseph, Peterson, Lindsay","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2207","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):579-579, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24812,""
"Experiences of Interdisciplinary Providers Deploying Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The expansion of telehealth services during COVID-19 is critical for healthcare delivery. This study describes the facilitators and barriers experienced by providers integrating telehealth during COVID-19. The sample consisted of 441 interdisciplinary providers (RNs, APNs, PAs, DPTs, RDs, mental health counselors) who were faculty or alumni of a college of nursing and health professions and completed the online telehealth provider survey. 53% of respondents were nurses/APNs, 59% implemented telehealth within the first week of federal legislation, and 48% received telehealth training once the pandemic started. Respondents reported telehealth changed several services provided during the pandemic (e.g., increased prescription of longer-term medication refills, increased counseling sessions). The greatest reported barrier to utilizing telehealth during the pandemic was the older adultsâ€™ ability to utilize technology. Understanding the facilitators and barriers experienced by providers during COVID-19 will lead to more robust healthcare delivery models to enhance health outcomes in older adults.","Moore, Katelyn, Hathaway, Zachary, Gonzalez-Kruger, Gloria, Montgomery, Kymberlee, DiMaria-Ghalili, Rose Ann, Coates, Martha","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2234","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):586-586, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24813,""
"Social Relations, Stress, and Racial Health Disparities","This symposium brings together four papers that address racial health disparities by investigating stressful aspects of social relations at different points in the life course. Cleary and colleagues focus on racial disparities in psychological health by testing cross-sectional effects of intergenerational stress over time. In particular, they investigate effects of network composition on the relationship between mothers' stressors and their children's depressive symptoms at three time points over 23 years. Camacho and colleagues use longitudinal data from the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project to examine cognitive decline among U.S. African-American, Latino, and White adults aged 60 and above. Results indicate loneliness predicted greater global cognitive decline over time in all groups. However, race differences in this association were found across cognitive function domains. Turner and colleagues consider dementia caregiving challenges among non-Hispanic Blacks. Data from five focus groups were analyzed to reveal distinctive challenges to caregiver health during the COVID-19 pandemic including increased burden and barriers to service access. Finally, Sol and colleagues examined the bidirectional association between loneliness and self-rated health over time among a racially diverse sample. Findings illustrate racial patterns in how loneliness at midlife influences health in later life. Antonucci will discuss the role of stress from social relations as a means to fully understand racial disparities in health across the life course.","Ajrouch, Kristine, Webster, Noah, Antonucci, Toni","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2242","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):588-588, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24814,""
"Views of Aging During the Corona Pandemic","In the Covid-19 pandemic, media stories and government reports have emphasized the heightened risk of being â€œoldâ€ and placed a spotlight on the way we think and talk about older adults and aging. In this symposium we investigate how the pandemic and the public discourse about older adults has shaped views of aging in different countries. Bellingtier et al. report on German childrenâ€™s views of older adults before and during the pandemic. Children placed greater distance between themselves and older adults both before and after the pandemic, suggesting early ageism in children that predates the pandemic. Levy et al. provide experimental evidence that media stereotypes about aging and Covid-19 influence the mental health of older American adults, both in positive and negative. Schwartz and Ayalon found that greater perceptions of age-based discrimination in the healthcare system by Israeli adults 50+ were significantly related to greater Covid-19 worries. Greater worry can motivate older adults to take precautions, but be detrimental if it becomes too high. In line with this finding, Tingvold et al. found in a study with older adults from Luxembourg that more Covid-19 worry predicted feeling older four months later, but only for those in worse health. Finally, Terracciano examined longitudinal change in subjective age and found that American adults reported feeling younger after the emergence of Covid-19 than before, suggesting that perceptions of aging partly reflect a coping process to counter the negativity in the media.","Bellingtier, Jennifer, Kornadt, Anna","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2261","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):592-592, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24815,""
"Impact of Media-Based Age Stereotypes on Older Individualsâ€™ Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, stigmatization of older persons has increased in traditional and social media. It was unknown whether this negative messaging could be detrimental to the mental health of older individuals, and whether the relatively uncommon positive messaging about older individuals could benefit their mental health. To address these gaps, we designed age-stereotype interventions based on actual news stories that appeared during the pandemic. As expected, the exposure of older individuals to the negative-age-stereotype-messaging interventions led to significantly worse mental health (more anxiety and less peacefulness), compared to a neutral condition;in contrast, the positive-age-stereotype-messaging interventions led to significantly better mental health (less anxiety and more peacefulness), compared to a neutral condition. The results demonstrate the need for media messaging aimed at empowering older individuals during the pandemic and beyond.","Chang, E.

"65 & Thrive: Improving Patient Length of Stay, Readmission, and Quality of Care by Becoming an Age-Friendly Hospital","Data indicates that older persons will increase in numbers along with having an increase of life expectancy in the United States. Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Centerâ€™s Utilization Department developed â€œ65 & Thriveâ€â€”an age-specialized initiative to provide holistic care that preserves independence, quality of life, prevents functional and cognitive decline, and promotes both patients and their families to continue thriving. The initiativeâ€™s focus is guided by the 5 Mâ€™s model on mobility, medication, mentation, multi-morbidity, and what matters. Case management staff were given age-sensitivity trainings, improved workflows and made assessments that identified, addressed, and secured resources for patients throughout their hospitalization. Silver Angel volunteers were specially trained to prevent physical and mental decline and focused on activities to prevent delirium, depression and falls. The volunteers visited with patients daily for these interactions. The initiative was piloted in April 2020 on a stroke telemetry unit and since then the hospital has seen a significant decrease in the overall annual readmission rates by 3.1% when compared to 2019. The average length of stay for older adult patients;however, increased from 4.05 to 4.83 days unfortunately due to COVID-19. This initiative demonstrates the necessity to expand â€œ65 & Thriveâ€ throughout the hospital and ultimately to other Kaiser Permanente medical centers to best provide holistic care to older adults.","Vien, Tracey, Bobroff, Stella, de Ocampo, Ricardo","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2273","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):594-595, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24817,""
"Technology Use Among Cancer Patients Pre- and Post- COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Dementia","COVID-19 has highlighted increasing reliance on information and communication technology (ICT) and challenges in access and use. ICT access also provides resources that benefit usersâ€™ mental health. Our study describes changes in the use of ICT before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among cancer patients with and without dementia. We identified 196 (1.6 million weighted population) older adults with a self-reported cancer history who participated in both 2019 and 2020 National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). In 2019, cancer patients with dementia (9.9%) were less likely (adjusted OR 0.29;95%CI, 0.11-0.78) to use information technology (IT) for health matters (contacting medical providers, handling health insurance matters, obtaining information about health conditions, and ordering prescription refills) compared to those without dementia. In contrast, dementia status was not associated with communication technology (CT) use (email or texts) or IT use for personal tasks (grocery shopping or online banking). IT use for personal tasks was inversely associated with anxiety symptoms (adjusted OR 0.22;95%CI:0.06-0.83) and CT use was inversely associated with depressive symptoms (adjusted OR 0.25 (95%CI:0.07-0.97). In 2020, regardless of dementia status, all cancer patients increased their virtual (email/phone/video) contact with family, friends (3.4%-7.0%), and medical providers (17.2%-36.2%) while decreasing in-person contact (10.0%-15.7% and 21.8%-24.2%, respectively) during the pandemic. This study suggests that there are potential unmet daily needs for patients with comorbid cancer and dementia that may be met with improved ICT access. Such challenges are of increasing concern as COVID-19 has resulted in increased ICT reliance for older adults.","Li, Weixin, Ornstein, Katherine, Li, Yan, Liu, Bian","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2579","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):692-693, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24818,""
"Intergeneration Bonding: An Acceptability and Feasibility Study","Social isolation and loneliness are detrimental risk factors to older adultâ€™s physical and psychological well-being and quality of life. Given the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation has risen. Social isolation affects younger adults as well and may increase the chances of depression and anxiety. In this study, we tested the acceptability and feasibility of an Intergenerational Bonding (IGB) Program with older and younger adults. Participants include students aged 19-29 at the University of Nebraska at Kearney and older adults above the age of 60 residing in the community. First, we surveyed younger and older adults to determine their interest level in participating in an IGB Program. Both groups of participants rated their interest in different activities. The most popular activities among both groups included engaging in conversations, board games, and an exchange of skills. Neither of the groups was in favor of participating in free housing opportunities or sports-related activities. Response rates were high in young adults but low in older adults, due to lack of trust. Then, in a pilot study, we measured the feasibility and acceptability of the IGB Program. Older adults residing in independent dwellings, assisted living environments, nursing homes and members of community groups were invited to participate in the intergenerational program. Response rates of older adults were low. Further, establishing collaboration with institutions such as nursing homes was not easy despite initial interest. Building trust and working with community activity group facilitators would be beneficial in recruiting older adults.","Rezac, Lauren, McKelvey, Miechelle, Saidi, Ladan Ghazi","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2644","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):712-713, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24819,""
"DNR Linked to Reduced Depressive Symptoms in Nursing Home Residents During COVID-19 Illness","Prior work shows that older adults who establish future care plans have a lower risk of depression. Residents in long-term care may benefit from establishing a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order when cardiopulmonary resuscitation is unlikely to provide medical benefit. The current study examines whether having a DNR order in place prior to COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with fewer depressive symptoms during the illness course. Residents at a NYC skilled nursing facility with a positive COVID-19 PCR test between 3/1/2020 â€“ 6/1/2020 were included (N=338). The Minimum Data Set (3.0) was used to examine residentsâ€™ Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores 1-30 days after diagnosis, functional status, cognition, age, and sex. A retrospective chart review was conducted to determine whether participants had an established DNR, DNI, and/or DNH order before developing COVID-19. Forty-eight percent, 46%, and 12% of participants had a DNR, DNI, or DNH order prior to COVID-19 illness, respectively. Average PHQ-9 score was 1.65 (SD=2.37). A hierarchical regression showed that after controlling for age (ÃŸ=-.13, p=.06), sex (ÃŸ=-.08, p=.28), cognition (ÃŸ=.14, p=.04), and functional status (ÃŸ=.23, p=.001;R2=.10, p=.001), having a DNR (ÃŸ=-.22, p=.006) order in place prior to COVID illness was associated with lower endorsement of depressive symptoms during illness (<U+0394>R2=.04, p=.01). Results suggest that establishing a DNR in long-term care residents when appropriate may potentially buffer depressive symptoms during illness in nursing home residents regardless of their age, sex, cognitive abilities, and functional status. Future examination of the underlying mechanism is warranted.","Mak, Wingyun, Burack, Orah, Reinhardt, Joann, Weerahandi, Himali, Canter, Benjamin, Boockvar, Kenneth","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2668","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):720-721, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24820,""
"The Interplay of COVID 19, Remote Contact, and Race as Risk Factors for Depression","There have been concerns about how social distance policies and lockdowns due to COVID-19 have affected loneliness and depression among older adults in ways that may magnify racial disparities in health. We conducted panel logistic regression analyses with random effects using national data spanning 2004 to 2016 and the COVID-19 module (Wave 2020, administered in June and September) from the Health & Retirement Study (n=15,504). Individuals living in a nursing home, diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and 64 years of age or younger were excluded from analyses. Age, gender, Hispanic status, education, marital status, working status, wealth, BMI, physical activity, smoking, drinking, and difficulty in meal preparation, eating without help, and grocery shopping were included as control variables. Findings suggest that older adults did not appear to experience increased loneliness during the pandemic relative to prior waves. However, Wave 2020 was an independent risk factor for depression. Greater in-person contact (OR: 0.97, CI: 0.95-0.99, p-val: 0.001) and remote contact (OR: 0.99, CI: 0.97-0.996, p-val: 0.008) were each independently associated with slightly decreased depression. Older Black Americans tended to be more depressed than their White counterparts (OR: 1.50, CI: 1.20-1.86, p-val: &lt;0.001). However, a null interaction between race and wave suggested that Black Americans did not experience more increased depression in 2020 relative to prior waves. Analyses suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic might change at-risk groups for depression and communication by remote technology â€“ often considered an inferior but necessary stopgap measure. Implications for practice and policy will be discussed.","Bae, Youngjoon, Abbott, Katherine, Pachucki, Mark","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2672","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):721-722, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24821,""
"A Comparison of Mental Health in a Sample of Older Women Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially impacted lives globally. Due to age-related risks, the older adult population has uniquely experienced negative changes caused by the pandemic. Research has also shown that the pandemic has disproportionately affected women. Therefore, it is important to understand how the mental health of older women has been impacted during this global crisis. This study aims to examine the differences in mental health indices in a sample of older women before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, participants include 201 women (aged 60-94) who completed an online survey of self-report measures assessing depression, anxiety, alcohol use, binge eating, positive affect, and emotional quality of life (QOL). We conducted one-way ANOVAs to compare each mental health construct in two samples of older women collected pre- and peri-pandemic. Results indicated that the peri-pandemic group reported significantly higher anxiety (F = 5.25, p = .02), with a trend for more role limitations due to emotional problems (F = 2.79, p = .09), than the pre-pandemic group. No significant differences emerged for levels of depression, alcohol consumption, binge eating, positive affect, or emotional wellbeing between groups. These findings point to the psychological resilience of older adults in the face of extreme adverse events, including this global crisis. Older women, while impacted differently during the COVID-19 pandemic, reported minimal exacerbations of mental health problems compared to older women pre-pandemic.

"Linking Coping Behavior and Mental Well-Being in Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","In addition to being a significant source of stress, the COVID-19 pandemic required older adults to drastically alter their behaviors and routines. People cope with stress in various ways;however, the pandemic was a unique situation that warranted investigation of this topic. This study aimed to identify the ways older adults coped with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the relationship between specific coping behaviors and perceived stress and mental health. Two hundred thirty-one older adults, ages 53 to 90, completed an online survey about coping behaviors used to manage stress during the pandemic, as well as measures of loneliness, depression, perceived stress, and the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives. â€œTalking with friends and familyâ€ (83%) and â€œincreased television watching or other screen-timeâ€ (68%) were the most common coping behaviors. A series of one-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA), with race, gender, age, education, and income included as covariates, revealed â€œeating more oftenâ€ and â€œdrinking alcoholâ€ were associated with greater loneliness, depression, and stress. â€œIncreased screen timeâ€ was also associated with greater depression and stress. â€œEngaging in more family activities,â€ was associated with a less negative impact of the pandemic, and â€œtalking with friends and familyâ€ was associated with less loneliness. These findings suggest older adults who coped with stress of the COVID-19 pandemic through more eating, drinking, and the second most common behaviorâ€”watching TVâ€”were more likely to report poorer well-being, and may benefit from programs to boost virtual social engagement.","O'Connor, Dugan, Smith, Jennifer","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2680","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):724-724, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24824,""
"Mental Health Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Older Adults With Chronic Conditions","The COVID-19 pandemic may have a negative impact on mental health, especially among older adults with chronic conditions who are more vulnerable to severe illness. This cross-sectional qualitative study evaluated how the pandemic has impacted the ways that adults aged 50 and older with chronic conditions managed their mental health. Participants included a total of 492 adults (M = 64.95 years, SD = 8.91, range = 50 â€“ 94) from Michigan (82.1%) and 33 other U.S. states who reported a diagnosis of at least one chronic condition and completed an anonymous online survey between May 14 and July 9, 2020. Participants provided open-ended responses to a question about the pandemicâ€™s impact on how they were taking care of their mental health. The data were coded to ascertain relevant concepts and were reduced to develop major themes. We determined four main themes. The pandemic impacted how participants took care of their mental health through: (1) pandemic-related barriers to social interaction;(2) pandemic-related routine changes;(3) pandemic-related stress;and (4) pandemic-related changes to mental health care. Taken as a whole, this study indicates that older adults with chronic conditions encountered a variety of challenges to managing their mental health in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also demonstrated considerable resilience. These findings identify potential risk and protective factors to target as part of personalized interventions to preserve their well-being during this pandemic and in future public health crises.","Polenick, Courtney, Kaba, Diarratou, Meyers, Summer, Zhou, Annie, Daniel, Nikita, Salwi, Shreya, Lee, Vanessa","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2681","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):724-724, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24825,""
"Older Age and Other Protective Factors of Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the US","Research conducted early in the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., March 2020) suggested that older adults were less likely to experience negative pandemic-related mental health than younger people. We investigated whether this age-related advantage persisted during the July 2020 spike in COVID-19 cases and investigated links between coping strategies and mental health. We used data from the Understanding America Study (UAS) to conduct a secondary data analysis of participants (N = 5,753) aged 18-110 years (M=46.20, SD=12.88) who completed online self-report surveys twiceâ€”once immediately prior to the July spike in cases, and again during the spike. Surveys assessed engagement in protective behaviors (e.g., wearing a mask, washing hands), coping strategies (e.g., calling family/friends, getting extra exercise, meditating), and anxiety and depressive symptoms (using the Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-4). Multiple regression analyses were used to identify predictors of anxiety and depression during the spike, controlling for previous anxiety and depression, race, ethnicity, income, education, and marital status. Older age and engaging in protective behaviors were associated with less anxiety, whereas coping by calling family/friends was associated with more symptoms, R2 = .71, F(16, 5736) = 885.90, p &lt; .001. Coping by calling and getting extra exercise were associated with fewer depressive symptoms, whereas coping by using social media was associated with more symptoms, R2 = .72, F(16, 5736) = 906.65, p &lt; .001. These findings highlight age as a protective factor for anxiety but not for depression and underscore the importance of social support as a protective factor for mental health.","Smith, Kelly, Chappell, Amanda, Spalding, Rachael, Wilson, Jenna, Haliwa, Ilana, Strough, JoNell","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2683","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):725-725, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24826,""
"Online Leisure Activities for Sustained Mental Health Well-being in Older Adults with COVID-19 Mitigation","Older adults (OA) experience psychosocial distress from the COVID-19 pandemic mitigations. While their participation in leisure and recreation activities (LRA) would be ameliorating, we do not know how LRA OA engages for their mental health (MH) well-being with COVID-19 mitigation. This scoping review aimed to trend the evidence on the types of LRA OA engage for their MH well-being across the young-old continuum (60-69 years) through to older-old (80 years and above) in the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched the following electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, JBI-ES, and Epistemonicos for LRA studies by OA with COVID-19 mitigation. To be included, we considered empirical articles published in English on LRA of OA 55+ years-old. Another criterion required articles describing those activities' qualities and the impact of LRA on MH and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. We resulted in seven empirical studies, two of which implemented in the USA and one from the USA and Canada, Spain, Israel, and Japan. Findings following narrative synthesis revealed trending evidence on OA to engage in online LRA for social, cognitive /intellectual, and emotional health. Leisure-time physical activity reduced negative MH symptoms as anxiety and depression in OA under COVID-19 threat. In conclusion, the present review's trending evidence suggests that OA engagement in social, physical, mental, and cognitive LRA enhanced their MH and overall well-being. Activities delivered by way of the Internet and television provided a cluster of beneficial opportunities for the OA mental health needs under the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rivera-Torres, Solymar, Mpofu, Elias, Keller, M.

"Perceived Impact of COVID-19 on Older Adultsâ€™ Mental Health and Barriers to Mental Health Care","COVID-19 disproportionately impacted older adults in terms of fatalities, but also increased stress, isolation, and loneliness (Chen, 2020). We examined older adultsâ€™ anxiety, depression, and barriers to mental healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic and their perceptions of these variables prior to the pandemic. Further, we explored whether any perceived changes differed based on geographical location (rural, suburban, urban). Data were collected online between mid-June and mid-July of 2020 from 244 individuals aged 65-82 years (M=68.3, SD=3.5). The sample was primarily White (91%) and female (60%);most (n=119) lived in suburban settings, with 63 in urban and 60 in rural settings. Repeated-measures ANOVAs at alpha=.01 showed that depressive symptoms, measured by the CESD-10 (p&lt;.001), and anxiety symptoms, measured by the GAD-7 (p&lt;.001), increased during the pandemic as did mental healthcare barriers related to transportation (p=.004) and beliefs that depression is a normal part of aging (p&lt;.001). Only transportation concerns differed based on where older adults lived;those in rural (p&lt;.001) and urban (p=.004) settings reported greater transportation barriers than those in suburban settings. No differences over time were found for barriers related to help-seeking (p=.403), stigma (p=.156), knowledge/fear (p=.180), finding a therapist (p=.030), ageism (p=.302), psychotherapist qualifications (p=.265), physician referrals (p=.207), or finances (p=.818).

"Physical Activity, Social Support, and Mood in Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Research shows that increased physical activity is associated with improved mood and reduced symptoms of depression in older adults. Prior research has also found that loneliness and social isolation have a significant impact on the mental and physical well-being of older adults, with higher amounts of social connectedness and social activity associated with more frequent positive mood states. Overall social isolation is increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic and this could have a large impact on the physical and mental health of older adults. A group of 36 community dwelling older adults (Mean age = 70.5) completed questionnaires measuring physical activity, social activity, and social support, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses found that perceived social support and average social network size significantly predicted positive mood states (F(2,33)=3.32, p&lt;0.05) accounting for 16.7% of the variance, with a large effect. After adding average number of hours of sedentary activity the model was not significant. Perceived social support was more predictive of positive mood (ÃŸ=0.32) compared to network size (ÃŸ=0.17). There was a trend for the same three variables to predict negative mood (F(3,32)=2.76, p=0.06) accounting for 22% of the variance. Sedentary behaviour was the most predictive (t=2.68, p&lt;0.05, ÃŸ= 0.49). This suggests that perceived social support is most predictive of positive mood, and sedentary behaviour is predictive of negative mood during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Inman, Morgan, Murphy, Clare, Strong, Jessica","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2687","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):726-726, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24829,""
"Protective and Risk Factors of Depression Among Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic adversely impacted the mental health of older adults. This study aims to explore the associations between protective/risk factors of depression during the pandemic and to examine the differences in these associations by marital status. Data from the Health and Retirement Study 2020 COVID-19 module, released in February, 2021, were used. The level of resilience during the pandemic was selected as a protective factor. The level of COVID-19 pandemic concern was selected as a risk factor. Among older adults aged 51 years and older, the weighted regression model found that higher levels of COVID-19 concern were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms (p&lt;0.05), whereas higher levels of resilience were associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms (p&lt;0.05). Marital status moderated the association between COVID-19 concern and depressive symptoms. Never-married people were at higher risk of depressive symptoms than married people when COVID-19 concerns increased. It is important to enhance support for never-married people during the pandemic to protect their psychological well-being.","Lee, Yeonjung, Terada, Tyran","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2688","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):726-727, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24830,""
"Social Isolation, Depressive Symptoms and Perceived Neighborhood Environment of Older Adults During COVID-19","Social isolation has been recognized as a social problem with negative effects on psychological well-being. Older adults are disproportionately affected by social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from the 2020 Health and Retirement Study COVID-19 Project, this study examined the relationship between social isolation and depressive symptoms among two groups of respondents differentiated by whether themselves or their social relationships were diagnosed with COVID-19. This study also explored the moderating role of perceived neighborhood environment. Depressive symptoms were measured using the eight-item CES-D. The index of social isolation was generated using five indicators, including living alone, no social participation, and less than monthly contact with children, family members, and friends. The moderator assessed two aspects of the neighborhood environment, including physical disorder and social cohesion. The results of bivariate analyses showed that respondents who were affected by COVID-19 were younger, more likely to be female, Hispanic, and Non-Hispanic Black, and with lower levels of social isolation. The results of multiple regression analyses indicated that social isolation was associated with more depressive symptoms, but this relationship was found to be only significant among respondents who were affected by COVID-19. Perceived neighborhood environment significantly moderated the relationship, as the effect of social isolation on depressive symptoms was stronger for respondents with more neighborhood physical disorders and less social cohesion. This study has implications for practice and policy, in that it underscored the importance of enacting strategies to improve the neighborhood environment, particularly for socially isolated older adults during the COVID-19.","Li, Ke, Tang, Fengyan","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2689","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):727-727, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24831,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Concerns on the Mental Health of Older Adults: A Rapid Review","The Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic continues to drastically impact older adults. Despite COVID-19 being linked to increased social isolation and loneliness, more research is needed on the psychological effects associated with older adultsâ€™ concerns of the pandemic. The current review explores associations between the COVID-19 Pandemic and older adultsâ€™ mental health to increase awareness and understanding. For this rapid review, empirical peer-reviewed source documents were identified through a computerized search using APA PsycInfo and Google Scholar bibliographical databases covering the years 2019 to 2021. The following keywords and combinations were used: â€œolder adults,â€ â€œCOVID-19,â€ and â€œmental health effects.â€ Relevant exclusion criteria were applied, and all related English-language journal articles were read. 47 articles met inclusion criteria. Eight associated COVID-19 stress with loneliness, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and poor psychological well-being, with three additional articles reporting elevations in women. Three articles revealed mixed findings regarding the impact of age on psychological variables. 13 articles evaluated changes among those with psychological/psychiatric diagnoses, and six explored physical activity and depression. Of the remaining articles, two concentrated on nutrition;seven examined routines, behaviors, and societal or risk perceptions;two evaluated coping mechanisms;and three examined emotional distress changes. Understanding COVID-19â€™s psychological impact on older adults will take time. This rapid review revealed mixed findings regarding COVID-19 related concerns on older adultsâ€™ psychological well-being, with multiple demographic variables uniquely impacting these outcomes.

"The Relationship Between Covid-19 Anxiety and Well-Being Outcomes in Older Veterans","Understanding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of vulnerable populations is essential in planning for care post pandemic and preparing for future pandemics. One such population often overlooked during the COVID-19 pandemic is older veterans, whose military service often results in physical and psychological effects that creates vulnerability to the impacts of COVID-19 beyond their age risks. The purpose of this research was to examine the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and well-being in older veterans. Survey data was collected from the end of June 2020 through August 2020 and examined the well-being of veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research looked at the 122 veterans in the sample who were aged 65 and older. Age ranged from 65 to 94 years (M=73, SD = 5.0). The sample was predominately Male (90%), White (83%), educated (65%) and married (69%). Moderate to high COVID-19 anxiety was reported in 38 percent of the sample. Older veterans who reported moderate to high COVID-19 anxiety were 5 times more likely to report loneliness, 11 times more likely to meet the diagnostic cut off for anxiety, 3 times for depression, 2 times for PTSD, and 3 times for moderate to severe insomnia. Results revealed a clear association between COVID-19 anxiety and the well-being of older veterans. Findings have implications for ensuring well-being outcomes are restored in older veterans as cause for pandemic anxiety is reduced. Results also demonstrate older veterans should be recognized as a vulnerable population in preparation for care future pandemics.","Kintzle, Sara, Castro, Carl","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2693","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):728-728, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24833,""
"COVID-19 Impacts on Mental Health Care in Veterans Health Administration Community Living Centers","COVID-19 forced VHA Community Living Centers (CLC) to adjust how mental health (MH) care is provided. Beginning March 2020, admissions and staff entering CLC space were restricted in response to the pandemic. Some care shifted from in-person to virtual. Veterans were more isolated due to visitor restrictions and cancellation of communal activities. Pre-COVID, CLC teams cared for an already complex population â€“ 80% of residents had a MH diagnosis (24% with serious mental illness). Changing resident composition and increased isolation may intensify challenges in providing MH care. Using VHA administrative data, we assess the impact of the changing CLC environment during the pandemic by comparing monthly average rates of MH diagnoses and provision of MH care and as-needed psychotropics to CLC residents pre-COVID (Oct 2019 â€“ Feb 2020) to the COVID period (Mar 2020 â€“ Feb 2021). CLCs experienced a 26% decline in the monthly resident census. However, the monthly percentage of residents with a serious mental illness increased 13%. Pre-COVID, virtual MH encounters were received by 2% of residents;35% received an in-person MH encounter. During COVID, 8% received a virtual MH encounter and 33% received in-person. As-needed antipsychotics remained unchanged, while as-needed benzodiazepine prescriptions decreased 15%. Despite increased MH concerns, CLC teams did not appear to respond with increased pharmacological interventions. Rather, teams seem to have maintained clinical service connection for those with MH concerns. Documenting successful approaches for addressing MH needs during this challenging time will be instructive for future care during times of crisis.","Jedele, Jenefer, Griffin, Cameron, Karel, Michele, Curyto, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2696","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):729-729, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24834,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on Older Adults: Changes in Health Access, Health, Socialization and Adaptive Coping Activities","Indirect effects of stay-at-home guidelines may negatively affect mental health by reducing health self-care behaviors and engagement in social participation. This study reports on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on community-dwelling older adultsâ€™ perceived physical and mental health and everyday health behaviors. 126 older adults participated in a county-wide telephone survey during June-July of 2020, asking about changes in mental and physical health, and adaptations in health behaviors. We investigated the effects of three negative everyday health behavior changes during the pandemic (changes in health services access, perceived changes in health, and increased social isolation) as well as two positive everyday health behaviors (adherence to stay-at-home guidelines to reduce risk, and adaptive coping activities) on mental health and COVID-related distress. Examples of active coping strategies were stockpiling resources, spiritual practices, or outreach to others. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, and multiple regressions characterized the impact of COVID-19 on perceived mental health. Descriptive data included changes in health service access, changes in mental and physical health, reduced social engagement, increased adherence to guidelines, and increased adaptive coping activities. Significant predictors of mental health impact of the pandemic were changes in health service access (ÃŸ = .18, p &lt; .05), health changes (ÃŸ = .25, p &lt; .01), and adaptive coping activities (ÃŸ = .21, p &lt; .05). Findings suggest COVID-19 distress may be alleviated with improved health care access and increased social contact. Mental health challenges may also benefit from increased engagement in adaptive coping activities.","Scott, Judith, Qualls, Sara, Yun, Stacy","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2702","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):731-731, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24835,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Participation in Community-Dwelling Older Adults: A Cross-Sectional Analysis","Public health guidelines to prevent spreading COVID-19 place older adults at risk of loneliness and social isolation. Evidence suggests that participation protects older adults from such detrimental outcomes, therefore we aimed to identify the factors associated with participation in life roles among older adults living in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a telesurvey on a random sample of community-dwelling older adults living in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, between May and July 2020. Outcome measures included participation in life roles, physical function, physical activity, mobility, mental health, nutrition, and demographics. We conducted two multivariate regression analyses with the Late Life Disability Instrumentâ€™s (LLDI) frequency and limitations scales as the dependent variables. Candidate factors were organized by International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) framework domains;personal factors, body functions and structures, activities, and environmental factors. A total of 272 older adults completed the telesurvey (mean age 78 Â±7.3 yrs, 70% female). Age, using walking aids, driving status, household income, education, mental health, nutrition, physical function, and dwelling type explained 47.1% (p&lt;0.001) of the variance observed in LLDI frequency scores. Using walking aids, driving status, receiving health assistance, mental health, and physical function explained 33.9% (p&lt;0.001) of the variance observed in LLDI limitation scores. These findings highlight factors from multiple ICF domains that are associated with participation limitation and frequency among older adults during the pandemic.

"Loneliness Among US Adults During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings From the COVID-19 Coping Study","We aimed to estimate the prevalence of loneliness and identify the key sociodemographic, employment, living, and health-related risk factors for loneliness among middle-aged and older adults during the early COVID-19 pandemic in the US, when shelter-in-place and social distancing restrictions were in place for much of the country. Data were collected from online questionnaires in the COVID-19 Coping Study, a national study of 6,938 US adults aged 55-110 years, from April 2nd through May 31st, 2020. We estimated the population-weighted prevalence of loneliness (scores of =6/9 on the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale), overall and according to sociodemographic, employment, living, and health-related factors. We used population-weighted modified Poisson regression models to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between these factors and loneliness, adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and education. Overall, 29.5% (95% CI: 27.9%, 31.3%) of US adults aged 55-110 were considered high in loneliness in April and May, 2020. In population-weighted, adjusted models, loneliness was most frequent among those with depression, those who were divorced or separated, those who lived alone, those diagnosed with multiple comorbid conditions, and individuals who were unemployed prior to the pandemic. In conclusion, we identified subpopulations of middle-aged and older US adults that were highly affected by loneliness during a period when COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders were in place across most of the country. These insights may inform the allocation of recourses to mitigate loneliness during times of restricted activity.","O'Shea, Brendan, Finlay, Jessica, Kler, Jasdeep, Joseph, Carly, Kobayashi, Lindsay","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2704","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):732-732, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24837,""
"The Impact of COVID-19: Perspectives of Recreational Therapists Working with Older Adults","This study explored the perspectives of recreational therapists (RT) from Pennsylvania and Michigan and how COVID-19 has impacted older adults and their roles in various settings. COVID-19 safety restrictions limiting social interaction with both peers and families had the potential for negatively impacting the social and emotional well-being of older adults (Van Orden et al., 2020) and the roles of therapists who work with them. Because peer socialization and physical activity programs prevent falls (Cameron et al., 2018) and improve depressive symptoms (Harvey et al., 2015), a better understanding of COVID-19 impact is significant. From a qualitative viewpoint, 14 RTs from various levels of care were interviewed to better understand their perspective on the impacts of COVID on older adults and their own practice. Hour long interviews conducted via zoom focused on organizational changes, role changes, and impact on older adults. After recordings were transcribed, multiple researchers classified, summarized, and tabulated the data. A consensus method determined common themes. From the RTâ€™s perspective, older adults have not only been negatively impacted in the social domain. While many older adults showed resilience, others were impacted physically, emotionally, and cognitively. Moreover, an increased importance on meaningful engagement, recreation, and leisure emerged. Technology became an essential tool in interpersonal connection. Teamwork, personal self-care, and coping were integral to providing effective care. Post pandemic, RTs are concerned about the challenge of reengaging older adults in groups but are certain that technology will continue to be used in a more expansive way in programs.","Kemeny, Betsy, DeVries, Dawn","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2706","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):732-732, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24838,""
"The Lived Experience of Assisted Living Administrators During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Since March, 2020, administrators in assisted living (AL) residences have been challenged to provide the best care for their populations while undergoing a pandemic. Because nothing like this has happened in the recent past, AL administrators had to make many new decisions. The purpose of this phenomenological study is to reflect on the lived experiences of AL administrators during the COVID pandemic. Using a semi structured interview, individual interviews of four AL administrators from different AL communities were conducted via Zoom. The interviews contained questions related to the participantsâ€™ experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic. The recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim into MAXQDA. Data analysis followed a modified Giorgi approach, by reviewing the recorded interviews, categorizing the data into meaning units, then situated units, generalized units, and then themes. Results indicated that AL administrators have been adapting to constantly changing and conflicting regulations. The pandemic incited fear, depression, moral distress, but also hope for the future. The data shows a multitude of feelings and actions related to the well-being of the staff, residents, and residentsâ€™ families. The limitations of this study include a small sample size and the evolving nature of the pandemic in Michigan. Opportunities for future research would be to compare our findings to the experience of other ALâ€™s in the United States. The results show the complexity of AL administratorsâ€™ lived experiences during the pandemic and highlight important considerations if an event like the pandemic were to occur again.","Hill, Elizabeth, Davis, Rebecca, Greer, Paige, Strouse, Susan","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2707","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):732-733, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24839,""
"Variables Impacting Nursing Home Goals of Care Discussions and Order Implementation During COVID-19","Nursing home (NH) residents are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, disproportionately suffering from severe illness and death. As such, resident Goals of Care (GOC) often had to be quickly established to ensure treatment preferences were known and respected. This study examined variables related to the occurrence of GOC discussions and added orders (Do Not Resuscitate, Do Not Intubate, and Do Not Hospitalize), including demographic, physical functioning, cognitive impairment, depression, number of diagnoses, and Optum participation (Optum provided added specialized care by nurse practitioners who routinely address GOC preferences). Subjects were 286 COVID positive residents from a large NYC NH. All data were obtained from the NHâ€™s electronic medical records. Patient median age was 81 n (interquartile range 71-88), 59% were female, 61% were long stay (stay &gt;100 days) and 39% were short stay. Using bivariate correlations we found that older short stay residents were more likely to have GOC conversations. Additionally, older, cognitively impaired, Optum participants were more likely to have orders added. When all independent variables were entered into binary logistic regressions, only older age and being a primary English speaker were significantly related to the occurrence of GOC conversations (<U+25A1>2= 21.76**;N=278;Nagelkerke R2 = .10), while older age and being an Optum participant were related to added orders (<U+25A1>2=32.18**;N=164;Nagelkerke R2 = .24). Results have implications for (1) ensuring the GOC wishes of diverse populations are known and abided by and (2) improving the quality of clinician â€“ resident GOC discussions.","Burack, Orah, Reinhardt, Joann, Mak, Wingyun, Weerahandi, Himali, Canter, Benjamin, Boockvar, Kenneth","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2711","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):734-734, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24840,""
"â€œHunger Would Kill us Instead of the Pandemic:â€ Eldersâ€™ Responses to COVID-19 in Ethiopia","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unpredictable challenges globally. Urban elders in Global South nations are among the major population groups vulnerable to COVID-19. A qualitative case study design was used to uncover the challenges and sources of support for poor urban elders during COVID-19 lockdown in Ethiopia. Data were collected from 27 elders age 60 and above in Debre Markos Town via in-depth interviews and document review. Narrative data were analyzed using thematic data analysis. Four prominent themes were identified: 1. Food insecurity (â€œHunger would kill us instead of COVID-19â€), 2. Hopelessness (â€œFeeling hopeless and begging to dieâ€), 3. Social isolation (â€œWe prefer social support rather than food donationsâ€) and 4. Gratitude (â€œFeeling thankfulâ€). The physical distancing program introduced to contain the pandemic isolated many elders and diminished their capacity to access support from others needed to perform their daily activities. An institutional welfare system is needed to ensure older adults in the Global South can live a joyful and dignified life, even through a global pandemic. Moreover, a special emergency fund to meet older adultsâ€™ basic needs during a pandemic like COVID-19 should be introduced to minimize the effect of crises on vulnerable groups like destitute older adults in Ethiopia.","Kotecho, Messay, Adamek, Margaret, Takele, Anduamlak","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2714","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):735-735, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24841,""
"No Visitors Allowed! The Impact of Covid-19 Restrictions on the Psychosocial Well-being of Nursing Home Residents","The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic changed life for everyone, but especially for nursing home residents. In March 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services enacted nursing home restrictions in response to the pandemic regarding visitation from outside family/friends and changes to facility activity programs. Despite the public health concern prompting these restrictions to prevent virus spread, these sudden changes affected nursing home residentsâ€™ relationships with their spouses/partners. As part of a larger study to identify the nursing home policies and practices that preserve relationships among nursing home residents with spouses/partners, participants shared facilitiesâ€™ restrictions, social connection practices, and effect of coronavirus restrictions on residentsâ€™ relationships with spouses/partners. The study utilized both an online survey (81 respondents) and ten telephone interviews with nursing home social workers in four Southern states. Twenty-eight percent of participants reported that no visitors were allowed;while 25% allowed couples to visit with one another as usual was reported by 25%. The most noted practices to maintain social connections were phone calls, video calls, and â€˜windowâ€™ visits between residents and families/friends;however, â€œitâ€™s just not the same. Itâ€™s affected them greatlyâ€. The interviews revealed further details about the detrimental effect of the COVID-19 restrictions on nursing home residentsâ€™ overall mental health and attachment relationships with spouses/partners. These results highlight the importance of maintaining social connections between residents and spouses/partners. Nursing home social workers can develop policies and practices that enhance relationships and connections under all circumstances and work with other health care team members to ensure implementation.","Shaw, Shanae, Csikai, Ellen","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2718","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):736-736, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24842,""
"We Need to Protect Ourselves: The Mental Burden of Managing Type 2 Diabetes among Black men During the COVID19 Pandemic","As COVID-19 swept across the United States in 2020, it appeared to infect and kill Black Americans at a disproportionately high rate. When examining the literature pertaining to the pandemic, present COVID-19 research focuses on physical health, but research regarding mental health and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic are lacking, especially among Black men and minority men in general. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to learn more about the type 2 diabetes (T2D) management related stress among Black men (n=22) during the COVID-19 pandemic. One on one interviews were conducted via Zoom video conferencing to gain an understanding of the experiences of managing T2D in a pandemic environment. Three main themes emerged from the study, which are: (1) my stress levels during this time, (2) diabetes specific stressors, and (3) coping mechanisms. Black men with diabetes may need psychosocial support that holistically addresses general developmental and diabetes-specific stressors and their influences on one another. Recognizing how Black men react to stress is essential for understanding and addressing their disproportionally high prevalence of stress related to management of chronic conditions and avoiding additional complications, morbidity or mortality. It is imperative to examine how stress and coping frameworks relate to menâ€™s health, in general, but specifically in Black men.","Sherman, Ledric, Pattin, Anthony, Pattin, Carla, Strong, Michelle, Vera, Sara","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2723","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):737-738, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24843,""
"Changes in well-being during the COVID pandemic: A longitudinal study of older adults","The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis the world has not seen in a century, with older adults faced with unique impacts due to their increased vulnerability and need to social distance. This research examines changes in physical and mental health and quality of life among older adults in the upper Midwest during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventy older adults aged 70-97 participated in three phone interviews (April [Time 1], June [Time 2], and October [Time 3] 2020) focusing on experiences coping with the pandemic and understanding overall changes in well-being. Participants rated their quality of life, physical health, and mental health on a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being â€œPoorâ€ and 5 being â€œExcellent.â€ Self-reported quality of life, mental health, and physical health initially declined between retrospective pre-COVID and Time 1 scores, with gradual increases seen across all three variables for Time 2 and Time 3 scores. Thematic analysis of qualitative responses for each interview wave identified salient themes of: 1) reduced quality of life, 2) distraction and routine, 3) loss and uncertainty, and 4) resilience and adaptation. The significance and meaning of these themes shifted across each time point. For example, the reduced quality of life theme initially encompassed loss of activities, later shifted to concerns about struggles to maintain relationships, and finally focused on hope for the future. Findings will be discussed in light of the significance of change over time as well as policy and practice implications for older adults.","Huseth-Zosel, Andrea, Fuller, Heather","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2730","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):740-740, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24844,""
"Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Older Adults With Chronic Conditions","The COVID-19 pandemic may have adverse health implications, particularly among older adults with chronic conditions who are at increased risk of severe illness. This cross-sectional study examined the early health impacts of the pandemic among adults aged 50 and older with chronic conditions. Participants included 700 adults (M = 64.60 years, SD = 8.85, range = 50 â€“ 94) from Michigan (82.4%) and 33 other U.S. states who reported at least one chronic condition and completed an anonymous online survey between May 14 and July 9, 2020. Of these, 488 also provided open-ended responses. Individuals reported lower illness self-efficacy, less consumption of fruits, vegetables, and fried foods, and lower physical activity, along with greater alcohol use since the pandemic. About half (42.7%) reported worsened sleep. One in five (20.1%) reported at least some difficulty obtaining medications and over half (60.4%) reported at least some difficulty receiving routine care. Almost two-thirds (63.9%) had delayed preventative care and one in five (19.3%) had delayed essential medical treatment. Nearly half (42.6%) avoided contacting care providers about a physical health concern and one in eight (12.9%) avoided reporting mental health concerns. Qualitative data revealed that the pandemic has influenced how participants cared for their physical health through following guidelines related to COVID-19;coping with daily routine changes;greater awareness of self-care;mental health impacts;and health care disruptions. Older adults with chronic conditions report distinct pandemic-related challenges for self-care and health care that should be addressed in interventions to maintain their health and functioning.","Polenick, Courtney, Lee, Vanessa, Salwi, Shreya, Daniel, Nikita, Zhou, Annie, Meyers, Summer, Kaba, Diarratou","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2733","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):741-741, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24845,""
"COVID-19 Concerns, Depression and Loneliness in Middle-Age and Older Adults","The coronavirus pandemic forced many people to restrict their activities and social interactions out of fear and due to local health regulations. This study examined whether oneâ€™s self-reported level of concern related to COVID-19 was associated with loneliness and depressive symptoms. Using early release 2020 data from the Health and Retirement Study (N=2,759 adults over age 50), we conducted ordinary least-squares and logistic regressions, controlling for age, gender, education, marital status, self-rated health, and exercise. Higher levels of self-reported concern about the coronavirus pandemic were associated with more depressive symptoms (B=.05, p&lt;.01) and increased odds of being lonely (OR=1.05, p&lt;.01). Female sex, lower education, not being married, worse self-rated health, and lack of exercise were associated with more depressive symptoms and higher odds of being lonely, while older age was associated with lower depression but higher odds of loneliness. These results suggest that mental health assessments should include measures specifically asking about COVID-19 concerns and experiences (e.g., COVID-19 diagnosis, death of close friends or family due to COVID-19, unable to attend important events). The pandemic has raised public awareness of the negative consequences of social isolation and acted to destigmatize mental illness, and this could encourage middle-aged and older adults to seek professional help for depression.","Curl, Angela, Wolf, Katie","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2740","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):743-743, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24846,""
"Loneliness During COVID-19 and Modes of Social Contact Use Among Older Adults","Due to social distancing and isolation recommendations, COVID-19 resulted in older adultsâ€™ greater reliance on technology to contact friends and families. While the mental health of older adults during COVID-19 has been well explored, less is known about how changes in modes and frequency of social contact is associated with loneliness. Using the National Health and Aging Trends Study COVID-19 data, this study assessed how the frequency of varying modes of contact (e.g., phone/email/text, in-person visits, videocalls) during the pandemic was associated with feelings of loneliness during COVID-19 among community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries (n = 2149). Participants were asked if they felt lonely â€œmore often,â€ â€œless often,â€ or â€œabout the sameâ€ compared to before the outbreak started. Multinomial regression analyses indicated that, compared to those who reported daily in-person visits, the odds of having more feelings of loneliness as compared to about the same as pre-COVID-19 was significantly higher among those who reported having in-person visits a few times (OR=2.17,CI=1.08-4.36), at least once (OR=2.37,CI=1.11-5.04), and never/less than once a week (OR=3.37, CI=1.59-7.16) while controlling for demographics, household, and social network size. Compared to daily use, use of phone/email/text at least once (OR=0.44, CI=0.201-0.965) or a few times (OR=0.76,CI=0.58-0.99) a week was associated with lower odds of reporting more feelings of loneliness versus about the same. Results suggest that greater use of technology that promote social engagement improves social connectedness and decreases COVID-19 related loneliness among older adults, and highlights the importance of older adultsâ€™ access to technology, including reliable internet.","Dhakal, Usha, Koumoutzis, Athena","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2743","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):744-744, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24847,""
"Older Adultsâ€™ Worry about COVID-19: Associations with Experiences of COVID-19 Among Social Connections","The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the physical and mental health of older adults, yet it is unknown how much older adults worry about their own exposure. As older adults are at increased risk for severe complications from COVID-19, understanding patterns of worry may inform public health guidelines and interventions for this age group. We investigated older adultsâ€™ worry about COVID-19 in the early months of the pandemic and associations with familial/friendâ€™s diagnosis or disease symptoms. Data comes from the baseline (April/May 2020), one-month, and two-month follow-up surveys from the COVID-19 Coping Study, a national longitudinal cohort study of US adults aged =55. We used linear regression models to investigate the association between self-reported familial/friend diagnosis or symptoms with pandemic worry, accounting for demographic factors and individual diagnosis or experience of COVID-19 symptoms. Participants (Baseline=4379, 1 month= 2553, 2 month=2682) were 67 years old on average, 72% were female, 5.7% were non-White, and 80.5% had a college degree. At baseline, 26.6% of participants had friends or family who had been diagnosed or experienced symptoms of COVID-19. Having friends or family diagnosed or with symptoms of COVID-19 (B=0.08, SE=0.04, p&lt;.05), being female (B=0.42, SE=0.03, p&lt;.001), and having higher educational attainment (B=0.06, SE=0.02, p&lt;.001) were significantly associated with greater worry about COVID-19. These associations were consistent over 3 months. Understanding if worry about the pandemic correlates with following public health guidelines is a key next step so intervention strategies can prioritize older adults and their social networks.","Leggett, Amanda, Koo, Hyun Jung, Kobayashi, Lindsay, Finlay, Jessica, Lee, Hannah, Baker, Elaina","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2744","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):744-744, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24848,""
"Social Isolation in Older Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The impact on Quality of Life and Mental health","To mitigate the spread of COVID-19, countries worldwide enacted quarantines, particularly for older adults, as mortality from COVID-19 is inequitably distributed among this group. Notably, social isolation in older adults is associated with a heightened risk of cardiovascular, autoimmune, and mental health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety). Furthermore, the mental health of women in particular has been greatly impacted by the pandemic. Although previous research indicates that social isolation among older adults is a â€œserious public health concernâ€, less is known about the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this issue. The primary objective is to investigate the effects of social isolation on mental health indices and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older women in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants include 77 postmenopausal women (aged 60+) who completed self-report measures online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Controlling for education and annual household income in all analyses, we used linear regression models to investigate the effects of social isolation on depression, anxiety, alcohol use, binge eating, and the 8 domains of the SF-36. Results indicate that, when controlling for education and income, social isolation significantly predicted depression, binge eating, and poorer HRQOL in all 8 domains of the SF-36 (all pâ€™s &lt; .01) Social isolation did not predict anxiety and alcohol consumption when controlling for these sociodemographic variables. Enrollment is ongoing;this poster will report updated results. Results indicate the continued need for creative avenues to improve social connectedness during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Marshall, Victoria, Sandhu, Robina, Kanzler, Kathryn, Espinoza, Sara, Keel, Pamela, LaCroix, Andrea, Musi, Nicolas, Kilpela, Lisa","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2746","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):745-745, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24849,""
"Physical Activity and Aging: Exploring Motivations of Masters Swimmers","Physical activity has many benefits for the optimal health of older adults (e.g., lowering risk of cardiovascular disease, depression, dementia and falls). However, less than one in four Americans meets guidelines for physical activity and evidence suggests inactivity increases with age. A growing number of unhealthy older adults will strain resources. Masters athletes are one segment of the population that some promote as exemplary because of their remarkable physical functioning. Swimming is a global, fast-growing sport in Masters athletics. This qualitative study explored the motivations and barriers of older adult (60+ years of age) members of a Masters swim club in Southern California. The researcher used purposive sampling to diversify the sample by selecting male and female participants (N=18) from multiple geographical areas. Guided by a primary research question: Why do Masters swimmers choose swim late in life, when most of their age cohort are becoming less physically active, the researcher conducted semi-structured interviews to delve into the lived experiences of the participants, solicited peer feedback and employed Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Four main themes emerged: Masters swimming provided an enjoyable way to slow physical decline;participants felt camaraderie;working out with a group provided challenge and achievement that reinforced their identity as swimmers;and their practice greatly reduced stress. A formidable barrier was revealed when most of the participants expressed longing and regret that they could not swim due to COVID risk and safety guidelines. These findings can be used to design community programs to promote lifelong physical activity participation.","Brilliant, Susan, Claver, Maria, LaPlace, Patti, Schlesinger, Cynthia","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2883","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):787-787, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24850,""
"Testing Predictive Factors of Depressive Symptoms among Grandparents under the COVID-19 Pandemic","An estimated 69.5 million Americans are reported to be grandparents. Among them, about 10% are raising grandchildren and the number of grandparents who are raising grandchildren (GRG) is increasing. Previous research on GRG suggests that the unexpected caregiving duties may lead to negative physical and mental health including more depressive symptoms when compared to non-caregiving grandparents (NGRG). Additionally, grandparent-grandchild relationships determined by emotional availability (EA) of the grandparent may be impacted. These factors might further be complicated, especially as it relates to the health and well-being of GRG, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the overarching goal of this presentation is to use the biopsychosocial model to present a conceptual framework to test the mental well-being of GRG during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this presentation, we will 1) summarize appropriate literature on GRG;2) share a COVID-19 health and well-being assessment survey designated for GRG in order to assess their health before and since the COVID pandemic;and 3) propose a conceptual model to investigate and test the protective role of physical activity and GRGâ€™s EA in the grandparent-grandchild relationship for the mental health of GRG. In our model, we argue that GRG experience more COVID-19 pandemic-related stress and more depressive symptoms when compared to NGRG. This proposed conceptual model offers one way to test the predictors of depressive symptoms on GRG. Future testing has the potential to shed new light on the development of appropriate intervention programs tailored to maintain the mental health of GRG.","Jiao, Yuqin, Fruhauf, Christine","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2938","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):804-804, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24851,""
"Caregiving during the Covid-19 pandemic: Factors associated with caregiver stress and cognition","Caregivers are critical in helping persons with dementia (PWD) live at home longer, but the caregiving experience is associated with increased risk of physical (Vitaliano et al., 2003;Son et al., 2007;Fonareva & Oken, 2014) and cognitive decline among caregivers (Pertle et al., 2015;Lathan et al., 2016;Vitaliano et al., 2017). The present study examined the caregiver experience during the time of the Covid-19 pandemic including factors associated with caregiver stress, burden, and self-reported cognition (i.e., prospective and retrospective memory errors). In a sample of 56 caregivers of PWD, caregiver stress was positively associated with reports of greater life change resulting from Covid-19 and a greater frequency of care recipient depressive and disruptive behaviors;however, caregiver stress was not associated with care recipient memory problems. Additionally, caregiver burden was negatively associated with ratings of preparedness for the pandemic, but not with availability of support services or the amount of time spent caregiving. Further, frequencies of prospective and retrospective memory mistakes were positively associated with perceived stress, but not with caregiver burden. These findings reveal that caregivers of PWD report greater experiences of stress associated with the Covid-19 pandemic and other facets of their caregiving responsibilities (e.g., care recipient depressive and disruptive behaviors, frequency of memory mistakes). This work is a first step in identifying areas in which caregivers need assistance and expanding the literature on caregiver cognition by measuring self-reported everyday memory performance.","Turner, Rachael, Reese-Melancon, Celinda, Harrington, Erin","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2945","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):806-806, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24852,""
"Caregiving Intensity and Psychosocial Impact of COVID-19 in Dementia and Non-Dementia Caregivers","COVID-19 has adversely impacted the well-being of informal caregivers (CG) due to infection risk, changes to the home environment, and changes to resource availability. CG of persons living with dementia (PLWD) may be especially vulnerable due to the intensity of care provided. We compared CG activities and well-being among CG who did and did not care for PLWD during COVID-19. We conducted an anonymous online survey from April 2020-present. Respondents self-identified as 18+ years and CG to a child or adult with mental health or medical conditions. CG answered questions regarding hours of care provision and caregiving activities, and completed measures of CG burden (Zarit Burden Inventory-4), loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire), and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2). Of the 258 respondents within the United States, 86 cared for PLWD (33%;88% female;56Â±12 years) while 172 did not (66%;87% female;49Â±14 years). Compared to non-dementia CGs, more CGs of PLWD provided 40+ hours of caregiving/week (36% vs. 49%, p&lt;.05), performed more caregiving activities (8.5 vs. 10.5, p&lt;.01), and assisted with more activities of daily living (55% vs. 73%, p&lt;.01). Compared to non-dementia CG, more dementia CG reported CG burden (53% vs. 67%;p&lt;.05) and loneliness (7.3 vs. 9.1, p&lt;.05). No differences in depressive symptoms or anxiety were found. Results suggest that existing needs of CG of PLWD may be exacerbated by the stressors and concerns of the pandemic, necessitating higher levels of support.","Humber, Marika, Truong, Angeline, Suresh, Madhuvanthi, Jacobs, Josephine, Thomas, Sam, Lee, Trevor, Risbud, Rashmi, Trivedi, Ranak","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2946","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):806-807, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24853,""
"Development and Initial Evaluation of the Caring Through COVID-19 Psychotherapy Group for Family Care Partners","This project details the development and initial evaluation of a manualized psychotherapy support group for family care partners of persons living with dementia, specially designed to address pandemic-related stressors. The authorship team, consisting of clinical geropsychologists, developed a treatment manual based on existing protocols, such as: cognitive behavioral therapy for pandemic-related stress, grief management and ambiguous loss, and caregiver family therapy. The resulting 8-week Caring Through COVID-19 psychotherapy group was piloted in an outpatient mental health clinic via tele-mental health with six family care partners of persons living with dementia. All participants were women and spouses or partners of the care recipient;mean age was 70.5 (SD = 9.07). Preliminary data showed a non-significant and small reduction in depression (d = .22) and non-significant moderate reductions in caregiver burden (d = .52) and pandemic-related stress (d = .64). Moderate non-significant improvements were observed in general caregiver self-efficacy (d = .62) and self-efficacy for emotional regulation (d = .67). The majority of participants reported that the content of the group was novel (83%) and relevant (83%);the most utilized topics outside of the group were accepting emotions (100%) and challenging negative cognitions (83%). Overall, most participants were very or extremely satisfied with the group (67%). Additional data is currently being collected with another cycle of the group (n = 4). Preliminary findings suggest that the Caring Through COVID-19 group may be beneficial for supporting family care partners during the pandemic. Considerations for implementation and future plans for dissemination will be discussed.","Plys, Evan, Williams, Kadija N.; Tyrrell, Caitlin J.; Weiskittle, Rachel","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2947","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):807-807, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24854,""
"Family Caregiving and Depression among Older Adults in Japan: A Cross-Sectional Study during the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 infections are particularly lethal in older adults;thus, social activities of older adults and their families in the community have been restricted. The threat of infection, restrictions on social activities, and limitations on the provision of care services for older adults could increase family caregiversâ€™ burden and impact their mental health. This cross-sectional study examined the association between family caregiving and change in depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2020, we conducted a mailed questionnaire survey on a random sample of functionally independent community-dwelling older adults in a semi-urban area of Japan. Based on the depression status between March and October 2020, participants were classified into four groups: â€œconsistently non-depressed,â€ â€œdepression onset,â€ â€œrecovering from depression,â€ and â€œremained depressed.â€ Participants were assessed for providing care for their family members or not. Caregiver participants were also assessed on their caregiving role (primary or secondary), the severity of their care-recipientâ€™s needs, and an increased caregiver burden. Data from 957 older adults were analyzed. The participantsâ€™ mean age (SD) was 80.8 (4.8) years, and 53.5% were female. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that family caregiving was associated with depression onset (OR=3.17 [95%CI=1.57-6.40], p=0.001) and remaining depressed (2.53 [1.36-4.71], p=0.004). Particularly, primary caregivers, those providing care for family members with severer care need-levels, and those with an increased caregiver burden had a higher risk of depression onset and remaining depressed. Family caregivers could have severe mental health conditions during the pandemic. Developing a support system is essential to protect their mental health.","Noguchi, Taiji, Hayashi, Takahiro, Kubo, Yuta, Tomiyama, Naoki, Ochi, Akira, Hayashi, Hiroyuki","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.2955","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):809-810, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24855,""
"Mobile Intervention Outcomes Compared Pre and Post-Shelter-in-Place for Middle Aged and Older Adults","The Meru Health Program (MHP), a mobile app-based intervention targeting depressive symptoms, teaches mindfulness and cognitive behavioral skills through video lessons and practices. MHP includes integrated asynchronous therapist and peer support. Our aim was to examine whether using the MHP reduced loneliness and improved mental health quality of life (QoL) in middle-aged and older adults with depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionairre-9 [PHQ-9] = 7). The timing of this study partially overlapped with the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic resulting in Californiaâ€™s shelter-in-place (SIP) orders. Fifty participants (42 enrolled prior to SIP) completed baseline assessments with a mean age of 57.06 (SD = 11.26;Range: 40-81 years) exhibiting mild to moderate depression symptoms (PHQ-9: M = 12.28, SD = 5.47). Participants enrolled pre-SIP exhibited significant improvements in QoL, F(1,38) = 12.61, p = .001, <U+03B7>2 = .25, and significant declines in loneliness, F(1,38) = 5.42, p = .03, <U+03B7>2 = .13. Improvements in QoL were found for post-SIP participants as well, F(1,44) = 6.02, p = .02, <U+03B7>2 = .12. In contrast, loneliness did not improve for the post-SIP cohort, perhaps alluding to the increased impact of social isolation during SIP. Our findings indicate MHP can improve QoL symptoms before and during SIP. It is possible that middle-aged and older individuals may require more individualized support during SIP to help alleviate loneliness when social connection is severely restricted. MHP remains a promising and scalable solution for those middle-aged and older adults struggling with mental health symptoms.","Carlson, Chalise, Alfaro, Ana, Chick, Christina, Bruce, Martha, Hoffman, Valerie Forman, Gould, Christine","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.3116","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):861-861, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24856,""
"Sleep Health, Depression, Pain and Quality of Life among Older Adults during the First Months of the Covid-19 Pandemic","To slow the spread of Covid-19, many states instituted restrictions on group size for religious services, exercise, and social engagement. We are beginning to understand the effect of these mandates on older adults. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between sleep health, depression, pain, and quality of life (QOL) among older adults during the initial months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Older adults completed an anonymous online survey to collect data including personal characteristics, behaviors, and health conditions during May-September 2020. Sleep Health was assessed with a survey of satisfaction, timing, efficiency, and duration of sleep along with daytime alertness. Pearson correlations were used to explore relationships between age, education, socioeconomic status, pain, depression, and QOL. Participants (N=509) were primarily female (n=392, 77%), white (n=466;92%), college educated (n=471, 93%) and with a mean age of 75.6 years (SD=5.0;range 63-93 years). Mean Sleep Health score was 7.4 (SD=2.1;range 0-10). Higher (better) Sleep Health scores were associated with education (r=.15, p&lt;01) and socioeconomic status (r=.17, p&lt;.01) and lower scores with depression (r= -.35, p&lt;.01), pain (r= -.23, p&lt;.01), and QOL (r= -.26, p&lt;.01). Poorer Sleep Health among older adults during the initial months of the pandemic were associated with depression, pain, and reduced QOL. Sleep, depression, and pain have reciprocal relationships that may have lasting consequences on physical and mental health among older adults. These findings suggest that poor sleep health should be identified and treated to improve QOL among older adults.","Lorenz, Rebecca, Stallings, Devita, Palmer, Janice, Lach, Helen","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.3129","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):865-865, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24857,""
"eMental Health Literacy and Psychological Distress as Predictors of Barriers to Mental Health Services","Since the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists have begun to rely heavily on technology to provide mental health information and services (APA, 2020). As the older adult population increases, the number of older adults in need of mental health services also increases;however, little is known about the way older adults might utilize technology to inform mental health-related decisions. This study expands on the construct of eHealth Literacy by examining eMental Health Literacy, which is defined as the degree to which individuals seek, find, understand, and appraise basic mental health information and services online that are needed to inform mental health-related decisions. A sample of 244 older adults (M=68.34, range=65-82 years) were recruited online through Amazon Mechanical Turk. A structural equation model was estimated specifying eMental Health Literacy and psychological distress as predictors of extrinsic and intrinsic barriers to mental health services. After adding three correlated errors, the model achieved good fit (<U+03C7>2(110)=329.20, p&lt;.001, SRMR=.08, CFI=.93, TLI=.91, GFI=.86, RMSEA=.09). All indicators were significantly related to their latent construct (p&lt;.001). The results indicated that, controlling for psychological distress, higher eMental health literacy was significantly related to fewer reported intrinsic (b=-.386, p&lt;.001) and extrinsic barriers (b=-.315, p&lt;.001) to mental health services. Higher distress was also significantly related to more intrinsic (b=.537, p&lt;.001) and extrinsic barriers (b=.645, p&lt;.001) to mental health services. These findings suggest that, as we move towards a more digital world, eMental health literacy could play a significant role in the way older adults navigate through the mental healthcare system.","Root, Eve, Caskie, Grace","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.3131","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):865-866, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24858,""
"Piloting an Augmented Reality Life Review Experience to Promote Mental Health Outcomes in Aging Asian American Women","Asian-American older women report the highest prevalence of suicidal ideations and rates of completed suicide compared to other racial groups. Ironically, Asian-American communities report disproportionately low rates of formal mental health utilizationâ€”this may be attributed to the lack of culturally-relevant services and negatively ingrained perceptions of mental health aid. One potential solution that has not been widely investigated is the use of technology to help older Asian-American women engage in mental health interventions. This study leverages innovations in augmented reality (AR) technology (i.e., overlaying of digital holograms onto the real world) to create a life review intervention aimed at promoting mental health well-being. The application, Tell-Being, is a personalized holographic life review experience that facilitates older adults to foster a sense of coherence and wholeness within their lives. Pilot data collection was amassed from four aging Asian-American female participants averaging 51.3 (SD=8.61) years of age. Initial pre/post analyses showcased mean differences that trend towards a higher presence of emotion regulation from pre-test (M=4.88, SD=1.08) to post-test (M=5.21, SD=1.17). Although data collection was prematurely halted due to COVID-19, results trended in promising directions. The technological innovations and findings from this study may lead to promising novel avenues to address barriers for older Asian-American women in seeking mental health assessment and treatment in a â€œnew normalâ€ world.","Hwang, Sarah, Armendariz, Jazlyn, Argueta, Jeremy, Fruiht, Veronica, Chan, Thomas","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.3133","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):866-866, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24859,""
"Fostering Intergenerational Connections in the time of Covid-19: A Friendly Caller Program","Social isolation affects one in five older adults, significantly increases the risk of premature death from all causes and is associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety and suicide. Covid-19 has exacerbated social isolation, including among older adults that reside in senior apartments. In response, a Friendly Caller Program was developed to foster intergenerational social connections among university students and residents in a large housing community that serves older adults aged 62 and older who have limited income and have mobility impairments. This study aimed to evaluate the Friendly Caller Program from the perspective of the older adult. An online survey includes questions about the participantsâ€™ demographic characteristics, physical and mental health self-assessment, social support, and ways in which the Friendly Caller Program has affected these areas of their life. An open-ended question assesses older adult participant expectations of the Friendly Caller Program. Results describe the population currently being served by this program and indicate that the program has a positive influence on participantsâ€™ feelings of safety, support and ability to function. Suggestions for future research include assessing university student perceptions about the benefits of participation as callers in the program and creating a toolkit that can guide other universities to create similar programs in partnership with housing communities that serve older adults.","Claver, Maria, Wilkinson, Alexandra, Clark, Tatia, Park, Chan","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.3136","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):867-867, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24860,""
"Technology acceptance and depressive symptoms among community-dwelling older people","Depression is a major public health issue among older adults, with an estimated prevalence between 5% and 10%. The aim of this study is to explore the possible benefits technology acceptance has in reducing depression among older people. Mail-survey data were collected from community-dwelling adults over the age of 65. This method was chosen over face-to-face surveys due to Covid-19. There were 192 total participants. The GDS-5 was used to measure the level of depressive symptoms. Among the participants, 25 participants (13%) scored higher than 2, indicating the presence of depression. Using a hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the equation explained 42.4 % of the variance (adjusted R square =.382) in levels of depression (F (3,176) = 9.973, p &lt;.000). Variance inflation factor (VIF) values were smaller than 10, indicating that multicollinearity among the correlates was not an issue. The correlates of the level of depression were: level of education, overall physical health, level of loneliness, perceived ease of technology use, attitude toward technology use, and intent to purchase new technology for older people. Results indicate that a positive attitude toward technology use might be inversely associated with depression levels. This shows how quality of life related to mental health may be improved by a change in attitude in favor of technology use. Participants were interested in learning to use new technology, and would like more opportunities to do so. Policy changes that increase lifelong learning options would help to make this happen.","Kang, Suk-Young, Kim, Jeungkun, Winthal, Jeffrey, Lenz, Rosemarie","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.3138","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):868-868, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24861,""
"Failure to Thrive: Nursing Home Staff Experiences in Caring for Residents during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Nursing home residents and staff have accounted for roughly 40% of Coronavirus-related deaths in the U.S. The burden of caring for vulnerable residents coupled with isolation policies has taken a significant emotional toll among direct health care staff in long term care facilities. This study explores nursing home staffâ€™s experiences in caring for residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. A qualitative descriptive approach with a semi-structured guide was used to conduct individual interviews. We recruited nursing home staff employed during the COVID-19 pandemic in long term care facilities located in New York State. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and then analyzed using Braun and Clarkeâ€™s Reflexive Thematic analysis. Twelve nursing home staff were interviewed. Participants consistently refer to failure-to-thrive as an extremely concerning problem because many residents demonstrate decreased appetite and poor nutrition, inactivity, and depressive symptoms due to social isolation. They also often feel frustrated and overwhelmed due to uncertainty and shortages of staff. Five main themes were identified, including doing their best to manage residentsâ€™ failure-to-thrive, working as a team, keeping family members informed and connected, struggling to balance competing personal and professional demands, and needing support to reduce stress and build strength. Our study findings indicate that nursing home staff experienced a high level of stress and identified failure-to-thrive caused by isolation and loneliness as a common phenomenon among nursing home residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions are urgently needed to reduce isolation and loneness in nursing home residents and to provide support for staff.","Chang, Yu-Ping, Raciti, Audrieanna, de Rosa, Cristina, Doerzbacher, Margaret, Zhou, Yanjun, Chen, Chia-Hui, Lyons, Amy","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.3188","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):883-883, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24862,""
"A Digital Intervention to Alleviate Loneliness and Depression Among Older Persons During the COVID-19 Outbreak","Social distancing has been proven to be effective in reducing infections but may cause ill effects on the mental health of older adults. We evaluated the effects of a short-term virtual group intervention that provided tools to promote better coping, and mitigate adverse mental health effects during the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic. A Randomized controlled trial tested the effects of a guided intervention comprised of seven online group sessions in which cognitive-behavioral techniques targeting maladaptive beliefs and appraisals were learned and practiced via ZOOM. A total of 82 community-dwelling adults from Israel, aged between 65 - 90 were randomized to either an intervention group (n=64) or a wait-list control group (n=18). Loneliness (UCLA loneliness scale) and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) were measured pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at 1-month follow-up. The findings showed a significant decrease in loneliness and depression scores in the intervention group with results maintained at 1-month follow-up. There were no significant changes in the wait-list control group. In addition, ten participants (16%) from the intervention group demonstrated a clinically meaningful decrease in depression between baseline and post-intervention, and this was maintained among 7 participants (10%) at 1-month follow-up, compared to only 1 participant (5%) in the control group. Our intervention presents a simple and easy-to-implement tool. Its relevance extends beyond the current pandemic as the skills acquired can be applied in other forms of social crises and during routine life, in order to promote the mental health of older adults who live alone and/or reside in remote areas.","Shapira, Stav, Cohn-Schwartz, Ella, Yeshua-Katz, Daphna, Aharonson-Daniel, Limor, Clarfield, A.

"Experiences of African American Dementia Caregivers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","African American caregivers are often confronted with the complexities of caregiving through the lens of race and associated health disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic has both exacerbated the systemic disparities and deeply rooted inequities experienced by African Americans and laid bare their effects on the community of caregivers. The purpose of this project was to explore the experiences of African American dementia caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nineteen African American caregivers of persons living with dementia were recruited by primary investigators and community partners with purposeful sampling techniques to participate in semi-structured focus groups that were held April 2021. Four overarching themes were constructed during thematic analysis: social isolation, decreased well-being, the good and bad of telehealth, and challenges in fulfilling the caregiver role. Caregivers expressed that they became socially isolated from family and friends, which led to them becoming depressed and mentally strained. Several caregivers felt they could not carry out their caregiver duties due to the constraints surrounding the pandemic. The varying levels of interaction with and the comfort level of physicians utilizing telehealth led to caregivers having mixed reviews on the popularized service. The results of this study will be used to culturally adapt caregiving education courses and programs promoting mastery and competency during a pandemic. In preparations for future public health crises, healthcare professionals will be able to use the results of this study to address the specific needs and improve the experiences of African American dementia caregivers.","Oliver, Sloan, Alexander, Karah, Epps, Fayron","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.3482","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):976-976, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24864,""
"Butterfly Garden Connects Community Living Center Residents, Family, and Staff During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 Pandemic has led to significant morbidity and mortality in older residents of long-term care facilities. In addition, the stringent restrictions on visitation of family and loved ones has further socially isolated residents leading to an increase in depression, loneliness, and spiritual distress. The Community Living Center (CLC) staff at West Palm Beach VA Medical Center wanted to address this dilemma and created a unique â€œButterfly Gardenâ€ (BG) visitation space. This space is a therapeutic garden adjacent to the CLC that can be accessed by families without having to enter the facility. Participants in the BG reported feelings of peace, undisturbed reflection, and tranquility as they observed and experienced natureâ€™s life cycle. This show of natureâ€™s beauty promotes visual, tactile, and olfactory sensory stimulation while attracting hummingbirds, bees, butterflies, and peace to this calm garden space. The BG visitations offers residents, family, and staff opportunities to experience the health benefits of nature during their visits under strict CDC social contact guidelines. From September through December 2020 and from January through March 2021 there were 67 and 184 visits respectively as families became more involved. The feedback from residents, families, and staff indicated that the spirits of all participants were raised by the BG visits despite the difficult challenges of social distancing and limited CLC visitations. This BG concept could serve as a model for other long-term care facilities to allow socially distant family visits to loved ones in a safe nature-based environment of care with or without a pandemic.","Rodriguez-Gonzalez, Maribel, Miller, Maura, Pratt, Gelda, Silverman, Micheal A.; DiScala, Sandra","https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONI/IGAB046.3564","","Database: PMC; Publication details: Innovation in Aging; 5(Supplement_1):1002-1003, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24865,""
"Exploring the impact of COVID-19 on families of children with developmental disabilities: A community-based formative study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every facet of society but has been particularly disastrous for families of children with developmental disabilities (DD) living on the margins. The unprecedented repercussions of COVID-19, including quarantine, social distancing, and service restrictions, continue to disproportionately impact these families. This is a pattern observed in previous humanitarian crises, where there has been a lack of response for children with DD. There is an urgent need to understand the experiences of families of children with DD in order to develop a community-driven model of service provision. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to identify the experienced impact of COVID-19 on families of children with DD who have significant needs and social barriers. DESIGN/METHODS: This was a community-based participatory study using a formative research framework in accordance with COREQ guidelines. In-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with caregivers and care providers of children with DD. Data were recorded, transcribed, and coded using deductive and inductive coding methods by three independent coders. A peer debriefing strategy was used to verify the coding approach and interpretation of findings in accordance with the RATS (relevancy, appropriateness, transparency, and soundness) guidelines for qualitative research. Perceived parental stress and social support were explored using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). RESULTS: A total of 25 IDIs were conducted. Of the 15 caregivers interviewed, five were new to Canada. Results suggested both newcomer and non-newcomer families of children with DD are in crisis, reporting high stress and low social support, with increased difficulties navigating and accessing therapies and programs, including those offered virtually. Participants reported behavioural regressions and increased anxiety among their children with DD, as well as caregiver mental health challenges. Providers reported having to change their service delivery model in accordance with public health recommendations, but caregivers said that they were not included in these decisions. CONCLUSION: Families of children with DD face extraordinary barriers to care, which may be further compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study demonstrates the value of community-informed design, particularly in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. To deliver truly patient-centred services during the pandemic, there is an urgent need for responsive programming that is built with patients, for patients.","Filler, T.; Kaur, P.; Mohamed, U.; Minhas, R.; Suleman, S.","https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxab061.007","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Paediatrics and Child Health (Canada); 26(SUPPL 1):e7-e8, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24866,""
"Family absence at the bedside during the COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: Child and family-centered care, a partnership approach to health care decision-making, is central to paediatric practice. To reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, healthcare institutions implemented policies to protect staff, patients and families. Family presence at the bedside was reduced to one caregiver, except in special circumstances requiring pre-approval by hospital leadership. OBJECTIVES: We explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric healthcare delivery, focusing on family presence. We describe the clinician's experience of restricted family presence during the COVID-19 pandemic in a paediatric hospital. DESIGN/METHODS: Physicians, trainees, and nurses at The Hospital for Sick Children completed surveys between March-August 2020 to identify patients they perceived to have experienced a suboptimal quality of care or health-outcome related to changes that had occurred as a result of the pandemic and describe the impact. Data were analyzed via case report and thematic analysis. As part of a larger study, here we report on cases related to family presence in the hospital. RESULTS: A total of 212 clinicians reported 116 cases;eighteen cases specified an impact on child and family-centered care. Nine cases related to patient experiences and nine to family experiences of the restricted family presence policy. Clinicians reported a perceived distress in patients due to family members not being present. 6267 family restriction exemption requests were received. Cases described families who opted for a different location for end-of-life care so that extended family could be present. Further cases highlighted how important conversations such as disclosure of diagnosis involved one parent present and the other joining remotely. Siblings were also reported to be impacted by visitor restrictions and closure of the sibling play area. Exclusions were also reported to be challenging for children with complex medical needs and technology dependency whereby two-caregivers were often required. Clinicians reported experiencing stress and moral distress as part of being required to support family restriction policies, impairing their ability to provide care. CONCLUSION: Family presence policies are a critical component of child and family-centered care and have been impacted by the pandemic as described both by family and clinician stress. Recommendations based on these findings would include: facilitating two-caregiver presence to support shared decision making, regular remote meetings to communicate information with families in cases where they cannot be physically present;using remote technology or implementing allotted visitation time for siblings, reviewing exceptions to caregiver restrictions, and mental health supports for clinicians such as peer-support groups, or wellness workshops.","Dharmaraj, B.; Diskin, C.; Orkin, J.; Agarwal, T.; Parmar, A.; Karmali, K.; Friedman, J.","https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxab061.070","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Paediatrics and Child Health (Canada); 26(SUPPL 1):e64, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24867,""
"New presentations of anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa in adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had profound effects on adolescent mental health. Beginning in mid-March 2020, public health measures were implemented throughout the province of Quebec, including full school closure and confinement. Previous studies have demonstrated the association between stressful events and the exacerbation of anorexia nervosa (AN), however the association of the COVID-19 pandemic on new AN diagnoses remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To assess the incidence and severity of newly diagnosed AN or atypical AN (AAN) cases among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the five preceding years. DESIGN/METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis from Jan 1 2015 to Nov 15 2020 of new eating disorder assessments at an urban tertiary pediatric hospital. Baseline demographic information and clinical assessment variables were collected. The primary outcomes were the incidence of de novo AN or AAN diagnoses and hospitalization within 7 days of diagnosis. Event rate time trends were compared during the period of pandemic public health measures (March 2020 to November 2020) to the proceeding 5-years (January 2015 to February 2020) using an interrupted time series and logistic mixed modeling. RESULTS: Overall, 353 patients met inclusion criteria during the study period. Median patient age was 15.9 (IQR 13.8-16.9) years, 93% were female, and 65% of patients were diagnosed with atypical AN. For the full cohort at diagnosis, %mBMI was 92% (SD Â±15%) and mean weight loss was 11 Kg (SD Â±7Kg). In the 5 years preceding the pandemic, there were 4.5 new AN/AAN cases per month with a modest downward trend (ÃŸcoeff=-0.016). During confinement, new diagnoses rose to 8.0/month with a steep upward trend (ÃŸcoeff=1.417, p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, hospitalizations for new cases increased from 0.8 to 2.6/month with a significant increase in linear tend (ÃŸcoeff-0.012 vs. 0.500, p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, patients diagnosed during COVID-19 confinement had a shorter duration of symptoms (6 months vs. 10 months, p=0.001), with a higher percentage of body weight loss (19% vs. 16%, p=0.03) at a faster rate (2.3kg/mo vs. 1.5Kg/mo, p=0.001). Bradycardia was more pronounced at diagnosis during the pandemic (55 bpm vs. 62 bpm, p=0.001) with a greater proportion meeting threshold for admission (38% vs. 19%, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 confinement, new diagnoses of AN and AAN nearly doubled and hospitalizations for these patients more than tripled. Markers for disease severity were more pronounced and evolved more rapidly. Findings highlight the urgent need for increased community resources during the pandemic, as well as prospective research to understand drivers and prognosis for these patients more effectively.","Agostino, H.; Burstein, B.","https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxab061.084","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Paediatrics and Child Health (Canada); 26(SUPPL 1):e74, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24868,""
"Understanding the psychosocial impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic - a focus on children and families","BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a major global threat that emerged in 2020. Many countries have enacted policies such as mandatory school closures, business closures, and self-quarantining to keep people at home and prevent further spread of the virus. Previous research has shown that pandemics and subsequent disease containment measures negatively affect children and families, both psychosocially and economically. OBJECTIVES: The current study explores the potential psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent disease containment measures on a number of domains (employment/business, education, finances, medical care, access to medication, technology, children/family, access to community services) through an online survey. The current  focuses on the emotional well-being of children and how families have been affected by the restrictions and changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN/METHODS: Participants were asked to complete an online survey through a secure portal. The survey consisted of questions about household demographics and socio-economic status (SES), as well as five psychometric scales measuring satisfaction with life, psychological well-being, anxiety, depression, and substance use, and specific questions about how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted respondents' daily lives in the previously identified domains. This is the first of four longitudinal surveys that will be conducted throughout this study. RESULTS: A total of 571 participants completed the survey. Of these participants, 41.3% identified as being a parent or guardian with children under 18. The focus of this  is the subset of respondents with children. Roughly three quarters of participants identified that their children were emotionally impacted by COVID-19, the school closures, or missing friends or family (Yes = 46.6%;Somewhat = 30.5%). Parents also reported loss of access to childcare, disruptions to their visits with their children living outside the home, and feeling like they could not access timely medical care for their children. Demographic information and other relevant responses and information can be found in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. CONCLUSION: The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be felt for years to come and will shape an entire generation of children. Even in the current sample, which consisted largely of individuals from medium-high SES households, most reported that children had been impacted emotionally. Understanding and mitigating the impact on children and adapting resources in the short term and the long-term to meet the growing needs of our communities must be top priorities for pediatricians and community service providers.","Gander, S.; Flood, K.; Campbell, S.; Bonner, K.","https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxab061.110","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Paediatrics and Child Health (Canada); 26(SUPPL 1):e97-e98, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24869,""
"For the parent, by the parent: Defining the characteristics of a novel program to empower parents of refugee background using the participatory approaches","BACKGROUND: With more than 28 million individuals of refugee or asylum-seeking background globally, the current situation has been described as one of the largest humanitarian crises of all time. Families of refugee background have complex, multigenerational mental health and developmental needs that are not accounted for in current programming frameworks. Difficulties in resettlement have been further compounded by COVID-19-related lockdowns, straining parental mental health and placing children at an increased risk for developmental or behavioural problems. Providing appropriate support services and educational resources that address the multigenerational concerns of families of refugee background will address these challenges, allowing for improved parental mental health, family cohesion, and developmental outcomes for children. OBJECTIVES: To gather data about the experiences, resources, referral pathways and barriers that impact the experience of parents of refugee background in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and to develop a novel, multi-dimensional parenting program model using Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) principles. DESIGN/METHODS: This was a qualitative community-based participatory study using a formative research framework, in accordance with COREQ guidelines. In-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with parents of refugee background and care providers that work closely with this population. Data were recorded, transcribed, and coded using deductive and inductive coding methods by two independent coders. A peer debriefing strategy was used to verify the coding approach and interpretation of findings in accordance with the RATS (relevancy, appropriateness, transparency and soundness) guidelines for qualitative research. RESULTS: A total of 20 IDIs were conducted (7 parents and 13 care providers). The main topics that were identified to be incorporated into the program include features of child development, how to address resettlement issues, child advocacy, and parenting in the Canadian context. Participants felt that tackling the language barriers, addressing the overlapping responsibilities of the mothers attending the sessions, providing incentives, increasing awareness of the program, and using an anti-racist and anti-oppressive approach is key to the program's success. Participants emphasized the need for trauma-informed mental health support within the program model. CONCLUSION: This study describes the key considerations for a novel parenting program for families of refugee background, by engaging them as key stakeholders in the program design process. Future iteration of this project would involve a pilot and evaluation of the program.","Kaur, P.; Minhas, R.; Ho, B.","https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxab061.119","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Paediatrics and Child Health (Canada); 26(SUPPL 1):e104, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24870,""
"How to deal with the negative psychological impact of COVID-19 for people who pay attention to anxiety and depression","Background: The fear of insecurity and uncertainty caused by the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the separation and loss of certain important relationships, and great changes in lifestyle have awakened strong emotional responses, which may cause psychological problems in the general population. However, there is little research on how people who pay attention to anxiety and depression cope with the negative psychological impact during an epidemic or major disaster. This study aimed to identify what behaviors can effectively reduce negative emotions during an epidemic. Methods: From 1 February to 8 March 2020, we conducted a web-based survey and collected information on general demographic data. Probable depression, anxiety symptoms, and coping behaviors were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and self-made coping behaviors questionnaires. Result: Among 17 249 responders, 7923 and 9326 completed assessments of depression and anxiety respectively, and all responders completed the coping behaviors questionnaires. Our survey population showed a high prevalence rate of possible depression disorders (2746 of 7923, 34.66%) and anxiety disorders (5309 of 9326, 56.93%). Compared with other groups, the elderly, women, people of lower education, and people with lower income were more likely to suffer depression and/or anxiety. In terms of marital status, the cohabiting group showed the highest rate of depression and/or anxiety. Among the careers, students and housewives were high-risk groups suffering from depression and/or anxiety. After adjusting for social-demographic factors (e.g. age, sex), depression and anxiety were positively associated with self-injury, doing housework, and having sex or masturbating, and negatively associated with singing, drawing, or writing, dating friends online, singing, attending lectures, and doing yoga. Conclusion: Our findings identified some spontaneous coping behaviors that can probably relieve the psychological impact of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Ge, F.; Wan, M.; Zheng, A.; Zhang, J.","https://doi.org/10.1093/PCMEDI/PBAA023","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Precision Clinical Medicine; 3(3):161-168, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24871,""
"The experience of SENCOs in England during the COVID-19 pandemic: the amplification and exposure of pre-existing strengths and challenges and the prioritisation of mental health and wellbeing in schools","A national survey of Special Educational Needs Coordinators (SENCOs) in England was conducted during the summer of 2020 in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The annually conducted survey typically collates demographic data about the SENCO workforce, but given the wider context, this particular survey also included nine questions about SENCOs' experiences during the pandemic. More than 1000 SENCOs participated in the survey and the findings demonstrate the critical contribution of SENCOs in supporting pupils with SEND and maintaining effective communication with their families during the pandemic. The study provides evidence of an amplification effect in relation to the strengths and challenges that SENCOs had been experiencing prior to the pandemic. The study also demonstrates the importance of prioritising mental health and wellbeing in schools for both pupils and staff in the wake of the pandemic, with this being the key priority identified by SENCOs across all types of setting and all phases of education.","Boddison, A.; Curran, H.","https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-3802.12553","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Journal of Research in Special Educational Needs;: 11, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24872,""
"Effectiveness of embodied conversational agents for managing academic stress at an Indian University (ARU) during COVID-19","Stress has become one of the major reasons for many mental health related issues among students of all age groups, which has resulted in devastating personal losses including suicide. Societal and familial pressure to succeed is high, particularly in developing countries where education is highly valued as a key enabler. As part of stress management during the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for online intelligent virtual advisors has risen and, consequently, the need for personalised explanation that is culturally sensitive to the user's context is essential to improve the user's understanding of and trust in the recommendations provided by the virtual advisor. This paper presents the mAnaging stRess at University embodied conversational agent (ECA) that has been adapted for Indian university students from an explainable agent that was found to help Western students reduce their stress by providing study tips with explanations based on the student's beliefs and/or goals. We conducted a research study with sixty students which measured the impact of providing three different patterns of tailored explanations (belief-based, goal-based, and belief and goal-based explanation) on the students' intentions to change the recommended behaviours and the relationship built with the ECA. The experimental results indicate that there was stress reduction across all student groups provided with different types of explanations. Further, the students showed trust and a good working alliance with the conversational agent, along with an intention to change behaviour across all types of explanations. However, it was observed that the user context played an important role in behaviour change intention and hence explanations could be tailored further, making them culturally more relevant to Indian students. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have been mostly developed, applied and shown to be effective in developed countries. Hence, their design and development are mostly guided by the intended user's needs and preferences. In a Western context, ECAs have been found to be beneficial for reducing study stress in university students. There is a pertinent need for use of low cost, effective technology that can aid academic stress reduction in higher educational institutions in developing countries owing to their high youth populations, lack of adequate mental healthcare facilities and associated social stigma. What this paper adds The adaptation and use of ECAs to reduce study stress in higher education students in a developing country is evaluated. The ECA technology is adapted for an Indian context in terms of its physical appearance, colour, speech dialect and dialog content so that it is culturally more aligned to the target population. The ECA engages in an empathic conversation tailored for the Indian students and their COVID-19 context providing them with explanation-backed behaviour recommendations that take their beliefs and goals into account. The ECA provides three types of explanation: belief-only;goal-only;and both belief and goal. Results of a study carried out in an Indian university with 61 students, randomly assigned to one of the explanation types, to capture their demographics, study stress statistics, behaviour change intentions and trust/working alliance with the conversational agent. The major findings include stress reduction across all explanation groups, development of a positive relationship between the ECA and the students regardless of its explanation pattern, and changes in behaviour intentions across all types of explanations for all recommended behaviours. However, differences in change intentions for certain behaviours indicate further tailoring of explanations is required based on the user context. Implications for practice and/or policy The ECA technology has shown promise in terms of stress reduction amongst Indian students. Higher Education Institutions in developing countries could utilise low-cost and widely accessible ECAs to overcome ack of access to human-based support and reluctance to use available services due to stigmatized attitudes to mental health issues. This technology can be further improved and deployed into a larger number of Indian educational institutions leading to a widespread impact on overall student health and wellbeing. Digital technologies to support mental health have become more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic, at least in Western countries. The ECA technology evaluated in our study demonstrates its viability and potential value for use in developing countries, with appropriate tailoring.","Nelekar, Shreeya, Abdulrahman, Amal, Gupta, Manik, Richards, Deborah","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13174","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: British Journal of Educational Technology; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24873,""
"Perceived changes in social contact during COVID-19 pandemic in the United States","The COVID-19 pandemic and its restrictions have led to a shift in how people connect with others. This study investigated (a) profiles of social contact change across social ties and modes of contact, (b) predictors of these profiles, and (c) the association between these profiles and mental health during the pandemic. Participants (N = 2,098;Age mean = 50.94, range = 18-98;48.3% female) were surveyed online twice, once prior to the pandemic (January 31-February 10, 2020) and again early in the outbreak (March 18-29, 2020). A latent profile analysis identified profiles of social contact change across social ties and communication methods. Additional analyses identified predictors of group membership and their association with mental health. Three latent groups were identified: (1) the ""majority group"" (77%) slightly restricted in-person contact and had a small increase in phone and text use, (2) the ""high technology use group"" (13%) restricted in-person contact and increased the use of all technology-based methods, and (3) the ""isolated group"" (10%) decreased in both in-person and technology-based contact. Compared to the majority group, the high technology use group reported higher depression and anxiety, whereas the isolated group reported higher loneliness. There were three distinct profiles of how adults in the United States changed their communication patterns with others early in the pandemic that were linked to distinct patterns of mental health. The results have implications for the development and the delivery of mental health treatment in times of social (physical) distancing.","Lee, J. H.; Luchetti, M.; Aschwanden, D.; Sesker, A.

"Depression Symptoms, Mattering, and Anti-mattering: Longitudinal Associations in Young Adulthood","We examined the dynamic interplay of depression symptoms, mattering (i.e., self-evaluation of importance or significance to others), and anti-mattering across four years of development in young adulthood (age 20-23;N = 452) using a cross-lagged panel model (CLPM). Support for a transactional model between anti-mattering and depression symptoms was found. Specifically, anti-mattering positively predicted later depression symptoms and depression symptoms consistently predicted later anti-mattering. Depression symptoms also shared a negative association with later mattering but not the reverse, supporting a symptoms-driven model of depression symptoms and mattering. Auto-regressive paths, residual covariances, and cross-lagged paths were invariant over time. Accounting for gender, household income, parental education, and fear of COVID-19 as covariates did not change the results. The stability of mattering and anti-mattering suggest careful consideration of how to effectively change these patterns. The implications for assessment and intervention on mattering or anti-mattering in the prevention and treatment of depression are discussed.","Krygsman, A.; Farrell, A.

"â€œA Little Bit Closerâ€: A Mixed Method Analysis of the Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Lives of Adolescent Parents","Using a Family Stress Model framework, we used quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the impact of the pandemic on Latinx pregnant and parenting adolescents and their families. Participants were 406 adolescents (ages 14?19) in the southwestern U.S. who participated in a school-based relationship education program for pregnant and parenting adolescents. In the quantitative analysis, we compared self-reported mental health (depressive symptoms, worry, parental stress), coparental relationships (conflict and communication), and parenting of adolescents who participated prior to the pandemic (N?=?357;83.6% female;84.7% Latinx) with those who participated during the pandemic (N?=?49;74.6% female;87.8% Latinx). Unexpectedly, the pandemic-period cohort reported fewer depressive symptoms, less parental stress, more frequent coparental communication, and more positive coparental communication and conflict management than the pre-pandemic cohort. For the qualitative analysis, we conducted focus groups and individual interviews with 21 adolescent parents (95.2% female;90.5% Latinx) from the pandemic-period cohort and analyzed the data using thematic analysis. Participants reported many negative effects of the pandemic including increased economic and health stress, yet also discussed reduced pressure with school and more time with family members. These findings have important implications for enhancing the well-being of adolescent parents and their children after the pandemic.","Astle, Shelby M.; Duncan, JeneÃ© C.; Toews, Michelle L.; Perez-Brena, Norma J.; McAllister, Paige, Maddy, Molly A.; E.

"Choices, choices: selecting, defining, and measuring outcomes for young people with depressive disorders","Talk 1: Presenter: Dr Darren Courtney Title: ''Response,'' ''Remission,'' and ''Recovery'' in randomized clinical trials for the Treatment of Adolescent Depression. ''Response,'' ''Remission,'' and ''Recovery'' are often used as dichotomized outcomes to define clinically important change in randomized clinical trials for mental disorders. These dichotomizations can guide clinical decisions to continue, intensify, switch, or stop treatment. Through a rigorous scoping review of randomized clinical trials for the treatment of adolescent major depressive disorder (N = 98), we found high variability in how these terms were operationally defined;with 53 unique outcome definitions of ''response'' across 45 trials that assessed response, 47 unique definitions of ''remission'' in 29 trials that assessed remission, and 19 unique definitions of ''recovery'' across 11 trials that assessed recovery. Moreover, there was a dearth of rationale based on empirical findings. Finally, reports of input from youth with lived experience in establishing these definitions were minimal. In studying and implementing interventions to address mental disorders arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, a new and standardized approach to define clinically important change is needed. Talk 2: Presenter: Dr Nancy Butcher Title: Measurement Matters: Evaluating Methods of Assessing Depression in Adolescent Clinical Trials. Rates of major depressive disorder in youth are on the rise, creating urgency for well-designed trials using well-measured outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic era. Timely conduct of psychiatric trials in youth, however, may require innovative and virtual methods for outcome measurement as an alternative design to in-person assessments. The Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised is the most commonly used method of measuring depressive symptoms in clinical trials of adolescents with major depressive disorder. Originally developed for use in children, it is unknown whether the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised is fit-for-purpose for measuring depression in adolescents. This study aimed to identify all existing evidence of key measurement properties of the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised in adolescents with major depressive disorder through a systematic review, and to evaluate these properties using a well-established appraisal method developed by the COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) Initiative. We found that it is unclear whether the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised can appropriately measure depression symptom severity of adolescents with major depressive disorder, either in person or via virtual assessment. No study assessed content validity, cross-cultural validity/measurement invariance, or measurement error of the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised in adolescents with major depressive disorder. Low-quality evidence was found for sufficient construct validity (n = 4 studies) and responsiveness (n = 2 studies). Very low-quality evidence was found for sufficient inter-rater reliability (n = 2 studies). The results for structural validity (n = 3 studies) and internal consistency (n = 5 studies) were inconclusive. No study evaluated the validity of the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised using a virtual mode of administration. Implications and future directions for depression outcome research will be discussed including tools to guide outcome measurement instrument selection and reporting using innovative and virtual methods. Talk 3: Presenter: Dr. Karolin Krause Title: Are Symptoms All That Matters? Contrasting Outcome Measurement in Youth Depression Trials with Youth Perceptions and Priorities Depression is a common mental health problem in adolescence worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic is putting additional strain on youth wellbeing and may lead to a rising demand for effective treatment in the coming years. Within a person-centered healthcare framework, treatment effectiveness should be judged with reference to individual patient needs. A recent systematic review suggests that most clinical trials for adolescent depression assess outcomes in the domain of symptom change, and half assess functional impairment, while other outcomes are rarely considered. We conducted a mixed-methods investigation of youth outcome perceptions and priorities, to understand the extent to which this focus reflects what matters to youth. In semi-structured interviews conducted with 34 youth following participation in a psychotherapy trial for depression, symptomatic change was the most frequently discussed outcome (by 65%) but change in coping skills was discussed just as often, followed by improved family functioning (47%) and social functioning (35%). These outcomes were assessed by less than 5% of recently published quantitative treatment studies. Subsequently, Q-methodology was used in a purposive sample of 28 youth with lived experience of depression, to investigate which outcomes they considered most important. Four distinct profiles were identified: ''symptom reduction and enhanced well-being'';''improved coping and self-management'';''better understanding past and present'';and ''less interference with daily life.'' Findings suggest that a narrow focus on symptom metrics fails to cover secondary outcomes that matter to youth. Trialist should draw on emerging guidance provided by Core Outcome Sets to consider a broader range of outcomes. Trialists should further consider including a personalized outcome measure to reflect varying individual priorities and understand whether treatments enable progress toward youth's individual treatment goals. Talk 4: Presenter: Dr Suneeta Monga Title: Engaging Youth in Defining What Outcomes Matter: Development of a Core Outcome Set for Adolescent Depression with Active Youth Participation Reviews of the literature document the wide heterogeneity in what, how, and when outcomes are measured in adolescent major depressive disorder. Such heterogeneity significantly limits the ability to draw conclusions around the best or most effective treatment as individual trial results cannot be pooled together in systematic reviews when outcomes differ across trials. A Core Outcome Set, as defined by the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Initiative, is an agreed, minimum, standardized set of outcomes that should be measured and reported in all clinical trials and audits in a specific area of health or healthcare. In other areas of medicine, development of a Core Outcome Set has increased consistency across trials, maximized the potential for a trial to contribute to systematic reviews of key outcomes, increased measurement of appropriate outcomes, and reduced selective outcome reporting. The development of a Core Outcome Set for adolescent major depressive disorder with a strong emphasis on youth and caregiver involvement to ensure that outcomes that really matter to youth and caregivers are incorporated into the final Core Outcome Set is currently underway. The use of innovative approaches that support engagement and participation of youth with lived experience, and caregivers, in all steps of the development of this Core Outcome Set will be a focus of this presentation. Important adaptations to manage the current impact of COVID-19 on the Core Outcome Set development will also be discussed as part of this presentation.","Courtney, D.; Krause, K. R.; Butcher, N.

"Left behind or at the front line of COVID-19: A descriptive phenomenological study","During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses in the field examined were required to manage large numbers of patients suffering from COVID-19 in in-patient clinics necessitating relocation of registered nurses (RNs) from other clinics in the department to support the care of those patients. The aim of the study was to explore how RNs attribute meaning to their experiences during the organizational changes caused by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This descriptive phenomenological study is based on thematic analysis interviewing 47 RNs who either continued working in in-patient clinics, were relocated to in-patient clinics, or remained in out-patient clinics. The study methods complied with the COREQ. The main finding, ?Sense-making in a changed reality of nursing?, shows how RNs attribute meaning or not to the organizational changes, and explains how meaning-making in RNs continuing in in-patient clinics reinforced their identity as RNs or, conversely, how feelings of meaninglessness in those relocated to in-patient clinics or remaining in out-patient clinics contributed to identity loss. This article suggests that managers, by paying attention to the narratives of meaning or meaninglessness in nurses during organizational changes, could be instrumental in managing the anger, frustration, and hopelessness arising from experiences of meaninglessness.","Grimshaw-Aagaard, SÃ¸sserr, KnÃ¸fler, Inge-Lise","https://doi.org/10.1177/20571585211061926","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Nordic Journal of Nursing Research;: 20571585211061926, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24880,""
"Changes in College Student Anxiety and Depression From Pre- to During-COVID-19: Perceived Stress, Academic Challenges, Loneliness, and Positive Perceptions","The COVID-19 pandemic is a major stressor that has negatively impacted global mental health. Many U.S. college students faced an abrupt transition to remote learning in March 2020 that significantly disrupted their routines, likely causing changes in mental health. The current study examined changes in anxiety and depressive symptoms among 990 college students, from before COVID-19 had reached U.S. community spread to 5Â months into the pandemic. Results indicate overall increases in anxiety and depressive symptoms;this effect was amplified as more COVID-related challenges with academic impact and loneliness were reported. Increases in anxiety and depression were buffered as a function of greater perceived positive changes attributed to COVID-19;the differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms over time were also lessened when greater perceived stress prior to COVID-19 was reported. Findings reveal an unexpected effect involving pre-pandemic stress, and highlight potential targets to promote resilience, which should be examined long-term.","Haikalis, Michelle, Doucette, Hannah, Meisel, Matthew K.; Birch, Kelli, Barnett, Nancy P.","https://doi.org/10.1177/21676968211058516","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Emerging Adulthood;: 21676968211058516, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24881,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic and Stress: Coping with the New Normal","COVID-19 is the new face of pandemic. Since the discovery of COVID-19 in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, it has spread all over the world and the numbers are increasing day by day. Anyone can be susceptible to this infection but children, older adults, pregnant women, and people with comorbidity are more vulnerable. The spread of coronavirus resulted in closures of schools, businesses, and public spaces worldwide and forced many communities to enact stay at home orders, causing stress to all irrespective of their age, gender, or socioeconomic status. The sudden and unexpected changes caused by the outbreak of coronavirus are overwhelming for both adults and children, causing stress and evoking negative emotions like fear, anxiety, and depression, among different populations. The aim of the paper is to ascertain how stress during this pandemic inculcates various psychological health issues like depression anxiety, OCD, panic behavior, and so on. Further, the paper is an attempt to identify different general as well as population specific coping strategies to reduce the stress level among individuals and prevent various stress-induced psychological disorders with reference to different theories and research articles.","Bhattacharjee, Anjana, Ghosh, Tatini","https://doi.org/10.1177/26320770211050058","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Journal of Prevention and Health Promotion;: 26320770211050058, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24882,""
"Causes and Circumstances of Death: Analysis in 266 Sickle Cell Adult Patients","Introduction Sickle cell disease is a genetic disease with acute and chronic complications. Pediatric mortality has decreased in recent decades with the introduction of systematic antibiotic therapy, preventive management of cerebral vasculopathy and therapeutic education of families. However, in the absence of cohort follow-up at birth, life expectancy, which is a different concept from age at death, cannot be assessed. In this retrospective, monocentric study, we describe causes and circumstances of death, acute chronic complications, long-term treatments and baseline biology of these patients. It seems important to analyze the risks of morbidity and mortality in order to decide on the necessary preventive measures. Material and method: Records of patients deceased between 2000 and 2020, from the national referral center (Henri Mondor Hospital), were retrospectively reviewed. The referral center follows 3500 patients. All deaths reported to the hospital, by families, other hospitals and health professionals were retrieved from computerized records. Deaths published by the INSEE (National Institute of Statistical and Economical study) from 2000 to December 2020 were accessible and compared with our databases to identify all our deceased patients. All patients with a medical record in our center were included for the study. Patients who had never visited our center were excluded. Results: During this period 226 patients including 128 women and 138 men are recorded. Genotypes for these patients were 204(76%) SS, 41 (15%) SC, 14(5%) SÃŸÂ°thalassemia and 7 (2%) SÃŸ+thalassemia. The median age at death was 41 years with an IQR [32-51]. 186 (70%) patients were hospitalized, 129 (70%) of whom were admitted to intensive care. 36 (13%) patients died at home, including 15 with opioid addiction and 5 patients with psychiatric pathology, and 4 patients on dialysis. This information was not available for 44 (16%) patients. The causes of death were vaso-occlusive complications with multivisceral failure in 44 cases, 42 sepsis, among which there were 11 renal failures, 9 of which were dialyzed. 5 patients died of COVID 19. Cerebral hemorrhage and neurological accident occurred in 22 cases, 4 of which were known to have macrovasculopathy. 25 patients died of a direct complication of renal failure, of which 17 were dialysed, 8 pre-dialysed and 3 transplanted. Acute liver failure in 16 cases, 10 precapillary pulmonary hypertension, 14 DHTR, 10 end-stage heart failure were noted. Two road accidents, 2 suicides, 1 dementia are repoted. For 51 cases, there was no information on the cause or circumstance of death. The causes of death according to genotype is on Table 1. Concerning the chronic complications, 94/266 (35%) patients had significant chronic organ damage. Sixteen patients had required renal or liver transplantation in their history. End-stage organ damage was frequent, 42 had end-stage renal failure, 21 had major liver failure, of which five were transplanted and 16 were awaiting transplantation. Twenty-one patients had known heart failure, 10 of which were associated with end-stage renal disease. Ten patients were followed for significant precapillary pulmonary hypertension. Transfusion difficulties due to a history of DHTR were found for 33 patients. Fourteen patients had an opioid addiction. Nine patients were pregnant and nine had received corticosteroids. Discussion: Causes of death have changed and chronic organ failure is the leading cause of death, especially in patients with kidney, liver and heart disease. This study does not calculate life expectancy, but there was an increase in age at death of about 1/4 of the patients who were between 51 and 81 years old.The management of sickle cell disease has progressed in recent years and new therapies are being proposed. Prevention of the development of these complications is one of the new challenges, especially for renal disease, which is associated with premature mortality. DHTR and cerebral hemorrhage, Covid-19 are new entities and DHTR was probably underdiagnosed in p evious publications. Pregnancy remains a period at risk, for which surveillance should be reinforced. The analysis is ongoing and correlations are currently being investigated between different parameters to find risk factors for mortality.

"Quality of Life in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults with Sickle Cell Disease and Their Caregivers during Standard of Care and after Bone Marrow Transplantation: A Single Center Report","[Formula presented] Background In spite of the improvements in clinical care of children with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), painful vaso-occlusive (VOC) crises, recurrent admissions and long hospital stays contribute to the disruption of the social and school life of children and adolescents with SCD causing a poor QoL. Limited information is available regarding QoL of children, adolescents and young adults with SCD and their caregivers during standard of care and after bone marrow transplantation in Italy even though Italian patients participating in international meetings or global surveys highlighted the importance to improve QoL (Strunk C. BMC Proc. 2020, Osunkwo I. Am J Hematol. 2021). Moreover, no mention is given to QoL in the current AIEOP Recommendations for the Management of Children with SCD in Italy. The availability of new treatment options for SCD highlights the need to improve QoL evaluation before and after treatments. Our Center decided, therefore, to include QoL evaluation as part of comprehensive care for patients with SCD. This study has the following aims: to describe the QoL of children, adolescents and young adults with SCD undergoing standard care or after disease curative treatments (bone marrow transplantation) and the QoL of their caregivers;to evaluate the correlation of QoL with clinical-haematological and therapeutic variables. Methods Health Related QoL was examined with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) questionnaires in Italian: Parent Proxy Profile-49 v2.0, Pediatric Profile-49 v2.0 and 57 Profile v2.1, exploring 8 domains: Pain, Fatigue, Anxiety, Depression, Physical Abilities, Peer Relations, Sleep Disorders, Pain Interference. An English version was available for English speaking parents. Patients and caregivers accessing the SCD Clinic starting May 2021 were given the paper version of the questionnaires;due to the COVID pandemic and the limited access to the SCD Outpatient Clinic, a link to a Google online version of the questionnaires was provided to all teenagers and young adults, through their mobile devices. PROMIS Scores were standardized through the Health Measures Scoring Service (healthmeasures.net). For the descriptive analysis, the T-score was obtained, for each patient and for each PROMIS domain (symptom or function), classifying impairment in each domain as normal, mild, moderate, or severe. The Student T Test for comparisons of the means among samples and the Wilcoxon Test for the sum of ranks were used in the statistical analysis of normal and non-normal continuous variables. For the correlation analysis between continuous variables of which at least one is not normal, the Spearman Correlation Test was used. The values with p&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results All patients and parents approached accepted to perform the questionnaire. The study involved 18 caregivers and 50 patients (25% F, mean age 16.4 years, 74% HbSS, 76% from Africa): 41 undergoing standard care (7 no therapy, 34 Hydroxyurea or chronic transfusion) and 9 who received HSCT. 37 patients (74%) and 8 parents (44%) completed the online Google version of the questionnaire. The standard of care patients displayed mild to severe symptoms in various domains (Figure 1A);in the transplant population there was impairment in QoL, with less severe impairment in most of the domains, especially in the pain domains, than what was in the standard of care group. (Figure 1B). Anxiety levels and depressive symptoms were greatest between the ages of 14-26, compared to younger ages (p 0.018). Parents do not have the same perception of the disease as their children: they appeared to overestimate the domain of pain and fatigue and underestimate anxiety and depression (p &lt;0.001). Sleep quality was impaired in both affected and HSCT patients. The number of hospital admissions in the previous year correlated with worse QoL (p 0.04), while the number of painful VOC showed a tendency towards significance (p 0.07);there was no difference with the other domains. Update results will be presented. Conclusions Our data show the feasibility of evaluating QoL during routine visits and also remotely. Impairment of QoL is already present in a subgroup of young patients. Even after HSCT, QoL is not optimal but personal, social, and economic reasons need to be taken into account to adequately interpret the results. Longitudinal assessment to look at QoL will be important. [Formula presented] Disclosures: Biffi: BlueBirdBio: Consultancy, Other: Advisory Board.

"Impact of COVID 19 Pandemic on Health Care Utilization for Patients with Sickle Cell Disease - a Specialty Treatment Center Experience","Introduction: Starting in March 2020, the coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic affected the United States (US) health care system. Many individuals were afraid to seek medical care due to fear of obtaining COVID-19;therefore, there was a high frequency of adults forgoing medical care. Chronic conditions including diabetes, COPD, mental health, and HTN outcomes worsened due to decrease in routine care during the pandemic. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic blood disorder that causes numerous complications including but not limited to vaso-occlusive crisis, strokes, and chronic kidney disease. Individuals who have routine follow up with a hematologist have been shown to have decreased hospitalizations, ER visits, length of stay, and opiate usage. The Inland Empire region of Southern California is one of the densest hot spots for patient's living with sickle cell disease in terms of disease burden and health care utilization. Therefore, we evaluated how the COVID-19 pandemic affected health care utilizations with individuals with SCD in this area. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the health care utilization in the inpatient setting was performed at three time points in line with the C.D.C. COVID pandemic declaration (Pre COVID: September 2019 to February 2020, Intra COVID 1: March 2020 to Sept 2020, Intra COVID 2: October 2020 to February 2021). Primary endpoints included emergency room visits, inpatient admissions, and length of stay, blood product utilization, and opioid utilization. Secondary endpoints and analyses included pediatric vs. adult health care utilization disparity and outcomes. Descriptive analysis was done by calculating frequency and percentages for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation for continuous variables. Results: Shown in Result TABLE attached.Patients seeking inpatient care for scheduled procedure's/ transfusion were excluded from this analysis. Patients with SCD diagnoses of acute SCD crises (pan crisis /chest syndrome / COVID infection / Pneumonia) were included in assessment. Absolute number of patients per ED visit, patient per Inpatient admission frequency has been shown in more detail in the bar chart in Figure and will be presented in the oral presentation along with detailed data analysis box plots and charts. Discussion: Fewer patients' sought timely care for acute SCD event leading to fewer but prolonged hospitalizations, a trend seen in our adult and pediatric patient's across the board during intra COVID 1 and 2 time points, likely due to the fear of contracting COVID infection at an acute health care setting in a declared pandemic. Similarly, we found there were less unique sickle cell patients using the ER for both pediatric and adult patients during the pandemic. There was a decrease in the amount of hospital admission related to sickle cell disease, which was similar to results published in the United Kingdom. More sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis were being managed at home, likely due to avoidance of COVID exposures at health care facilities, likely thus leading to certain individuals having more severe crisis as shown by increased LOS in our adult population. Additionally, only a few individuals with likely more severe crisis needed more RBC transfusions. The general trend for different patients requiring RBCs and IV opiates decreased during the pandemic. Due to more people foregoing medical care especially in the minority populations who had restrictions to access to healthcare, there was an overall decrease in inpatient healthcare utilization in sickle cell population during the pandemic. Additionally care disparities in outcome of pediatric and adult SCD patients were highlighted by our study. Pediatric patients commonly cared at a center of excellence by the dedicated team of sickle cell stakeholders, seemed to do well overall as compared to adult SCD patients who notoriously have has inequitable access to comprehensive Sickle Cell care globally. Infrastructure around better outpatient support, care optimization with sickle cell disease m difying agents and timely access to inpatient care even in a pandemic, that is ongoing could be strategies to reduce stress on the health care systems and better utilization of scarce resources in current times of surge from an International health care crisis such as the SAR CoV2 pandemic.

"Depression and Anxiety in Persons with Von Willebrand Disease","[Formula presented] Background: Depression and anxiety are associated with poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL), lower functioning and decreased treatment adherence. In 2019, 7% adults in the US had moderate/severe symptoms of depression, while &lt;5% had anxiety. Impacts of depression and anxiety in persons with von Willebrand disease (VWD) are unclear and less studied. Objective: We assessed sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with depression and anxiety in a geographically diverse cohort of individuals with VWD obtaining care at seven US Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs). Methods: The study enrolled and collected data on individuals age =12 with VWD Type 1 (VWF:Ag/RCo: =30%), low VWF(VWF:Ag/RCo: 30-50%), Type 2, and type 3 between September 2018-June 2021. Participants completed a survey at enrollment to collect sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, self-reported pain, joint problems and HRQoL measured by the EQ-5D-3L. A quarterly survey administered one year post-enrollment collected similar data. The patient health questionnaire (PHQ-8) and the generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) were administered with the last follow-up survey after August 2019. Chart reviews ed VWD type information. The association of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics with depression or anxiety was assessed using Chi-square tests for categorical variables, as well as logistic regression models with stepwise selection. Results: We analyzed data from 77 participants who completed both baseline and last follow-up surveys. Mean age was 34.2 (standard deviation (SD)=18.8) years, 74.0% were adults =18 years, 79.2% were female, 60.8% had Type 1/low VWF, and 3.9% had Type 3 VWD. Mean age at VWD diagnosis was 13.9 (SD=13.2) years. Overall reported depression rate was 63.4%, and 58.3% for anxiety (values =10 on either PHQ-8 or GAD-7). Proportion of those with depression (75% vs. 62%) or anxiety (58% vs. 58%) prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic were not significantly different. Persons with low VWF had higher rates of depression (86.7%) or anxiety (69.2%) as compared to those with type 1 VWD (55.3% for depression, 52.8% for anxiety) or types 2 and 3 (62.5%, 60.9%, p=0.10, not significant (NS) for depression and p=0.56, NS for anxiety, respectively). Females reported a higher rate of anxiety (61.4%) than males (46.7%, p=0.30, NS). When compared to individuals who rated their general health as the same or better than 3-months ago, those who rated their health as worse had significantly higher rates of depression (92.3% vs. 57.8%, p=0.02) and anxiety (83.3% vs. 53.3%, p=0.05). Participants with chronic pain reported a significantly higher depression rate (81.6% vs. 36.8%, p=0.0003). Those who reported having joint problems also reported depression at a significantly higher rate (82.4% vs. 48.8%, p=0.002) or anxiety (74.1% vs. 46.3%, p=0.02) than those without joint problems. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that among adults or parents of pediatric patients, being single or not with a partner was the most important variable associated with depression (odds ratio (OR)=7.0, confidence interval (CI): 1.7-29.0), followed by having joint problems (OR=6.3, CI=2.0-20.1). The most important variable associated with anxiety was being a youth aged 12-18 years old (OR=6.7, CI=1.6-26.9), followed by being single or not with a partner (OR=10.8, CI=2.5-47.5), or having worse health compared to 3-months prior (OR=12.3, CI=1.3-116.2). Mean covariates adjusted EQ index scores were lower among persons with depression (0.75Â±standard error (SE) 0.03 vs. 0.83Â±0.04, p=0.06 NS) or anxiety (0.75Â±0.03 vs. 0.82Â±0.04, p=0.7 NS) than among those without depression or anxiety. As compared to individuals without depression or anxiety, mean covariates adjusted EQ VAS was significantly lower in persons with depression (68.7Â±3.1 vs. 77.6Â±4.2, p=0.03), but not among those with anxiety (69.3Â±3.7 vs. 71.3Â±4.3, p=0.66 NS). Conclusions: Our study revealed higher rates of major depression and anxiety in thi VWD sample than the general US population. Depression had a significant negative impact on HRQoL. Mental health screening is imperative for persons with VWD, especially those with low VWF, chronic pain or joint problems. Special attention should be paid to women and youth. This study underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach in the comprehensive care of patients seen at HTCs.

"Being Present-CML: A Distress Reduction Intervention for Patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Taking Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors","Background: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) enable patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) to achieve similar overall survival to the general population, but can cause side effects that negatively impact quality of life (QOL) and contribute to distress. Since most CP-CML patients remain on TKIs indefinitely, there is a need to develop targeted interventions to address their physical and psychosocial complications. Mindfulness meditation interventions have improved QOL and decreased distress, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain in patients with solid tumors;however, such interventions have not previously been evaluated in patients with CP-CML. In Being Present-CML, we sought to determine if a mindfulness meditation-based program is feasible and acceptable to patients with CP-CML, and to explore its preliminary efficacy. Methods: Being Present-CML is a prospective, single-arm clinical trial of an 8-week, online mindfulness meditation-based intervention effective in patients with gastrointestinal cancers (Atreya, et al. PLoS One, 2018). Participants were recruited from a single academic institution. Eligibility included adult patients with CP-CML taking TKIs. Participants were instructed to independently play audio-guided meditations at least 5 times per week on a secure website and to participate in once weekly, instructor-led meditation classes on Zoom in assigned cohorts. Qigong was incorporated into the classes to target fatigue, a common TKI side effect. Class content was recorded and uploaded to the website for those unable to attend live. Feasibility was assessed through measurement of recruitment and attrition. Adherence was determined by web capture. Acceptability was determined by feedback from study surveys and qualitative interviews. Preliminary efficacy was evaluated using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at baseline (week 0) and post-intervention (week 8) using the NCCN Distress Thermometer (DT) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) short forms for anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, and sleep disturbance. A DT score =4 is consistent with moderate to severe distress. PROMIS scores use T-scores where the mean score for the general population is 50 (standard deviation [SD] +/-10);higher scores indicate worse symptoms. Descriptive statistics and two-tailed paired t-tests (p &lt;0.05) were used to summarize the data. Results: Between October 2020-April 2021, 98 eligible participants were approached to participate in the study;88 (89.8%) patients agreed to learn more, and 37 (37.8%) patients provided consent. The median age was 51 (range 23-72), 51.5% (n=19/37) were male, and 89.1% (n=33/37) were non-Hispanic White. At time of study start, 83.7% (n=31/37) had a BCR-ABL1 PCR transcript =1% and a median time since diagnosis of 71 months (range 2-234) (Table 1). Of 37 participants, 29 (78.4%) completed end of study procedures;4 (10.8%) dropped out, and 4 (10.8%) did not complete week 8 surveys. The median number of audio meditations listened to per participant was 34 with an average of 4.3 per week. The median number of weekly classes attended and/or recordings viewed per participant was 7 (range 1-8). At baseline, participants had a median DT score of 5 (range 2-8). Average baseline PROMIS scores were slightly worse than the general population in depression (51.4, SD 8.8), anxiety (55.9, SD 7.8), sleep disturbance (51.8, SD 6.9), fatigue (53.9, SD 10.6), and pain interference (52.2, SD 9.9). By week 8, the median DT score improved to 3 (p=0.003) (Figure 1). Post-study PROMIS scores improved in sleep disturbance (p=0.001) and depression (p=0.01) (Figure 2), but not anxiety (p=0.12), fatigue (p=0.10), or pain interference (p=0.98). Of those who conducted post-study interviews, 77% (n=20/26) reported their symptoms during the study were not influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly all participants found the study helpful (Figure 3) and would recommend it to others (median score of 8 on a 1-10 scale;10=extremely likely). Concl sions: Patients with CP-CML taking TKIs found the mindfulness meditation-based intervention to be feasible and acceptable. PROM results suggest promise of clinical benefit in this patient population, including patients with well-controlled disease and a long history of CML. A randomized controlled trial is being planned to validate these findings.

"Potential Benefits of a 6-Week Exercise and Mindfulness-Based Telehealth Training for HCT Survivors to Meet the Challenges of the COVID-19 Pandemic - a Feasibility Study","Background: Impairment of quality of life (QOL) such as reduced physical fitness and psycho-social dysfunction, is a recognized late effect of HCT, a life-saving procedure. Guided exercise and mindfulness-based stress management (MBSM) programs, delivered alone or in combination, have shown promise in improving patient's QOL mainly in the inpatient setting. Delivery of equitable and effective interventions in outpatient settings is challenging but may be addressed via telecommunication technology, reducing clinic visits and infection transmission. The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility and efficacy of a virtual and home-based program of combined exercise and MBSM via videoconference. Methods: Patients attending our post-HCT outpatient clinic were invited to participate (SVH HREC approval 12/175). Eligibility criteria included aged 18-75 years, &gt;6 months post allogeneic HCT and the basic skills to access the online training and assessment packages. Patients with severe medical and psychological problems were excluded by their clinicians. Consented participants attended an initial in-person introductory session and were provided materials including booklet and audio recordings for skill practice. This was followed by once weekly exercise and MBSM training for 6 weeks via videoconferencing. Assessments were performed pre, and then virtually post training, and at 3, 6 and 12 months. Assessment session included: 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), Modified Bruce Test (MBT), sit-to-stand (STS), hand grip strength (HGS). Subjective measures were Goal Attainment Scale, Karnofsky Score, FACT-BMT, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Godin-Shephard Leisure Time Index. Linear mixed-effects model was used for outcome comparisons. This maximum likelihood approach utilizes all acquired data points and manages missing data points by missing at random (MAR) assumption. P values were adjusted using Holm-Sidak method for multiple comparisons. Results: Twenty-four eligible patients responded to the invitation and completed the program (54% male, median age 53 years (33 - 73), median time post-HCT of 37 months (13 - 68), 38% rural/remote). Based on participant feedback surveys at 6 months, this combined modality telehealth program was found to be well-accepted and safe. The 6-MWT scores were significantly higher at 3 and 12 months (M=646.5m, SD=53.34 and M=615.33m, SD= 94.95, respectively;both p &lt; 0.01) compared to baseline (M=566.94, SD=145.22). The MBT, the only test that required participants to attend the clinic was ceased after 3 months as changes in 6-MWT paralleled changes in MBT. STS Test was significantly higher at 3 and 12 months (M=19.53, SD=6.93, p&lt;0.01 and M=19.07 SD= 8.0;both p &lt; 0.05) compared to baseline (M=15.14, SD=6.44). For the upper limb assessment, dominant hand grip was significantly stronger at 3, and 12 months (M=35.09, SD=9.83;p&lt; 0.01) compared to baseline (M=29.07, SD=9.79). A significantly higher FACT-BMT total and FACT-G scores were found at 3 months (M=123.37, SD=15.12 and M=91.23, SD=11.76;p&lt; 0.01) compared to baseline (M=116.44, SD=14.16 and M=88.25, SD=12.52 respectively), and a trend non-significant at 12 months. Conclusion: A 6-week internet and home-based exercise and MBSM programme was an acceptable, safe, and potentially effective intervention for sustained improvement of some QOL outcomes in HCT survivors. The positive findings of this feasibility study provided valuable data for the design of a multicentre RCT that is underway. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.","Ma, D.; Kliman, D.; Fennessy, K.; Molan, N.","https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2021-152350","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Blood; 138:4045, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24888,""
"Randomized, Multi-Center, Double-Blinded, Placebo Controlled Safety and Early Efficacy Trial of Cryopreserved Cord Blood Derived T-Regulatory Cell Infusions (CK0802) in the Treatment of COVID-19 Induced ARDS (RESOLVE Trial)","Background. COVID19 associated moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Immune dysfunction and hyper-inflammatory responses result in a vicious cycle of tissue inflammation and end organ damage. Based on the suggestion of early efficacy of adoptive therapy with allogeneic T regulatory cells in COVID19 ARDS (Gladstone et al., Ann Int Med 2020), Cellenkos Â® initiated a randomized, placebo controlled, multi-center trial of multiple doses of CK0802 (allogeneic, off-the-shelf, cryopreserved, cord blood derived T regulatory cells) for treatment of moderate-to-severe COVID19-related ARDS patients. Study design. Multi-center, randomized, blinded, placebo controlled trial of CK0802 at two different doses (100 million cells and 300 million cells ) were compared to placebo. Each patient was randomized to receive the assigned product on days 0, 3 and 7 (Figure 1), without HLA matching. Enrollment was staggered for the first 6 active treatment patients with 7 days between each patient while monitoring for any safety signals. Subsequent patients were enrolled on a continuous basis. DSMB monitoring occurred after every cohort of 15 patients (5 controls;5 of each active treatment). Results are presented as median (with range) unless otherwise indicated. Primary Outcomes. The two co-primary outcomes were: â€¢ Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) = Regimen related grade 3, 4, or 5 toxicity within 48 hours of first infusion â€¢ S28 = [Alive and not intubated 28 days after the date of first infusion] = 28-day treatment success Secondary Outcomes. Secondary outcomes, recorded from first day of infusion up to 28 days later, included: i) time to extubation, ii) ventilator-free days;iii) organ failure-free days;iii) ICU free days;iv) PaO 2/FiO 2 between days 0 and 11;and v) 28-day all-cause mortality Covariates. Patient covariates recorded at enrollment included: i) age, ii) gender iii) on vasopressors;iii) on hemodialysis;iv) duration of intubation prior to enrollment. Study Conduct. The multicenter study (n=5 centers) was activated in October 2020 and enrollment completed in March 2021. Results. Forty-five patients were enrolled (60% male, median age 60 [range 21-85], 46.7% Caucasian race). At baseline 13% were on hemodialysis;62% on vasopressors;SOFA score=8 (6-13);PaO 2=85 mmHg (45-133);FiO 2=60% (40-100);PEEP=10 cmH 2O (5-18) with a median duration of intubation of 48 hrs (0-120) prior to enrollment. Patient were intubated a median of 72 [0-144] hours prior to infusion. Sixty percent of patients were alive and extubated at day 28. Median time to extubation from first infusion was 10.5 [2-46] days and median ventilator free days at day 28 was 12 [0-26]days. No treatment related SAEs were reported. Time to extubation from first infusion was 10.5 days (2-46) and at day 28 the ventilator free days were 12 (0-26). The estimated day 28 overall survival was 78.6% with the following breakdown according to the co-variates: i) age&gt;60 yrs =77.5% vs. age&lt;60yrs=79.9%;ii) female=85.7% vs male=73.7%;iii) on vasopressor=65.8% vs. 77.8%;iv) on hemodialysis=75% vs. 79%. Duration of intubation to enrollment had no impact on 28d survival. At baseline, 14 pts were positive for both HLA I and HLA II antibodies (Abs);3 pts positive for HLA I Ab only, and 9 positive for HLA II Ab only. In 20 paired samples collected on day 0 and day 28, HLA I Ab and HLA II Ab seroconversion was observed in 4 and 1 pt, respectively. Discussion This is the first clinical trial to examine safety and early efficacy of multiple doses of allogenic, off-the-shelf, cryopreserved, T regulatory cells for the treatment of COVID-19-related ARDS. Full data analysis of treatment groups (placebo;CK0802-100 million;CK0802-300 million) is ongoing and will be presented at the conference. Additional data to be presented will include: 3- and 6- month QOL, mental health, and cognitive index analyses, and paired Biomarker analysis.

"COVID-19 triage in general adult in-patient psychiatry: perspectives from clinicians on a novel triage ward during the pandemic","Intra-hospital transmission of COVID-19 is a major concern. To mitigate this risk, 'COVID-triage' psychiatric wards were implemented by some in-patient service providers in the UK. Although the effectiveness of this model has not been investigated, there are questions about the benefits and detriments of this model of care for patients and staff. This reflection draws from the experiences of clinicians who were redeployed from their planned clinical posts (and training rotations, in the case of trainees) to staff a newly established COVID-triage ward at a large urban mental healthcare provider, between August 2020 and March 2021.","Williams, R.; Cranshaw, J.; da Costa, M.

"Standardization of the method of concentration and extraction of nucleic acids in wastewater samples: a low-cost tool to be used in epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2","Sewage quality surveillance can represent a complementary tool for monitoring infectious diseases and preventing epidemic outbreaks, especially when the capacity for clinical testing is limited. Thus, the present study describes the technical details of a low-cost method for concentrating and extracting nucleic acids from sewage samples, as a preliminary step for the detection of viruses and other pathogens. To validate the proposed methodology, after the concentration and extraction steps, the presence of the SARS coronavirus-2 (COVID-19) in the samples was analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The virus' ribonucleic acid was detected in 80% of the sewage samples analyzed, proving the success of the methodological procedure adopted. The early detection of a pathogen associated with the work of multidisciplinary teams allows the practice of epidemiological surveillance, which assists in making decisions about One Health - an inseparable union between animal, human, and environmental health.","Cabral, A.

"Challenges of diversity and inclusion in defence emergency management and preparedness during the COVID-19 pandemic","LAY SUMMARY The Canadian military's recent mission in support of long-term-care homes in Ontario, and the alleged abuses reported, demonstrates the urgent need to address challenges associated with diversity and inclusion in defence emergency management and preparedness during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article reviews the social and health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on diverse groups within the Canadian Defence Team and across Canada, with a particular focus on visible minorities, Indigenous people, women, older adults, persons with disabilities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and two-spirit communities. The review indicates that the pandemic widened the existing physical and mental health disparities and socio-economic inequities affecting these groups. To address these challenges, and to better understand the needs of diverse groups in the pandemic context, several recommendations for the Defence Team are proposed to incorporate into daily encounters with diverse groups and communities affected by COVID-19. The recommendations are designed to enable the Defence Team to establish positive and sustainable relations with diverse communities and to increase community resilience and defence emergency operational readiness. The range of potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals, families, and communities emphasizes the importance of recognizing the diverse perspectives and needs of the Canadian Defence Team and the urgency of developing inclusive approaches for managing these impacts. Whether the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) and Department of National Defence (DND) are providing support to their own diverse workforce, or responding with humanitarian relief in Canada and abroad, it is essential to understand how the COVID-19 crisis may affect diverse groups across Canada. As a result, this article provides a perspective on COVID-19's potential impacts on diverse groups and communities when examining emergency management and preparedness in the Canadian defence context. The potential challenges that may be experienced by diverse groups across Canada, including members of the Defence Team, are discussed, with a focus on racialized people, women, older adults, persons with disabilities, and members of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and two-spirit communities who reside across the Canadian landscape. The article also includes evidence-based recommendations that are intended to complement existing efforts to mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19, and it further contributes to the well-being of the Defence Team and DND-CAF readiness.","Waruszynski, B.

"Oncology nursing in the Global South during COVID-19","In mid-2020, a call was made to oncology nurses in the Global South to share their experiences managing patient care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Eighteen submissions were received from 16 countries across Latin America, Africa, Europe and Asia. Three were research-based and 15 were personal narratives on the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on the nurses, colleagues, patients and families. Three narratives were from oncology nurses working with cancer-related non-governmental organisations locally or, in one case, internationally. A simultaneous literature search for publications (including grey literature) was performed to identify themes of COVID-19's impact in these 16 countries and specifically on oncology nurses and patients/families. Four themes were identified: a) interruptions to care;b) support/resource shortages;c) psychosocial impact on nurses and patients and d) staffing and nursing role impacts. The three research-based studies describe oncology nursing in-depth efforts to explore the impact of COVID-19. Findings in the 15 narratives are briefly presented according to the four themes identified in the literature. Due to the severe shortage of physician adult and paediatric oncology specialists, oncology nurses in the Global South often shoulder much of the care for patients with cancer and even more so during COVID-19 with attendant oncology nursing shortages due to reassignment to COVID-19 units. It is important to hear from these critical members of the oncology nursing workforce who often lack the time, resources or training to publish in peer-reviewed journals in English, particularly in the middle of a pandemic. Giving voice to these nurses documents the reality of their work and ability to continue to provide care despite the chaos and rapidly changing guidelines and government action. Lessons learned by these nurses to improve mental health and psychosocial support of the nurses as well as their patients/families will be essential for the next global pandemic.","Challinor, J.; Sierra, M.

"A study to assess the psychosocial aspects of care for cancer patients with COVID-19 at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India","COVID-19 has more impact on cancer patients due to their immune compromised status. In this study, we tried to understand the impact of cancer patients afflicted with COVID-19 in the physical, emotional, vocational, financial and social domains. The patient caregivers' problems were also assessed. The investigator tailored the tool and content validity was done by the experts. Total samples were 50 and convenient sampling was used. Descriptive statistics were used and the Shapiro-Wilk's test was used for normalcy of the variables. The major findings were that the majority belonged to male population with an average annual salary. The diagnosis was hematolymphoid as the main focus compared to breast, bone, gynaecological, gastrointestinal, genitourinary and others. Patients who were receiving chemotherapy were in the majority when compared to radiation, Palliation and surgery. In the physical domain, patients experienced fatigue as a major problem most probably due to the treatment of chemotherapy. The other major problems were loss of smell, breathlessness and loss of appetite. Skin pigmentations were not experienced. In the emotional domain, the major problem was the depression they experienced during COVID-19. In the social domain, financial problems was the most important aspect and access to medication acquirement and transport during the pandemic and job securities were the other problems. Care givers felt social distancing to be a major aspect while looking after patients. They were very uncertain about the prognosis of COVID-19. The Middle age group had more emotional problems.","Jagdish, P.; Pawar, M.; D'Souza, A.; Goswami, S.; AkshayPatil","https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2021.1330","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Ecancermedicalscience; 15:1-8, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24894,""
"Cancer care in the COVID-19 era and psychosocial impacts on oncology nursing in Brazil","Introduction: Globally, Brazil has the third highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the second highest number of deaths related to COVID-19 at the time of writing. Maintaining cancer care has been a challenge for patient safety and for the physical and mental health of oncology nurses. Objectives: To describe which effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care could already be evaluated and to identify the psychosocial impact on cancer nurses in Brazil. Method: Reflective, analytical, qualitative study. Results: Although the Brazilian cancer care policy has reached important achievements in overcoming access barriers to cancer diagnosis and treatment over the past decade, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused losses of timely access to health services for patients with cancer, which has compromised screening, early diagnosis and treatment, and patient follow-up. Oncology nurses have actively participated in the management and assistance strategies during the pandemic. This path has generated an increase in oncology nurses' workload, leading to physical and mental stress and anxiety related to the fear of contagion for themselves and their family. Conclusion: The pandemic has affected the care of cancer patients, with the potential to suffer greater losses because of reductions in screening, early diagnosis and treatment, and patient follow-up. In addition to the worsening of the cancer setting, the COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed Brazilian oncology nurses, physically and mentally.","Teixeira, T. O. A.; Carvalho, L. G.; Camargo, G.

"A review of the prevalence, associated factors and interventions of psychological symptoms among cancer patients in the Chinese Mainland during the COVID-19 pandemic","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed tremendous pressure on public health systems across the world. Compared with the healthy population, cancer patients are more prone to developing psychological problems, including depression and anxiety, because of worries about cancer recurrence, cancer symptoms, treatment-related discomfort, a lack of social interaction and the impact on their financial well-being. This paper aimed to identify existing evidence on psychological symptoms and their associated factors among cancer patients in the Chinese Mainland during the COVID-19 pandemic, and on interventions to effectively manage these symptoms. Articles related to the prevalence, the risk factors and interventions of psychological symptoms among cancer patients in the Chinese Mainland during COVID-19 published between December 2019 and August 2020 were searched in two English (PubMed and Embase) and two Chinese (CNKI and Wan Fang Data) databases. A total of 180 studies were identified, and 18 studies were included in the review after removing duplicates and screening for relevancy. The results suggest that patients with cancer in the Chinese Mainland have suffered psychological pressure during COVID-19, with a high prevalence of psychological distress, depression and anxiety reported across most of the reviewed studies. Pandemic-related factors such as treatment discontinuation and worry about being infected are associated with these symptoms. Nurses may help to relieve these symptoms by identifying stressors, providing relevant information through mass and social media and referring patients to specialists for psychological support. However, evidence about treatments and interventions for these symptoms is limited, and additional research is warranted to identify effective interventions to promote resilience in this patient population.","Xu, B.

"Psychological Symptoms in COVID-19 Patients: Insights into Pathophysiology and Risk Factors of Long COVID-19","There is growing evidence of studies associating COVID-19 survivors with increased mental health consequences. Mental health implications related to a COVID-19 infection include both acute and long-term consequences. Here we discuss COVID-19-associated psychiatric sequelae, particularly anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), drawing parallels to past coronavirus outbreaks. A literature search was completed across three databases, using keywords to search for relevant articles. The cause may directly correlate to the infection through both direct and indirect mechanisms, but the underlying etiology appears more complex and multifactorial, involving environmental, psychological, and biological factors. Although most risk factors and prevalence rates vary across various studies, being of the female gender and having a history of psychiatric disorders seem consistent. Several studies will be presented, demonstrating COVID-19 survivors presenting higher rates of mental health consequences than the general population. The possible mechanisms by which the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the brain, affecting the central nervous system (CNS) and causing these psychiatric sequelae, will be discussed, particularly concerning the SARS-CoV-2 entry via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors and the implications of the immune inflammatory signaling on neuropsychiatric disorders. Some possible therapeutic options will also be considered.","Thye, Angel Yun-Kuan, Law, Jodi Woan-Fei, Tan, Loh Teng-Hern, Pusparajah, Priyia, Ser, Hooi-Leng, Thurairajasingam, Sivakumar, Letchumanan, Vengadesh, Lee, Learn-Han","https://doi.org/10.3390/biology11010061","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Biology; 11(1):61, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24897,""
"Insomnia, pre-sleep arousal, psychosocial factors and changes in sleep pattern during the second wave lockdown of the covid-19 pandemic in georgia","Studies performed across the COVID-19 pandemic waves point to the persistent impact of the pandemic on sleep and mental health. We expand these data by examining insomnia, pre-sleep arousal, psychosocial factors, and retrospective changes in sleep pattern during the COVID-19 second wave lockdown period in Georgia. Data were collected through an online survey (n = 1117). The prevalence rate of probable insomnia disorder was 24.2%. Clinically relevant somatic and cognitive pre-sleep arousal was present in 49.8% and 58.0% of participants, and high levels of anxiety, depression and social isolation were found in 47.0%, 37.3%, 47.2% of respondents, respectively. We observed high prevalence rates of worse sleep quality, delayed bedtimes and risetimes, longer sleep latencies, higher awakenings and shorter sleep durations, relative to the pre-pandemic period. COVID-19-infected subjects showed more severe sleep and mental problems. Specific predictors differentially affected insomnia, somatic and cognitive pre-sleep arousal. Depression and COVID-19 infection emerged as vulnerability factors for pre-sleep arousal, which, in turn, wasassociated with a higher predisposition to insomnia disorder. We confirm the strong deteriorating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep and psychosocial well-being during the second wave lockdown period. The specific association between pre-sleep arousal, insomnia, and psychosocial factors is of clinical relevance for the prevention of severity and persistence of sleep and mental problems across the repeated lockdown/reopening waves. Modulation of pre-sleep arousal may prove beneficial to implement targeted interventions.","Basishvili, T.; Oniani, N.; Sakhelashvili, I.; Eliozishvili, M.; Khizanashvili, M.; Arabidze, M.; Tsaava, M.; Charekishvili, T.; Tsertsvadze, N.; Darchia, N.","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12010017","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 12(1), 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24898,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown on European Students&rsquo;Negative Emotional Symptoms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Considerable changes to higher education approaches, as a response to the global coronavirus pandemic, has increased the stress on university students. The impact of these changes has had an effect on the negative emotional symptoms being experienced, which can lead to more severe mental health issues. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine the prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress during the coronavirus lockdown. A systematic review of three electronic databases (Google Scholar, PubMed and Medline) was conducted, with 13 studies from different European countries reporting data on students and their negative emotional symptoms identified. The random-effects model was used to perform the meta-analysis on anxiety, depression and stress. The overall pooled prevalence rate was 55% (95% CI: 45&ndash;64%) for anxiety, 63% (95% CI: 52&ndash;73%) for depression and 62% (95% CI: 43&ndash;79%) for stress. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on negative emotional symptoms has been serious with studies reporting high prevalence rates for these. Isolation, reduced social contact, duration of quarantine and restrictions, which are the characteristics of a lockdown, played an important role in increased negative emotional symptoms for students. Countries have to be aware of this situation and develop mental support strategies to mitigate the impact.","Oliveira Carvalho, Patrick, HÃ¼lsdÃ¼nker, Thorben, Carson, Fraser","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12010003","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 12(1):3, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24899,""
"Personality Traits, Cognitive Styles, Coping Strategies, and Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown on Healthy Youngsters","The objective of the present study was to explore possible changes in the psychological wellbeing of young healthy students during the initial 14 days of the COVID-19 general lockdown that occurred in March of 2020, and if there was any relation with specific personality traits (neuroticism, psychoticism, and extraversion), cognitive styles (internal and external locus of control and intolerance of uncertainty), and coping strategies. One hundred twenty-two university students aged from 18 to 29 years participated in the study. The dispositional factors were assessed at the beginning of the study, while measures of psychological adjustment (anxiety, depression, and self-perceived health) were taken in three different assessment stages, employing validated questionnaires and scales. Anxiety and depression scores significantly increased after one week of lockdown, reaching a plateau pattern by the second week. The levels of self-perceived mental health, vitality, and quality of life showed a pattern of sustained progressive decrease, with a more acute lessening during the first week. Neuroticism, intolerance of uncertainty, and negative autofocus were associated to worse levels of psychological adjustment. These individual differences might be taken into consideration when designing prevention programs aiming to dampen the psychological impact of a general lockdown in healthy population.","Ãrbol, Javier RodrÃ­guez, Ruiz-Osta, Alberto, Montoro Aguilar, Casandra Isabel","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12010005","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 12(1):5, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24900,""
"Neurologic Complications in Adult and Pediatric Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection","SARS-CoV-2 has an impact on the nervous system as a result of pathological cellular and molecular events at the level of vascular and neural tissue. Severe neurologic manifestations including stroke, ataxia, seizure, and depressed level of consciousness are prevalent in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although the mechanism is still unclear, SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with the pathogenesis of intravascular coagulation and angiotensin-converting enzyme-I, both exacerbating systemic inflammation and contributing to hypercoagulation or blood&ndash;brain barrier leakage, resulting in ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. On the other hand, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in neural tissue and within the cerebrospinal fluid may induce neural dysfunction, resulting in neuroinflammation, which is exacerbated by peripheral and neural hypercytokinemia that can lead to neuronal damage and subsequent neuroinflammation. A deeper understanding of the fundamental biological mechanisms of neurologic manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 infection can pave the way to identifying a single biomarker or network of biomarkers to help target neuroprotective therapy in patients at risk for developing neurological complications.","Howard, Kendall, Williams, Taylor, Fitch, Elizabeth, Ots, Heather, Pototskiy, Esther, Hawkshead, Jay, Ghersin, Zelda, Musto, Alberto E.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ctn6010001","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Clinical and Translational Neuroscience; 6(1):1, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24901,""
"&ldquo;What Is Hidden behind the Mask?&rdquo;Facial Emotion Recognition at the Time of COVID-19 Pandemic in Cognitively Normal Multiple Sclerosis Patients","Social cognition deficits have been described in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), even in absence of a global cognitive impairment, affecting predominantly the ability to adequately process emotions from human faces. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced people to wear face masks that might interfere with facial emotion recognition. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed at investigating the ability of emotion recognition in PwMS from faces wearing masks. We enrolled a total of 42 cognitively normal relapsing&ndash;remitting PwMS and a matched group of 20 healthy controls (HCs). Participants underwent a facial emotion recognition task in which they had to recognize from faces wearing or not surgical masks which of the six basic emotions (happiness, anger, fear, sadness, surprise, disgust) was presented. Results showed that face masks negatively affected emotion recognition in all participants (p &lt; 0.001);in particular, PwMS showed a global worse accuracy than HCs (p = 0.005), mainly driven by the &ldquo;no masked&rdquo;(p = 0.021) than the &ldquo;masked&rdquo;(p = 0.064) condition. Considering individual emotions, PwMS showed a selective impairment in the recognition of fear, compared with HCs, in both the conditions investigated (&ldquo;masked&rdquo;: p = 0.023;&ldquo;no masked&rdquo;: p = 0.016). Face masks affected negatively also response times (p &lt; 0.001);in particular, PwMS were globally hastier than HCs (p = 0.024), especially in the &ldquo;masked&rdquo;condition (p = 0.013). Furthermore, a detailed characterization of the performance of PwMS and HCs in terms of accuracy and response speed was proposed. Results from the present study showed the effect of face masks on the ability to process facial emotions in PwMS, compared with HCs. Healthcare professionals working with PwMS at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak should take into consideration this effect in their clinical practice. Implications in the everyday life of PwMS are also discussed.","Ziccardi, Stefano, Crescenzo, Francesco, Calabrese, Massimiliano","https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics12010047","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Diagnostics; 12(1):47, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24902,""
"Educational Impact on Ecuadorian University Students Due to the COVID-19 Context","The mobility restrictions imposed in different countries due to the pandemic of Sars-CoV2 has hugely impacted different areas in the world. In this work, impacts on the social areas of Ecuadorian university students such as education, economy, physical and mental health, and access to telecommunications are analyzed. For this work, in a snapshot between May to September 2020, 1841 students from 6 public and 5 private universities from Ecuador were surveyed through 47 questions, which were grouped into 7 mutually exclusive dimensions. The Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the correlations between the responses of the questions and the relations between dimensions. Dimensional relations were used to analyze how students perceive online classes, teachers&rsquo;preparation, mood, and the impact on their learning process due to their decreasing family income. Among the most important results, we found that 63.78% of students want to return to on-site classes regardless of their conditions of Internet connection and their available learning tools (computers, tablets, or cellphones). The results also show that family income has influenced how students access the Internet, Internet connection, technological resources for online learning, and mood. Regarding the relations between variables, we found that older students and students from higher semesters think that online classes are better than face-to-face classes and want to continue in online education.","BenalcÃ¡zar, Marco E.; Barona, Lorena, Valdivieso, Ãngel Leonardo, Vimos, Victor Hugo, Velastegui, Daniel, Santacruz, Cesar J.","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci12010017","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Education Sciences; 12(1):17, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24903,""
"Energy Poverty among Tertiary Students in Aotearoa New Zealand","Energy poverty in Aotearoa New Zealand is well-documented, and tertiary students have been identified as an at-risk group. However, there has been very little research on tertiary students&rsquo;experiences of energy poverty in New Zealand. This paper used a nationwide online survey to investigate the extent and impact of energy poverty among tertiary students. Furthermore, it aimed to identify disparities between different demographic groups, understand the effects of COVID-19 and evaluate the effectiveness of the support policies available to students. Responses from 522 students were analysed;85% were under 30 years old, 72% were female, 14% identified as M&#257;ori, and 14% reported having long-term disabilities or health concerns. The findings of this study are concerning. Tertiary students in New Zealand are largely living in dwelling conditions that do not meet recommended health standards and exacerbate energy poverty. Energy poverty has adverse effects on their physical and mental health;however, available support is limited or inaccessible. Most significantly, the impact of energy poverty is disproportionally affecting students with long-term disabilities or health concerns as well as students identifying as M&#257;ori. Moreover, the impact of COVID-19 further strained students experiencing energy poverty and again, disproportionally affected more vulnerable students.","Clark, Isobel Kiri Harris, Chun, Saera, Oâ€™Sullivan, Kimberley Clare, Pierse, Nevil","https://doi.org/10.3390/en15010076","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Energies; 15(1):76, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24904,""

"Association between Perceived Trusted of COVID-19 Information Sources and Mental Health during the Early Stage of the Pandemic in Bangladesh","Unverified information concerning COVID-19 can affect mental health. Understanding perceived trust in information sources and associated mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic is vital to ensure ongoing media coverage of the crisis does not exacerbate mental health impacts. A number of studies have been conducted in other parts of the world to determine associations between information exposure relating to COVID-19 and mental health. However, the mechanism by which trust in information sources may affect mental health is not fully explained in the developing country context. To address this issue, the present study examined associations between perceived trust in three sources of information concerning COVID-19 and anxiety/stress with the mediating effects of COVID-19 stress in Bangladesh. An online cross-sectional study was conducted with 744 Bangladeshi adults between 17 April and 1 May 2020. Perceived trust in traditional, social, and health media for COVID-19 information, demographics, frontline service status, COVID-19-related stressors, anxiety (GAD-7), and stress (PSS-4) were assessed via self-report. Linear regression tested for associations between perceived trust and mental health. Mediation analyses investigated whether COVID-19-related stressors affected perceived trust and mental health associations. In fully adjusted models, more trust in social media was associated with more anxiety (B = 0.03, CI = 0.27&ndash;0.97) and stress (B = 0.01, CI = &minus;0.34&ndash;0.47), while more trust in traditional media was associated with more anxiety (B = 0.09, CI = 0.17&ndash;2.26) but less stress (B = &minus;0.08, CI = &minus;0.89&ndash;0.03). Mediation analyses showed that COVID-19-related stressors partially explained associations between perceived trust and anxiety. These findings suggest that trusting social media to provide accurate COVID-19 information may exacerbate poor mental health. These findings also indicate that trusting traditional media (i.e., television, radio, and the newspaper) may have stress-buffering effects. We recommend that responsible authorities call attention to concerns about the trustworthiness of social media as well as broadcast positive and authentic news in traditional media outcomes based on these results.","Patwary, Muhammad Mainuddin, Bardhan, Mondira, Browning, Matthew H.

Healthcare professionals struggle on the frontline and they can experience stigma, which can create difficulties in controlling epidemic diseases, influencing the mental health of healthcare professionals, caregivers, families, communities, and the provided quality of care. The aim of this study is to explore the lived experience of Italian nurses about perceived stigma during COVID-19 pandemic with the phenomenological Cohen method. The principal themes that emerged from data analysis were &ldquo;stigma in the working environment&rdquo;and &ldquo;stigma in everyday life&rdquo;. Each of these themes had subthemes: &ldquo;looks like gun sights&rdquo;, &ldquo;avoiding closeness to others&rdquo;, &ldquo;nobody wants to touch you&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the fault of being your family members&rdquo;. Public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, are stressful events for individuals and communities.

The objective of the present research was to develop and verify the effectiveness of a psychological intervention for professionals in the field of ID to improve their mental health during this health crisis. Methods: A total of 32 professionals participated. The variables measured were: post-traumatic growth, mental health, burnout, coping strategies, resilience, life satisfaction, optimism, and cognitive and affective empathy. Results: The results revealed statistically significant differences in the post-traumatic growth variable. In the rest of the variables (mental health, burnout, coping strategies, resilience, vital satisfaction, optimism, and empathy), no significant differences between groups were found. Conclusions: An increase in the levels of post-traumatic growth was observed in the intervention group after a brief online psychological intervention.

Objective: To analyze which variables related to the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the risk of relapse in patients with SMDs. Method: A multicenter retrospective cohort study in which data were collected from 270 patients with mental disorders who had been under follow-up in day hospitals during the year 2020. Results: The proportion of full mental health inpatient admissions was significantly higher in those who lost their employment (40.7% vs. 18.1%;p = 0.01), in those who were not receiving psychotherapy interventions (33.9% vs. 16.6%;p = 0.006), and in those who were not receiving occupational therapy (25.7% vs. 13.6%: p = 0.013).

Ten outpatients suffering from schizophrenia were interviewed in a semi-structured format using an interview designed by the authors for the purpose of this study. The interviews were transcribed, and a conventional qualitative content analysis was conducted. The general themes identified in the content analysis were organized into four categories: first reactions to information about the pandemic;subjective assessment of the pandemicâ€™s impact on patientsâ€™ mental health;patientsâ€™ attitudes towards the temporary limitations and lockdowns;psychiatric treatment and psychotherapy during the pandemic. A variety of different experiences were observed, but the general conclusion arising from the study suggests that the majority of the interviewed patients coped quite well with the pandemic and that the observed reactions were similar to the reactions of other groups described in the literature.

"â€œFamily Connectionsâ€, a DBT-Based Program for Relatives of People with Borderline Personality Disorder during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Focus Group Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the family environment due to the difficulties that have been generated by job losses, deaths, increase rates of family and domestic violence, poor mental health outcomes, and estrangement in personal relationships. â€œFamily Con-nectionsâ€ (FC) is an internationally renowned DBT-based program that supports the families and caregivers of people with borderline personality disorder. The study took place at a Specialized Health Centre in Spain. A focus group with seven participants was organized for people who had previously attended an FC group. The participants were asked about their experiences during the confinement periods that was caused by COVID-19 as well as their experiences and opinions on relatives, skills practiced, their need to and the advantages of attending the group, and satisfaction with the FC group. The qualitative research web program Dedoose was used for the thematic analysis of the data. The results showed that the participants experienced various experiences during confinement;validation and radical acceptance were determined to be the most useful skills;the importance of professionals and the content as well as the sincerity of attendees and having a safe space were determined to be the greatest benefits of the programs;and the participants all indicated great satisfaction of the program. This study allowed us to explore the experiences of family members of people with BPD with their loved ones during the confinement period caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated the use of the FC program skills in the family environment during confinement, and we analyzed the acceptability and satisfaction with the FC program.","FernÃ¡ndez-Felipe, I.; DÃ­az-GarcÃ­a, A.; Marco, J.

"Mental distress during the coronavirus pandemic in Israel: Who are the most vulnerable?","Based on Pearlinâ€™s stress process model and the social inequality approach to health, this study used a social lens to explore the role of socioeconomic inequities in mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel. Specifically, we examined peopleâ€™s pre-pandemic sociodemographic characteristics and economic situation, and the economic effects of the pandemic itself on mental distress. A real-time survey was conducted in May 2020 among 273 adults (ages 20â€“68), and hierarchical linear models were employed. Findings indicated that groups vulnerable to mental distress in routine times (e.g., women, people with economic difficulties) showed the same pattern during the pandemic. Not only was unemployment related to mental distress, so too was a reduction in work hours. The pandemicâ€™s economic effects (e.g., needing to take out loans, having a worsening financial situation) were also associated with increased mental distress. This study is one of very few studies to explore a wide range of socioeconomic factors and their association with mental distress during the current crisis. The findings call for broader interventions to alleviate the economic distress caused by the pandemic to promote mental health, especially for groups that were vulnerable before the crisis and those most affected economically following the pandemic.","Refaeli, T.; Krumer-Nevo, M.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19010124","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(1), 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24913,""

"Psychological distress among bangladeshi dental students during the covid-19 pandemic","Background: Psychological sufferings are observed among dental students during their academic years, which had been intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: This study assessed the levels and identified factors associated with psychological distress, fear and coping experienced by dental undergraduate students in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross sectional online survey was conducted during October-November, 2021. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) were used in order to assess psychological distress, fear and coping strategies, respectively. Results: A total of 327 students participated;the majority (72%) were 19â€“23 years old and females (75%). One in five participants were infected with COVID-19 and 15% reported contact with COVID-19 cases. Negative financial impact (AOR 3.72, 95% CIs 1.28â€“10.8), recent or past COVID-19 infection, and contact with COVID-19 cases were associated with higher levels of psychological distress;but being a third year student (0.14, 0.04â€“0.55) and being satisfied about current social life (0.11, 0.03â€“0.33) were associated with lower levels of psychological distress. Being a third year (0.17, 0.08â€“0.39) and a fourth year student (0.29, 0.12â€“0.71) were associated with lower levels of fear. Health care service use and feeling positive about life were associated with medium to high resilience coping. Conclusions: This study identified dental students in Bangladesh who were at higher risk of psychological distress, fear and coping during the ongoing pandemic. Development of a mental health support system within dental institutions should be considered in addition to the academic and clinical teaching.","Sabrina, F.; Chowdhury, M. T. H.; Nath, S.

"Acute stress in health workers during two consecutive epidemic waves of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has provoked generalized uncertainty around the world, with health workers experiencing anxiety, depression, burnout, insomnia, and stress. Although the effects of the pandemic on mental health may change as it evolves, the majority of reports have been web-based, cross-sectional studies. We performed a study assessing acute stress in frontline health workers during two consecutive epidemic waves. After screening for trait anxiety/depression and dissociative experiences, we evaluated changes in acute stress, considering resilience, state anxiety, burnout, depersonalization/derealization symptoms, and quality of sleep as cofactors. During the first epidemic wave (April 2020), health workers reported acute stress related to COVID-19, which was related to state anxiety. After the first epidemic wave, acute stress decreased, with no increase during the second epidemic wave (December 2020), and further decreased when vaccination started. During the follow-up (April 2020 to February 2021), the acute stress score was related to bad quality of sleep. However, acute stress, state anxiety, and burnout were all related to trait anxiety/depression, while the resilience score was invariant through time. Overall, the results emphasize the relevance of mental health screening before, during, and after an epidemic wave of infections, in order to enable coping during successive sanitary crises.","Renaud, K.

"Validating insomnia severity index (Isi) in a bangladeshi population: Using classical test theory and rasch analysis","The COVID-19 outbreak is associated with sleep problems and mental health issues among individuals. Therefore, there is a need to assess sleep efficiency during this tough period. Unfortunately, the commonly used instrument on insomnia severityâ€”the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)â€”has never been translated and validated among Bangladeshis. Additionally, the ISI has never been validated during a major protracted disaster (such as the COVID-19 outbreak) when individuals encounter mental health problems. The present study aimed to translate the ISI into Bangla language (ISI-Bangla) and validate its psychometric properties. First, the linguistic validity of the ISI-Bangla was established. Then, 9790 Bangladeshis (mean age = 26.7 years;SD = 8.5;5489 [56.1%] males) completed the Bangla versions of the following questionnaires: ISI, Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). All the participants also answered an item on suicidal ideation. Classical test theory and Rasch analyses were conducted to evaluate the psychometric properties of the ISI-Bangla. Both classical test theory and Rasch analyses support a one-factor structure for the ISI-Bangla. Moreover, no substantial differential item functioning was ob-served across different subgroups (gender, depression status (determined using PHQ-9), and suicidal ideation). Additionally, concurrent validity of the ISI-Bangla was supported by significant and moderate correlations with FCV-19S and PHQ-9;known-group validity was established by the significant difference of the ISI-Bangla scores between participants who experienced suicidal ideation and those without. The present psychometric validation conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak suggests that the ISI-Bangla is a promising and operationally adequate instrument to assess insomnia in Bangladeshis.","Mamun, M.

"An investigation into art therapy aided health and well-being research: A 75-year bibliometric analysis","Considering the physical, and psychological impacts and challenges brought about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), art therapy (AT) provides opportunities to promote human health and well-being. There are few systematic analysis studies in the fields of AT, which can provide content and direction for the potential value and impact of AT. Therefore, this paper aims to critically analyze the published work in the field of AT from the perspective of promoting health and well-being, and provides insights into current research status, hotspots, limitations, and future development trends of AT. This paper adopts a mixed method of quantitative and qualitative analysis including bibliometric analysis and keyword co-occurrence analysis. The results indicate that: (1) the current studies on AT are mostly related to research and therapeutic methods, types of AT, research populations and diseases, and evaluation of therapeutic effect of AT. The research method of AT mainly adopts qualitative research, among which creative arts therapy and group AT are common types of AT, and its main research populations are children, veterans, and adolescents. AT-aided diseases are trauma, depression, psychosis, dementia, and cancer. In addition, the therapeutic methods are mainly related to psychotherapy, drama, music, and dance/movement. Further, computer systems are an important evaluation tool in the research of AT;(2) the future development trend of AT-aided health and well-being based on research hotspots, could be focused on children, schizophrenia, well-being, mental health, palliative care, veterans, and the elderly within the context of addressing COVID-19 challenges;and (3) future AT-aided health and well-being could pay more attention to innovate and integrate the therapeutic methods of behavior, movement, and technology, such as virtual reality and remote supervision.","Liu, Z.; Yang, Z.; Xiao, C.; Zhang, K.; Osmani, M.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19010232","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(1), 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24918,""
"Subjective well-being among parents of children with special educational needs in Hong Kong: Impacts of stigmatized identity and discrimination under social unrest and covid-19","The COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest have posed a unique set of challenges to Hong Kong. During these two social events, parents of children with special educational needs (SEN) who were already experiencing caregiving pressure, likely coped with additional stressors;they were at a higher risk of mental health problems. A pre-registered, cross-sectional survey study was carried out among 234 Hong Kong parents of children with SEN, investigating the associations of stigmatized identity, perceived discrimination, and subjective well-being under the impact of these social events. Utilizing the Bayesian modelling, we found that highly self-stigmatized parents not only perceived more daily-life discriminating behaviors against them, but also reported having higher distress, more negative emotions, and lower life satisfaction. A higher perceived impact of social events and more discrimination were also associated with lower well-being. Additionally, stigmatized identity, perceived discrimination, and perceived impact of social events demonstrated unique associations with well-being variables, indicating they were substantial stressors. The study called out for public attention to the mental health conditions among parents of children with SEN and other disadvantaged groups in society.","Ye, F. T. F.; Sin, K.

"The changes in stress coping, alcohol use, cigarette smoking and physical activity during covid-19 related lockdown in medical students in Poland","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has significantly limited social contacts, thus contributing to deepening isolation. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 exerted on humanity not only a physical impact but also a psychological one, often increasing the feeling of stress. The long-term effects of such a state could include the management of depression, so our study aimed to analyze groups of medical students in different periods of the pandemic (at the beginning of the pandemic, after half a year of the pandemic, after one year of the pandemic) in order to assess the impact of this situation on coping with stress. The impact of the pandemic on the development of stress factors such as alcohol consumption and smoking was also studied. The level of physical activity in the context of coping with an uncertain situation was also assessed. The impact of the above-mentioned factors on the behavior of students, including the Mini-COPE questionnaire, AUDIT test, the FagerstrÃ¶m test and the IPAQ questionnaire was analyzed. It has been shown that as the pandemic and the lockdown progressed, patients consumed more often or larger amounts of alcohol, smoked more cigarettes, and levels of physical activity decreased. All these factors may have had some impact on the deterioration of coping with stress among the respondents, which would indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly contributed to an increase in the sense of stress among the students.","Kosendiak, A.; KrÃ³l, M.; Sciskalska, M.; Kepinska, M.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19010302","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(1), 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24921,""
"Stress Perception, Sleep Quality and Work Engagement of German Outpatient Nurses during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, outpatient nurses have been exposed to a double burden of already known occupational and new pandemic-related stressors. Recent studies suggest that increased pandemic-related stress can affect mental health and promote the development of negative mental health outcomes for nurses. This includes a decrease in sleep quality and work engagement. In addition, certain groups appear to be particularly vulnerable to pandemic-related stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the stress perception of German outpatient nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim was to determine associations between their pandemic-related stress and variables such as sleep quality, work engagement, pandemic-related worries and concerns. For this purpose, a questionnaire was developed based on well-established measurement instruments such as the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire to conduct a cross-sectional online survey among outpatient nurses from Germany. Participants (n = 166) showed rather moderate overall pandemic-related stress levels, good sleep quality, high work engagement, and moderate pandemic-related worries and concerns. Pandemic-related stress proved to be a predictor of decreased sleep quality and work engagement of outpatient nurses with weak effect sizes. Despite the surprisingly moderate stress levels, the effects of pandemic-related stress on selected aspects of participants&rsquo;mental health could be demonstrated. Therefore, behavioural and organisational health promotion measures are recommended to support outpatient nurses during the pandemic. However, further research is needed to determine the causal relationships and long-term effects of pandemic-related stress on the mental health of outpatient caregivers.","Bernburg, Monika, Hetzmann, Mara Shirin, Mojtahedzadeh, Natascha, Neumann, Felix Alexander, Augustin, Matthias, Harth, Volker, Groneberg, David Alexander, Zyriax, Birgit-Christiane, Mache, Stefanie","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19010313","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(1):313, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24922,""
"Help-seeking as a maladaptive coping style in the pandemic scenario: What worked and what did not for facing this new stressor","The spread of COVID-19 and its related confinement measures were important stressors for a large part of the global population, with massive effects on both physical and mental health. Assessing how individuals coped with such a stressor and which strategies were effective is one of the main challenges for psychological research. In this study, we aimed to investigate the coping strategies implied during the COVID-19 lockdown and their effectiveness. We recruited 374 Italian participants through convenience sampling during the first pandemic wave (April 2020). We administered to our participants an online battery of questionnaires including the Brief COPE, the use of alternative coping strategies proposed by the WHO to help people facing lockdown stress, and a range of psychological symptoms. An exploratory factor analysis conducted on the subscales of the Brief COPE revealed a three-factor structure. Following the previous literature, we named these factors en-gagement, disengagement, and help-seeking coping styles. In the pandemic scenario, the engagement and disengagement styles revealed the typical correlation patterns with psychological symptoms (i.e., the engagement was adaptive while the disengagement was maladaptive). Instead, contrary to previous literature, help-seeking was positively related to psychological symptoms, suggesting a mismatch between searching for help and finding it during the lockdown. This result supports the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of coping strategies in the pandemic scenario, to give more compelling and precise advice to the population.","Simione, L.; Gnagnarella, C.; Spina, G.; Bersani, G.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19010319","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(1), 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24923,""
"Maternal mental health under covid-19 pandemic in Thailand","Numerous nations have implemented lockdown measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence of the lockdown on daily living, social participation, and health service accessibility, vulnerable people, for example, new mothers, may experience an increase in mental health problems. This cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on Thai new mothers and the variables affecting their mental health. The survey data were collected from 903 Thai mothers with infants aged 0â€“12 months using an online platform and a face-to-face interview questionnaire survey between 17 July and 17 October 2020, during the first nationwide COVID-19 lockdown period. For the final analysis, there were 862 participants who completed all of the questions. The full exploratory analysis was performed by multivariable linear regression to identify the variables influencing maternal mental health. Our study demonstrated that new mothers reported feeling a high extent to some extent of worry (44.9%), increased appetite (40.4%), becoming easily annoyed or irritable (39.1%), and feeling down (33.5%), whereas 82.7% felt able to cope with the first lockdown situation. Practiced relaxation techniques were associated with positive maternal mental health (adjusted ÃŸ = 1.05, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.52, p &lt; 0.001). The perceived impact of the COVID-19 lockdown was on the householdâ€™s ability to pay for rent, to make mortgage payments (adjusted ÃŸ = -1.59, 95% CI -2.87 to -0.36, p = 0.011), the householdâ€™s ability to pay for other essentials, such as utilities and medication (adjusted ÃŸ = -1.99, 95% CI -3.16 to -0.81, p = 0.001), household crowding after lockdown (adjusted ÃŸ = -3.46, 95% CI -4.86 to -2.06, p &lt;0.001), and not going outside or doing outdoor activities (adjusted ÃŸ = -2.22, 95% CI -3.35 to -1.08, p &lt; 0.001). These impacts were significantly associated with negative mental health. In conclusion, our results emphasize the critical need for continuous monitoring of maternal mental health and developing an effective response strategy and activity for promoting maternal mental health under the stress of repetitive lockdowns and increased economic pressures.","Sirikul, W.; Ongprasert, K.; Piankusol, C.; Siviroj, P.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19010347","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(1), 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24924,""
"Lockdown-Associated Hunger May Be Affecting Breastfeeding: Findings from a Large SMS Survey in South Africa","The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, on food security and child health is especially concerning. A rapid, Short Message Service (SMS) Maternal and Child Health survey was conducted in South Africa in June 2020 (n = 3140), with a follow-up in July 2020 (n = 2287). This was a national cross-sectional survey conducted among pregnant women and mothers registered with the MomConnect mhealth platform. Logistic regression was conducted to explore the associations between breastfeeding, maternal depressive symptoms, and hunger in the household. High breastfeeding initiation rates and the early introduction of other foods or mixed milk feeding were found. The prevalence of depressive symptoms in this survey sample was 26.95%, but there was no association between breastfeeding behaviour and depressive symptom scores (OR = 0.89;95% CI: 0.63, 1.27). A positive correlation was found between not breastfeeding and not going to the health clinic. The odds of hungry mothers breastfeeding were significantly lower (OR = 0.66;p = 0.045). This result also holds in a multivariate framework, including covariates such as depressive symptoms, attendance of a PHC facility, and whether the infant was older than 3 months. Support for breastfeeding must include support, such as economic support, for breastfeeding mothers, to enable them to access nutritious diets. Mothers also need reassurance on the quality of their breastmilk and their ability to breastfeed and should be encouraged to continue to attend the health clinic regularly.","Sayed, Nazeeia, Burger, Ronelle, Harper, Abigail, Swart, Elizabeth Catherina","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19010351","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(1):351, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24925,""
"Emergency Management of Medical Wastewater in Hospitals Specializing in Infectious Diseases: A Case Study of Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China","Medical wastewater originating from hospitals specializing in infectious diseases pose a major risk to human and environmental health during pandemics. However, there have been few systematic studies on the management of this type of wastewater management. The function of the Huoshenshan Hospital as a designated emergency field hospital for the treatment of COVID-19 has provided lessons for the management measures of medical wastewater, mainly including: (1) Modern information technology, management schemes, and related standard systems provided the legislative foundation for emergency management of medical wastewater. (2) The three-tier prevention and control medical wastewater management system ensured the discharged wastewater met water quality standards, especially for the leak-proof sealed collection system of the first tier, and the biological and chemical treatment technology of the second tier. (3) The establishment of an effective three-tier medical wastewater quality monitoring accountability system. This system was particularly relevant for ensuring continuous data monitoring and dynamic analysis of characteristic indicators.

"Mental Health Problems among COVID-19 Frontline Healthcare Workers and the Other Country-Level Epidemics: The Case of Mexico","COVID-19 frontline healthcare workers (FHCW) are struggling to cope with challenges that threaten their wellbeing. We examine the frequency and predictors of the most frequent mental health problems (MHP) among FHCW during the first COVID-19 peak in Mexico, one of the most severely affected countries in terms of FHCW&rsquo;s COVID-19 mortality. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May 8 and August 18, 2020. A total of 47.5% of the sample (n = 2218) were FHCW. The most frequent MHP were insomnia, depression, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and health anxiety/somatization (whole sample: 45.7, 37.4, 33.9, and 21.3%;FHCW: 52.4, 43.4, 40.3 and 26.1, respectively). As compared to during the initial COVID-19 phase, depression and health anxiety/somatization symptoms as well as experiences of grieving due to COVID-19, personal COVID-19 status, and having relatives and close friends with COVID-19 were more frequent during the COVID-19 peak. Obesity, domestic violence, personal COVID-19 status, and grieving because of COVID-19 were included in regression models for main FHCW&rsquo;s MHP during the COVID-19 peak. In conclusion, measures to decrease other country-level epidemics contributing to the likelihood of COVID-19 complications (obesity) and MHP (domestic violence) as well as FHCW&acute;s probability of COVID-19 infection could safeguard not only their physical but also mental health.","Robles, Rebeca, Morales-ChainÃ©, Silvia, Bosch, Alejandro, Astudillo-GarcÃ­a, Claudia, Feria, Miriam, Infante, Sara, Alcocer-Castillejos, Natasha, Ascencio, Leticia, Real-RamÃ­rez, Janet, DÃ­az, Dulce, GÃ³mez-Estrada, HÃ©ctor Francisco, Becerra, Claudia, Escamilla, RaÃºl, LÃ³pez-Montoya, Alejandra, Beristain-Aguirre, Ana, Vega, Hamid, Ãlvarez-Icaza, DenÃ­, RodrÃ­guez, Evelyn, Durand, Sol, FresÃ¡n, Ana, Medina-Mora, MarÃ­a-Elena, FernÃ¡ndez-CÃ¡ceres, Carmen, Madrigal de LeÃ³n, Eduardo Ãngel","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19010421","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(1):421, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24927,""
"Mental Health Impacts of Wildfire, Flooding and COVID-19 on Fort McMurray School Board Staff and Other Employees: A Comparative Study","Background: Fort McMurray, a city in northern Alberta, Canada, has experienced multiple traumas in the last five years, including the 2016 wildfire, the 2020 floods, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Eighteen months after the wildfire, major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms were elevated among school board employees in the city. Objective: This study aimed to compare employees of the school board and other employees of Fort McMurray in respect to the impact the 2016 wildfires, the 2019 COVID pandemic, and the 2020 floods had on their mental health. Methodology: A quantitative cross-sectional survey was conducted in Fort McMurray from 24 April to 2 June 2021. Online questionnaires were administered through REDCap and were designed to capture socio-demographic characteristics, clinical as well as wildfire, COVID-19, and flooding-related variables. Mental health outcome variables were captured using self-reported standardized assessment scales. Data were analysed with descriptive statistics, Chi-square/Fisher&rsquo;s Exact tests, and binary regression analysis. Results: Of the 249 residents who accessed the online survey, 186 completed the survey, giving a response rate of 74.7%. Of these respondents, 93.5% (174) indicated their employment status and were included in the Chi-square analysis. Most of the respondents were female (86.2%, (150)), above 40 years (53.4%, (93)), and were in a relationship (71.3%, (124)). The prevalence values for MDD, GAD and PTSD among respondents were 42.4%, 41.0, and 36.8%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between employees of the school board and other employees with respect to likely PTSD prevalence (28% vs. 45%, respectively, p &lt; 0.05), although with other factors controlled for, in a binary logistic regression model, employer type did not significantly predict likely PTSD. Conclusions: The study has established that likely PTSD symptoms were significantly higher in other employees compared to those of school board employees. Greater exposure to the traumatic events and a greater perceived lack of support from other employers might have contributed to the significantly higher prevalence of PTSD in other employees.","Agyapong, Belinda, Eboreime, Ejemai, Shalaby, Reham, Pazderka, Hannah, Obuobi-Donkor, Gloria Kofi, Adu, Medard K.; Mao, Wanying, Oluwasina, Folajinmi, Owusu, Ernest, Greenshaw, Andrew J.; Agyapong, Vincent I.

"Mediating Effects of Psychological States on Work Performance of Visiting Nurses According to COVID-19 Workplace Quarantine Measures: A Multi-Group Path Analysis Study","This multi-group path analysis study investigated the effects of verbal abuse (suspicion of infection and disrespect) on difficulties in work performance according to the workplace quarantine measures of visiting nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 262 visiting nurses in Korea completed the online questionnaire between 10 October and 30 November 2020, and their data were included in the final analysis. The study found that experiences of verbal abuse mediated fear and anxiety to affect difficulties in work performance. In the path model of the group with a high level of workplace quarantine measures, experiences of verbal abuse (suspicion of infection and disrespect) did not directly affect fear. The opposite was true for the group with low levels of workplace quarantine measures. The implications for the field are that the following is required: heightened awareness of verbal abuse;workplace quarantine policies;and mental health management systems and intervention programs to detect the early fear and anxiety of visiting nurses.","Hwang, Jee-Hyun","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19010444","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(1):444, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24929,""
"Ongoing use of SSRIs does not alter outcome in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: A retrospective analysis","SARS-CoV-2 continues to have devastating consequences worldwide. Though vaccinations have helped reduce spread, new strains still pose a threat. Therefore, it is imperative to identify treatments that prevent severe COVID-19 infection. Recently, acute use of SSRI antidepressants in COVID+ patients was shown to reduce symptom severity. The aim of this retrospective observational study was to determine whether COVID+ patients already on SSRIs upon hospital admission had reduced mortality compared to COVID+ patients not on chronic SSRI treatment. Electronic medical records of 9044 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from six hospitals were queried for demographic and clinical information. Using R, a logistic regression model was run with mortality as the outcome and SSRI status as the exposure. In this sample, no patients admitted on SSRIs had them discontinued. There was no significant difference in the odds of dying between COVID+ patients on chronic SSRIs vs. those not taking SSRIs, after controlling for age category, gender, and race. This study shows the utility of large clinical databases in determining what commonly prescribed drugs might be useful in treating COVID-19. During pandemics due to novel infectious agents, it is critical to evaluate safety and efficacy of drugs that might be repurposed for treatment.","Rauchman, S. H.; Mendelson, S.

"Working Mode and Physical Activity as Factors Determining Stress and Sleep Quality during COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown in Poland","The coronavirus pandemic and related government restrictions have a significant impact on peoples&rsquo;everyday functioning and working, which influences their physical and mental health. The aim of the study was to examine the associations between stress and sleep quality of people of different working modes: working in the workplace (WP), working remotely (RW), and nonworking (NW) in relation to their physical activity (PA) during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Poland. It was an online survey performed during governmental lockdown in April 2020. The data were collected form 1959 adults using International Physical Activity Questionnaire&mdash;Short Form (IPAQ-SF), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The conducted analysis included t-Student test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and mediation analysis (MANOVA). A moderate level of stress was reported in 57% of participants, and 34% of them reported a high stress level. Poor sleep quality was reported in 64% of participants. Total PA performed daily was, on average, 184.8 &plusmn;170.5 min/day for WP, 120.6 &plusmn;124.4 min/day for RW, and 124.6 &plusmn;114.7 min/day for NW (p &lt; 0.001). There was a relationship observed between the stress and sleep quality vs. PA habit and working mode, with p &lt; 0.05. Being physically active can be beneficial to perceive less stress and sleep disturbances influencing sleep quality, especially in remotely or nonworking people. Planning future pandemic restrictions, the policymakers should be aware of the appropriate guidelines of work planning and PA recommendations for people of different working modes.","Lipert, Anna, Musial, Kamila, Rasmus, Pawel","https://doi.org/10.3390/life12010028","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Life; 12(1):28, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24931,""
"Bibliometric Study of Scientific Productivity on the Impacts on Mental Health in Times of Pandemic","Background and Objectives: The presence of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus is causing enormous threats to people&rsquo;s health and lives, so quantifying the scientific productivity on mental health in times of pandemic is an urgent need, especially to expand the degree of knowledge on mental health problems in regions of low scientific productivity. The aim was to characterize the bibliometric indicators of scientific productivity on mental health during the pandemic in the PubMed Identifier database of the National Library of Medicine in the United States. Materials and Methods: A documentary study (bibliometric) of the scientific productivity on mental health in times of pandemic from January 2020 to June 2021 was carried out. The PubMed database was used to  the information from the original scientific articles. The data ed were: authors, year of publication, journal name, country, and language of publication. Results: We identified 47 original articles worldwide, which were published in 29 journals and in three languages (English, Spanish, and German). We observed three groups of countries that published on mental health topics. The first group comprised the largest number of publications, which were multicenter studies (six studies), followed by India (five studies), and Italy (four studies). A second group comprised Bangladesh, China, USA, and Spain, with 3 studies each;and a third group comprised 13 countries (Albania, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Greece, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, and New Zealand) with one study each. Conclusions: Bibliometric indicators of scientific productivity on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic have ostensibly increased. We verified 47 studies in PubMed, which could serve to improve the understanding and management of COVID-19, as well as serve as a thought-provoking means for other countries and researchers to publish on the state of mental health during and post pandemic.","Caballero-Apaza, Luz Marina, Vidal-Espinoza, RubÃ©n, Curaca-Arroyo, Silvia, Gomez-Campos, Rossana, Callata-Gallegos, Zaida, Fuentes-LÃ³pez, JosÃ©, Cossio-BolaÃ±os, Marco","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58010024","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Medicina; 58(1):24, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24932,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown in Eating Disorders: A Multicentre Collaborative International Study","Background. The COVID-19 lockdown has had a significant impact on mental health. Patients with eating disorders (ED) have been particularly vulnerable. Aims. (1) To explore changes in eating-related symptoms and general psychopathology during lockdown in patients with an ED from various European and Asian countries;and (2) to assess differences related to diagnostic ED subtypes, age, and geography. Methods. The sample comprised 829 participants, diagnosed with an ED according to DSM-5 criteria from specialized ED units in Europe and Asia. Participants were assessed using the COVID-19 Isolation Scale (CIES). Results. Patients with binge eating disorder (BED) experienced the highest impact on weight and ED symptoms in comparison with other ED subtypes during lockdown, whereas individuals with other specified feeding and eating disorders (OFSED) had greater deterioration in general psychological functioning than subjects with other ED subtypes. Finally, Asian and younger individuals appeared to be more resilient. Conclusions. The psychopathological changes in ED patients during the COVID-19 lockdown varied by cultural context and individual variation in age and ED diagnosis. Clinical services may need to target preventive measures and adapt therapeutic approaches for the most vulnerable patients.","Baenas, Isabel, Etxandi, Mikel, MunguÃ­a, Lucero, Granero, Roser, Mestre-Bach, Gemma, SÃ¡nchez, Isabel, Ortega, Emilio, Andreu, Alba, Moize, Violeta L.; FernÃ¡ndez-Real, Jose-Manuel, Tinahones, Francisco J.; DiÃ©guez, Carlos, FrÃ¼hbeck, Gema, Le Grange, Daniel, Tchanturia, Kate, Karwautz, Andreas, Zeiler, Michael, Imgart, Hartmut, Zanko, Annika, Favaro, Angela, Claes, Laurence, Shekriladze, Ia, Serrano-Troncoso, Eduardo, Cecilia-Costa, Raquel, Rangil, Teresa, Loran-Meler, Maria Eulalia, Soriano-Pacheco, JosÃ©, Carceller-Sindreu, Mar, Navarrete, Rosa, Lozano, Meritxell, Linares, Raquel, Gudiol, Carlota, Carratala, Jordi, Plana, Maria T.; Graell, Montserrat, GonzÃ¡lez-Parra, David, GÃ³mez-del Barrio, JosÃ© A.; SepÃºlveda, Ana R.; SÃ¡nchez-GonzÃ¡lez, JÃ©ssica, Machado, Paulo P.

"Comparison of Food-Based and Music-Based Regulatory Strategies for (Un)Healthy Eating, Depression, Anxiety and Stress","There are many ways to regulate emotions. People use both adaptive (e.g., regulation by music) and maladaptive (e.g., regulation by food) strategies to do this. We hypothesized that participants with a high level of food-based regulatory strategies and a low level of music-based regulatory strategies (a group with the least adaptive form of emotion regulation) would have significantly greater levels of unhealthy eating behaviours, depression, anxiety and stress, as well as a significantly lower level of healthy eating behaviours than those with a low level of food-based regulatory strategies and a high level of music-based regulatory strategies (a group with the greatest adaptive form of emotion regulation). Participants (N = 410;Mage = 31.77, SD = 13.53) completed: the Brief Music in Mood Regulation Scale, the Emotional Overeating Questionnaire, the Healthy and Unhealthy Eating Behavior Scale, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and a socio-demographic survey. The four clusters were identified: (a) Cluster 1 (N = 148): low food-based regulatory strategies and high music-based regulatory strategies;(b) Cluster 2 (N = 42): high food-based regulatory strategies and high music-based regulatory strategies;(c) Cluster 3 (N = 70): high food-based regulatory strategies and low music-based regulatory strategies;(d) Cluster 4 (N = 150): low food-based regulatory strategies and low music-based regulatory strategies. Overall, our outcomes partially support our hypothesis, as higher levels of unhealthy eating behaviours, depression, anxiety and stress were observed in participants with high food-based and low music-based regulatory strategies as compared with adults with low food-based and high music-based regulatory strategies. To sum up, the results obtained indicate that during the COVID-19 pandemic the group of people regulating their emotional state and unhealthy eating predominantly with food is potentially characterized by worse functioning than the group of people regulating with music. Therefore, it can be concluded that people who regulate their functioning using food should be included in preventive measures by specialists. During the visit, psychologists and primary care physicians can ask patients about their daily strategies and based on this information specialists can estimate the potential risk of developing high levels of stress and anxiety, depressive disorders and unhealthy eating habits and provide specific (match) intervention.","Czepczor-Bernat, Kamila, Modrzejewska, Adriana, Modrzejewska, Justyna, Majzner, Rafal","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14010187","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Nutrients; 14(1):187, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24935,""
"Mental Health Symptomatology and Posttraumatic Growth among Those with Multimorbidity in COVID Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Findings from the STRONG Study in Greece","Background: Individuals with physical or mental health conditions represent a vulnerable population, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, limited information is available concerning posttraumatic growth and common mental health symptoms of this vulnerable health group during COVID-19. Methods: An online cross-sectional study (STRONG study;psychological changes and effects after COVID-19 quarantine in Greece) was conducted from 28 September 2020 (no lockdown restrictions) to 2 November 2020, just before the second lockdown in Greece. Main outcomes were depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as posttraumatic growth. Results: A total of 860 adults participated in the study. A high proportion of participants did not report any pre-existing health condition (61%), while 334 individuals reported one or more physical or mental health conditions. Overall, 20.2% of the participants reported significant depressive symptoms, and 27.9% reported moderate to high posttraumatic growth. The presence of physical and mental health conditions, either as single diagnosis or as a multimorbidity, was significantly associated with the development of depressive symptomatology (either physical or mental health conditions: OR = 1.12;95% CI, 1.07&ndash;1.17, p &lt; 0.001;both physical and mental health conditions: OR = 1.23;95% CI, 1.14&ndash;1.33, p &lt; 0.001). Posttraumatic growth did not differ between those with or without any pre-existing health issue. Conclusions: Although having a physical or/and a mental health condition predicted the development of depressive symptomatology in a post-lockdown period, the presence of pre-existing conditions was not associated with posttraumatic growth development.

"COVID-19 Face Masks as a Long-Term Source of Microplastics in Recycled Urban Green Waste","Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, many governments recommended or mandated the wearing of fitted face masks to limit the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus via aerosols. Concomitant with the extensive use of non-sterile, surgical-type single-use face masks (SUM) was an increase of such masks, either lost or discarded, in various environmental settings. With their low tensile strength, the spunbond and melt-blown fabrics of the SUM are prone to shredding into small pieces when impacted by lawn cutting equipment. Observations highlight the absence of smaller pieces, which are either wind-dispersed or collected by the mower&rsquo;s leaf catcher and disposed together with the green waste and then enter the municipal waste stream. As proof-of-concept, experiments using a domestic lawn-mower with different height settings and different grass heights, show that 75% of all pieces of SUM fabric caught in the catcher belonged to sizes below 10 mm2, which under the influence of UV light will decay into microfibers.

"Implications of COVID-19 Mitigation Policies for National Well-Being: A Systems Perspective","The ongoing COVID-19 crisis and measures aimed at curbing the pandemic have a widespread impact on various aspects of well-being, such as housing, social connections, and others. Moreover, COVID-19 does not affect all population groups equally. This study analyzes the impact of major COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on a set of national well-being indicators from the most recent version of the OECD Well-Being Framework. Using causal loop diagrams (systems maps), we consider direct and indirect effects of these policies on various components of the national well-being system. Our results show that business closures directly and/or indirectly impact more national well-being components than any other policy. The most affected national well-being components by all policies are life satisfaction, perceived health, and prevalence of depressive symptoms. In addition, we specify how the impact of the anti-pandemic measures differs for various population strata, using the degree of income and employment loss as key stratifying variables. Our insights can be helpful to identify and promote measures that can alleviate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 crisis on the national well-being.","Strelkovskii, Nikita, Rovenskaya, Elena, Ilmola-Sheppard, Leena, Bartmann, Robin, Rein-Sapir, Yonat, Feitelson, Eran","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14010433","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(1):433, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24938,""
"Prevalence and predictors for depression among medical students during coronavirus disease-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND: Since the declaration of the World Health Organization of the coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) as a pandemic, several countries have locked down and quarantined their residents with restrictive procedures to control spread of the disease. Due to pandemic related stressors, concerns and worries have developed regarding negative psychological impact on the mental well-being of the general population, particularly those known to have higher levels of psychological impairment with high vulnerability to mental health diseases such as medical students. AIM: The objectives of the study were to assess the prevalence of self-reported depression and to explore its predictors during the period of Coronavirus Disease 2019 first lock down among medical students. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study design. The study was conducted at Kasr Alainy Medical School, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt, in June 2020. A simple random sample was picked of one subgroup of 4th year medical students (No. = 300) at faculty of medicine during the academic year 2019â€“2020. Self-administered questionnaires including Beckâ€™s Depression Inventory scoring were distributed using Google form through communication social media such as WhatsApp. RESULTS: Out of the 300 participants, 238 responses were received with response rate 79.3%. Results indicated that 38.2% of the respondents were experiencing depression with different degrees with Beckâ€™s Depression Inventory mean scores was 19.4 Â± 11.6. Multiple logistic regression analysis point out that gender (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4 and p = 0.022) and â€œGoodâ€ grade level of academic performance (OR = 7.2 and p = 0.045) are significant predictors for developing depression among the participating medical students.

"Depression among medical staff during the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic in egypt: A comparative web-based cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak had created several challenges for health care workers and public worldwide. That pandemic also leads to a significant mental health crisis across the globe. AIM: The study aimed to determine depression levels of physicians who work in isolation hospitals that treat patients with COVID-19 and those with other health facilities in Egypt during COVID-19 pandemic. Risk factors for depression were determined and interpreted to provide further psychological interventions for health care workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was a cross-sectional web-based study among Egyptian physicians. The participants were divided into two groups based on their workplace;1177 of whom worked in front line hospitals (group II) and the remaining 1154 physicians (group I) in other health facilities (second line). Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. RESULTS: In group I and II, nearly one-third had mild depressive symptoms whereas 5.1% in group I and 14.6% in group II had severe ones with a significant difference between both groups (p = 0.001). Females, younger age groups, divorced or widowed, frontline physicians, 1â€“5 years of work experience, specialty jobs and contact with patients with COVID-19 were more affected than others. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms are common among medical staff especially frontline health care workers. Regular evaluation of medical personnel involved in treatment and diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 must assess their stress, depression, and anxiety.","Elghazally, N.

"Investigation of the effect of smoking on depression and stress in healthcare workers during a pandemic","Aim: In the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers suffer from significant stress and anxiety disorders. The importance of smoking in the mortality and morbidity of COVID-19 disease is obvious. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of smoking on depression and perceived stress in healthcare workers who served at the forefront during the pandemic period. Material and Methods: In our study, participants were asked questions on the Depression Severity Scale (PHQ-9), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS 14), and the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) using aquestionnaire method, and the results were evaluated. Results: Depression and stress symptoms were most often found in the healthcare workers included in our study. However, there was no statistically significant difference in depression and perceived stress scale between smoking and non-smoking groups. Discussion: Previous studies have demonstrated that smokers are more affected by COVID-19 and that their morbidity rate is higher. Because of this information, smoking healthcare professionals are more symptomatic in terms of mental health disorders, but no statistical difference was reported between smokers and non-smokers in this study in terms of being symptomatic. Although smoking was revealed as a comorbidity for COVID-19, there was no significant difference between smoking and non-smoking healthcare professionals in terms of mental health disorders.","Taskin, O.; Demir, U.; Soylu, V.

"Is it possible that antidepressants protect against COVID-19? Anti-depresants and covid","Aim: The neuroinflammatory hypothesis suggests that proinflammatory cytokines or the immune system may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of depression. COVID-19 affects older people the most because their immune systems are weakened. In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of using antidepressant use on mortality in patients infected with COVID-19. Material and Methods: Our study was developed as a retrospective examination of unique central patient records. In our study, the diagnosis of COVID-19 diagnostics (U07.3) was between the ICD-10 classification (U07.3) and the diagnosis of depressive emotional state disorders (F31, F32, F33, F34) and patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by the test result were included. Results: Considering the relationship between the use of antidepressants and mortality in COVID-19 patients, it was seen that the mortality rate was significantly lower in those using antidepressants (p &lt;0.05). The presence of chronic disease was found to be significantly associated with mortality in COVID-19. The mortality rates of patients with chronic diseases were found to be higher (p &lt;0.01). Discussion: In our study, we found that antidepressants did not have any superiority over each other in terms of mortality in COVID-19 patients.However, when all anti depressants were evaluated in our study, we observed that drug use had a positive effect on statistically significant mortality (p &lt;0.05).

The aim of the study was to evaluate brain changes in patients suffering from variable symptoms of brain fog after COVID-19. Material and methods: Eleven patients hospitalized due to symptoms of severe brain fog, i.e. insomnia, sudden impairment of cognitive function, headache, and depression, and 14 healthy volunteers underwent brain imaging including MR spectroscopy. Results: Routine MR imaging revealed no specific macroscopic changes in keeping with brain fog. Considering that the clinical manifestation of brain fog is transient, the evaluation of the metabolic status of the brain remained the method of choice. The concentration of the major cerebral metabolites, i.e. NAA, Cho, and Cr, remained stable. However, changes in Glx and Lac concentration were observed in MR spectroscopy.

"Pivoting Open? Pandemic Pedagogy and the Search for Openness in the viral Learning Environment","This paper is based on the authors' experiences and reflections working in educational technology and design support roles in higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrace our lived experience from the beginning of the pandemic in the spring (from our vantage points in the UK and Canada) and the associated 'pivot online' enacted in education around the world, through to the autumn of 2020, when we appeared to be transitioning into a so-called 'new normal' of the mid-pandemic. As digital education practitioners, who are also educators. researchers, and also simply as humans and friends living through a global pandemic, we had turned to each other initially for support in terms of work, wellness, and sharing news, information and sense-making, during which we began to consider researching under-examined dimensions of the evolving situation. The experiences and issues we reference are drawn from our own work, as well as from our responses to popular narratives advanced by key voices who have encouraged certain interpretations of the pandemic and its educational effects. Using Schon's (1983) reflection-in-action lens, we examine these experiences and narratives of pandemic pedagogy through the frame of our multiple identities. In particular, from our perspective as researchers and advocates of open education, we noted calls for openness (such as the use of open educational resources) in response to the online pivot, which did not appear to be cutting through the noise of the sudden deluge of information, advice and broadly negative coverage of online teaching. However, through our reflective narrative and synthesis, we offer an alternative interpretation, which is that openness was nonetheless flourishing, but that the 'pivot open' was to practices rather than resources. Open exchange, community building and support amongst educators were apparent in multiple contexts. While pandemic profiteering has highlighted the need for open resources and infrastructures, and we anticipate this case continuing to be made more strongly as we emerge from the emergency, it is the turn to open practices which has met the immediate needs of educators and learners through community, interactions. sharing and care.","Havemann, L.; Roberts, V.","https://doi.org/10.5334/jime.676","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Journal of Interactive Media in Education; - (1):11, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24946,""
"Psychological support unit design and implementation during COVID-19 pandemic: Case of Mongi Slim Hospital, Tunisia Comment","General lockdown was declared in Tunisia in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It had a negative psychological and social impact on the Tunisian population and health professionals. Mental healthcare was crucial during this period but health services access was difficult because of movement restrictions. Mongi Slim Hospital contains three special COVID-19 units and there was an urgent need for a psychological intervention with increasing demands at the mental health department in this hospital. A psychological support unit (PSU) was implemented with a free helpline for both patients, families and hospital staff. The objective of this paper was to describe the design, implementation and activities of this unit. This PSU had preventive and management activities for both patients and health professionals. Recommendations drawn from this experience are to promote mental health care and to encourage implementation of such units in order to respond to the local need of patients and staff. This pilot experience should be generalized to other hospitals in Tunisia and worldwide.","Abdelghaffar, W.; Haloui, N.; Bouchrika, N.; Yaakoubi, S.; Sarhane, A.; Kalai, E.; Siala, N.; Boulehmi, H.; Trabelsi, S.; Bourgou, S.; Charfi, F.; Belhadj, A.; Rafrafi, R.","https://doi.org/10.5339/avi.2021.2","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Avicenna; 2021(1):5, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24947,""
"The Relationship between State-Trait Anxiety Levels, Hopelessness Levels and Duration of Hospitalization in Patients with Covid-19","Objective: In addition to its physical effects, COVID-19 also causes significant psychological effects. Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between state and trait anxiety and hopelessness levels of inpatients with sociodemographic variables and length of hospital stay. Methods: 161 patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 who received in-hospital treatment between 20.11.2020-10.01.2021 in hospital were included in the study. After the interview with the patients, the Sociodemographic data form, State-Trait Anxiety Scale and Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) were administered online via Google Forms. Results: A significant correlation was detected between participants' Trait Anxiety Scale scores and State Anxiety Scale scores (r: 0.436;p&lt;0.001). But, no correlation was detected between participants' BHS total scores and State Anxiety Scale scores (r: -0.080, p=0.314). Anxiety scores of patients hospitalized for more than 3 days increased significantly (p=0.010). None of the features such as age, gender, educational status, history of psychiatric disease caused a difference in anxiety and hopelessness levels. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients had lower anxiety levels in the first 3 days after hospitalization, it was observed that their anxiety levels increased as the duration of hospitalization was prolonged. Accordingly, psychosocial interventions should be planned for people with prolonged hospitalization.","Ulusoy, T. U.; Almbaidheen, E. O.; Baskak, N. S.; Bilek, H. C.; Demirkose, M.; Akin, M.

"SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE RISK OF DEPRESSION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC A Snapshot of Hungarian Adolescents","Background: Social exclusion usually contributes to an increased vulnerability to mental health problems and risky health behaviors. This study aims to identify the role of health behavior in the increased risk of depressive symptoms among adolescents during the coronavirus pandemic in Hungary. Methods: A total of 705 high school students participated in our study (M = 15.9 years;SD = 1.19). The self-administered questionnaire included items about sociodemographics, eating habits, physical activity, sedentary behavior, and substance use. Depressive symptoms were measured using the short version of the Child Depression Inventory. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used to analyze our results. Results: Daily fruit and vegetable consumption was reported by 21.7% and 22.4% of respondents, respectively. The proportion of the respondents reporting daily sweets consumption stood at 13.2%, daily soft drinks consumption was 12.3%, and daily energy drink consumption tallied to 4.5%. More than one-third of the sample (35.5%) reported having breakfast every school day, which rose to 68.1% of the sample reporting breakfast on both weekend days. The rate of students engaged in daily physical activity was 6.5%, while 86.1% of them reported more than four hours screen time in a day. In addition, despite the mandatory confinement, a notable percentage of adolescents engaged in substance use. Consistent with previous studies, girls had a higher risk of depression. Low levels of physical activity and high levels of screen time - as well as alcohol and drug use - were associated with a high risk of depression. Conclusions: We believe our study provided useful information on adolescent health behaviors that can lead to adolescents' depression, and that maintaining physical activity can prevent it even in these unusual circumstances.","Berki, T.; Piko, B.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Family Medicine Practices in Saudi Arabia","Background The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the largest global healthcare crises in nearly a century. To face this global health emergency, health institutions have had to readjust their functioning while ensuring the continuity of care and protecting medical staff and patients. Our aim in this study was to assess the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on family medicine and its practice in Saudi Arabia. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted during the period from June 30, 2020, to July 20, 2020, by posting an online survey on social media platforms (WhatsApp and Twitter) and emailing physicians individually to collect data on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family medicine and primary care practices during the period of lockdown in Saudi Arabia. Results A total of 382 primary healthcare (PFIC) providers participated in the study (males: 213 (55.8%);females: 169 (44.2%)). The mean age and standard deviation of the population were 38.27 +/- 7.46. Most participants were from governmental health sectors. Participants revealed that they have a good level of knowledge regarding COVID-19. However, they indicated confusion regarding the knowledge due to changing recommendations or multiple-source information. Only 57.3% of respondents received relevant training on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). The most frequently used PPE were surgical masks (100%) and gloves (98.4%). The highly protective N95 masks were used by only 55.7%. Many health care workers indicated a high rate of stress and anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic. Data obtained are suggestive that there was a reduction in outpatient visits and a reduction in consultation time. Canceled physical examinations of the patients during the consultation were encountered most of the time. There was no shortage of medications, nasopharyngeal swabs, or sanitizers. However, an occasional lack of PPEs occurred. 64.4% of the respondents used online consultations with their patients. A shortage of health care workers during the pandemic in family medicine clinics was encountered by 63.3% of the participants. Conclusion Family medicine practices are adversely affected by pandemics and lockdowns following them. It has been reported that COVID-19 interferes with preventive, chronic, and acute care visits and increases mental health visits. Outpatient visits have also decreased as well as the amount of time spent in consultations. In addition, the transition from in-person clinics to telemedicine has happened. Perhaps these changes will delay the diagnosis and prescription refills.","Shatla, M.; Alharthi, B. T.; Alharbi, A. G.; Khan, Z. A.; Althaqfi, A. A.; Babkoor, A. A.; Almalki, A.

"Prevalence of Low Birth Weight Neonates during COVID-19 Pandemic in a Tertiary Care Hospital at Larkana, Sindh, Pakistan","In comparison to other middle-income countries, Pakistan has a high prevalence of low birth weight. Currently the situation has worsened because of the COVID-19 pandemic where stress can have a negative impact on intrauterine development, leading to a rise in preterm birth rates and the incidence of low birth weight babies. The goal of this study is to estimate the prevalence of low birth weight in a tertiary care hospital in Larkana, Sindh, Pakistan, during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, the hospital records of two thousand, two hundred and seventy eight neonates were analyzed from patients' data register for the year 2020. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel spread sheet. Of 2278 children admitted to the neonatal ward, only 29.2% babies had birth weight within normal range, 0.7% neonates were high birth weight, and the rest of the admitted babies (70.1%) during the year 2020 had birth weight below 2500 grams. Smallest birth weight observed in the study was 0.9 kg and 4.8 kg was highest birth weight (mean 2.35 kg, SD 0.88, SE 0.012). Female neonates were 895 (39.3%) and the rest of the 1383 (60.7%) babies were male. This study revealed that in Sindh province of Pakistan, the prevalence of low birth weight is extremely high during COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the findings suggest that there is need for a lot more emphasis on improving maternal mental health, nutrition and several other relevant factors to reduce the prevalence of low birth weight.","Shahani, M.

It can be concluded that corona education to parents has been significantly effective in reducing their mean anxiety. scores in the post-examination stage is greater than the significance level (p 0.0 0.05). Therefore, it can be concluded that the difference between the mean adjustment scores at different times is different according to the studied variables. Conclusion: The results of the present research demonstrated that after training anxiety and adjustment in the two groups, information support of patients' families will help them to better adapt in the face of stressful situations. Thus, educating the patients and their family increases the level of information and reduces the anxiety of the patient and the family and reduces the problems facing of the disease. Although families experience high stressors from the corona, but providing the necessary training for parents and increase supports may be necessary to be successful.","Jafarnejad, S.; Ebrahimi, H.

"Longitudinal Study of the Psychological Impact of the Contingency Response to COVID-19 in Mexico","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have implemented prevention and care measures, among which voluntary confinement stands out. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychological impact of the contingency response due to COVID-19 in Mexico, considering time and level of confinement, participation in pleasurable activities during confinement, and responses derived from the economic recovery plan of the government. The study had a longitudinal design with two evaluations involving 158 people from 17 to 76 years of age who answered the questionnaires within 9 weeks. People with high confinement levels showed significant differences in positive affect, stress, and depression;people with low confinement levels and those who continued to work showed greater affection. Those who reported not having participated in pleasant activities during their confinement showed low results, and those who reported having been more worried about the economic recovery plan had a higher score in worry and a lower score in life satisfaction. It can be concluded that although psychological support interventions should focus on people in confinement, greater efforts that contribute to improving quality of life and well-being should be directed to those who work during public health contingency responses.","Ramirez, M.

"Mental Health and Resilience Factors during Lockdown by COVID-19","The coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdown adopted to prevent its spread can generate the appearance of mental health symptoms, especially in countries with long periods of confinement. This article explores the coping factors carried out by the general population to attenuate these symptoms derived from this situation. To do this, we carried out a survey study on a sample of 1041 people between 18 and 65 years of age and residents in Spain. The results found show the impact of the positive attitude and the perception of self-efficacy as effective coping strategies, as well as other sociodemographic variables. The article exposes the usefulness and practical applications of these results and possible future lines, as well as the need to perform psychological training to the population in these cognitive variables in the face of future pandemics and lockdown.","Fernandez-Millan, J.

"Changes of Behavior and Mobility in Elderly during COVID-19 Epidemic","In the present study, the authors conducted a questionnaire survey to clarify the effects of the COVID-19 epidemic on the physical and mental health of elderly people and the changes in the feelings of elderly drivers toward driving. The number of outings, which decreased during the period of emergency declaration, gradually recovered to the level before COVID-19 epidemic. However, the number of outings for leisure and social activities did not recover. The number of times they used public transportation decreased, and the number of times they used cars driven by others increased. In addition, the number of times they drove by themselves decreased slightly, and their anxiety about driving by themselves increased. Furthermore, communication with others was association with mental health in the elderly.

"Chronic colchicine poisoning with neuromyopathy, gastric ulcers and myelosuppression in a gout patient: A case report","BACKGROUND Colchicine has been widely used as an anti-gout medication over the past decades. However, it is less commonly used due to its narrow therapeutic range, meaning that its lethal dose is close to its therapeutic dose. The lethal dose of colchicine is considered to be 0.8 mg/kg. As chronic colchicine poisoning has multiple manifestations, it poses a challenge in the clinicianâ€™s differential diagnosis. Historically, the drug was important in treating gout;however, clinical studies are currently underway regarding the use of colchicine in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 as well as its use in coronary artery disease, making this drug more important in clinical practice. CASE SUMMARY A 61-year-old male with a history of gout and chronic colchicine intake was admitted to our Emergency Department due to numbness and weakness of the lower limbs. The patient reported a history of colchicine intake for 23 years. After thorough examination, he was diagnosed with colchicine poisoning, manifesting as neuromyopathy, multiple gastric ulcers and myelosuppression. We advised him to stop taking colchicine and drinking alcohol. We also provided a prescription of lansoprazole and mecobalamin, and then asked him to return to the clinic for re-examination. The patient was followed up for 3-mo during which time his gout symptoms were controlled to the point where he was asymptomatic. CONCLUSION Colchicine overdose can mimic the clinical manifestations of several conditions. Physicians easily pay attention to the disease while ignoring the cause of the disease. Thus, the patientâ€™s medication history should never be ignored.","Li, M.

"From Positive to Death: A Corpus-Based Semantic Analysis of COVID-19 Representation in Malaysian English News Reports","More than a year after being declared a pandemic, Covid-19 has not shown any sure signs of dissipating even as the battle to curb it continues. In Malaysia, the Movement Control Order (MCO), or lockdown seems to be the most effective way to curb the spread of the disease. Unfortunately, studies show that lockdowns affect people 's livelihoods and lifestyle, as well as their emotional and mental state. This situation, in many countries, is exacerbated by the onslaught of negative news on Covid-19 and heightened news consumption via various media platforms. Given this, the objective of the current study is to analyse the representation of Covid-19 in Malaysian media based on a corpus of news reports during Malaysia's first lockdown, i.e. MCO 1.0. This was a period of uncertainty lasting six weeks beginning from 18 March 2020 which saw increased reports of mental health cases and domestic violence cases in the country. News reports published in two Malaysian English online newspapers, The Star Online and Malaysiakini during MCO 1.0 formed the corpus of study. Using collocational analysis, the study examined the semantic prosody of Covid-19 and how it is represented in Malaysian new reports. The findings show that 'Covid-19' generally occurs in the company of unfavourable associations, causing it to acquire a negative prosody and in turn negatively represented in the news reports. The unfavourable portrayal of Covid-19, coupled with the increase in news consumption may adversely affect readers' emotions and anxiety levels, which in turn, may contribute to crisis fatigue.","Xin, C.

"Effect of concern about COVID-19 on professional self-efficacy, psychological distress, anxiety, and depression in Peruvian health personnel","Introduction. Concern about becoming infected with COVID-19 is one of the reactions that has affected the mental health of Peruvian health care workers. Objective. To determine the effect of concern about COVID-19 on professional self-efficacy, psychological distress, anxiety, and depression in health personnel in the Puno region of Peru. Method. An explanatory, cross-sectional study was conducted with the voluntary participation of 401 health workers (such as nurses, physicians, nursing technicians, obstetricians, dentists, psychologists, and nutritionists) of both sexes (24.2% men and 75.5% women) from 12 health networks in the region of Puno, Peru. They were asked to answer the Scale of Concern for the Transmission of COVID-19 in Health Personnel (EPPC-Cov19), Patient Health Questionnarie-2 (PHQ-2, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2 (GAD-2) and the Professional Self Efficacy Scale (AU-10). Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used for data analysis. Results. The factor loads of the explanatory model showed a good fit: X-2 (286) = 797.31, p &lt; .001;IFC = .99;RMSEA= .06;SRMR = .07;WRMR = 1.25. Therefore concern about COVID-19 has a greater effect on anxiety (beta = .77) and depression (beta = .71), as well as psychological distress (beta = .65), and only a mild effect on work self-efficacy (beta = .12).

"Psychosocial factors and mental health in Mexican healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction. The World Health Organization has estimated a significant increase in mental disorders due to the COVID-19 pandemic and has identified healthcare workers as a vulnerable group. In Mexico, the impact of this pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers and the psychosocial factors associated with it remain unknown. Objective. To identify levels of stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression and their relationship with negative psychosocial stressors and positive psychosocial resources in healthcare workers in Mexico during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method. As a part of a larger project in certain Latin American countries, 269 health workers from various Mexican clinics and hospital centers initially participated in a non -experimental, cross-sectional correlational design. Participants were recruited by targeted sampling. Various ultra-brief measures were used to measure symptoms of depression, anxiety, burnout, and stress and a mixed-methods exploration technique was used to identify associated psychosocial factors, which were also explored with cluster analysis. Results. We found high levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (56.9% and 74.7%), as well as burnout and stress (49.8% and 46.8%). Although the stressors ""infection of self"" and ""family infection"" (38.3% and 30.9%) and the resources ""family"" and ""personal protective equipment"" (34.6% and 24.5%) were the most frequent, there were more than 20 factors in each category differentially associated with mental health. Cluster analysis made it possible to identify representative sets of psychosocial variables. Discussion and conclusion. The increased risk in mental health for health care workers is confirmed in a preliminary way and the stressors and resources to be considered in preventive strategies to address COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico are identified.","Juarez-Garcia, A.; Camacho-Avila, A.; Garcia-Rivas, J.; Gutierrez-Ramos, O.","https://doi.org/10.17711/sm.0185-3325.2021.030","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Salud Mental; 44(5):229-240, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24963,""
"Electrocardiographic findings over time and their prognostic value in patients with COVID-19","Background: The objective of this study was to carry out a retrospective analysis of the progression of electrocardiographic (ECG) findings over time, based on biomarkers for myocardial injuries in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Also, the ECG observations were assessed for possible prognostic use. Methods: Diagnostic criteria provided by the Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program of the Chinese National Health Commission were used. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 31 COVID-19 cases diagnosed as positive by high-throughput sequencing of nasopharyngeal nucleic acid test and admitted to Sichuan Province Public Health Clinical Medical Center, Sichuan Province, China. Based on changes in biomarkers, the 31 participants were divided into a non-myocardial injury group (A) and a myocardial injury group (B). Our study observed the dynamic changes and new abnormal changes of the ECG during the hospitalization of patients. Results: The results summarized in the 4 following points: (I) The time sequence changes for ST and T indicated that the absolute ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion values in group B were larger. (II) The heart rate (HR) and RV5 values in group B were higher, the QTC value for group B was lower. (III) The sensitivity of ST-segment depression for the diagnosis of myocardial injury was 32.60% and the specificity was 90.50%. The sensitivity of T-wave inversion was 41.30% and the specificity was 85.10%. (IV) Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a major factor affecting patient's death. Conclusions: If abnormal ST-T, increased heart rate, shortened QTC interval, and high ventricular voltage are observed in a COVID-19 patient, it may infer that myocardial damage has occurred. Using ECG as a point of reference for change can compensate for the time limitation of myocardial enzyme index. Regardless of the stage of disease development, ECG can reflect myocardial damage. Particularly in the 8-12 days after hospitalization, almost all myocardial enzymes cannot be applied. The ST-depression and T-wave inversion had diagnostic significance with relatively high sensitivity and specificity for myocardial injury. Assessment of LDH and biomarkers in combination with ECG can more accurately reflect myocardial injury, and facilitate prompt clinical diagnosis and treatment.","Su, Y.; Yin, L. X.; Lin, J.; Peng, Q.

"Erectile dysfunction among Thai patients with COVID-19 infection","Background: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is suspected to be the symptom manifestation of COVID-19. However, scarce data was presented this day. Our study was conducted to determine the prevalence of ED and its associated factors among Thai patients with COVID-19. Methods: Sexually active males with COVID-19, hospitalized between May and July 2021 at one university hospital in Bangkok, were screened for erectile dysfunction by the International Index of Erectile Function 5 (IIEF-5). Demographic data and COVID-19 treatment history were collected. Mental health status, including depression and anxiety, was evaluated with the Thai Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), respectively. The sample size was calculated, and logistic regression was used to analyze the association. Results: One hundred fifty-three men with COVID-19 were recruited. ED prevalence was 64.7%, of which severity was mostly mild. Logistic regression, adjusted for age, BMI, and medical comorbidities, portrayed a significant association between ED and mental health status. Higher risk of ED was found in participants with major depression [adjusted OR 8.45, 95% CI: 1.01-70.96, P=0.049] and higher GAD-7 total score [adjusted OR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01-1.31, P=0.039]. Conclusions: Thai patients with COVID-19 had high prevalence of ED, which was associated with mental disorders.

"Effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on brain and behavior","The Covid-19 viral infection, which was first detected in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019, spread rapidly around the world and turned into a major pandemic. At the time this article was written, Covid-19 has infected more than 250 million people worldwide, causing close to 5 million deaths. In addition to the fact that Covid-19 is a lytic infection, its easy spread through the respiratory tract required a social isolation that people were not accustomed in the pandemic period. Social isolation and economic losses caused significant social and psychological problems in society. On the other hand, Covid-19 also has direct effects on the central nervous system (CNS), and these effects may be responsible for some serious early or late neuropsychic disorders. In addition, acute symptoms of infection involved in respiratory system failure and cytokine storm, and vaccination activities were discussed detailed. Although neurological problems such as seizure, encephalitis, anosmia, dysgeusia, stroke and delirium are discussed to a certain extent, current data on psychological and/or psychiatric problems due to pandemic itself or the virus are remaining limited. In this review article, it is aimed to evaluate the effects of Covid-19 on brain and mental health in the light of current data.

Although the mechanism of COVID-19 induced sleep disorder and anxiety-related complications have not been reported yet, the investigated data suggested that sleep disorder and anxiety-related complications are arising due to increasing cortisol, norepinephrine levels in the blood and decreasing glucocorticoid receptor signaling. Further examination and clinical studies are critically required to investigate the influential factors of COVID-19 patients' susceptibility to sleep disorder, anxiety for affirming speculation, and better treatment.","Chowdhury, S.; Debi, H.; Amin, M.

"COVID-19 pandemic and the healthcare workers- The call of duty","COVID-19 is the current topic of discussion globally as people are getting affected by it on a huge scale. This study is focused to determine the concerns and perceptions of healthcare workers (HCWs) due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on their mental health, routine work, family and social life. Study was conducted at various health care facilities of Sindh, Pakistan, from October to December 2020 (three months). An online survey questionnaire consisting of fourteen closed-ended questions was designed in Google Forms and circulcalted among the HCWs through email and social media. The data collected was analyzed using SPSS 24 and descriptive statistical tools were used to measure the frequencies and the Chi-square test was applied among correlated variables. Among 412 respondents, majority of the participants were male (54.6%) and young with 18-28 years of age (47.3%). Two-third of HCWs were highly concerned about their family's health versus own health (67.7% vs 44.7% respectively) and 157 (38.1%) were emotionally distressed. It was also found that HCWs with assigned duties in the isolation wards were more emotionally distressed (56.2% high to very high) compared to those not working in isolation units (45.3% high to very high). More than half of HCWs (51.9%) reported that their family life was also disturbed. Our findings indicate that COVID-19 pandemic has a significant psychological impact on frontline soldiers (HCWs) particularly they were worried about family's health. The HCWs who were assigned duties in isolation units were more emotionally distressed than those who were not assigned duties in isolation wards.","Muhammad, S.; Kumari, G.; Kumar, N.; Tabassum, R.; Khaskheli, M.

"Unnatural deaths among autopsy cases brought at tertiary care hospital of western Nepal during COVID-19 pandemic period: A descriptive cross-sectional study","Introduction: The outbreak of COVID-19 has changed patterns of mortality in different setups. The rate of suicide has increased in some countries during the pandemic while the overall death rates have decreased. The study was conducted with objective to find out the prevalence of unnatural deaths among the autopsy cases brought at tertiary care hospital during COVID-19 pandemic period. Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study using the records of the medico legal autopsies conducted from 24th March 2020 to 23rd August 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pokhara Academy of Health Sciences. Ethical approval was taken from Institutional Review Committee of Pokhara Academy of Health Sciences (Reference number 28.2077/78). Whole sampling method was used. Records which were available were included in the study whereas those cases whose complete records were not available were excluded. Point estimate at 95% confidence interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. Results: Out of 188 deaths studied at the autopsy during the COVID-19 pandemic period, the prevalence of unnatural deaths was 147 (78.19%) (71.04-85.33 at 95% Confidence Interval). Among these deaths, 109 (74.14%) were males and 38 (25.85%) were females. Suicide was the most common manner attributing to 78 (53.06%) of the unnatural deaths. Conclusions: The prevalence of suicide was more than those demonstrated by earlier observations in similar settings before the pandemic period. Suicidal deaths were more common during the COVID 19 pandemic. This is an indicator of frustration of the people and necessary steps have to be taken to decrease such deaths in similar conditions to come.","Koirala, S.; Subedi, K.; Subedi, N.","https://doi.org/10.31729/jnma.6484","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of the Nepal Medical Association; 59(244):1293-1296, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24973,""

"Digital Social and Emotional Literacy Intervention for Vulnerable Children in Brazil: Participants' Experiences","Social emotional literacy (SEL) interventions are widely implemented through schools, with growing evidence for a range of positive child outcomes. Increasingly, such interventions are delivered on online platforms. To date, there is limited evidence about digital SEL interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of children, parents and facilitator of the potential value of addressing SEL via tailored digital intervention. The intervention was designed to help children, in Brazil, to cope during the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. The intervention was delivered via a digital platform to groups of three children for 45 min per week for nine. Thirteen children, nine parents and nine facilitators were interviewed following the completion of the intervention. The data was analysed through a codebook thematic approach, which led to three themes: empowerment, participatory aspects of the intervention and digital adaptation. Overall, children's SEL development was reported to be supported during the COVID-19 pandemic, by the application of new skills outside the sessions. Children reported a number of empowering factors such as being heard and belonging. A range of useful participatory tools were identified including storytelling, games, drawings and videos. Blended SEL interventions involving both face-to-face and web-based facilitation could be developed within a tiered model of universal mental health promotion and targeted prevention. Access to online platforms would increase reach to large numbers of children in LMIC, especially in contexts of disadvantage.","Freeland, L.; O'Reilly, M.; Fleury, J.; Adams, S.; Vostanis, P.","https://doi.org/10.32604/ijmhp.2022.015706","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: International Journal of Mental Health Promotion; 24(1):51-67, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24975,""
"After Over a Year of Pandemic: Mental Well-being and Life Satisfaction of Filipino College Students","The COVID-19 pandemic has been there for over a year and may substantially negatively impact student's mental well-being. This study aimed to assess the subjective mental wellbeing and satisfaction with life of Filipino college students. This cross-sectional study involved the analysis of 1,141 college students in the Philippines. The data were collected using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Results indicated that while 52.8% reported high satisfaction with life, 40.2% had poor mental well-being. Self-reported health status (beta=1.899, p=.000), age (beta=0.179, p=.000), and year level (beta=0.306, p=.000) predicted mental well-being. On the other hand, subjective mental well-being (beta=0.736, p=.000), self-reported health status (beta=0.967, p=.000), and age (beta=0.691, p=.025) predicted life satisfaction.

"The Role of Religious Orientation and PsyCap in Mitigating Technostress","The government's work from home policy because of COVID-19 Pandemic has had an impact on changing the learning system. This policy necessitates that students use technology to carry out learning activities. This causes the individual to experience difficulties. The digitization of learning activities has an impact on mental health problems such as technostress. Technostress refers to a modern adaptation disease caused by an inability to cope with new technology. The level of technostress of each individual varies depending on their religious orientation and level of psychological capital (PsyCap). Based on these two internal factors, this study examines how religious orientation and PsyCap influence technostress levels as observed among business students in Indonesia. This study provides empirical evidence suggesting that intrinsic religious orientation and PsyCap can encourage individuals to endure challenges and rising demand, thereby reducing the stress caused by technology. These outcomes assist policymakers to implement programs oriented towards individuals' PsyCap.","Wijayanti, D. M.; Riza, A.

"COVID-19 pandemic and its psychological impact among healthy Portuguese and Spanish nursing students","Few studies have explored the impacts of COVID-19 and lockdown on the mental health of undergraduate nursing students. This study aimed: a) to explore perceived stress among undergraduate nursing students in Portugal and Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak;and b) to analyze several COVID-19 related factors and psychological issues that may be associated with perceived stress. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a convenience sample of Portuguese and Spanish undergraduate nursing students (n=1075). The data gathered included demographic information, questions about COVID-19 related factors, and psychological issues. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression with a degree of significance at p&lt;0.05. High perceived stress scores were found in 558 participants (51.9%). Students with high perceived stress most likely had a COVID-19 diagnosis in their household;their household income had been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic;experienced difficulty falling asleep or sleeping all night;consumed junk food in excess;neglected their appearance;felt headaches, stomach aches, and back pain;and lacked the patience or desire to exercise. Additionally, high perceived stress was negatively associated with life satisfaction. The results provide evidence that infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, may significantly influence mental health.

"Psychological Determinants and Consequences of COVID-19 Anxiety: A Web-Based Study in Iran","Pandemic illnesses such as COVID-19 can provoke negative emotions, including anxiety and depression, in addition to compulsive behaviors. Clarifying the psychosocial antecedents and consequences of COVID-19 anxiety can inform successful psychological support and treatment. This study investigated psychological predictors and consequences of COVID-19 anxiety during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Iran. University students (N = 398) completed a web-based survey measuring COVID-19 anxiety, general health anxiety, uncertainty intolerance, interpersonal trust, depression, and COVID-19-related panic shopping. The participants also responded to two additional questions: ""Do you personally know of anyone who was suspected of having been infected with COVID-19?"" and ""Did you get sick in the past year?"" Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, Pearson correlation, multiple regression analysis, multivariate regression analysis, and 2 x 2 factorial ANOVA were used to analyze data. Health anxiety, uncertainty intolerance, and interpersonal trust were significantly associated with COVID-19 anxiety. COVID-19 anxiety was a significant predictor of depression and panic shopping. Participants who knew someone with COVID-19 and those who reported being sick in the past year experienced more COVID-19 anxiety. COVID-19 anxiety appears to be more severe among people with a low tolerance for uncertainty and low interpersonal trust. Understanding these risk factors can inform individualized therapeutic approaches to address the maladaptive outcomes of depression and false safety behaviors, such as panic buying.","Shabahang, R.; Aruguete, M.

"Professional challenges encountered by healthcare professionals and its impact on their well-being during the covid-19 pandemic","Background: The unprecedented public health concern of COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges at structural and psychosocial levels, increases the risk of psychological morbidity and affects the well-being of healthcare professionals (HCPs). Objective: The study aimed to understand the professional challenges faced by HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. It also aimed to understand the psycho-social impact of these challenges on the subjective well-being of HCPs. Method: A cross-sectional web-based survey was designed, consisting of twenty-eight multiple choice or Likert-type questions. The survey had four mental health domains to be explored. It was an anonymous survey with online informed consent and was circulated on social media groups of doctors and nurses in Delhi, India using snow-ball method. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed to study demographic and COVID-19 related factors on psychological and occupational variables. Further, thematic analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) were used for short answer qualitative questions. Results: Results of 253 HCPs showed that those dealing with COVID-19 patients, scored lower on perceived occupational preparedness (F1,251 = 6.266, p &lt; 0.0001), work satisfaction (F1,251= 40.998, p &lt; 0.0001) and well-being (F1,251 = 53.529, p &lt; 0.0001) as compared to non-COVID-19 duty HCPs;although they displayed less challenges in adaptation and protection (F1,251 =17.413, p &lt; 0.0001).

The present research, of a qualitative nature, explores what it means, under the lens of affect and from the student's perspective, to experience remote education during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire of 41 closed- and open-ended questions was given to 363 students from a public school in southeastern Brazil. This article analyzes the affective fields that emerged from the discursive textual analysis of the students' responses (n = 100). Four affective fields were categorized: friends, classes, home, and teachers;intersecting emotions, attitudes, values, beliefs, and motivation. In general, students expressed more negative than positive affect but a positive disposition toward face-to-face classes. Boys focused their affect more on classes, while girls on teachers. The affective fields allow us to consider the friends-home-teachers tripod as fundamental to overcoming the phenomenon of affective fatigue that has been identified.","Comelli, F. A.

"A Mental Health Services Research Agenda in the Era of COVID-19: Steadfast Commitment to Addressing Evolving Challenges","Background: Decades of research that predate the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate that most people with mental health needs are not receiving adequate care. The inequities between those who need care and those who receive adequate care are larger for racial and ethnic minority groups and people living in underserved communities. The pandemic is associated with an exacerbation of these inequities, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality for the most vulnerable populations. Aims: This Perspective summarizes longstanding and evolving challenges to the provision of high quality care for people with mental illness, describes the National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) commitment to addressing those challenges. and embeds salient research priorities most germane to the health policy readership of this journal. Methods: Example funding announcements and extant funding priorities are highlighted to demonstrate NIMH's commitment to health services research during the pandemic. The collaborative care model is presented as an evidence-supported service delivery model that could be delivered via telehealth. Recent studies that compare the utilization of routine telehealth services during the pandemic. when compared to in-person services pre-pandemic, are summarized. Results: In FY2020, NIMII invested $171,194,275 in health services research. Over the past two years. NIMH led or participated on dozens of funding announcements that call for mental health services research to help improve the provision of care for people with mental illness. Service delivery models like collaborative care can offer effective intervention via telehealth. The practice community can deliver routine services via telehealth at volumes similar to pre-pandemic in-person levels. However, wide variation in telehealth utilization exists, with inequities associated with racial and ethnic groups and underserved rural locations. A limitation is that clinical outcomes are not routinely available from administrative datasets. Discussion: There continues to be an urgent need for health policy research and collaboration with the health policy community as part of the research enterprise. Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: NIMH encourages and often requires strong research practice partnerships to help ensure findings will be of value to end users and make their way into the practice setting. There is a need to study pandemic related changes in financing, delivery, receipt, and outcomes of mental health care. Implications for Health Policies: Despite robust evidence, clinical practice guideline recommendations, and established financing mechanisms, uptake of service delivery models that can be delivered in part or in full via telehealth (e.g., the collaborative care model) is poor. Implications for Further Research: In the era of COVID-19, the charge to the mental health services research community is urgent: (i) develop strategies to better implement, scale, and sustain existing evidence-supported treatments and services and (ii) develop, test, and evaluate new solutions to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, and value of care.","Freed, M.

"RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY IN PROFESSIONALS SUPPORTING VICTIMS OF CHILD ABUSE DURING THE COVID-19 CRISIS","The covid-19 crisis has challenged the well-being of professionals supporting abused children. The effects of some risk (i.e., number of nearby infected people and telecommuting and housework hours per day) and protective (i.e., social support, self-efficacy, and self-care) factors on depression and anxiety symptoms were tested in professionals supporting child-abuse victims in Chile during the covid-19 crisis. Professionals (N = 175) answered self-reports. Having infected people nearby and social support predicted depression. The effect of social support on depression was partially mediated by self-efficacy and self-care. The effect of social support on anxiety was completely mediated by self-care. Results show that social and psychological variables are relevant to understand depression and anxiety symptoms in professionals even during the covid-19 crisis.","Guerra, C.; Arredondo, V.; Pinto-Cortez, C.; Saavedra, C.; Lira, G.; Arredondo, A.; Lobos, P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=RISK+AND+PROTECTIVE+FACTORS+FOR+DEPRESSION+AND+ANXIETY+IN+PROFESSIONALS+SUPPORTING+VICTIMS+OF+CHILD+ABUSE+DURING+THE+COVID-19+CRISIS","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Revista Mexicana De Psicologia; 38(2):71-82, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24992,""

"Mapping Out Indigenous and Racialized Critical Community-Based Perspectives and Experiences in the Time of COVID","The COVID-19 pandemic has had many implications for the lives, health, and well-being of Indigenous and racialized queer individuals and communities across the globe. In this article, three queer social workers (two Indigenous and one racialized settler) situated on the traditional territories of the Haudenosaunee, Anishinaabek, and Neutral/Attawandaron people discuss lived experiences of social isolation and mental health, while navigating work, education, and moments of resilience, in their communities of belonging. Through a circle process, they discuss the implications of social isolation for queer Indigenous, and racialized-settler individuals in the context of shifting notions of community due to the pandemic. The authors engage with unique intersectional social work standpoints that are steeped in Indigenous-centred, critically reflexive, queer, intersectional feminist, and relational approaches that highlight the politics of care, relational accountability, and relationship with Creation and ethics during COVID-19.

"Mental Health and Emotional Regulation in students of traditional universities of the IV region, Chile during COVID-19","Mental Health and Emotional Regulation are crucial for the human being. There is a growing concern about the deterioration of mental health in Chile, added to the exceptional changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The present research aims to determine the relationship between Mental Health and Emotional Regulation of students from Traditional Universities of the Coquimbo Region, Chile. The sample consisted of 117 participants who are currently studying an undergraduate degree. The applied instruments were the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Emotional Regulation Difficulties (DERS-E). The analysis of a Pearson correlation coefficient and T-student revealed that mental health had a positive and significative relation with emotional regulation.

"The impact of COVID-19 on fertility behaviour and intentions in a middle income country","The COVID Pandemic may affect fertility behaviour and intentions in many ways. Restrictions on service provision reduce access to family planning services and increase fertility in the short term. By contrast, the economic uncertainty brought about by the pandemic and its impact on mental health and well-being may reduce fertility. These various pathways have been explored in the context of high income countries such as the United States and Western Europe, but little is known about middle income countries. In this paper we asses the impact of the COVID pandemic on fertility intentions and behaviour in the Republic of Moldova, a middle income country in Eastern Europe, using the Generations and Gender Survey. This survey was conducted partially before and partially after the onset of the pandemic in 2020, allowing for detailed comparisons of individual circumstances. The results indicate that the pandemic reduced the used of intrauterine devices, and increased the use of male condoms, but with no overall decrease in contraceptive use. Conversely individuals interviewed after the onset of the pandemic were 34.5% less likely to be trying to conceive, although medium term fertility intentions were unchanged. Indicators therefore suggest that in the medium term fertility intentions may not be affected by the pandemic but restricted access to contraception requiring medical consultation and a decrease in short-term fertility intentions could disrupt short term family planning.","Emery, Koops","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261509","20220106","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",24999,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on Hematology-Oncology Trainees: A Quantitative and Qualitative Assessment","Graduate medical and research training has drastically changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, with widespread implementation of virtual learning, redeployment from core rotations to the care of patients with COVID-19, and significant emotional and physical stressors. The specific experience of hematology-oncology (HO) fellows during the COVID-19 pandemic is not known. We conducted a mixed-methods study using a survey of Likert-style and open-ended questions to assess the training experience and well-being of HO fellows, including both clinical and postdoctoral trainee members of the American Society of Hematology and ASCO. A total of 2,306 surveys were distributed by e-mail; 548 (23.8%) fellows completed the survey. Nearly 40% of fellows felt that they had not received adequate mental health support during the pandemic, and 22% reported new symptoms of burnout. Pre-existing burnout before the pandemic, COVID-19-related clinical work, and working in a primary research or nonclinical setting were associated with increased burnout on multivariable logistic regression. Qualitative thematic analysis of open-ended responses revealed significant concerns about employment after training completion, perceived variable quality of virtual education and board preparation, loss of clinical opportunities to prepare for independent clinical practice, inadequate grant funding opportunities in part because of shifting research priorities, variable productivity, and mental health or stress during the pandemic. HO fellows have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, and our data illustrate multiple avenues for fellowship programs and national organizations to support both clinical and postdoctoral trainees.","Durani, Major, Velazquez, May, Nelson, Zheng, Hall, Alam, Reynolds, Thompson, Kumbamu, Das, Murphy, Henry, Lee, Marshall, Wun, Weeks","https://doi.org/10.1200/OP.21.00630","20220106","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",25000,""
"Affective and Coping Responses to Quarantine Hotel Stays","During the outbreak of COVID-19, many travelers had to quarantine upon arrival to their destination, often at designated hotels and usually for two weeks. Quarantine, as any type of isolation, is often emotionally challenging. This study applies the transactional theory of stress to explore guests' experiences during the hotel quarantine, the cognitive appraisals of their experiences and affective responses, and the coping strategies they deploy to address adverse mental effects of the quarantine. Data from in-depth interviews with quarantine hotel guests demonstrates that guests experience a rollercoaster of moods and emotions during their stay, moving from uncertainty and anxiety to isolation and boredom to despair and depression, and finally to relief and optimism. These hotel guests used a range of coping styles to alter the perceived space and time in quarantine, address social isolation as well as negative emotions and moods. These findings have important implications for tourism, hospitality, and health professionals in managing travel, accommodation, and quarantine arrangements during a crisis.

"Feasibility of Using a Mobile App for Stress in Middle-Aged Men and Women","Middle-aged adults (40 to 65 years) report higher stress than most age groups. There is a need to test the feasibility of using a meditation app to reduce stress and improve stress-related outcomes in middle-aged men and women with focus on men as previous meditation app studies report a low percentage of male participants and some studies do not include men at all. The purpose of this study was to: (1) determine the feasibility (i.e., acceptability and demand with focus on men) of a consumer-based meditation app (i.e., Calm) to reduce stress in middle-aged adults reporting elevated stress; and (2) explore the preliminary effects of Calm on perceived stress, psychological outcomes (i.e., anxiety, depressive symptoms, mindfulness, general coping), health behaviors (i.e., physical activity, eating habits), and perceptions of COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to: (1) determine the feasibility (i.e., acceptability and demand with focus on men) of a consumer-based meditation app (i.e., Calm) to reduce stress in middle-aged adults reporting elevated stress; and (2) explore the preliminary effects of Calm on perceived stress, psychological outcomes (i.e., anxiety, depressive symptoms, mindfulness, general coping), health behaviors (i.e., physical activity, eating habits), and perceptions of COVID-19. This was a randomized controlled feasibility study testing an app-based meditation (i.e., Calm) intervention in middle-aged adults (N=83) with elevated stress levels (i.e., score greater than or equal to 15 on the Perceived Stress Scale) and limited or no previous experience with meditation. Participants were randomized to Calm or app-based education control group (POD). Participants completed self-report assessments at baseline and post-intervention (Week 4). Feasibility was measured as acceptability and demand using Bowen's framework. Feasibility and COVID-19 perceptions data were examined via descriptive statistics. Preliminary effects were examined using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Participants were satisfied with Calm (96.4%; 27/28) and found it appropriate/useful (92.9%; 26/28). Most reported that they were likely to continue using Calm in the future (64.3%; 18/28). More participants in the Calm group reported satisfaction, appropriateness/usefulness, and intent to continue use compared to the control. Calm participants (n=33) averaged 20.0Ã‚Â±31.1 minutes of meditation on the days they meditated and 103Ã‚Â±109.1 minutes of meditation per week during the study. On average there was a 70.8% adherence rate to the prescribed meditation, compared to 62.2% in POD. Recruitment of men into the study was 34.9% (29/83). Of those randomized to Calm, 55.2% (15/29) were men. Retention among men was 93.3% (14/15) compared to 60% (12/20) for women. No significant within or between group differences in stress or psychological outcomes related to stress or health behaviors related to stress were observed. A four-week, app-based mindfulness meditation intervention (i.e., Calm) may be feasible in middle-aged adults and a useful self-management tool for both men and women to manage stress. Calm participants expressed satisfaction with the intervention and felt it was appropriate and useful. Significant improvements in perceived stress and psychological outcomes (i.e., anxiety, depressive symptoms, mindfulness and general coping) or health behaviors related to stress (i.e., physical activity, eating habits) were not observed. The majority of participants reported that COVID-19 negatively impacted their stress, mental health, and physical health. Even though men spent less time in meditation than women and completed fewer weekly sessions, men were more likely to adhere to the prescription. More research is needed for improving stress and stress related outcomes in middle-aged adults with emphasis about effects of mindfulness meditation app in men.","Laird, Puzia, Larkey, Ehlers, Huberty","https://doi.org/10.2196/30294","20220106","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",25003,""
"The societal economic value of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States","The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the lives of more than 800,000 people in the United States (US) and has been estimated to carry a societal cost of $16 trillion over the next decade. The availability of COVID-19 vaccines has had a profound effect on the trajectory of the pandemic, with wide-ranging benefits. We aimed to estimate the total societal economic value generated in the US from COVID-19 vaccines. We developed a population-based economic model informed by existing data and literature to estimate the total societal value generated from COVID-19 vaccines by avoiding COVID-19 infections as well as resuming social and economic activity more quickly. To do this, we separately estimated the value generated from life years saved, healthcare costs avoided, quality of life gained, and US gross domestic product (GDP) gained under a range of plausible assumptions. Findings from our base-case analysis suggest that from their launch in December 2020, COVID-19 vaccines were projected to generate $5.0 trillion in societal economic value for the US from avoided COVID-19 infections and resuming unrestricted social and economic activity more quickly. Our scenario analyses suggest that the value could range between $1.8 and $9.9 trillion. Our model indicates that the most substantial sources of value are derived from reduction in prevalence of depression ($1.9 trillion), gains to US GDP ($1.4 trillion), and lives saved from fewer COVID-19 infections ($1.0 trillion). Constructed as a projection from December 2020, our model does not account for the Delta or future variants, nor does it account for improvements in COVID-19 treatment. The magnitude of economic benefit from vaccination highlights the need for coordinated policy decisions to support continued widespread vaccine uptake in the US.","Kirson, Swallow, Lu, Mesa-Frias, Bookhart, Maynard, Shivdasani, Lefebvre","https://doi.org/10.1080/13696998.2022.2026118","20220106","COVID-19; H; H5; H51; I; I1; I10; I18; cases avoided; coronavirus; life years saved; pandemic; societal value; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",25004,""

Telemedicine has significant benefits for perinatal mental health patients, including increased accessibility to specialized care, direct observation of child-parent interactions in their home environment, and facilitation of collaborative work between obstetrical providers and psychiatrists. Alternatively, telemedicine may impede recovery and contribute to an increase in social isolation.

"Early Maladaptive Schemas and COVID-19 Anxiety: The mediational role of Mistrustfulness and Vulnerability to Harm and Illness","Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMS), as lifelong psychological structures, tend to be associated with psychopathological symptomatology. Previous research has suggested that schemas act as psychological vulnerabilities to stressful life situations, such as the present worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, anxiety and psychological distress have been documented as two of the main psychological symptoms associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the associations between specific EMS and COVID-19 anxiety remain unexplored. Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationships between EMS, COVID-19 anxiety, as well as other mental health variables such as psychological well-being, distress, and life satisfaction METHODS: In a cross-sectional design, two hundred and forty-nine individuals (N = 249, M = 34.2, SD = 12.0) completed several self-report measures RESULTS: EMS from different schematic domains were positively associated with COVID-19 anxiety and psychological distress and negatively associated with psychological well-being and life satisfaction. An EMS hierarchical regression model predicted COVID-19 anxiety. Mistrustfulness and vulnerability to harm and illness mediated the relationships between COVID-19 anxiety, psychological distress, and life satisfaction. According to these results, mistrustfulness and vulnerability to harm and illness can act as underlying variables for the decrease in mental health associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Faustino, Vasco, Delgado, Farinha-Fernandes, Guerreiro","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2706","20220106","COVID-19 Anxiety; Early Maladaptive Schemas; Life Satisfaction; Mistrustfulness; Psychological Distress; Vulnerability to Harm and Illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",25006,""

A cross-sectional, online, self-administered survey of AYAs diagnosed with cancer between 15 and 39 years of age was conducted. Psychological distress was measured by the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Associations between variables and high psychological distress (K10Ã‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 25), and comparison of prevalence of psychological distress with the YACPRIME study were done using multivariable logistic regression. Summative qualitative content analysis analyzed participant experiences during this pandemic. We included 805 participants. High psychological distress was present in over two-thirds of the group (68.0%; 95% CI, 64.7%-71.2%). Employment impact during pandemic (AOR (adjusted odds ratio), 2.16; 95% CI, 1.41-3.31) and hematologic malignancy (AOR, 1.76; 95% CI 1.08-2.97) were associated with higher psychological distress, while older age [AOR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99] and personal income &lt; $40,000 (AOR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24-0.58) were associated with lower distress. Adjusted odds of experiencing psychological distress among AYAs with cancer during pandemic compared to pre-pandemic years was 1.85 (95% CI: 1.36-2.53). Overarching themes of pandemic experiences included: inferior quality of life, impairment of cancer care, COVID-19 related concerns and extreme social isolation. AYAs diagnosed with cancer are experiencing high psychological distress during this pandemic. Distress screening and evidence-based interventions to alleviate distress are essential.","Glidden, Howden, Romanescu, Hatala, Scott, Deleemans, Chalifour, Eaton, Gupta, Bolton, Garland, Mahar, Oberoi","https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5849","20220106","COVID-19; adolescent; cancer; mental health; oncology; pandemic; psycho-oncology; psychological distress; young adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",25007,""

"The Relationship Among Spirituality, Self-Efficacy, COVID-19 Anxiety, and Hopelessness During the COVID-19 Process in Turkey: A Path Analysis","This study explores the relationship among spirituality, self-efficacy, COVID-19 anxiety, and hopelessness. The participants are comprised of 418 individuals (282 females and 136 males) in Turkey whose ages range between 18 and 61Ã‚Â years old. The participants completed the following surveys: The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and the Spiritual Orientation Inventory. The relationships among the variables have been examined using path analysis. According to the results, spirituality, self-efficacy, and COVID-19 anxiety have direct effects on hopelessness. The analysis also shows self-efficacy to mediate the relationship between spirituality and hopelessness. The proposed model has good fit indices.

"Circadian rhythm disorder and anxiety as mental health complications in post-COVID-19","In 2020, the world gained dramatic experience of the development of the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent researches notice an increasing prevalence of anxiety and circadian rhythm disorders during COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study was describing clinical features of circadian rhythm disorders and the level of anxiety in persons who have had COVID-19. We have conducted a cohort retrospective study that included 278 patients who were divided into 2 study groups according to medical history: group 1 includes patients with a history of COVID-19; group 2 consists of patients who did not have clinically confirmed COVID-19 and are therefore considered not to have had this disease. To objectify circadian rhythm disorders, they were verified in accordance with the criteria of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-3. The level of anxiety was assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The most common circadian rhythm disorders were sleep phase shifts. We found that COVID-19 in the anamnesis caused a greater predisposition of patients to the development of circadian rhythm disorders, in particular delayed sleep phase disorder. In addition, it was found that after COVID-19 patients have increased levels of both trait and state anxiety. In our study, it was the first time that relationships between post-COVID-19 anxiety and circadian rhythm disorders had been indicated. Circadian rhythm disorders are associated with increased trait and state anxiety, which may indicate additional ways to correct post-COVID mental disorders and their comorbidity with sleep disorders.","Boiko, Skrypnikov, Shkodina, Hasan, Ashraf, Rahman","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-18384-4","20220106","Anxiety; COVID-19; Circadian rhythm; Cohort retrospective study; Mood disorders; Sleep disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",25010,""
"Masked face recognition in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic","Face and facial expression recognition abilities have been frequently evaluated in the assessment of social cognition disorders in patients with MS. Investigation of the effect of new difficulties emerging in the field of face recognition with the widespread use of masks during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on patients with MS may make new contributions to the literature. The study included 44 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMSp) and 51 controls who were matched to the case group in terms of age and education level. The Benton face recognition test-short form (BFRT-sf), Beck Depression Inventory, a close-ended 13-item survey on face recognition difficulties due to mask use during the pandemic was administered to all groups. In the RRMSp, the mean disease duration was 8.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.6, the mean EDSS score was 1.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.0, and the mean MOCA test score was 27.23Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.08. The mean BFRTsf was 19.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.4 in the RRMSp and 21.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.8 in the healthy controls.Twenty-five percent of RRMSp and 4% of the healthy controls required people to remove their masks to be able to recognize their faces. Improvement in face recognition difficulty over time was reported as 80% in the healthy controls and 34% in the RRMSp. RRMSp had worse performance in masked face recognition and required removal of the facial masks more often than healthy controls to recognize the faces. RRMS patients did not show as much improvement in recognizing masked faces over time according to the onset of the pandemic as healthy controls.","Kuzu Kumcu, Tezcan Aydemir, Ãƒâ€“lmez, Durmaz Ãƒâ€¡elik, YÃƒÂ¼cesan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05797-9","20220106","COVID-19 pandemic; Face mask; Masked face recognition; Multiple sclerosis; Social cognition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",25011,""
"Impact of COVID-19 containment measures on patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease in the UK and Europe: the REUMAVID study (phase1)","The aim was to compare the impact of the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and lockdown measures on patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) in the UK and other European countries (OEC). REUMAVID was an online cross-sectional survey of seven European countries. The data collected included the following: demographics, lifestyle, employment, access to health-care services, disease-specific characteristics, the World Health Organization five well-being index (WHO-5), hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), visual analogue scale (VAS) disease activity, and the perceived acceptable symptom scale. One thousand eight hundred responses were received between April and July 2020 [UK, <i>n</i> = 558 (31.0%); OEC, <i>n</i> = 1242 (69.0%)]. UK patients were more likely to be older [mean (S.d.): UK 58.5 (13.4) years; OEC 50.0 (12.2) years], university educated [UK <i>n</i> = 302 (54.1%); OEC <i>n</i> = 572 (46.1%), quit smoking [UK <i>n</i> = 92 (59.4%); OEC <i>n</i> = 65 (16.2%)] and continue exercise [UK, <i>n</i> = 216 (49.2%); OEC, <i>n</i> = 228 (33.1%)], although, conversely, alcohol consumption increased [UK <i>n</i> = 99 (36.3%); OEC <i>n</i> = 98 (12.1%)]. UK patients felt informed about COVID-19 (UK 72.7%, OEC 57.4%) and kept their planned rheumatology [UK <i>n</i> = 87 (51.2%); OEC <i>n</i> = 213 (38.6%)] and/or general practice appointments [UK <i>n</i> = 87 (76.3%); OEC <i>n</i> = 310 (53.9%)]. Almost half the patients with RMDs reported a decline in health and well-being, although this was less common in UK patients [UK <i>n</i> = 214 (38.4%), OEC <i>n</i> = 618 (50.2%)], who reported better perceived acceptable symptom scale, VAS pain and HADS scores, but worse WHO-5 scores. UK RMD patients performed better in the physical and mental health domains tested, possibly owing to a less restrictive lockdown and better health-care access. These findings have implications for health-care services globally in planning patient care after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Harrison, Garrido-Cumbrera, Navarro-CompÃƒÂ¡n, Correa-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Webb, Christen, Marzo-Ortega","https://doi.org/10.1093/rap/rkab098","20220106","COVID-19; Europe; United Kingdom; mental health; pandemic; rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",25012,""
"PGY1 Resident-Led Mock Virtual Interviews to Prepare for the 2022 Otolaryngology Residency Virtual Interviews","Due to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, virtual interviews are planned for the 2021-2022 residency application cycle. The virtual interview will remain novel to applicants for each match cycle until the graduating medical student class has experience from virtual interviews during their medical school admissions. The virtual interview poses unique challenges that are unique from in-person formats. Given the lack of experience of applicants in the 2022 match, practicing interviewing skills prior to the actual date is vital to success. We describe a postgraduate year 1 (PGY1)-run mock interview session for applicants preparing for the 2021-2022 otolaryngology interview cycle and discuss the methodology. Deliberate practice with PGY1 residents who have just recently undergone the virtual interview process can better prepare applicants for their virtual interviews, improve on-camera behaviors, and ameliorate mental health challenges unique to the virtual format.","Blumenstein, Bruss, Kan, Yu","https://doi.org/10.1177/2473974X211067947","20220106","medical student; mock interview; residency application; resident mentors; virtual interview","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",25013,""
"COVID-19-Related Concerns and Symptoms of Anxiety: Does Concern Play a Role in Predicting Severity and Risk?","Objective Rates of anxiety have increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, partially attributable to the experience of COVID-19 related concerns. It remains pivotal to determine the implications of such concerns on the severity of anxiety as they may represent opportune targets for public health preventative or therapeutic efforts. The current study evaluated COVID-19 related concerns as predictors of anxiety symptom severity. It also assessed the relative risk associated with sub-types of COVID-19 concerns, the role of age, sex, and minority status as potential moderators; and the unique contribution of COVID-19 concerns beyond sociodemographics, perceived stress, and self-reported general mental health. Methods The data source was obtained from the publicly available ""Crowdsourcing: Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians-Your Mental Health survey"" conducted by Statistics Canada. Participants were Canadians aged 15 and older living in ten provinces or three territories. Only participants that completed the self-reported sociodemographics, COVID-19 concerns, and general anxiety symptoms measures were included (n = 44549). Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate continuous reports of anxiety symptoms, and the relative risk of meeting anxiety cut-off levels was determined using chi-square non-parametric testing. Results Within the sample, 29.1% met cut-off levels of anxiety. Levels of coping and security (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.205, p &lt; 0.001), distal (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.043, p &lt; 0.001), and proximal concerns (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.122, p &lt; 0.001) wereÃ‚Â found to predict the severity of anxiety experiences, which was determined to be robust to statistical control for sociodemographics, perceived stress and self-reported general mental health (ÃŽâ€R<sup>2</sup> = 0.0625, p &lt; 0.001). Minority status and sex were significant moderating variables, although the interaction accounted for less than 0.1% of the observed variance. Family stress from confinement, support during and after the crisis and personal health concerns significantly predicted more than a 200% increase in the risk of meeting anxiety cut-off levels. Conclusion The current study represents a novel examination of COVID-19-related concerns as risk factors for the experience of anxiety amongst a sizeable Canadian cohort. Coping and security-related concerns represented robust predictors of anxiety symptom experiences. Participants whoÃ‚Â experienced concerns relating to their proximal social groups wereÃ‚Â two times more at risk for meeting cut-off anxiety levels than individuals without such concerns.Ã‚Â Longitudinal and evidence synthesis remains essential for identifying therapeutic targets and developing pandemic-related public health prevention and care.","Benzouak, Gunpat, Briner, Thake, Kisely, Rao","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.19999","20220106","anxiety; covid-19; epidemiology; mental health; pandemic; psychological stresses; sars-cov-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",25014,""
"COVID-19 and inequities in the Americas: lessons learned and implications for essential health services","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated social, economic, and health-related disparities, which disproportionately affect persons living in conditions of vulnerability. Such populations include ethnic groups who face discrimination and experience barriers to accessing comprehensive health care. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed these health disparities, and disruptions of essential health services have further widened the gaps in access to health care. Noncommunicable diseases are more prevalent among groups most impacted by poor social determinants of health and have been associated with an increased likelihood of severe COVID-19 disease and higher mortality. Disruptions in the provision of essential health services for noncommunicable diseases, mental health, communicable diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, and maternal and child health services (including sexual and reproductive health), are projected to also increase poor health outcomes. Other challenges have been an increased frequency of interpersonal violence and food insecurity. Countries in the Americas have responded to the disruptions caused by the pandemic by means of health service delivery through telemedicine and other digital solutions and stepping up social service support interventions. As vaccinations for COVID-19 create the opportunity to overcome the pandemic, countries must strengthen primary health care and essential health services with a view to ensuring equity, if the region is to achieve universal health coverage in fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals. La pandemia de COVID-19 ha acentuado las desigualdades sociales, econÃƒÂ³micas y relacionadas con la salud, que afectan desproporcionadamente a las personas en situaciÃƒÂ³n de vulnerabilidad. Esta poblaciÃƒÂ³n incluye grupos ÃƒÂ©tnicos que se enfrentan a la discriminaciÃƒÂ³n y obstÃƒÂ¡culos para el acceso a la atenciÃƒÂ³n integral de salud. La pandemia de COVID-19 ha expuesto estas desigualdades de salud, y las interrupciones de los servicios esenciales de salud han ampliado aÃƒÂºn mÃƒÂ¡s las brechas en el acceso a la atenciÃƒÂ³n de salud. Las enfermedades no transmisibles son mÃƒÂ¡s prevalentes en los grupos que han sufrido un mayor impacto de los determinantes sociales de la salud deficientes y se han asociado con una mayor probabilidad de presentar un cuadro grave de COVID-19 y una mayor mortalidad. Asimismo, se proyecta que las interrupciones en la prestaciÃƒÂ³n de servicios esenciales de salud para las enfermedades no transmisibles, la salud mental, las enfermedades transmisibles como la infecciÃƒÂ³n por el VIH, la tuberculosis y la malaria, y los servicios de salud maternoinfantil (como la salud sexual y reproductiva) incrementen los resultados deficientes en materia de salud. Otros retos son una mayor frecuencia de la violencia interpersonal y la inseguridad alimentaria. Los paÃƒÂ­ses de la RegiÃƒÂ³n de las AmÃƒÂ©ricas han respondido a las interrupciones causadas por la pandemia con la prestaciÃƒÂ³n de servicios de salud mediante la telemedicina y otras soluciones digitales, y la aceleraciÃƒÂ³n de las intervenciones de apoyo de los servicios sociales. A medida que la vacunaciÃƒÂ³n contra la COVID-19 crea la oportunidad de superar la pandemia, los paÃƒÂ­ses deben fortalecer su atenciÃƒÂ³n primaria de salud y sus servicios de salud esenciales a fin de garantizar la equidad, para que la RegiÃƒÂ³n logre la cobertura universal de salud en cumplimiento de los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible.

Being female and younger age were associated with a higher likelihood of developing depression, anxiety, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress. In addition, participants with underlying psychological problems were three times more likely to develop depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms. <b>Conclusion:</b> According to the findings, women, youth, singles, divorced individuals, and individuals with pre-existing psychological and medical conditions are subject to a higher risk of mental health problems during the pandemic, which policy-makers should consider when imposing restrictive measures.","Al-Mutawa, Al-Mutairi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.801002","20220106","COVID-19; GCC countries; anxiety; depression; insomnia; post-traumatic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",25016,""
"Telephone based smoking cessation intervention for adults with serious mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic","The high rates of smoking in adults with serious mental illness (SMI) increases risk for COVID-19 infection. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a smoking cessation intervention that was adapted to be offered by phone during a Shelter in Place (SIP) period in San Francisco, California, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the SIP, we offered counseling sessions by phone to five participants. At the end of each session, we assessed readiness to quit, tobacco cessation or reduction, and inquired about the impact of the shelter in place on smoking habits and mental health. Grounded theory guided data collection and analysis. The categories that emerged around barriers and facilitators for smoking cessation were COVID-19-related stressors, having purpose, structure and feelings of connections, and the importance of quitting aides for smoking cessation. Offering telephone based smoking cessation counseling to adults with SMI while they shelter in place may improve their readiness to quit.","Leutwyler, Hubbard","https://doi.org/10.1177/1179173X211065989","20220106","COVID-19 pandemic; serious mental illness; smoking cessation; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",25017,""
"Persistent and Emergent Clinical Sequelae of Mild COVID-19","<b>BACKGROUND:</b> Knowledge of the clinical course and consequences of COVID-19 initially evolved in the context of severe presentations and among those with comorbidities. However, understanding the outcomes of milder infections in healthy individuals is important for safe return-to-duty in extreme environments or to occupations requiring significant fitness. We reviewed the literature to characterize the nature and timing of persistent and emergent clinical sequelae in milder COVID-19 cases to facilitate development of post-COVID-19 screening and surveillance protocols.<b>METHODS:</b> We searched databases including EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane COVID-19 study register, gray literature, clinical trial registries, and relevant health and disease prevention sources for publications from 2019 to February 18<sup>th</sup>, 2021, documenting COVID-19 sequelae. Articles were included if the COVID-19 severity was mild and there were no, or only minor, pre-existing comorbidities. Persistent and emergent sequelae were then stratified based on time since diagnosis.<b>RESULTS:</b> Among those with mild COVID-19, sequelae were shown to emerge or persist for months following presumed recovery. Among those with no comorbidities, cardiac, hematological, and respiratory sequelae emerged after 1-2 mo, and primarily cardiac abnormalities persisted at Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3 mo. Among those with minor comorbidities, persistent respiratory abnormalities, fatigue, dyspnea, and headache were common, and mental health symptoms emerged by 1-2 mo postinfection.<b>DISCUSSION:</b> After presumed recovery from mild COVID-19, a range of symptoms can persist and later emerge. Whether these are new or previously unrecognized is unclear. Under-recognized COVID-19 sequelae may increase the risk of subtle or sudden incapacitation and have implications for return-to-work (RTW) screening and surveillance for safety-critical roles.<b>Tucci V, Saary J. <i>Persistent and emergent clinical sequelae of mild COVID-19</i>.

"The sustained adverse impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among pregnant women in Sri Lanka: a reassessment during the second wave","To study the change in trend of antenatal mental health and associated factors among a cohort of pregnant women during the second wave of COVID-19 using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Previous study using the same scale, during the first wave reported a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression. A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at the two large maternity hospitals in Colombo, Sri Lanka: Castle Street Hospital for Women (CSHW) and De Soysa Hospital for Women (DSHW). Consecutively recruited 311 women were studied. Out of which, 272 (87.5%) were having uncomplicated pregnancies at the time of the survey and 106 (34.1%) were either anxious, depressed, or both. Prevalence of anxiety was 17.0% and depression 27.0%. Overall, continuing COVID-19 pandemic increased antenatal anxiety and depression. The trend was to aggravate depression more intensively compared to anxiety in this cohort of women studied. Special support is needed for pregnant mothers during infectious epidemics taking more attention to antenatal depression.","Patabendige, Wanniarachchi, Weerasinghe, Ruwanpathirana, Jayasundara, Jayawardane","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-021-05893-1","20220106","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Epidemiology; Hospitalisation; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",25019,""
"Serial Multiple Mediation of the Correlation Between Internet Addiction and Depression by Social Support and Sleep Quality of College Students During the COVID-19 Epidemic","This cross-sectional study explores the serial multiple mediation of the correlation between internet addiction and depression by social support and sleep quality of college students during the COVID-19 epidemic. We enrolled 2,688 students from a certain university in Wuhu, China. Questionnaire measures of internet addiction, social support, sleep quality, depression and background characteristics were obtained. The prevalence of depression, among 2,688 college students (median age [IQR]=20.49 [20.0, 21.0] years) was 30.6%. 32.4% of the students had the tendency of internet addiction, among which the proportion of mild, moderate and severe were 29.8%, 2.5% and 0.1%, respectively. In our normal internet users and internet addiction group, the incidence of depression was 22.6% and 47.2%, respectively. The findings indicated that internet addiction was directly related to college students' depression and indirectly predicted students' depression via the mediator of social support and sleep quality. The mediation effect of social support and sleep quality on the pathway from internet addiction to depression was 41.97% (direct effect: standardized estimate=0.177; total indirect effect: standardized estimate= 0.128). The proposed model fit the data well. Social support and sleep quality may continuously mediate the link between internet addiction and depression. Therefore, the stronger the degree of internet addiction, the lower the individual's sense of social support and the worse the quality of sleep, which will ultimately the higher the degree of depression. We recommend strengthening monitoring of internet use during the COVID-19 epidemic, increasing social support and improving sleep quality, so as to reduce the risk of depression for college students.","Jiang, Zhao, Wang, Hua, Chen, Yao, Jin","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2021.0147","20220106","Addictive disorder; Depressive disorder; Epidemiology; Sleep disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",25020,""
"Mental Health and Related Factors of Adolescent Students During Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic","Adolescents are at a special stage of physical and mental development, which is a susceptible period for mental disorders. Since the outbreak of coronavirus pneumonia in December 2019, long term stress may have negative effects on the mental health of the adolescents. In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the study was designed to investigate the mental and psychological health of adolescents in China and its possible related factors. A cross-sectional study design was adopted using a structured questionnaire which were distributed through the Internet to measure depression, anxiety, life events and stress related factors. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression analyses were conducted to process the data. The final sample comprised 795 adolescents. The total detection rate of depression was 76.48% and the total detection rate of anxiety was 33.08%. ANOVA showed that there were significant differences in depression scores in terms of gender, anxiety scores, history of mental disorders, COVID-19 knowledge reserve, family and social contradictions (p&lt;0.05). And there were significant differences in anxiety scores in terms of gender, depression scores, mental health knowledge reserves, family and social contradictions (p&lt;0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that anxiety score, health status and COVID-19 knowledge reserve were positively associated with depression score (p&lt;0.01), and history of psychosocial disorders was negatively associated with depression score (p&lt;0.05); depression score, family and social contradictions were significantly positively correlated with anxiety score (p&lt;0.01), and history of mental disorders was significantly negatively correlated with SDS score (p&lt;0.01). During the outbreak of COVID-19, adolescent students with better understanding of the pandemic, more complete knowledge of mental health, and better family and social relationship had less impact on their mental health. Therefore, to ensure a sound social support system, elaborate health instruction, and family communication and mutual understanding are conducive to alleviating the psychological stress caused by the epidemic, and it is positive for adolescent students to maintain a good mental health.","Lu, Yu, Zhao, Guo","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2020.0416","20220106","Adolescent; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-07","",25021,""
