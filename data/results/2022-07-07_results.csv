"Use of digital technologies in mental health during COVID-19; Uso de tecnologias digitais na saÃºde mental durante a COVID-19","Abstract Most countries did not have a consolidated digital health structure before the pandemic. Both social distancing and mental health problems resulting from the situation justify the urgency of discussions on web-mediated interventions. The objective of this work is to present the panorama of technological mediation in mental health services and their specificities in the context of the pandemic. This paper is grounded on a critical look at the migration from face-to-face care to the Internet environment, highlighting: the international experiences using digital technologies in the pandemic context; the challenges in online consultations, emphasizing the importance of the ethical, technical/technological, and clinical domains, which are recurring issues in the international literature; the challenges and perspectives in the use of technologies. It is essential to develop strategies aligned with government incentives, aiming at the quality of the offered services and the guarantee of an adequate hybrid qualification.; Resumo A maioria dos paÃ­ses nÃ£o possuÃ­a uma estrutura de saÃºde digital consolidada antes da pandemia.

"Predictors of residential environment stress during social distancing in the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus; Preditores de estresse ambiental domiciliar durante o distanciamento social na pandemia causada pelo vÃ­rus SARS-CoV-2","Abstract The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus pandemic and social distancing caused impacts on people's health, among them, environmental stress - a set of objective and subjective reactions that occur when people face negative environmental influences. The objective was to investigate variables associated with residential environment stress during the pandemic in Brazil. An online survey was carried out with 2000 Brazilians with a mean age of 38.7 years (SD = 14.55), 76.80% of whom were women. The results showed that 81.90% (f = 1,639) of the sample had some level of environmental stress, predicted by geographic region (Brazil's northern and northeastern regions), lower income, lower residential quality scores, and absence of a restorative environment. It is then concluded the identification of some negative and positive environmental factors associated with environmental stress, which may assist in the implementation of policies for coping with 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and promoting mental health in the pandemic context.; Resumo A pandemia causada pelo CoronavÃ­rus da SÃ­ndrome RespiratÃ³ria Aguda Grave 2 (SARS-CoV-2) e o distanciamento social causaram impactos sobre a saÃºde das pessoas.

This effect may differ between age groups. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of fear of disease on X, Y, and Z generations in the COVID-19 epidemic. Among our data collection tools in our study;There is a sociodemographic data form consisting of 21 questions including sociodemographic, occupational, educational level, habits, and taking precautions against diseases of individuals created by researchers, COVID-19 Fear Scale (C19F Scale) and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DAS-21). Of the 1131 participants in the study group, 62.2% (n: 703) were female, with a mean age of 35.07Â±10.88 (18-74 years between values). When the relationship between the scores of the study group from the C19F Scale and the generations is examined it was observed that the Y generation experienced higher fear than the X and Z generation. In addition, it was determined that the Z and Y generation had higher depression than the X generation, the Y generation had higher anxiety than the Z generation, and the Z and Y generation had higher stress scores than the X generation. In the COVID-19 epidemic, the effects of fear of illness and feelings of depression and anxiety on X, Y, and Z generations show differences.

"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COVID-19 VACCINATION RATE AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IN TURKEY: A CORRELATION STUDY","The aim of the research was to evaluate the correlation between the COVID-19 vaccination rate and education, population, health, and income indicators at the provincial level. The study was a descriptive type of research. The first dose COVID-19 vaccination rate was taken from the Turkish Ministry of Health COVID-19 Table. Population, economic, education, and health indicators of the provinces were obtained from the 2019 Health Statistics Yearbook of the Turkish Ministry of Health and the official website of the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK). SPSS v.18 program was used for data analysis. Variables associated with the COVID-19 vaccination rate were evaluated by Spearman correlation analysis. p&lt;0.05 was considered significant. There was a very strong positive correlation between the vaccination rate and the 65-year-old population ratio (rs=0.710, p&lt;0.001), and a very strong negative correlation between the mean household size (rs=-0.848, p&lt;0.001).

"Effects of online attentional bias modification on coronavirus anxiety","Objective: The negative impacts of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on public mental health are enhancing the number of individuals requiring psychotherapy. Besides, anxiety is becoming more frequent than any other mental health issue among individuals. Similar to other anxiety types, coronavirus anxiety is associated with elevated attentional bias. The present study aimed to examine the effects of Attentional Bias Modification (ABM) on attentional bias towards coronavirus-related stimuli, and coronavirus anxiety. Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study with pretest-posttest-follow-up and a control group design. The research participants were 37 adults (aged 18 to 38 y), who were randomly assigned to the experimental (n=18) and control (n=19) groups. The experimental group received ABM, while no intervention was delivered to the controls. Attentional bias and coronavirus disease anxiety were assessed at pretest, posttest, and 2 months follow-up stages using the Dot- Probe Task (DPT) and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS). The collected data were analyzed using two-way repeated-measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Fisher's least significant difference in SPSS v. 26. Results: After receiving online ABM, the study participant's coronavirus-related attentional bias decreased, leading to a significant reduction in coronavirus anxiety (P&lt;0.05). These significant changes were evident at the posttest and maintained until the follow-up step. However, no significant changes occurred in the control group (P&gt;0.05). Conclusion: The presented ABM could decrease coronavirus anxiety;thus, its online implementation is a suitable approach to treat individuals with this anxiety while observing social distancing.

"Antidepressant-Like Effect of Traditional Medicinal Plant Carthamus Tinctorius in Mice Model through Neuro-Behavioral Tests and Transcriptomic Approach","Major depression disorder (MDD) has become a common life-threatening disorder. Despite the number of studies and the introduced antidepressants, MDD remains a major global health issue. Carthamus tinctorius (safflower) is traditionally used for food and medical purposes. This study investigated the chemical profile and the antidepressant-like effect of the Carthamus tincto-rius hot water extract in male mice and its mechanism using a transcriptomic analysis. The antidepressant effect of hot water extract (50 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg) was investigated in mice versus the untreated group (saline) and positive control group (fluoxetine 10 mg/kg). Hippocampus transcriptome changes were investigated to understand the Carthamus tinctorius mechanism of action. The GC-MS analysis of Carthamus tinctorius showed that hot water extract yielded the highest amount of oleamide as the most active ingredient. Neuro-behavioral tests demonstrated that the safflower treatment significantly reduced immobility time in TST and FST and improved performance in the YMSAT compared to the control group. RNA-seq analysis revealed a significant differential gene expression pattern in several genes such as Ube2j2, Ncor1, Tuba1c, Grik1, Msmo1, and Casp9 related to MDD regulation in 50 mg/kg safflower treatment as compared to untreated and fluoxetine-treated groups. Our findings demonstrated the antidepressant-like effect of safflower hot water extract and its bioactive ingredient oleamide on mice, validated by a significantly shortened immobility time in TST and FST and an increase in the percentage of spontaneous alternation.","Alegiry, Mohamed H.; Abdelfatteh El, Omri, Ahmed Atef, Bayoumi, Alomar, Mohammed Y.; Rather, Irfan A.; Sabir, Jamal S.

"Attitudes and Evaluations of the Teachers Towards Distance Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study aims to identify the attitudes and evaluations of the teachers towards distance education which has become compulsory due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both the attitudes towards distance education and the evaluations regarding this application and process were taken with an online survey prepared in this context. The authors have reached the teachers with the help of various applications and collected the data. The study was performed under the mixed method. It has been determined that the teachersÃ­ attitudes towards distance education were negative. This study also examines how teachersÃ­ attitudes towards distance education differ according to various parameters and it was found that only the teachers with previous distance education experience have a positive attitude. Apart from these, the views of the teachers were also questioned by various means. It was found out that the teachers have both positive and negative attitudes and evaluations, and suggestions were developed in this regard.","Erten, Pinar","https://doi.org/10.2478/dcse-2022-0010","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Discourse and Communication for Sustainable Education; 13(1):112-144, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33847,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily life and worry among mothers in Bhaktapur, Nepal","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many aspects of daily life worldwide, but the impact may be higher for impoverished populations. The main aim of this study is to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on different aspects of daily life in mothers in Nepal. We included 493 mothers of children aged 54-71 months participating in a randomized controlled trial on vitamin B12 supplementation. Mothers answered questions regarding the exposure and impact of the pandemic on their daily lives, and pandemic-related worries and sleep problems. We examined the extent to which worry, and sleep problems differed between mothers according to their exposure to COVID-19, socioeconomic status, and previous symptoms of depression. The mean age (SD) of the mothers was 32.3 (4.6) years and 54% had education below the secondary level. Of the mothers, 5.4% had either been exposed to someone who had tested positive or who had a family member with COVID-19. One-third of the participants responded that the pandemic had affected their economic situation, employment, and family life to a great deal. Both mothers and fathers with educational levels above 10 years or households with higher socioeconomic status had significantly higher average worry scores (maternal p = 0.020 and paternal p = 0.005). Mothers with a history of symptoms of depression had significantly more worry-related sleep problems during the pandemic (p = 0.020) than those without a history of depressive symptoms. Our study underlines the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on diverse aspects of everyday life of mothers in Nepal.","Ranjitkar, S.; Strand, T.

"Multi-system investigation of covid-19 illness","IntroductionThe pathophysiology and trajectory of multiorgan involvement in post-COVID-19 syndrome is uncertain. We aimed to adjudicate the likelihood of myocarditis in post-COVID-19 patients.MethodsA prospective, longitudinal, cohort study involving post-COVID-19 patients enrolled in-hospital or early post-discharge (visit 1) and re-evaluated 28â€“60 days post-discharge (visit 2). Serial research blood tests (biomarkers), digital electrocardiography, and patient reported outcome measures were obtained at both visits. Chest computed tomography with pulmonary and coronary angiography, cardiovascular and renal magnetic resonance imaging, were acquired at visit 2.Results159 patients (mean age 55 years, 43% female) and 27 controls with similar age, sex, ethnicity, and vascular risk factors were enrolled from 22 May 2020 to 2 July 2021 and had a primary outcome evaluation. Adjudicated likelihood of myocarditis was not (n=17;11%), unlikely (n=56;35%), probably (n=65;41%) or very likely (n=21;13%). Healthcare worker status (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 2.99 (1.01, 8.89);p=0.048), acute kidney injury (3.26 (1.00, 10.64);p=0.050) and HbA1c(0.64 (0.42, 0.99);p=0.044) were multivariable associates of adjudicated myocarditis. During convalescence, COVID-19 was associated with worse health-related quality of life (EQ5D-5L) (p&lt;0.001), illness perception (p&lt;0.001), anxiety and depression (p&lt;0.001), physical activity (p&lt;0.001) and predicted maximal oxygen utilization (ml/kg/min) (p&lt;0.001). These measures were associated with adjudicated myocarditis.ConclusionThe illness trajectory of COVID-19 includes persisting cardio-renal inflammation, lung damage and hemostasis activation. Adjudicated myocarditis occurred in one in eight hospitalized patients and was associated with impairments in health status, physical and psychological wellbeing during community convalescence.Conflict of InterestNil","Mangion, Kenneth, Morrow, Andrew, Sykes, Robert, MacIntosh, Alasdair, Bagot, Catherine, Bayes, Hannah K.; Bulluck, Heerajnarain, Carrick, David, Corcoran, David, Findlay, Iain, Pauline Hall, Barrientos, Ho, Antonia, Lang, Ninian N.; Lennie, Vera, Patrick, Mark, McConnachie, Alex, McGeoch, Ross, Nordin, Sabrina, Payne, Alexander, Ryan, Nicola, Roditi, Giles, Allwood-Speirs, Sarah, Veldtman, Gruschen, Watkins, Stuart, Welsh, Paul, Berry, Colin","https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2022-BCS.157","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Heart; 108(Suppl 1):A122, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33849,""
"Mobile phone mental health applications: a novel pathway for overdiagnosis of depression","Mobile phone mental health applications (apps) are widely used, and usage has only been accelerated by the global COVID-19 pandemic. These apps often offer a suggested diagnosis as well as treatment guidance. Despite the extensive use of these apps, there is no evidence on the effect they may have on overdiagnosis of mental health conditions, specifically depression. Given the nature of mental health, overdiagnosis can be particularly difficult to quantify and attempts to study overdiagnosis in mental health have often focused on misdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis is separate from misdiagnosis and occurs when overdetection or overdefinition occur. Overdefinition is of relevance in mental health as the DSM-V criteria have been critiqued as being overinclusive such that normal aspects of life are medicalized. Overdiagnosis of depression can have significant effects on the user in the forms of treatment side effects, stigma and labelling harms as well as direct and indirect costs. From a systems level, overdiagnosis results in inefficient use of resources and potential diversion of resources away from those most in need.To understand if mobile phone mental health apps have the potential to contribute to the overdiagnosis of depression in users with milder and self-limited depressive symptoms or grief reactions.MethodsA review of the relevant literature was conducted using PubMed. The top 25 apps using the search term â€˜depressionâ€™ on the Apple App Store and Google Play App Store were reviewed.ResultsNumerous apps (8/25 on each app store) inappropriately used a general screening and treatment response tracking tool, the PHQ-9 questionnaire, as a diagnostic tool. These apps and others provided users with a suggested diagnosis of depression in the context of short term mild depressive symptoms that do not meet DSM-V criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). This may reflect misdiagnosis, however beyond this phenomenon, these apps appear to be susceptible to overdiagnosis as well. Users may meet diagnostic criteria for MDD however symptoms may be sufficiently transient or mild that clinicians using their clinical judgement would not make a diagnosis of depression. Mental health apps lack this fine-tuned clinical judgment and have the potential to indiscriminately make the diagnosis in those experiencing non-pathologic aspects of everyday experiences. The top 12 apps in each store represent greater than 90% of the monthly active users of all depression apps. Among the top 12 apps, 4/12 after making a suggested diagnosis of depression then offered links to for profit web-based therapy services that in some cases have funded the app itself or reimbursed the app for successful referrals.ConclusionPhysicians need to be aware of this potential for overdiagnosis of depression and should clarify how a patientâ€™s previous history of depression was diagnosed. Additionally, patients presenting with depressive symptoms may have already used these apps to reach a premature diagnostic conclusion and expect a certain level of treatment based on the recommendations of these apps. This can strain the therapeutic relationship and care must be taken to explain the nuances of diagnosis and treatment that these apps often overlook.","MacLean, Davis, Ranson, Adam, Patten, Scott, Lang, Eddy","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2022-PODabstracts.61","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Evidence - Based Medicine; 27(Suppl 1):A29-A30, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33850,""
"Communicating about advance care planning to reduce overtreatment in the COVID-19 era: a rapid review","ObjectivesTo explore how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted communication around Advanced Care Planning (ACP). We sought to identify the barriers and enablers of ACP communication given the global crisis involving a previously-unknown, serious infection potentially leading to a surge in overtreatment.MethodsWe adopted the WHO recommendation of using rapid reviews for the production of actionable evidence. We searched PUBMED database to April 2021 and included all studies that focussed on ACP during COVID-19. Non-English articles were excluded. Titles and s were screened independently by two team members and full-texts selected by one author and reviewed by another. Quality was not appraised and risk-of-bias not formally conducted due to the rapid nature of this review. Studies were categorised for design and common themes were identified.ResultsFrom an original 323 s screened, 74 articles were included in this rapid review. The majority were commentary articles (n=39) and the rest were a mix of primary research studies (n=21) and reviews/guidelines (n=14). Most of the articles derived from the USA (n=49), followed by the UK (n=10), with other countries including India (n=3), Taiwan (n=2), Australia (n=2). The population settings included hospitals, outpatient services, residential aged care and community, indicating the widespread interest in ACP across all aspects of society during COVID-19. The main enablers of ACP communication identified included online tools and availability of telehealth. The development of new online tools and workshops encouraged community engagement with ACP during the COVID-19 pandemic. The expansion of telehealth services facilitated communication between patients, their families and physicians, relating to clinical condition, goals of care and treatment options. This allowed them to share decision-making in the setting of social distancing and visitor restrictions during the pandemic.Barriers to ACP communication during COVID-19 were more commonly described. Communication was made difficult by the clinical uncertainty around COVID-19, rapid patient deterioration and varied patient responses to treatment, often resulting in delayed ACP discussions. Complex medical jargon and complicated ACP forms also hindered ACP discussions during the pandemic. ACP uptake was shown to be lower in ethnic minorities and groups with lower socioeconomic status, likely due to language barriers, reduced familiarity with the health system and cultural reluctance to discuss death. Clinicians also experienced difficulties communicating about ACP, stemming from low levels of medical education in palliative care/end-of-life planning. Clinicians were reluctant to initiate ACP conversations, fearing they would extinguish hope of recovery. Shortage of personal protective equipment, visitor restrictions, clinician fatigue and high workload were further barriers to effective ACP communication.ConclusionsEffective communication around ACP during the pandemic, despite the challenges discussed, was found to facilitate end-of-life care in accordance with patientâ€™s wishes, reduce anxiety and depression of bereaved relatives, and potentially prevent unwanted aggressive treatments, unnecessary hospital admissions and long periods of self-isolation. Recommendations to standardise ACP tools, engage a multi-disciplinary team to conduct ACP and increase ACP education for the community and clinicians will serve to further drive ACP conversations at the individual, local and international levels.","Younan, Sarah, Cardona, Magnolia, Sahay, Ashlyn, Willis, Eileen, Danielle Ni, Chroinin","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2022-PODabstracts.40","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Evidence - Based Medicine; 27(Suppl 1):A19-A20, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33851,""
"Examining links between social withdrawal subtypes and internalizing problems among Italian primary school children","The study aimed to explore links between social withdrawal subtypes and internalizing problems among children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were N =Â 748 children (387 girls) aged 7â€“11Â years (M =Â 8.91, SDÂ =Â 1.07) attending primary schools in Italy. Children completed an online questionnaire assessing subtypes of social withdrawal (i.e., shyness, social avoidance, unsociability) and indices of internalizing problems (i.e., social anxiety, loneliness, depression). Among the results, shyness was positively associated with social anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Unsociability was related to depression but not to social anxiety and loneliness. Social avoidance was positively related to loneliness and depression (particularly among older children) and negatively associated with social anxiety (particularly among boys). Results are also discussed in terms of the implications of the different subtypes of social withdrawal in late childhood and early adolescence.

"Bringing nature into CAMHS inpatient services: reflections for the implementation and integration of training into practice","Poor mental health is a global concern and is exacerbated by recent challenges concerning COVID-19 and the climate emergency, with significant consequences to individuals and to society. Increasing evidence demonstrates that nature-based approaches (NBAs) have numerous benefits to mental health services and the people they support with mental health needs. Despite these benefits, understanding how to integrate these approaches into practice is challenging. In this paper, we report our findings from a recent qualitative study with staff from a CAMHS inpatient unit who had recently undergone NatureWell Facilitator training. This is a particular approach to working with people in nature developed by The Natural Academy. Participants identified the importance of implementation of discreet, novel NBAs, as well as integrating nature into current practice, the benefits when fostering psychologically safe and therapeutic relationships with staff, and the clinical and operational factors when carrying out NBAs in these settings.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of sleep of mental health workers in Colombia","Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been reports of poor sleep quality in the general population. However, there are few studies on the sleep quality of health workers, especially mental health workers. The primary objective of the study was to establish the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of sleep of Colombian mental health workers. This study was a cross-sectional study with an analytical approach. Data gathered through an electronic self-reported questionnaire (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-Spanish version) was sent by email between September 27 and October 4, 2020. A total of 48.7% (209) of 429 respondents (mental health workers) slept poorly (95% confidence interval [46.3-57.1]). The lowest scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were for psychiatrists and psychologists (chi2 = 52.882, p = .000), women (chi2 = 6.393, p = .011), daytime shift workers (chi2 = 15.890, p = .0001), those who reported having dreams about the COVID-19 pandemic (chi2 = 16.001, p = .000) and those who had been in close contact with a suspected case of COVID-19 in the past month (chi2 = 10.269, p = .001). This study found that there has been a decline in the sleep quality of mental health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia.

"[Clinical observation on filiform-fire needling of ""<i>Biaoben</i> acupoint combination"" for 33 cases of sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 during recovery period]","To observe the clinical therapeutic effect of filiform-fire needling of ""<i>Biaoben</i> acupoint combination"" on the sequelae of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the recovery period. A total of 33 patients with COVID-19 during the recovery period were treated with filiform-fire needling at the acupoints of Mingmen (GV 4), Shenzhu (GV 12), Gaohuang (BL 43), Zusanli (ST 36) and Shangjuxu (ST 37), etc., once every other day, 3 times a week, and 3 times was one course of treatment and totally 2 courses of treatment were required. The TCM symptom, Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) and Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) scores, pulmonary function indexes (forced vital capacity [FVC], forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1], peak expiratory flow [PEF]) and chest CT imaging change were observed before and after treatment, and the therapeutic effect was evaluated. After treatment, the scores of TCM symptom, HAMA and HAMD were decreased compared with those before treatment (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05), and the levels of FVC, FEV1 and PEF were increased compared with those before treatment (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05), and the recovery rate of 22 patients with pulmonary ventilation dysfunction was 86.4% (19/22). After treatment, the lung shadow area was smaller than that before treatment (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The effective rate of 25 patients with lung CT abnormalities was 84.0% (21/25). After treatment, 23 cases were cured, 5 cases were markedly effective, 4 cases were effective, 1 case was ineffective, the cured and markedly effective rate was 84.8%. The filiform-fire needling of ""<i>Biaoben</i> acupoint combination"" could significantly reduce the sequelae of cough, fatigue, chest tightness, etc. and mental symptoms such as anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19 during the recovery period, and promote inflammatory exudation absorption of pulmonary lesion and improve lung ventilation function. <b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¦Â â€¡Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã©â€¦ÂÃ§Â©Â´Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¦Â¯Â«Ã§ÂÂ«Ã©â€™Ë†Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã©Ââ€”Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â´Ã¥ÂºÅ Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã©â‚¬â€°Ã¥Ââ€“33Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨Â¡Å’Ã¦Â¯Â«Ã§ÂÂ«Ã©â€™Ë†Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã§Â©Â´Ã¥Ââ€“Ã¥â€˜Â½Ã©â€”Â¨Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¨ÂºÂ«Ã¦Å¸Â±Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¨â€ ÂÃ¨â€šâ€œÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¨Â¶Â³Ã¤Â¸â€°Ã©â€¡Å’Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¤Â¸Å Ã¥Â·Â¨Ã¨â„¢Å¡Ã§Â­â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã©Å¡â€Ã¥Â¤Â©Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”1Ã¦Â¬Â¡Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Â¯ÂÃ¥â€˜Â¨3Ã¦Â¬Â¡Ã¯Â¼Å’3Ã¦Â¬Â¡Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§â€“â€”Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥â€¦Â±Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”2Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ§â€“â€”Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â§â€šÃ¥Â¯Å¸Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¥ÂÅ½Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¦Â±â€°Ã¥Â¯â€ Ã¥Â°â€Ã©Â¡Â¿Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã¯Â¼Ë†HAMAÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¦Â±â€°Ã¥Â¯â€ Ã¥Â°â€Ã©Â¡Â¿Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã¯Â¼Ë†HAMDÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¨â€šÂºÃ¥Å Å¸Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¦Å’â€¡Ã¦Â â€¡[Ã§â€Â¨Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¨â€šÂºÃ¦Â´Â»Ã©â€¡ÂÃ¯Â¼Ë†FVCÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§Â¬Â¬1Ã§Â§â€™Ã§â€Â¨Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¥â€˜Â¼Ã¦Â°â€Ã¥Â®Â¹Ã§Â§Â¯Ã¯Â¼Ë†FEV1Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥â€˜Â¼Ã¦Â°â€Ã¥Â³Â°Ã¥â‚¬Â¼Ã¦ÂµÂÃ©â‚¬Å¸Ã¯Â¼Ë†PEFÃ¯Â¼â€°]Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¨Æ’Â¸Ã©Æ’Â¨CTÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥Æ’ÂÃ¥Â­Â¦Ã¥ÂËœÃ¥Å’â€“Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Â®Å¡Ã¤Â¸Â´Ã¥ÂºÅ Ã§â€“â€”Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Å’Â»Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¥ÂÅ HAMAÃ£â‚¬ÂHAMDÃ¨Â¯â€žÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¥Ââ€¡Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥â€°ÂÃ©â„¢ÂÃ¤Â½Å½Ã¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦FVCÃ£â‚¬ÂFEV1Ã£â‚¬ÂPEFÃ¥Ââ€¡Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥â€°ÂÃ¥Ââ€¡Ã©Â«ËœÃ¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’22Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã©Ââ€”Ã§â€¢â„¢Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¨â€šÂºÃ©â‚¬Å¡Ã¦Â°â€Ã¥Å Å¸Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã©Å¡Å“Ã§Â¢ÂÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ§Å½â€¡Ã¤Â¸Âº86.4%Ã¯Â¼Ë†19/22Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¨â€šÂºÃ©Æ’Â¨Ã©ËœÂ´Ã¥Â½Â±Ã©ÂÂ¢Ã§Â§Â¯Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥â€°ÂÃ§Â¼Â©Ã¥Â°ÂÃ¯Â¼Ë†<i>P</i>&lt;0.05Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’25Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã©Ââ€”Ã§â€¢â„¢Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¨â€šÂºÃ©Æ’Â¨CTÃ¥Â¼â€šÃ¥Â¸Â¸Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦â€¢Ë†Ã§Å½â€¡Ã¤Â¸Âº84.0%Ã¯Â¼Ë†21/25Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â²Â»Ã§â€“â€”Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã§â€”Å Ã¦â€žË†23Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã¦â€¢Ë†5Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦â€¢Ë†4Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦â€”Â Ã¦â€¢Ë†1Ã¤Â¾â€¹Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦â€žË†Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã§Å½â€¡Ã¤Â¸Âº84.8%Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å¡</b>Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¦Â â€¡Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã©â€¦ÂÃ§Â©Â´Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¦Â¯Â«Ã§ÂÂ«Ã©â€™Ë†Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¦ËœÅ½Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã¥â€¡ÂÃ¨Â½Â»Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥Å¾â€¹Ã¥â€ Â Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™Ã¨â€šÂºÃ§â€šÅ½Ã¦ÂÂ¢Ã¥Â¤ÂÃ¦Å“Å¸Ã¦â€šÂ£Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã¥â€™Â³Ã¥â€”Â½Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¤Â¹ÂÃ¥Å â€ºÃ£â‚¬ÂÃ¨Æ’Â¸Ã©â€”Â·Ã§Â­â€°Ã¥ÂÅ½Ã©Ââ€”Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’ÂÃ§Â­â€°Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥ÂÅ’Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã¤Â¿Æ’Ã¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨â€šÂºÃ©Æ’Â¨Ã§â€”â€¦Ã§ÂÂ¶Ã§â€šÅ½Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã¦Â¸â€”Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ¥ÂÂ¸Ã¦â€Â¶Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦â€Â¹Ã¥â€“â€žÃ¨â€šÂºÃ©â‚¬Å¡Ã¦Â°â€Ã¥Å Å¸Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Luo, Wang, Zhang, Chen, Chen, Chen, Zhou, Gu, Li, Yan, Tian, Xu, Chen, Chen, Liang, Wu","https://doi.org/10.13703/j.0255-2930.20210817-0002","20220706","Biaoben acupoint combination; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); filiform-fire needling; recovery period; sequelae","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33856,""

Our results indicate that both the outbreak negatively affects the well-being of HE, and women face more levels of fear, negative feelings and violence than men. Within the context of this research, we contribute to the literature by considering the changing living conditions in the outbreak and adopting a comprehensive approach to reveal sub-level of well-being as subjective and psychological well-being rather than focusing on only mental health like previous studies.","GÃƒÂ¼ler, AydÃ„Â±n, Rahman, IÃ…Å¸Ã„Â±k","https://doi.org/10.1080/07399332.2022.2087077","20220706","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33857,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on the social relationships and mental health of older adults living alone: A two-year prospective cohort study","Owing to the COVID-19 outbreak, older adults living alone, who can only connect socially outside their homes, are at risk of social isolation and poor mental health. This study aimed to identify the changes, before and after COVID-19, by sex and age, in social relationships (social activity, social network, and social support) and mental health (depression and suicide ideation) among older adults living alone. This is a prospective cohort study of community-dwelling older adults who were at least 65 years old and living alone in South Korea. The study was conducted during 2018-2020 with 2,291 participants (795, 771, and 725 for the 1st to 3rd waves, respectively). The data were collected via face-to-face interviews. A generalized linear mixed modeling framework was used to test for changes over three years. Social activity was reduced after the COVID-19, with an interaction effect of sex: older women (odds ratio [OR], 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.23; p &lt; .001) showed greater reduction than older men (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.34-0.75; p &lt; .001). Interaction with neighbors also reduced after the pandemic, but there was no significant evidence of interaction effects. Interaction with family members increased in both sexes during the pandemic, with the interaction effect of sex: older women (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.11-1.76; p = .004) showed greater increase than men (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.13-2.14; p = .007). Social support increased in both sexes during the pandemic, but there was no significant evidence of interaction effects. Depression and suicide ideation showed no significant differences before and after the pandemic. The findings provide health administrators and health providers with explorative insights into the impact of the COVID-19 on social relationships and mental health among older adults living alone and can guide further studies of interventions considering specific properties of social relationships.","Ryu, Park, Kim, Huh, Chang, Jang, Noh","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270260","20220706","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33858,""
"Does money buy health? evaluation of stock market performance and economic growth in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic","The novel coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) has significantly harmed numerous social and economic activities worldwide, drawing researchers and governments' attention to the problem and tackling it via persistent healthcare measures. The study's primary purpose is to examine the effects of total coronavirus cases, total fatalities, total recovered cases, unemployment, and trade openness on stock prices and economic growth in the world's top 39 affected nations. An analysis of the coronavirus outbreaks found that wealthier countries had a well-established healthcare infrastructure, but they were disproportionately affected by the virus. Conversely, the less wealthy nations had inadequate healthcare infrastructures, but they were not as affected as the wealthier countries. Is it possible to buy health with money? That was the question at the heart of the study's money-and-health curve. The robust least square regression results indicate that an increase in coronavirus cases influences economic growth and stock market performance due to massive healthcare funding distributed globally, sustaining economic and financial activities for a shorter period. However, a continuous increase in coronavirus fatalities depresses the stock market, resulting in financial depression worldwide. Additionally, a rise in overall coronavirus recovered cases has a negative effect on the country's economic development and stock market performance because of greater uncertainty in economic and financial activities. Case fatality ratios influence economic growth, whereas case recovery ratios decrease economic and financial performance due to greater healthcare concerns across countries. Finally, trade openness is critical in sustaining the country's economic development and stock market performance in the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Bibi, Khan, Zaman, Sriyanto, Sasmoko, Khan","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0269879","20220706","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33859,""

"Caring for adolescents and young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in primary care: seizing opportunities to address youth mental health needs","To provide primary care providers (PCPs) with updated practical guidance around the assessment and management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adolescents and young adults (AYA). Of the three different presentations of ADHD delineated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the Predominantly Inattentive presentation is the most common among AYA. Multiple rating scales exist to assist clinicians in identifying ADHD symptoms and monitoring treatment effects. Importantly, ADHD frequently persists into adulthood with negative impacts in many life domains if left untreated. It is important for PCPs to provide support for AYA as they transition to adulthood, as treatment adherence often drops sharply at that time, and, once treatment is discontinued, it is rarely restarted. Further, clinicians should be aware of the negative psychological, behavioral, and social impacts that COVID-19 has had on AYA with ADHD. AYA with ADHD often seek care first from PCPs. However, diagnosis and management of ADHD among AYA are challenging, and many clinicians feel ill-equipped, creating concern that many youth may go undiagnosed and untreated. Despite these long-standing challenges, recent advances have opened up critical opportunities for PCPs to proactively address ADHD in primary care settings and make a profound impact on youth as they seek to realize their full potential.","Driscoll, Kimberg, Chung","https://doi.org/10.1097/MOP.0000000000001127","20220706","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33861,""
"Impact of COVID-19 - Experiences of 5th year medical students at the University of KwaZulu-Natal","Ã‚Â The global pandemic associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had a considerable effect on higher education in South Africa, with online instruction replacing traditional lectures for many students. Medical students were required to vacate their residences in March 2020 but returned to campus in July 2020 to enable them to continue with clinical teaching and learning. The aim of this study was to understand the learning experiences of 5th year medical students at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) during 2020. Ã‚Â This was a qualitative study conducted via Zoom in December 2020 with 18 students in four focus group discussions and four semi-structured interviews. These were all facilitated by an independent researcher with experience in qualitative research. All the interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed qualitatively through the identification of codes, categories and themes. Ã‚Â The following major themes emerged: A stressful and at times an overwhelming year, mental health issues, developing strategies to cope, and issues that related to teaching and learning. Ã‚Â The disruptions caused by COVID-19, the lockdown, a condensed academic programme and uncertainty about their competency resulted in high levels of anxiety and stress among medical students. Participants highlighted strategies that had helped them to cope with the isolation and academic pressures. Given the large volume of work, careful thought needs to be given to what should be taught and how it should be taught to ensure that graduates have the competencies they need to practise.","Ross","https://doi.org/10.4102/safp.v64i1.5483","20220706","COVID-19; learning; qualitative; resilience; stress and anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33862,""

"Obsessive-compulsive symptoms among the general population during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave in Italy","This study investigated obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) in the Italian general population during the initial stage of the pandemic and the impact of COVID-19 related potential risk factors. A web-based survey was spread throughout the internet between March 27th and April 9th<sup>,</sup> 2020. Twenty thousand two hundred forty-one individuals completed the questionnaire, 80.6% women. The Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS) was included to assess the severity of the obsessive-compulsive symptom domains. Further, selected outcomes were depression, anxiety, insomnia, perceived stress, and COVID-19 related stressful life events. A panel of logistic or linear regression analyses was conducted to explore the impact of COVID-19 related risk factors, socio-demographic variables, and mental health outcomes on OCS. A total of 7879 subjects (38,9%) reported clinically relevant OCS. Specifically, more than half of the sample (52%) reported clinically relevant symptoms in the Contamination domain, 32.5% in the Responsibility domain, 29.9% in the Unacceptable thoughts domain, and 28.6 in the Symmetry/Ordering domain. Being a woman was associated with OCS, except for Symmetry/Ordering symptoms. A lower education level and younger age were associated with OCS. Moreover, depression, anxiety, perceived stress symptoms, insomnia, and different COVID-19 related stressful events were associated with OCS. We found high rates of OCS, particularly in the contamination domain, in the Italian general population exposed to the first COVID-19 epidemic wave and COVID-19 related risk factors. These findings suggest the need to investigate further the trajectories of OCS in the general population along with the long-term socio-economic impact of the pandemic.","Pacitti, Socci, D'Aurizio, Jannini, Rossi, Siracusano, Rossi, Di Lorenzo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.06.043","20220707","COVID-19; COVID-19 related risk factors; Mental health; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Obsessive-compulsive symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33864,""
"Risk factors for COVID-19-related stress among college-going students","To explore the degree of COVID-19-related stress among college students enrolled in higher level institutions and identify socio-demographic and psychosocial factors that may predict, or be associated with, higher levels of pandemic-related distress. Data were obtained from a cross-sectional survey completed by 321 college students primarily recruited from Universities in Ireland. Ages ranged between 18-21 years (<i>n</i> = 176) and 22-25 years (<i>n</i> = 145). Participants answered some demographic questions before completing scales assessing their experience of childhood adversity, their present resilience and levels of psychological distress, as well as their COVID-19-specific stress. Multiple regression analysis revealed that students who were female, who had chronic illness, who experienced monetary concerns and who expressed psychological distress experienced greater stress related to COVID-19. Findings suggest that certain categories of college students may be at higher risk for experiencing poor mental health during a global pandemic. Higher level institutions should consider this when designing and delivering support services aiming to promote student mental health and alleviate mental distress.","Bhargav, Swords","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2022.33","20220706","COVID-19; Coronavirus; higher education; mental health; risk factors; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33865,""
"A systematic review of fear, stigma, and mental health outcomes of pandemics","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of people globally. Despite substantial research on the short-term psychological impact of COVID-19, its long-term consequences on mental health remain relatively unexplored. We aimed to examine mental health literature on prior outbreaks to provide recommendations for developing effective strategies to mitigate the short- and long-term psychological impact of the current pandemic. We conducted a narrative review of 41 studies to analyze the adverse impact of the following epidemics and pandemics on the mental health of individuals, groups, and communities: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Influenza A/H1N1, and Ebola Virus Disease. We noted that these past epidemics and pandemics escalated stress, distress, anxiety, fear, and stigma that persisted in countries and communities. We also identified the role of misinformation in propagating discrimination and prejudice towards certain groups. We discuss how the mental health outcomes of previous pandemics differed from the COVID-19 outbreak. We believe that strategies that reduce misinformation, educational initiatives, and mental health programs when introduced at the individual and community level have the potential to effectively diminish the negative psychological impact of COVID-19. This study followed the PRISMA guidance and was not registered in PROSPERO. This is a narrative review that used qualitative thematic analysis.

"Rapid improvement in severe long COVID following perispinal etanercept","This study aimed to describe the neurological improvements in a patient with severe long COVID brain dysfunction following perispinal etanercept administration. Perispinal administration of etanercept, a novel method designed to enhance its brain delivery via carriage in the cerebrospinal venous system, has previously been shown to reduce chronic neurological dysfunction after stroke. Etanercept is a recombinant biologic that is capable of ameliorating two components of neuroinflammation: microglial activation and the excess bioactivity of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a proinflammatory cytokine that is a key neuromodulator in the brain. Optimal synaptic and brain network function require physiological levels of TNF. Neuroinflammation, including brain microglial activation and excess central TNF, can be a consequence of stroke or peripheral infection, including infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. Standardized, validated measures, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Beck Depression Index-II (BDI-II), Fatigue Assessment Scale, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Trail Making Tests, Timed Finger-to-Nose Test, 20 meter Self-Paced Walk Test, 5 Times Sit-to-Stand Test and Grip Strength measured with a Jamar Dynamometer were used to quantitate changes in cognition, depression, fatigue and neurological function after a single 25mg perispinal etanercept dose in a patient with severe long COVID of 12 months duration. Following perispinal etanercept administration there was immediate neurological improvement. At 24Ã¢â‚¬â€°hours there were remarkable reductions in chronic post-COVID-19 fatigue and depression, and significant measureable improvements in cognition, executive function, phonemic verbal fluency, balance, gait, upper limb coordination and grip strength. Cognition, depression and fatigue were examined at 29 days; each remained substantially improved. Perispinal etanercept is a promising treatment for the chronic neurologic dysfunction that may persist after resolution of acute COVID-19, including chronic cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, and depression. These results suggest that long COVID brain neuroinflammation is a potentially reversible pathology and viable treatment target. In view of the increasing unmet medical need, clinical trials of perispinal etanercept for long COVID are urgently necessary. The robust results of the present case suggest that perispinal etanercept clinical trials studying long COVID populations with severe fatigue, depression and cognitive dysfunction may have improved ability to detect a treatment effect. Positron emission tomographic methods that image brain microglial activation and measurements of cerebrospinal fluid proinflammatory cytokines may be useful for patient selection and correlation with treatment effects, as well as provide insight into the underlying pathophysiology.","Tobinick, Spengler, Ignatowski, Wassel, Laborde","https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2022.2096351","20220706","Long COVID; SARS-CoV-2; TNF; etanercept; microglial activation; perispinal; treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33867,""
"Trends in Post-Secondary Student Stress: A Pan-Canadian Study","Previous research has evaluated the sources of post-secondary student stress, but has failed to explore whether stressors fluctuate over time. The purpose of this research was to use the Post-Secondary Student Stressors Index to examine whether stressors changed significantly and meaningfully over the course of an academic year. Due to the timing of data collection, results also provide context around students' experiences of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional data was collected at 3 time points via online surveys over the course of the 2020-2021 academic year from &gt;10,000 students. Participants attended 15 post-secondary institutions across Canada, representing 9 provinces and 1 territory. Validated instruments were used to assess levels of stress, distress and the severity of student-specific stressors. Kruskal-Wallis ranked tests and multiple pairwise comparison analyses were conducted to assess whether the mean severity of stressors changed over time. Standard effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's <i>d</i>. Mean levels of stress and psychological distress were high at the start of the study and remained high across time points. A similarly high level of stress was observed on average for student-specific stressors. While significant differences in mean severity were observed over time for some stressors, standardized effect sizes were negligible, suggesting little meaningful change and consistent levels of chronic stress over the course of the academic year. This is the first paper to examine trends in student-specific stress using a nationwide sample of Canadian post-secondary students during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patterns observed in student-specific stressors reflected changes likely to be indicative of the pandemic, including the most severe stress associated with academics, finances and concerns for the future. Implications for future research are discussed, in particular, the importance of examining stressors related to COVID-19 and their impact on student mental health.","Linden, Stuart, Ecclestone","https://doi.org/10.1177/07067437221111365","20220706","COVID-19; higher education; mental health; post-secondary; stress; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33868,""
"'The key to this is not so much the technology It's the individual who is using the technology': Perspectives on telehealth delivery for autistic adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic meant that a lot of healthcare services had to move online, such as to video-calls, or to telephone. However, not many studies have looked at how autistic adults feel about this kind of service delivery. It is important to know this, as autistic people may have poorer health than non-autistic people, and they may also struggle to access services more than non-autistic people. This study asked 11 autistic adults (aged 27-67Ã¢â‚¬â€°years), seven family members/carers (aged 44-75) reporting about autistic adults and six service providers about their experiences of accessing or providing a telehealth service. These experiences were collected through interviews, which were then analysed through thematic analysis. Two main themes were: technology aids communication and access - except when it doesn't, and in/flexibility. The themes pointed out some positive aspects of telehealth delivery, including improved communication and decreased stress. The themes also pointed out negative aspects of telehealth, such as increased rigidity of the healthcare system, amplifying pre-existing barriers. Because autistic people have many barriers to accessing healthcare, this study encourages researchers and healthcare providers to think about how such barriers could be addressed through telehealth, and about the possible limitations of telehealth for some autistic people.","Ali, O'Brien, Hull, Kenny, Mandy","https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613221108010","20220706","autism; mental health; physical health; service delivery; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33869,""
"Previous trauma exposure and self-mastery as moderators of psychiatric effects of home isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic: a field study","Limiting contagion during the Covid-19 pandemic has necessitated employment of drastic measures ranging from complete lockdown to home isolation and quarantines. This study examined the psychiatric effects of home isolation, the effects of interacting previous traumatic events and the moderating effect of self-mastery as a resilience factor that could mitigate negative effects. Six hundred forty-five adults aged 18-67 completed an online survey during the first wave lockdown during the Covid-19 outbreak in Israel. Participants completed a demographic questionnaire including measures of strictness of adherence to home isolation, a traumatic life events measure, the Mastery Scale, and the Brief Symptom Inventory. Data was analyzed using Structural Equation Model. Findings showed positive relations between strictness of home isolation adherence and psychiatric symptoms, and between previous trauma exposure and psychiatric symptoms. A negative relation between self-mastery and psychiatric symptoms emerged. During home isolation, effects of previous trauma exposure on psychiatric symptoms was moderated by self-mastery. Individuals with high self-mastery showed less psychiatric symptoms than those with low self-mastery, at both high and low levels of previous trauma exposure. Home isolation adherence is associated with significant psychological distress and symptomatology and, thus, should be of great concern for public mental health service providers. The present study offers a new slant on appropriate clinical interventions during this period with a focus on strengthening resilience factors that can moderate mental health decline. Therapy and interventions based on promoting self-mastery could exert a significant effect on lowering psychiatric symptoms during stressful periods of home isolation.

"The role of healthy emotionality in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and mental health problems: a cross-sectional study","Understanding pandemic-related psychopathology development is limited due to numerous individual and contextual factors. It is widely accepted that individual differences to endure or cope with distress predict psychopathology development. The present study investigated the influence of individual differences in neuroticism and healthy emotionality concerning the association between fear of COVID-19 and mental health problems. It was hypothesized that healthy emotionality would moderate the mediated link between fear of COVID-19 and mental health problems. A sample of 752 participants (351 males and 401 females) completed an online survey including the Emotional Style Questionnaire, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Neuroticism subscale of the Big Five Inventory, and General Health Questionnaire. The results showed that the fear of COVID-19 positively predicted mental health problems (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.43, SEÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001, Cohen's f <sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.24). Neuroticism also showed a significant mediation effect on the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and mental health problems. Fear of COVID-19 indirectly predicted psychopathology through neuroticism (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°.16, SEÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.04, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001, tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.53, 95% CI [0.11, 0.23]).

"Perception of risk and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with rheumatic diseases: a case-control study","Risk perception of the COVID-19 pandemic may affect chronic disease outcomes among patients with rheumatic diseases (RD). To describe and compare the perception of risk and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with RD from two health care centers compared with a control group. A retrospective case-control study was conducted. Patient respondents completed an online survey to measure risk perception and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The case group consisted of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of RD, coming from two third-level health care centers. The control group was a population group without RD from a public university. A total of 3944 participants were included: 986 patients with an RD (cases) from the two hospital centers and 2958 controls without RD. A greater perception of risk severity and perception of contagion was observed in the group of patients with RD, OR: 1.70, 95% CI 1.44Ã¢â‚¬â€™2.01 and OR: 2.0, 95% CI 1.79Ã¢â‚¬â€™2.23, respectively; more significant deterioration in family life OR: 1.14, 95% CI 1.01Ã¢â‚¬â€™1.29; greater economic impact, OR 3.94, 95% CI 3.48Ã¢â‚¬â€™4.46; as well as negative emotions and feelings (alarmed, anxiety, depression, confusion, fear, isolation, and discrimination). This impact was maintained when the model was adjusted for comorbidities. In the face of an unexpected and catastrophic event such as the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with RD report apparently greater impact on their mental state and economic situation than the control population, as well as increased perception of discrimination. Key Points Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The multidisciplinary analyses of risk perception are required to promote actions that can enhance the preparedness and responses of public efforts for possible future pandemics in a way that considers the specific needs of vulnerable people like patients with rheumatic diseases. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Identifying risk perceptions of possible effects of the pandemic, sources of communication, and opinions is essential to ensure self-care in rheumatic disease. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The impact of COVID-19 has been much greater for people with rheumatic disease, especially in terms of the perceived severity of the pandemic, impacts on family and economy, preventive behaviors, and uncertainty.","Gastelum-Strozzi, Pascual, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-GarduÃƒÂ±o, Moctezuma-Rios, Guaracha-BasaÃƒÂ±ez, Sotelo, Garcia-Garcia, Contreras-YaÃƒÂ±ez, ÃƒÂlvarez-HernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Infante-CastaÃƒÂ±eda, PelÃƒÂ¡ez-Ballestas","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-022-06257-1","20220705","COVID-19; CaseÃ¢â‚¬â€œcontrol study; Impact; Rheumatic Disease; Risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33872,""
"Risk and protective factors for posttraumatic stress and posttraumatic growth in parents of children with intellectual and developmental disorders","Parents of children with intellectual and developmental disorders often experience potentially traumatic events while caring for their children. Heightened posttraumatic stress (PTS) and posttraumatic growth (PTG) have been found in this population. We aimed to explore risk and protective factors for their PTS and PTG. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 385 parents (average age MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°43.14 years, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.40; 95.3% mothers). Parenting trauma showed an adverse effect on developing PTS (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.25, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) and a positive role in promoting PTG (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.16, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). Social support was protective in its correlation with lower levels of PTS (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.12, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) and higher levels of PTG (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.22, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). Barriers to care were associated with increased PTS (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.23, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01), but unrelated to PTG (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.855). Negative parenting showed a significant, but small, correlation with more severe PTS (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.11, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05), and was unrelated to PTG (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.09, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.065). Our study increases the understanding of posttraumatic reactions in parents, predominantly mothers, of children with IDD and identified parenting-related trauma, social support, and barriers to mental health care as predictive factors of the reactions. More research is needed to confirm and validate the effects of the discussed factors. Although causation can not be inferred, prompt and adequate screening and therapeutic resources should be provided to those mothers who were exposed to multiple stressful caregiving events and had limited healthcare access and less support from their spouses, peers, and caregiving partners. Parents of a child with Intellectual and Developmental Disorders with parenting trauma had higher posttraumatic stress (PTS) and posttraumatic growth (PTG).Social support was related to lower PTS and higher PTG.Barriers to care were related to higher PTS but unrelated to PTG. <b>Antecedentes:</b> Los padres de niÃƒÂ±os con trastornos intelectuales y del desarrollo a menudo experimentan eventos potencialmente traumÃƒÂ¡ticos mientras cuidan a sus hijos. En esta poblaciÃƒÂ³n se han encontrado un elevado estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico (PTS por sus siglas en ingles) y crecimiento postraumÃƒÂ¡tico (PTG por sus siglas en ingles).<b>Objetivo:</b> Nuestro objetivo fue explorar los factores protectores y de riesgo para PTS y PTG.<b>MÃƒÂ©todo:</b> Se realizÃƒÂ³ un estudio transversal con 385 padres (con edad promedio MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°43,14 aÃƒÂ±os, DSÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7,40; 95,3% madres).<b>Resultados:</b> El trauma parental mostrÃƒÂ³ ser un efecto adverso en el desarrollo de PTS (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.25, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) y un papel positivo en la promover el PTG (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.16, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,01). El apoyo social fue protector en su correlaciÃƒÂ³n con niveles mÃƒÂ¡s bajos de PTS (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢Ë†â€™0.12, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) y niveles mÃƒÂ¡s altos de PTG (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.22, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). Las barreras a la atenciÃƒÂ³n se asociaron con un aumento de PTS (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.23, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), pero no se relacionaron con PTG (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,855).

"Mental Health of Medical Students Before and During COVID-19 Pandemic: a 3-Year Prospective Study","Very few studies prospectively analyzed medical students' mental health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to prospectively evaluate mental health in medical students in 2018, 2019, and 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. All students from first to fourth year were invited to participate in 2018. These students were also invited to participate in the same period in 2019 and 2020 (during the peak of the COVID-19 lockdown). The Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20), created by the WHO to investigate 20 nonpsychotic psychiatric symptoms, was used to evaluate common mental disorders. The cut-off for relevant symptom severity for mental distress is seven (SRQ-20Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°7). In the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, a total of 860 SRQ-20 questionnaires were completed. Overall, mean SRQ-20 scores were 8.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.6, and SRQ-20Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°7 frequency was 60.5%. When comparing the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, no differences were found for either SRQ-20 scores (8.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.7, 8.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.6, and 7.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.4, respectively; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.351) or SRQ-20Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°7 frequency (62.2%, 60.9%, and 59.2%, respectively; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.762). In contrast to our initial hypothesis, stable results on mental health measures were found even during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. Maintenance of daily routines through distance learning and the continuation of adapted clerkship activities with strict safety measures could have contributed to these results. However, this study points to high overall levels of common mental disorders, especially among women. Further studies should be conducted to understand all the factors responsible for such stability, such as social and economic support, resilience, or even previous high levels of common mental disorders.","Pereira, Casagrande, Almeida, Neves, da Silva, Miskulin, Perissotto, Ribeiz, Nunes","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40670-022-01580-3","20220705","COVID-19; Distance learning; Medical students; Mental health; Prospective","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33874,""
"Metacognitions About Health in Relation to Coronavirus Anxiety: The Mediating Role of Cognitive Attentional Syndrome and Distress Tolerance","The current study aimed to investigate the mediating role of cognitive attentional syndrome (CAS) and distress tolerance in the relationship between health-related metacognitions and coronavirus anxiety. The sample of this study consisted of 462 participants (381 female). Participants voluntarily completed self-report questionnaires on each of the variables mentioned above. The results of the structural modeling analysis showed that health-related metacognitions have a significant effect on the mediator variable of distress tolerance and CAS. Also, health-related metacognitions had a direct effect on coronavirus anxiety. Also, based on the results of the bootstrap test, it can be argued that health-related metacognitive beliefs, apart from their direct effect, play an important role in coronavirus anxiety, with CAS acting as a mediator. This study provides insights into the relationships among metacognitive beliefs, coronavirus anxiety, CAS, and distress tolerance. In particular, dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs, including an individual's beliefs about the uncontrollability of disease-related thoughts, are risk factors that could negatively affect mental health, leading to coronavirus anxiety. In addition, the association of dysfunctional beliefs with maladaptive behaviors resulting from the cognitive attentional syndrome is also involved in predicting and causing coronavirus anxiety. Given the insignificant role of emotional distress tolerance in the psychopathology of COVID-19 anxiety, the findings emphasize the importance of cognitive factors in this context.","Mohammadkhani, Akbari, Shahbahrami, Seydavi, Kolubinski","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10942-022-00467-x","20220705","Cognitive attentional syndrome; Coronavirus anxiety; Distress tolerance; Health-related metacognitions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33875,""
"Acceptance of E-mental health interventions and its determinants among psychotherapists-in-training during the first phase of COVID-19","Although E-mental health (EMH) interventions have been shown to be effective in the treatment of mental health problems and empirical knowledge regarding EMH acceptance for different occupations in health care is established, little is known regarding EMH and psychotherapists-in-training. This seems particularly relevant as psychotherapists-in-training will shape the future health care system since they are as being the next generation of psychotherapists. With social distancing measures in place, COVID-19 has led to an increased demand for EMH, which is broadening the way psychological treatments are delivered. The present study aims to assess the acceptance of EMH and its determinants among psychotherapists-in-training of different EMH modalities and to retrospectively compare current acceptance with pre-COVID-19 times. Altogether, 29 training institutions in Switzerland and 232 training institutions in Germany were contacted, resulting in a sample of <i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯216 psychotherapists-in-training (88.4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% female) who filled out the self-administered web-based questionnaire in summer 2020. The acceptance of EMH was assessed considering several different modalities (e.g., videoconference, guided self-help programs) as well as further possible predictors of EMH acceptance based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Acceptance scores were categorized as low, moderate or high based on prior research and predicted using multiple regression. Acceptance of EMH was moderate (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯3.40, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.11) and increased significantly (<i>t</i>(215)Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯12.03, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.01; <i>d</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.88) compared to pre-COVID-19 (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2.67, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.11); however, acceptance varied significantly between modalities (F(2.6, 561.7)Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯62.93, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.01, partial ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.23), with videoconferencing being the most accepted and unguided programs the least. Stepwise regression including three of 14 variables (R<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.55, F (14, 201)Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯17.68, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001) identified <i>performance expectancy</i>, <i>social influence</i> and <i>concerns about the therapeutic alliance</i> as significant determinants of EMH acceptance. Acceptance by psychotherapists-in-training was moderate and in line with prior research and comparable with other clinicians' acceptance scores. <i>Performance expectancy</i>, <i>social influence</i> and <i>concerns about the therapeutic alliance</i> were predictive of EMH acceptance, indicating their significance in the implementation of EMH in health care. These findings underline the importance of the aforementioned determinants of EMH acceptance and the need for further studies investigating EMH acceptance in order to derive adequate educational programs and to facilitate dissemination among psychotherapists-in-training.","Staeck, DrÃƒÂ¼ge, Albisser, Watzke","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2022.100555","20220705","Acceptance; COVID-19; E-mental health; Mental health; Psychotherapist-in-Training; Psychotherapy; UTAUT","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33876,""
"Opportunities and challenges of using social media big data to assess mental health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis and future major events","The present commentary discusses how social media big data could be used in mental health research to assess the impact of major global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We first provide a brief overview of the COVID-19 situation and the challenges associated with the assessment of its global impact on mental health using conventional methods. We then propose social media big data as a possible unconventional data source, provide illustrative examples of previous studies, and discuss the advantages and challenges associated with their use for mental health research. We conclude that social media big data represent a valuable resource for mental health research, however, several methodological limitations and ethical concerns need to be addressed to ensure safe use.","TuÃ…Â¡l, Thelen, Marcus, Peters, Shalaeva, Scheckel, Sykora, Elayan, Naslund, Shankardass, Mooney, Fadda, Gruebner","https://doi.org/10.1007/s44192-022-00017-y","20220705","Big data; COVID-19; Mental health; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33877,""
"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on psychopathological symptoms in mothers and their school-age children before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic peak","The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on children's and caregivers' mental health. We investigated psychopathological symptoms in a group of non-at-risk and a group of at-risk mothers and their school-age children from the pre-pandemic period to the lockdown period and to the post-lockdown period. We used the SCL-90/R to assess mothers' psychological symptoms, the CBCL 1Ã‚Â½-5, and the CBCL 6-18 for the perceived children's emotional-behavioral functioning. Analysis of variance was conducted to assess significant differences in the groups over the three assessment points. Linear regressions were run to investigate the effect of maternal psychological symptoms on their children's functioning. In the non-at-risk group, maternal psychopathological symptoms significantly varied during the pandemic. Children's Aggression scores decreased after the lockdown, while Depression scores significantly increased during lockdown and after. The mothers in the at- risk group presented overall decreasing scores over the three assessment points.Ã‚Â Children's Aggression scores did not increase during lockdown. Depression scores did not show significant changes over the three assessment points. Overall, our results showed that mothers' psychopathological risk did not influence specific areas of children's emotional/behavioral functioning, but it had an effect on the general offspring psychological well-being.","Cimino, Di Vito, Cerniglia","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03360-z","20220705","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33878,""
"Gloomy and out of control? Consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on momentary optimism in daily live of adolescents","In the global COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents are regarded as especially burdened due to school closures and leisure activities being banned, often reducing peer contacts to zero. Experiencing restrictions while being uninvolved in decision-making processes left them with little control over their daily lives. Meanwhile, research highlights that optimism can act as a buffer against the impact of daily hassles and is considered an important resource for mental health. To understand the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for adolescents' lives, this study examined how momentary perceived control and perceived personal and societal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic relate to momentary optimism. Using experience-sampling data from <i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°242 (<i>M</i> <sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.89; 86% female) adolescents assessed during the second pandemic wave in Germany, multilevel modeling revealed positive associations between adolescents' momentary perceived control and their momentary optimism at both the within- and between-person level. Additionally, perceived consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic showed specific associations with momentary optimism: Whereas perceived societal consequences were directly related to lower momentary optimism, perceived personal consequences strengthened the relationship between momentary perceived control and optimism. These findings highlight the role of perceived control as an important resource for optimism both as a general tendency and within specific situations in daily life. This way, our results may shed light on how to support adolescent optimism during states of emergency, such as a worldwide pandemic.

"[Alarming situation amongst mental health care employees; mental health issues with possible resignation as a consequence]","While the COVID-19 pandemic integrates more and more into daily life and hospitalizations decrease, the consequence for mental health care personnel is becoming clearer. 50% of the employees in mental health care institutes experience stress and 30% have signs of depression. Simultaneously more patients present themselves at the mental health care institutes with complaints as aÃ‚Â result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This increases workload even more while the waiting lists are already very long. To prevent sick leave and/or even resigning, social support in the working environment, prevention measures for mental complaints, and support have to be initiated by every level of the mental health care institutes.","van den Broek, van Dam, Bongers, Stikkelbroek, Bachrach, de Vroege","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12508-022-00353-y","20220705","COVID-19 pandemic; Employees; Mental health; Mental health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-07","",33880,""
