"Fear of COVID-19 infection and its relationship with health-related preventive practices among patients having chronic ailments","Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) is clinical threat to healthy individuals around the world. Risk of disease and related complications are high among immunocompromised individuals and those with pre-existing chronic diseases. Aim: To assess the fear of Covid-19 among patients having chronic diseases and to determine its relationship with preventive practices among them. Study Design: Cross-sectional study Place and Duration of Study: Department of Community Medicine, HITEC Hospital Taxila from 1st September2020 to 31st March 2021. Methodology: Three hundred and seventeen patients having chronic diseases were included. Fear of Covid-19 scale used to assess the fear level and questions related to preventive practices. Results: Fear of Covid-19 was high among females, hypertensive, diabetics and those having cardiovascular disease. Fear was found among 133 (42%) participants. Regarding Covid-19 preventive practices, 8(2.5%) had unsatisfactory, 115 (36.3%) had satisfactory and 194(61.2%) had good preventive practices. Covid precautions were significantly practiced among those having fear. Statistically significant positive correlation was found between mean Covid fear and practices scores (r=.30, p=.001) Conclusion: Fear of Covid is a recognized risk factor for anxiety and depression among people. However, fear is found to promote risk perception and health related preventive behaviors among chronic patients that can positively ensure safety, decrease the risk of infection and serious complications among chronic patients.","Ahmed, A.; Nisar, N.; Gul, A.; Javed, A.; Abbas, H.

"Lesson learnt during COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan","The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a major health crisis affecting the several nations. In particular, the high ratio of COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan is significantly deteriorating human mental as well as physical health. The huge mental and physical loss has taught several lessons, which have been retrieved from already existing literature. The latest researches were consulted to identify the challenges and solution to combat COVID-19. First of all, the pharmacy communities in Pakistan are not sufficient to handle the burden of COVID-19 due to economic issues. However, the Government should provide interest-free loans to students and researchers for conducting scholarly work for manufacturing advance medication to combat against COVID-19. Secondly, the drugs that have been used to control the spread of COVID-19, found to be associated with the development of a neuropsychiatric complication. Therefore, there is a dire need to develop more mental health services to control the medication side effects. Thirdly as the traditional mental health services are not sufficient to provide effective and advanced mental health services, therefore, transformative changes through community psychology are mandatory to implement. Lastly, as communicable disease limit the geographical access to avail mental health services. Therefore, the e-CBT approaches must be provided to mitigate the pre and post-pandemic effects. The findings of the study would provide the direction for preparing to combat communicable diseases in the future.","Rehman, S.","https://doi.org/10.36721/pjps.2021.34.5.Reg.1805-1808.1","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Pakistan Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences; 34(5):1805-1808, 2021.; Publication details: Pakistan Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences; 34(5):1805-1808, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21949,""

"Evaluating the Relationship Between Online Learning Environment and Medical Students' Wellbeing During COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been found to negatively affect medical students' wellbeing. This finding may be related to how medical education is being conducted at present, with online learning replacing face-to-face teaching in many countries. This cross-sectional study aims to assess how the online learning environment is connected to medical students' wellbeing. Methods: A self-administered online questionnaire was distributed to undergraduate medical students at Universitas Indonesia. The study was conducted from September 2020 to February 2021. The questionnaire included a modified version of the Online Learning Environment Scale (OLES) and the Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning and Accomplishment (PERMA) profiler. The OLES was used to evaluate students' perceptions of the online learning environment, whereas the PERMA Profiler was used to evaluate students' wellbeing. We validated the questionnaire before distribution. The content validity index was 1.0, with internal consistency coefficients of 0.87 and 0.89, respectively. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between OLES and PERMA scores. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 274 undergraduate medical students. Students reported moderate to high degrees of positive perception towards online learning, high levels of positive emotions and moderate levels of negative emotions. Statistically significant differences were found across groups based on students' gender, year of study and academic programme. Almost all aspects of the online learning environment were significantly predictive of students' wellbeing, with personal relevance and evaluation and assessment being the two most important predictors (R-2 = 0.201;P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Medical students generally enjoyed online learning, although some challenges were presented. The online learning environment was positively associated with students' wellbeing;however, some students expressed negative emotions including loneliness, anxiety, anger and sadness.","Mustika, R.; Yo, E.

"Smartphone addiction is associated with symptoms of anxiety, depression, stress, tension, confusion, and insomnia: A cross-sectional and comparative study with physically and non-physically active adults in self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction. During the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, social media exposure and the use of electronic devices have increased;still, these behaviors may cause adverse health effects. Objective. This study assessed sleep quality, insomnia, mood, and psychological aspects among physically (n = 46) and non-physically (n = 53) active individuals during self-isolation throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and ex-amined their association with smartphone addiction. Method. A cross-sectional study was conducted among adult Brazilian citizens in self-isolation for at least 60 days;ninety-nine volunteers from different Brazilian re-gions were enrolled in the online survey. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-Short Form, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Brunel Mood Scale, and the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version were used to assess the study outcomes. Results. The results indicate moderate and large correlations of smartphone addiction with mood subscales, insomnia (r = .52), anxiety (r = .49), depres-sion (r = .49), and stress (r = .49) symptoms. Also, it was observed that physically active participants were less addicted to smartphones than the non-physically active during self-isolation (p &lt; .01) and that the physically active ones had a better mood and lower anxiety (p = .02), depression (p &lt; .01) and insomnia (p &lt; .01) levels. Discussion and conclusion. These findings show the health implications of self-isolation and how essential it is to be physically active to avoid self-isolation & apos;s adverse psychological effects.","Solon, L. J.

"COVID-19 Pandemic and Conspiracy Beliefs: Psychological Antecedents, Consequences, Possibilities for Correction","The coronavirus pandemic is accompanied by the active introduction of conspiracy theories into the mass consciousness, that is, concepts that explain the causes and extent of the pandemic by the action of certain groups of people. The article discusses three main questions: what factors provoke the appearance of conspiracy beliefs in people;how these beliefs affect behavior related to the coronavirus pandemic;how to counter conspiracy theories. A person's acceptance of conspiracy beliefs related to COVID-19 is facilitated by a variety of socio-demographic and psychological factors: gender, age, educational level, financial situation, current psychological state of a person;one's stable individual psychological characteristics (personality traits, worldview beliefs, style of thinking, features of the cognitive sphere and attitudes);features of social identity. Conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 affect various behavioral responses associated with the pandemic: compliance with hygiene and social distancing norms, purchasing behavior, adherence to pseudoscientific practices for the prevention and treatment of coronavirus infection. The specificity of the influence of various types of conspiracy beliefs on people's behavior associated with the pandemic was found. Some types of conspiracy beliefs are more likely to inhibit the implementation of prevention recommendations than others. This indicates that conspiracy beliefs should not be viewed as a whole, but in a differentiated way. The influence of conspiracy beliefs on following ""anti-COVID"" recommendations is mediated by intermediate variables such as a subjective assessment of the danger of COVID-19, trust in science, and a sense of helplessness. Two main strategies for countering conspiracy theories have been identified: preventive, implemented before the appearance of conspiracy information, and reactive, carried out after information about such theories appears in the media and social networks. Various options for implementing a preventive strategy are considered: limiting the dissemination of information about COVID-19 conspiracy theories, preventive refutation of such theories, and the formation of skills in people to detect inaccurate information. The factors of the effectiveness of the reactive countermeasure strategy are considered: the type of tactics for refuting the conspiracy theory, characteristics of the source of inaccurate information about the theory, the structure of the refuting message, the frequency of repetition of inaccurate information and the time elapsed between its appearance and refutation, the degree and direction of the recipient's cognitive activity, their views and beliefs.","Myagkov, M.

"Facing the pandemic: Burnout in physicians in turkey","OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians have been working for long hours, with the fear of contracting the disease and infecting their families. Therefore, there are great concerns about the mental health of physicians. In this research, we aimed to reveal the factors that affect the burnout among physicians working during the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving physicians working during the pandemic in health institutions that admit COVID-19 patients. A questionnaire form consisting of the â€œSociodemographic Data Formâ€ and the â€œMaslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)â€ was used. The questionnaire was sent to the contact numbers of physicians via the internet. The target population was reached through the communication groups of the Turkish Thoracic Society and other professional associations, the communication groups of health institutions, and also through personal correspondence. Burnout was evaluated with the scores of each participant from the 3 subscales of Emotional Exhaustion (EE), Depersonalization (DP), and Lack of Accomplishment (LA). RESULTS: Of the 1177 physicians who participated in the survey, 893 answered the survey completely. Females comprised 56.70% (n = 506) of the respondents, and the mean age was 38.63 (Â±11.65). The residents (41%, n = 366) and specialists (31%, n = 277) made up the majority of the physicians. Eighty-six percent (n = 768) of the physicians had difficulty in obtaining personal protective equipment (PPE). It was determined that 81.7% (n = 730) of the 893 physicians were actively working in pandemic units (outpatient clinics, emergencies, inpatient clinics, intensive care units), and burnout was significantly higher in these physicians (P &lt; .01). After excluding other confounding factors by regression analysis, their Maslach total scores and EE scores were found to be significantly high (P = .001). CONCLUSION: Working in pandemic units and facing difficulty in accessing PPE are identified as the most important risk factors for burnout. Hence, we can say that working with PPE, and with the managersâ€™ discretion and support, the physiciansâ€™ burnout can be prevented.","Tarhan, S, Simsek, G. Ã–, Tecirli, N. D.; UÃ§an, E.

"Surviving Lockdown: Human Nature in Social Isolation","2020 has been the year of the virus, and it will not be a mere footnote in history. This book reflects on the unprecedented changes to our lives and the impact on our behaviour as we lived through social isolation during the global COVID-19 pandemic. From sociable creatures of habit, we were forced into a period of uncertainty, restriction and risk, physically separated from families and friends. Packed with guidance and coping strategies for lockdown, this book, authored by top psychologist David Cohen, explores the impact of this widespread quarantine on our relationships, our children, our mental health and our daily lives. Benedictine monks, hermit popes, Dorothy Sayers, Daniel Defoe (who made the isolated Robinson Crusoe a hero), Sigmund Freud and a rabbiâ€™s angry dog are all among the cast of characters as we are taken on a whistle-stop tour through plagues in history and brain science, to the importance of introspection and how to make meaning from lockdown. In his trademark entertaining style, Cohen examines the psychology behind our behaviour during this unusual time to discover what we can learn about human nature, what lessons we can learn for the future â€“ and whether we will apply them.

"The relationship between religious beliefs and coping with the stress of covid-19","Recently, we have faced the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the world, which has attracted the attention of all people. Stress has become a word familiar to all people. The stressors of life are relatively clear and some of them cannot be eliminated by humans. One of the stressors in the life of humans is the COVID-19 pandemic. Doctors believe that the virus is controllable but its prevalence is quicker and deadlier than other viruses. In addition, the virus puts the elderly and those with underlying diseases (e.g. pulmonary problems) at extreme risk. Therefore, more care is seriously required to protect members of society. However, this psychological imbalance caused by the virus is associated with stress and anxiety. Lack of proper management of this stress will be associated with emotional impacts (e.g. depression and anxiety), physiological impacts (e.g. gastrointestinal disorders and increased heart rate), cognitive impacts (e.g. reduced concentration and distraction) and behavioural impact (e.g. increased work and activity avoidance, and sleep disorders). Contribution: Given the importance of this topic, this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between religious beliefs and coping with COVID-19-related stress amongst Muslim students in three cities of Russia â€“ Ingushetia, Chechnya and the Republic of Dagestan â€“ in 2020. Data were collected using questionnaires, the validity and reliability of which were previously confirmed. According to the results, religious beliefs had an impact on stress coping by p = 0.657. In other words, studentsâ€™ ability to cope with stress improved by 0.657 units, with each unit of enhancement in their religious beliefs. Â© 2021, AOSIS (pty) Ltd.

"Social media in health promotion in the context of contact restriction in the Covid-19 pandemic","The objective is to analyze the contributions of social media, in the format of lives, in health promotion in the context of physical distancing in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This is an observational and bibliographic study of an exploratory analytical nature with a narrative approach, using data from streaming platforms and Google Trends from January to April 2020. Search for lives had a notable rise, especially between May and April, and these contribute for health promotion, mental health care, leisure, education, social relationships, entertainment, and emotional support as they articulate and permeate public policies associated with technologies. In addition, there is ample relevance regarding the social role they assume in encouraging donations. It is believed that these analyzes and information tend to cooperate with further investigations to better understand the contributions of digital technologies during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for people who have and/or are experiencing such experiences.","Alves, C.

"Prevalence and Factors Associated with Parentsâ€™ Non-Intention to Vaccinate Their Children and Adolescents against COVID-19 in Latin America and the Caribbean","We aimed to estimate the prevalence and factors associated with parentsâ€™ non-intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19 in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). We performed a secondary analysis using a database generated by the University of Maryland and Facebook (Facebook, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA). We included adult (18 and over) Facebook users residing in LAC who responded to the survey between 20 May 2021 and 14 July 2021. We included sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, mental health, economic and food insecurity, compliance with mitigation strategies against COVID-19, and practices related to vaccination against this disease. We estimated the crude (cPR) and adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios with their respective 95%CI. We analyzed a sample of 227,740 adults from 20 LAC countries. The prevalence of parentsâ€™ non-intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19 was 7.8% (n = 15,196). An age above 35 years old, educational level above college, compliance with physical distancing, use of masks, having economic insecurity, having had COVID-19, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, having a chronic condition or two or more comorbidities, and being vaccinated were associated with a lower prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate children and adolescents against COVID-19. Living in a town, a village, or a rural area was associated with a higher prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate children and adolescents against COVID-19. Approximately nine out of ten parents in LAC intended to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19. Our results allow for understanding parentsâ€™ intentions to vaccinate children and adolescents and help promote and develop education strategies for national vaccination plans against COVID-19.","Urrunaga-Pastor, Diego, Herrera-AÃ±azco, Percy, Uyen-Cateriano, Angela, Toro-Huamanchumo, Carlos J.; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J.; Hernandez, Adrian V.; Benites-Zapata, Vicente A.; Bendezu-Quispe, Guido","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9111303","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Vaccines; 9(11):1303, 2021.; Publication details: Vaccines; 9(11):1303, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21964,""
"The COVID-19 Pandemic: Female Workersâ€™ Social Sustainability in Global Supply Chains","This review article investigates the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on female workers in the global supply chain context. To this end, we reviewed and critically examined emerging scholarly literature as well as policy documents and reports published by international development organizations concerning female workersâ€™ social sustainability, livelihood, and health and wellbeing issues in global supply chain operations. Thus, this article focuses on female workersâ€™ issues in emerging and developing economies where the ongoing pandemic continues to devastate and create multidimensional social and economic challenges for the wellbeing and social sustainability of female workers. Our analysis suggests that female workers are facing serious socioeconomic challenges that continue to affect their wellbeing, mental health, and livelihoods. Accordingly, it is imperative that international development organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), trade associations, governments, and most importantly the corporate sector not only consider individual responsibility for promoting female workforce social sustainability in global supply chains but also actively collaborate to address pressing social sustainability issues vis Ã  vis female workers. Building on these findings, the implications for future research, practice, and policies are discussed.","Sajjad, Aymen, Eweje, Gabriel","https://doi.org/10.3390/su132212565","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(22):12565, 2021.; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(22):12565, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21965,""
"Connection to Nature Boosts Adolescentsâ€™ Mental Well-Being during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Growing evidence suggests that connection to nature may be linked to mental health and well-being. Behavioral changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect adolescentsâ€™ connection to nature, subsequently impacting health and well-being. We explored the relationship between connection to nature and well-being before and during the pandemic through a nationally representative survey of adolescents across the United States (n = 624) between April and June 2020. Survey items focused on connection to nature, mental well-being, and participation in outdoor activities before and during the pandemic. Paired-sample t-tests revealed declines in connection to nature, mental well-being, and participation in outdoor activities during the pandemic. Multiple linear regression analyses examining connection to natureâ€™s mediating role between outdoor activity participation and mental well-being indicated that connection to nature fueled higher levels of mental well-being at both time intervals. Z scores comparing connection to natureâ€™s mediating role between outdoor activity participation and mental well-being between time intervals indicate that during the pandemic, the direct effect of outdoor activities on mental well-being increased, generating a greater impact than before the pandemic. This study illustrates how the health and well-being benefits associated with adolescentsâ€™ outdoor activities are reinforced when those activities also foster a stronger connection to nature.","Jackson, S.

"Who Believes in Conspiracy Theories about the COVID-19 Pandemic in Romania? An Analysis of Conspiracy Theories Believersâ€™ Profiles","The current COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by the circulation of an unprecedented amount of â€œpollutedâ€ information, especially in the social media environment, among which are false narratives and conspiracy theories about both the pandemic and vaccination against COVID-19. The effects of such questionable information primarily concern the lack of compliance with restrictive measures and a negative attitude towards vaccination campaigns, as well as more complex social effects, such as street protests or distrust in governments and authorities in general. Even though there is a lot of scholarly attention given to these narratives in many countries, research about the profile of people who are more prone to believe or spread them is rather scarce. In this context, we investigate the role of age, compared with other socio-demographic factors (such as education and religiosity), as well as the role of the media (the frequency of news consumption, the perceived usefulness of social media, and the perceived incidence of fake information about the virus in the media) and the critical thinking disposition of people who tend to believe such misleading narratives. To address these issues, we conducted a national survey (N = 945) in April 2021 in Romania. Using a hierarchical OLS regression model, we found that people who perceive higher incidence of fake news (ÃŸ = 0.33, p &lt; 0.001), find social media platforms more useful (ÃŸ = 0.13, p &lt; 0.001), have lower education (ÃŸ = -0.17, p &lt; 0.001), and have higher levels of religiosity (ÃŸ = 0.08, p &lt; 0.05) are more prone to believe COVID-19-related misleading narratives. At the same time, the frequency of news consumption (regardless of the type of media), critical thinking disposition, and age do not play a significant role in the profile of the believer in conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic. Somewhat surprisingly, age does not play a role in predicting belief in conspiracy theories, even though there are studies that suggest that older people are more prone to believe conspiracy narratives. As far as media is concerned, the frequency of news media consumption does not significantly differ for believers and non-believers. We discuss these results within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Buturoiu, Raluca, Udrea, Georgiana, Oprea, Denisa-Adriana, Corbu, Nicoleta","https://doi.org/10.3390/soc11040138","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Societies; 11(4):138, 2021.; Publication details: Societies; 11(4):138, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21967,""
"Delirium and Cognitive Impairment as Predisposing Factors of COVID-19 Infection in Neuropsychiatric Patients: A Narrative Review","SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasive and neurotropic abilities may underlie delirium onset and neuropsychiatric outcomes. Only a limited number of studies have addressed the potential effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mental health so far. Most studies mainly reported the acute onset of mixed neuropsychiatric conditions in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, characterized by agitated behavior, altered level of consciousness, and disorganized thinking, regardless of psychological or socioeconomic triggering factors. The present narrative review aims to analyze and discuss the mechanisms underlying the neuroinvasive/neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent mental complications. Delirium appeared as a clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 brain infection in some patients, without systemic or multiple organ failure symptoms. A small number of studies demonstrated that neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with COVID-19, initially presenting as a confused state, may subsequently evolve in a way that is consistent with the patientsâ€™ neuropsychiatric history. A literature analysis on this topic prevalently showed case reports and case series of patients presenting delirium or delirium-like symptoms as the main outburst of COVID-19, plus a cognitive impairment, from mild to severe, which pre-existed or was demonstrated during the acute phase or after infection. Dementia appeared as one of the most frequent predisposing factors to SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated with delirium. Instead, contrasting data emerged on the potential link between COVID-19 and delirium in patients with cognitive impairment and without a neuropsychiatric history. Therefore, clinicians should contemplate the possibility that COVID-19 appears as delirium followed by a psychiatric exacerbation, even without other systemic symptoms. In addition, cognitive impairment might act as a predisposing factor for COVID-19 in patients with delirium.","Fabrazzo, Michele, Russo, Antonio, Camerlengo, Alessio, Tucci, Claudia, Luciano, Mario, De Santis, Valeria, Perris, Francesco, Catapano, Francesco, Coppola, Nicola","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57111244","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Medicina; 57(11):1244, 2021.; Publication details: Medicina; 57(11):1244, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21968,""
"Sleep Dysfunction in COVID-19 Patients: Prevalence, Risk Factors, Mechanisms, and Management","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to establish the prevalence of sleep dysfunction and psychological distress, identify predisposing and protective factors, and explore effective management strategies remains an important priority. Evidence to date suggests that a considerable proportion of COVID-19 patients experience significant sleep disturbances (estimated to afflict up to 50â€“75%) as well as psychological distress such as depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress. Duration of hospitalization, pre-existing mental health concerns, lower absolute lymphocyte count, and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio have been all associated with a greater risk of sleep dysfunction in infected and hospitalized patients. Furthermore, in this review, we discuss the link between sleep deprivation, susceptibility to viral infections, and psychosocial wellbeing in relevance to COVID-19 and summarize the existing evidence regarding the presence and role of sleep apnea in infected individuals. Finally, we highlight the importance of suitable interventions in order to prevent and manage sleep dysfunction and avoid long-term physical and psychological implications. Future research should aim to provide high-quality information including in high risk, underserved, or difficult to reach populations and on the long-term consequences and effectiveness of applied interventions.","Pataka, Athanasia, Kotoulas, Seraphim, Sakka, Elpitha, Katsaounou, Paraskevi, Pappa, Sofia","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11111203","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Journal of Personalized Medicine; 11(11):1203, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Personalized Medicine; 11(11):1203, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21969,""
"Association between Vitamin D Supplementation and Mental Health in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review","Vitamin D is considered to be a crucial factor that influences symptoms of depression, negative emotions, and quality of life, but to date, no systematic review has been conducted with regard to its effect on other domains of mental health. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of vitamin D supplementation on mental health in healthy adults. The systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020155779) and performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. The literature search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science databases and included intervention studies published until October 2019. The human studies were included if the supplementation regimen involved the administration of a specified dosage of vitamin D to an adult sample. A total of 7613 records were screened and assessed independently by two researchers, based on their title, abstract, and full text sequentially. Finally, 14 studies were included, and their risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastleâ€“Ottawa Scale (NOS). The studies were included if they presented the results of various doses of vitamin D, compared the supplementation results with the placebo effect, compared the outcome with no supplementation, or observed effect of specific dose applied. The assessed mental health outcomes mainly included depressive symptoms, or depression, well-being, quality of life, mood, general mental component, and anxiety, but single studies also included other parameters such as distress, impression of improvement, and fear of falling and flourishing. The results of the majority of studies did not confirm a positive influence of vitamin D supplementation. None of the high-quality studies (assessed using NOS), which evaluated outcomes other than depression, supported the hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation effectively ameliorates mental health issues, while they present conflicting evidence for depression. Some studies indicated that supplementation should be combined with physical activity to provide effective results, and that supplementation is less effective than vitamin D supply from food sources. The included studies were conducted in diverse populations and followed various doses and intervals of administration, so the results may be incomparable, which should be considered as a limitation. The conducted systematic review did not provide strong evidence for a positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on mental health in healthy adults.","Guzek, Dominika, Kolota, Aleksandra, Lachowicz, Katarzyna, Skolmowska, Dominika, Stachon, Malgorzata, Glabska, Dominika","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10215156","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(21):5156, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(21):5156, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21970,""
"Tryptophan: A Unique Role in the Critically Ill","Tryptophan is an essential amino acid whose metabolites play key roles in diverse physiological processes. Due to low reserves in the body, especially under various catabolic conditions, tryptophan deficiency manifests itself rapidly, and both the serotonin and kynurenine pathways of metabolism are clinically significant in critically ill patients. In this review, we highlight these pathways as sources of serotonin and melatonin, which then regulate neurotransmission, influence circadian rhythm, cognitive functions, and the development of delirium. Kynurenines serve important signaling functions in inter-organ communication and modulate endogenous inflammation. Increased plasma kynurenine levels and kynurenine-tryptophan ratios are early indicators for the development of sepsis. They also influence the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and thereby the development of polyneuromyopathy in critically ill patients. The modulation of tryptophan metabolism could help prevent and treat age-related disease with low grade chronic inflammation as well as post intensive care syndrome in all its varied manifestations: cognitive decline (including delirium or dementia), physical impairment (catabolism, protein breakdown, loss of muscle mass and tone), and mental impairment (depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder).","Kanova, Marcela, Kohout, Pavel","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms222111714","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Molecular Sciences; 22(21):11714, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Molecular Sciences; 22(21):11714, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21971,""
"Anxiety and Depression during COVID-19 in Elite Rugby Players: The Role of Mindfulness Skills","The COVID-19 pandemic created stressors that raised the likelihood of elite athletes experiencing mental health problems. Understanding how individual traits promote resilience is key to offering treatments specific to this population. This prospective study explores the relationship between mindfulness skills, resilience, and athletic identity on anxiety and depression. The initial assessment was during the first UK lockdown Aprilâ€“May 2020 (T1), and the second during the return to competition July-August 2020 (T2). The sample was 160 elite rugby players. Measures included: Personal Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Disorder-7, Cognitive Affective Mindfulness Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and Athletic Identity Measurement. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was profiled with descriptive statistics, and relationships between variables with bi-variate correlations and forward stepwise regression modelling. Depression decreased significantly between lock down (T1) and return to competition (T2) (MT1 = 4.20, MT2 = 3.24, p &lt; 0.01), with no significant change in anxiety. Significant correlations were found between mindfulness, resilience, and anxiety and depression (=0.001). Regression showed that mindfulness (T1) predicted lower anxiety and depression during the return to competition (T2) after controlling for baseline mental health symptoms. Returning to competition after lockdown was associated with a reduction in depression but not anxiety. Mindfulness skills potentially confer protection against anxiety and depression.","Myall, Kearnan, Montero-Marin, Jesus, Kuyken, Willem","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182211940","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):11940, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):11940, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21972,""
"Changes in Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour in Cardiovascular Disease Patients during the COVID-19 Lockdown","The COVID-19 lockdown has been associated with physical inactivity. We prospectively evaluated changes in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time (ST) among 1565 cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients using validated questionnaires at 5 weeks after lockdown initiation (i.e., baseline, April 2020) and at every 4 subsequent weeks, until July 2020. Multivariate mixed model analyses were performed to identify whether age, sex, CVD-subtype, lockdown adherence and mental health factors impacted changes in physical (in)activity. Patients were 67 (interquartile range: 60â€“73) years and primarily diagnosed with coronary artery disease. Time spent in MVPA was 143 min/day (95% confidence interval (CI) 137;148) at baseline. Female sex, heart-failure, fear of COVID-19 infection and limited possibilities for physical activity were independently associated with lower levels of MVPA across time. After adjusting for confounders, overall MVPA did not change. ST was 567 (95% CI 555;578) min/day at baseline. Lack of social contact, limited possibilities for physical activity and younger age were independently associated with higher levels of ST. After adjusting for confounders, ST progressively increased following 8 (<U+0394>+19.7 (95% CI 0.4;39.0)) and 12 weeks (<U+0394>+25.2 (95% CI 5.4;47.1) min/day) of lockdown. Despite a phased relaxation of the lockdown, CVD patients progressively increased ST and reported no change in MVPA. This highlights the need to target physical inactivity during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","van Bakel, Bram M.A.; Bakker, EsmÃ©e A.; de Vries, Femke, Thijssen, Dick H.J.; Eijsvogels, Thijs M.H.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182211929","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):11929, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):11929, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21973,""
"Lifestyle Modification Program on a Metabolically Healthy Elderly Population with Overweight/Obesity, Young-Old vs Old-Old CONSEQUENCES of COVID-19 Lockdown in This Program","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to lockdowns, which affected the elderly, a high-risk group. Lockdown may lead to weight gain due to increased food intake and reduced physical activity (PA). Our study aimed to analyze the impact of a 12-month lifestyle intervention on a metabolically healthy overweight/obese elderly (MHOe) population and how the lockdown by COVID-19 affected this program. Methods: MHOe participants (65â€“87 years) were recruited to participate in a lifestyle modification intervention based on the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and regular PA. Participants were classified into two groups: young-old (&lt;75 years) or old-old (=75 years). Anthropometric and clinical characteristics, energy intake, and energy expenditure were analyzed at baseline and after 12 months of intervention. Results: The final sample included 158 MHOe participants of both sexes (age: 72.21 Â± 5.04 years, BMI: 31.56 Â± 3.82 kg/m2): 109 young-old (age: 69.26 Â± 2.83 years, BMI: 32.0 Â± 3.85 kg/m2) and 49 old-old (age: 78.06 Â± 2.88 years, BMI: 30.67 Â± 3.64 kg/m2). After 12 months of intervention and despite lockdown, the young-old group increased MedDiet adherence (+1 point), but both groups drastically decreased daily PA, especially old-old participants. Fat mass significantly declined in the total population and the young-old. Depression significantly increased (26.9% vs. 21.0%, p &lt; 0.0001), especially in the old-old (36.7% vs. 22.0%, p &lt; 0.0001). No significant changes were found in the glycemic or lipid profile. Conclusions: This study indicates that ongoing MedDiet intake and regular PA can be considered preventative treatment for metabolic diseases in MHOe subjects.

"The Role of Animal Ownership for People with Severe Mental Illness during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mixed-Method Study Investigating Links with Health and Loneliness","Research has reported the benefits of companion animals for people with severe mental illness (SMI). However, this evidence base is fragmented and unclear. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity to explore the role of companion animals in the context of social distancing and isolation measures for people with SMI. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the links between mental and physical health and animal ownership in people with SMI and to explore animal ownersâ€™ perceptions related to humanâ€“animal interactions during the pandemic restrictions. A survey was conducted with a previously assembled cohort of individuals with SMI in the UK. The survey included previously validated and new bespoke items measuring demographics, and outcomes related to mental and physical health, and humanâ€“animal interactions. The survey also included a question inviting free-text responses, allowing participants to describe any experiences of their humanâ€“animal relationships during the pandemic. Of 315 participants who consented to participate, 249 (79%) completed the survey. Of these, 115 (46.2%) had at least one companion animal. Regression analyses indicated that animal ownership was not significantly associated with well-being and loneliness. However, animal ownership was associated with a self-reported decline in mental health (b = 0.640, 95% CI [0.102â€“1.231], p = 0.025), but no self-reported change in physical health. Thematic analysis identified two main themes relating to the positive and negative impact of animal ownership during pandemic restrictions. Animal ownership appeared to be linked to self-reported mental health decline in people with SMI during the second wave of the pandemic in the UK. However, the thematic analysis also highlighted the perceived benefit of animal ownership during this time. Further targeted investigation of the role of humanâ€“animal relationships and the perceived humanâ€“animal bond for human health is warranted.","Shoesmith, Emily, Spanakis, Panagiotis, Peckham, Emily, Heron, Paul, Johnston, Gordon, Walker, Lauren, Crosland, Suzanne, Ratschen, Elena","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182211908","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):11908, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):11908, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21975,""
"Efficiency of an Online Health-Promotion Program in Individuals with At-Risk Mental State during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Mental health issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic greatly impact peopleâ€™s daily lives. Individuals with an at-risk mental state are more vulnerable to mental health issues, and these may lead to onset of full psychotic illnesses.

Via social media, the online counseling program released one topic of material (about 15â€“20 min) every two weeks and provided interactive counseling for specific personal health needs on the platform. Study questionnaires, physiological examination, and blood serum examination were completed at both pre- and post-tests. The participants showed significant improvements in mental risk, anxiety, and physical activity after participating in the program. Furthermore, those who did not complete the program had significantly more severe negative symptoms. These results imply that the online health-promotion program is effective and accessible under certain barriers such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but not for individuals with higher risk of more negative mental health symptoms.","Tsai, Ching-Lun, Tu, Cheng-Hao, Chen, Jui-Cheng, Lane, Hsien-Yuan, Ma, Wei-Fen","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182211875","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):11875, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):11875, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21976,""
"The Relationship between Internet Addiction, Internet Gaming and Anxiety among Medical Students in a Malaysian Public University during COVID-19 Pandemic","The internet has become an important medium for learning and communication during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for university students. Nevertheless, an increase in internet usage could predispose people to internet addiction (IA) and internet gaming (IG). Equally, there is concern that anxiety levels have increased during the pandemic. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of IA and IG, and their associations with anxiety among medical students during the pandemic. Data were collected during the second wave of the â€œConditional Movement Control Orderâ€ (CMCO) in Malaysia between 12 November and 10 December 2020. A total of 237 students participated through proportionate stratified random sampling in this cross-sectional study. They completed a set of online questionnaires which consisted of a sociodemographic profile, the Malay version of the internet addiction test (MVIAT), the Malay version of the internet gaming disorder-short form (IGDS9-SF) and the Malay version of the depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21). The prevalence of IA and internet gaming disorder (IGD) were 83.5% and 2.5%, respectively. A multiple logistic regression showed that those in pre-clinical years had a greater risk of anxiety than those in clinical years [(AOR) = 2.49, p-value 0.01, 95% CI = 1.22â€“5.07]. In contrast, those who scored high on IA were protected against anxiety [AOR = 0.100, p-value 0.03, 95% CI = 0.01â€“0.76)]. In conclusion, IA was highly prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic and its high usage might serve as a protective factor against anxiety among the medical students in this study sample.","Ismail, Nurazah, Tajjudin, Ahmad Izzat, Jaafar, Hafiz, Nik Jaafar, Nik Ruzyanei, Baharudin, Azlin, Ibrahim, Normala","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182211870","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):11870, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):11870, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21977,""
"Factors Associated with Depression and Anxiety in Adults =60 Years Old during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review","COVID-19 represents a threat to public health and the mental health of the aged population. Prevalence and risk factors of depression and anxiety have been reported in previous reviews in other populations;however, a systematic review on the factors associated with depression and anxiety in older adults is not currently present in the literature. We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, ProQuest Psychology Database, Science Direct, Cochrane Library and SciELO databases (23 February 2021). The results were obtained by entering a combination of MeSH or Emtree terms with keywords related to COVID-19, elderly, depression and anxiety in the databases. A total of 11 studies were included in the systematic review. Female gender, loneliness, poor sleep quality and poor motor function were identified as factors associated with both depression and anxiety. Aspects related to having a stable and high monthly income represent protective factors for both depression and anxiety, and exercising was described as protective for depression. This study synthesised information and analysed the main factors associated with depression and anxiety in the older population during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Psychological Distress in Healthcare Workers between the First and Second COVID-19 Waves: The Role of Personality Traits, Attachment Style, and Metacognitive Functioning as Protective and Vulnerability Factors","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) since its outbreak, but little attention has been paid to person-level vulnerability and protective factors. This study aims to determine the prevalence of both general and pandemic-related psychological distress among HCWs between the first and second COVID-19 waves in Italy and analyze associations between psychological distress and personality traits, attachment style, and metacognitive functioning. Between June and October 2020, 235 Italian HCWs completed questionnaires concerning psychological stress, personality traits, attachment style, and metacognitive functioning;26.5% of respondents presented with moderate to extremely severe levels of general psychological distress and 13.8% with moderate to extremely severe levels of pandemic-related psychological distress. After controlling for demographic and occupational variables, significant associations emerged among high emotional stability as a personality trait and both general (aOR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.41â€“0.79) and pandemic-related psychological stress (aOR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.41â€“0.90). Additionally, higher scores regarding oneâ€™s ability to understand othersâ€™ emotional states were associated with lower odds of developing psychological distress (aOR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.63â€“0.93). Lastly, when comparing those with fearful attachment styles to those with secure attachments, the aOR for psychological distress was 4.73 (95% CI: 1.45â€“17.04). These results highlight the importance of conducting baseline assessments of HCWsâ€™ person-level factors and providing regular screenings of psychological distress.","Cena, Loredana, Rota, Matteo, Calza, Stefano, Janos, Jessica, Trainini, Alice, Stefana, Alberto","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182211843","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):11843, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):11843, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21979,""
"Universal Screening in Positive School Mental Health Using the ASEBA Methodology for Teachers: A Pilot Epidemiological Study","School-based detection and intervention are critical components in ensuring positive mental health in children, with teachers playing an essential role in assessing studentsâ€™ well-being. The current research aims to be a pilot epidemiological study on positive school mental health in Malaga, Spain, using the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA). Data were collected in the COVID-19 pre-pandemic setting, using the Caregiver-Teacher Report Form (C-TRF) and the Teacher Report Form (TRF) in a sample of 420 children, who were between 5 and 8 years old at the time of the data collection. In 5-year-old children, the DSM-oriented scale with the highest clinical prevalence corresponds to attention deficit and hyperactivity problems (1.13%). In this same sub-sample, clinical levels of externalizing problems (4.52%) were non-significantly more common than internalizing conditions (1.69%). As for children between 6 and 8 years old, the DSM-oriented scale with the highest prevalence of clinical scores corresponds to anxiety problems (4.12%) and conduct problems (2.88%). Clinical levels of externalizing problems (9.47%) were non-significantly more prevalent than internalizing problems (6.58%).

"â€˜Itâ€™s Easily the Lowest Iâ€™ve Ever, Ever Got toâ€™: A Qualitative Study of Young Adultsâ€™ Social Isolation during the COVID-19 Lockdowns in the UK","(1) Background: Social connectivity is key to young peopleâ€™s mental health. Local assets facilitate social connection, but were largely inaccessible during the pandemic. This study consequently investigates the social isolation of young adults and their use of local assets during the COVID-19 lockdowns in the UK. (2) Methods: Fifteen semi-structured Zoom interviews were undertaken with adults aged 18â€“24 in the UK. Recruitment took place remotely, and transcripts were coded and analysed thematically. (3) Results: Digital assets were key to young peopleâ€™s social connectivity, but their use was associated with stress, increased screen time and negative mental health outcomes. The lockdowns impacted social capital, with young peopleâ€™s key peripheral networks being lost, yet close friendships being strengthened. Finally, young peopleâ€™s mental health was greatly affected by the isolation, but few sought help, mostly out of a desire to not overburden the NHS. (4) Conclusions: This study highlights the extent of the impact of the pandemic isolation on young peopleâ€™s social capital and mental health. Post-pandemic strategies targeting mental health system strengthening, social isolation and help-seeking behaviours are recommended.","Dedryver, Chloe C.; Knai, CÃ©cile","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182211777","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):11777, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):11777, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21981,""
"A Comprehensive Assessment of Informal Caregivers of Patients in a Primary Healthcare Home-Care Program","Studies of the characteristics of informal caregivers and associated factors have focused on care-receiver disease or caregiver social and psychological traits;however, an integral description may provide better understanding of informal caregiversâ€™ problems. A multicenter cross-sectional study in primary healthcare centers was performed in Barcelona (Spain). Participants were a random sample of informal caregivers of patients in a home-care program. Primary outcomes were health-related quality of life and caregiver burden, and related factors were sociodemographic data, clinical and risk factors, social support and social characteristics, use of healthcare services, and care receiversâ€™ status. In total, 104 informal caregivers were included (mean age 68.25 years);81.73% were female, 54.81% were retired, 58.65% had high comorbidity, and 48.08% of care receivers had severe dependence. Adjusted multivariate regression models showed health-related quality of life and the caregiversâ€™ burden were affected by comorbidity, age, time of care, and dependency of care receiver, while social support and depression also showed relative importance. Aging, chronic diseases, and comorbidity should be included when explaining informal caregiversâ€™ health status and wellbeing. The effectiveness of interventions to support informal caregivers should comprehensively evaluate caregivers when designing programs, centering interventions on informal caregivers and not care receiversâ€™ conditions.","Rodrigo-BaÃ±os, Virginia, Marta del, Moral-Pairada, GonzÃ¡lez-de Paz, Luis","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111588","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11588, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11588, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21982,""
"Occupational Self-Efficacy as a Mediator in the Reciprocal Relationship between Job Demands and Mental Health Complaints: A Three-Wave Investigation","The most recent version of the job demands-resources (JDâ€“R) theory proposes that demanding working conditions and employee strain form a self-perpetuating loss cycle. By acknowledging that such cycles are detrimental for both employees and organizations, the present study aimed to contribute to enhancing the current scarce understanding regarding their explanatory mechanisms. For this purpose, it applied social cognitive theory to propose that occupational self-efficacy mediates the effects of two role stressors (i.e., role ambiguity and role conflict) on employee mental health complaints and vice versa. The hypothesized reciprocal mediation effects were tested using a three-wave full panel research design and a dataset of 917 (NT1 = 513, NT1+T2 = 122, NT1+T3 = 70, NT1+T2+T3 = 212) Croatian employees working in heterogeneous private sector industries. The results demonstrated that role conflict, but not role ambiguity, undermined employeesâ€™ beliefs in their capabilities to successfully master their jobs which, in turn, led them to experience more mental health complaints over time. Contrary to expectations, poor mental health did not lead to diminished efficacy beliefs nor, in turn, more job demands over time. Overall, the results of this study demonstrated an additional mechanism in the job demands-strain relationship and, at the same time, shed new light on the role of personal resources within the JDâ€“R theory. Accounting for the malleable nature of employee efficacy beliefs, the study proposes several ways in which organizations can enhance occupational self-efficacy and thereby curb the causal chain linking job demands and employee strain reactions.","Tomas, Jasmina","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111532","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11532, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11532, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21983,""
"The Wildman Programmeâ€”Rehabilitation and Reconnection with Nature for Men with Mental or Physical Health Problemsâ€”A Matched-Control Study","Men with health problems refuse to participate in rehabilitation programmes and drop out of healthcare offerings more often than women. Therefore, a nature-based rehabilitation programme was tailored specific to men with mental health problems, and long-term illnesses. The rehabilitation programme combines the use of nature, body, mind, and community spirit (NBMC) and is called the â€˜Wildman Programmeâ€™. The presented study was designed as a matched-control study with an intervention group participating in the Wildman Programme (N = 114) compared to a control group receiving treatment as usual (N = 39). Outcomes were measured at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and 6 months post-intervention (T3). The primary outcome was the participantsâ€™ quality of life measured by WHOQOL-BREF, which consists of four domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. The secondary outcomes were the level of stress measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the participantsâ€™ emotional experience in relation to nature, measured by the Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS). The intervention group improved significantly in the physical and psychological WHOQOL-BREF domains and in PSS at both follow-ups. The participantsâ€™ interest in using nature for restoration increased significantly as well. The only detectable difference between the control group and the intervention group was in the WHOQOL-BREF physical domain at the 6-month follow-up. For further studies, we recommend testing the effect of the Wildman Programme in an RCT study.","HÃ¸egmark, Simon, Andersen, Tonny Elmose, Grahn, Patrik, Mejldal, Anna, Roessler, Kirsten K.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111465","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11465, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11465, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21984,""
"Towards an Ideology-Free, Truly Mechanistic Health Psychology","Efficient transfer of concepts and mechanistic insights from the cognitive to the health sciences and back requires a clear, objective description of the problem that this transfer ought to solve. Unfortunately, however, the actual descriptions are commonly penetrated with, and sometimes even motivated by, cultural norms and preferences, a problem that has colored scientific theorizing about behavioral controlâ€”the key concept for many psychological health interventions. We argue that ideologies have clouded our scientific thinking about mental health in two ways: by considering the societal utility of individuals and their behavior a key criterion for distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy people, and by dividing what actually seem to be continuous functions relating psychological and neurocognitive underpinnings to human behavior into binary, discrete categories that are then taken to define clinical phenomena. We suggest letting both traditions go and establish a health psychology that restrains from imposing societal values onto individuals, and then taking the fit between behavior and values to conceptualize unhealthiness. Instead, we promote a health psychology that reconstructs behavior that is considered to be problematic from well-understood mechanistic underpinnings of human behavior.","Hommel, Bernhard, Beste, Christian","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111126","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11126, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(21):11126, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21985,""
"Does Emotional Intelligence Increase Satisfaction with Life during COVID-19? The Mediating Role of Depression","COVID-19 has spread rapidly and become a health crisis around the world, and negatively affected the mental state of individuals. Emotional intelligence (EI) can play an important role in coping with the mental problems experienced due to the pandemic. This study examined how individualsâ€™ emotional intelligence levels affect depression and satisfaction with life during the COVID-19 period. The study was designed as quantitative and cross-sectional and reached 578 adult participants online. Emotional intelligence trait scaleâ€“short form, depression subscale (DASS-21), satisfaction with life scale, and sociodemographic questions as control variables were used as data collection tools in the study. The data obtained were conducted using SPSS 24, PROCESS-Macro, and Amos 25 statistical programs. The hypotheses established were tested by correlation, multiple regression, mediating, and moderating analyzes. Results confirmed that emotional intelligence had a positive association with satisfaction with life and a negative association with depression. In addition, interaction analyses found that age and family type had a moderating effect on satisfaction with life, and depression had a mediating effect. After discussing the importance of emotional intelligence as a coping mechanism in dealing with problems, some suggestions were made to policymakers and practitioners.","KoÃ§ak, Orhan","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9111529","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1529, 2021.; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1529, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21986,""
"Association between Psychological Stress and Neck Pain among College Students during the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 Pandemic: A Questionnaire-Based Cross-Sectional Study","The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) greatly affected peopleâ€™s lifestyles. We used an online, cross-sectional survey during a COVID-19-related lockdown in Israel, with the aim of investigating the effects of such lockdowns on studentsâ€™ self-perceived stress and neck pain (NP). College students (N = 295) completed questions on sociodemographic characteristics, the Neck Disability Index (NDI), the Perceived Stress Scale, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and NP frequency (four-point scale). Logistic regression models were calculated with the NDI as the dependent variable. In total, 35.6% of students experienced at least moderate NP-related disability (NDI = 15), more during than before the lockdown. NP increased gradually, from a lifetime mean of 1.80 to a lockdown mean of 3.07 (<U+03C7>2 = 316.72;p &lt; 0.001). Studentsâ€™ self-perceived stress was moderate, and 59.3% reported experiencing study-related stress. Higher levels of self-perceived stress, study-related stress, sitting &gt;3 h/day, and a higher VAS score were associated with a higher risk of an NDI = 15 (Nagelkerkeâ€™s R2 = 0.513, p &lt; 0.001).

"Associations between Physical Activity and Mental Health in Iranian Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Accelerometer-Based Study","Using self-reported questionnaires, several studies found that social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the level of physical activity (PA) in children and adolescents. Since the objectivity of self-reported PA is limited in several ways, we used modern accelerometers in this study to assess the PA levels of male and female adolescents during the pandemic-related lockdown. Moreover, the association of PA with mental health of the adolescents were analyzed. A total of 136 students (76 girls, mean age of 16.28 Â± 0.97 years) from various schools in Iran wore the accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X-BT) for seven consecutive days. Mental health was measured through the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 of Lovibond and Lovibond (1995). Descriptive statistics and independent t-tests were used to analyze the PA levels of male and female students, and linear regressions were computed to examine whether PA predicts mental health status. On average, the daily time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was 18.47 min, which is clearly below the WHO guideline of at least 60 min of MVPA per day. Only 4% of adolescents showed MVPA for more than 30 min per day. Male students were significantly more active than their female peers (p = 0.015). As expected, MVPA was negatively associated with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress. However, the majority of adolescents reported symptoms of mild-to-moderate mental health disorders. These results emphasize the need for targeted strategies and offerings geared to young peopleâ€™s needs and preferences to promote an adequate level of PA and good mental health during and after the ongoing pandemic.","Ghorbani, Saeed, Afshari, Mostafa, Eckelt, Melanie, Dana, Amir, Bund, Andreas","https://doi.org/10.3390/children8111022","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Children; 8(11):1022, 2021.; Publication details: Children; 8(11):1022, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21988,""

"Objective Knowledge Mediates the Relationship between the Use of Social Media and COVID-19-Related False Memories","The exposure to relevant social and/or historical events can increase the generation of false memories (FMs). The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a calamity challenging health, political, and journalistic bodies, with media generating confusion that has facilitated the spread of fake news. In this respect, our study aims at investigating the relationships between memories (true memories, TMs vs. FMs) for COVID-19-related news and different individual variables (i.e., use of traditional and social media, COVID-19 perceived and objective knowledge, fear of the disease, depression and anxiety symptoms, reasoning skills, and coping mechanisms). One hundred and seventy-one university students (131 females) were surveyed. Overall, our results suggested that depression and anxiety symptoms, reasoning skills, and coping mechanisms did not affect the formation of FMs. Conversely, the fear of loved ones contracting the infection was found to be negatively associated with FMs. This finding might be due to an empathy/prosociality-based positive bias boosting memory abilities, also explained by the young age of participants. Furthermore, objective knowledge (i) predicted an increase in TMs and decrease in FMs and (ii) significantly mediated the relationships between the use of social media and development of both TMs and FMs. In particular, higher levels of objective knowledge strengthened the formation of TMs and decreased the development of FMs following use of social media. These results may lead to reconsidering the idea of social media as the main source of fake news.

"Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis of Arabic COVID-19 Tweets Using BERT-Based Transformers and Dynamically Weighted Loss Function","The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected almost all of the countries of the world, and has had significant social and psychological effects on the population. Nowadays, social media platforms are being used for emotional self-expression towards current events, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The study of peopleâ€™s emotions in social media is vital to understand the effect of this pandemic on mental health, in order to protect societies. This work aims to investigate to what extent deep learning models can assist in understanding societyâ€™s attitude in social media toward COVID-19 pandemic. We employ two transformer-based models for fine-grained sentiment detection of Arabic tweets, considering that more than one emotion can co-exist in the same tweet. We also show how the textual representation of emojis can boost the performance of sentiment analysis. In addition, we propose a dynamically weighted loss function (DWLF) to handle the issue of imbalanced datasets. The proposed approach has been evaluated on two datasets and the attained results demonstrate that the proposed BERT-based models with emojis replacement and DWLF technique can improve the sentiment detection of multi-dialect Arabic tweets with an F1-Micro score of 0.72.","Alturayeif, Nora, Luqman, Hamzah","https://doi.org/10.3390/app112210694","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Applied Sciences; 11(22):10694, 2021.; Publication details: Applied Sciences; 11(22):10694, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21991,""
"Rumination: A concept analysis","Aim: To analyze the concept of rumination and shed light on its structure in examining the effectiveness of using the concept in nursing practice. Methods: This study analyzed 91 papers by using Rodgersâ€™ concept analysis approach. Results: The following one attribute category was extracted: â€œuncontrollable thoughts.â€ Five categories were extracted for prerequisites and another three for consequences. Conclusion: The findings suggested that the concept of rumination means â€œuncontrollable thoughtsâ€ which people experience when they have â€œmental pain,â€ â€œnegative belief,â€ â€œlack of objective vision,â€ â€œnonadjustable attention,â€ and â€œbiologic profile.â€ As a result of rumination, â€œaggravation of mental health,â€ â€œ aggravation of physical health,â€ and â€œaggravation of stress or Recovery from the eventâ€arise.

"Digitization of healthcare post COVID-19: Reimagining the role of health education and promotion","The digitization of health promotion and communication has become a major discourse in healthcare. This paper synthesizes my understanding of the role of health literacy, promotion, education and communication in ensuring effective digitization of healthcare and presents four key findings from a mental health promotion project. First, the pandemic has shown us more than ever how fragile we all are - health-seeking behaviour will increasingly take centre stage over the next decade. Second, why do people refuse to wear masks even though it increases the risk of mortality? Why are individuals not motivated to exercise despite downloading free health apps? Why do people keep eating unhealthy food even when they can afford healthier options? Why? The numbers cannot tell the whole story. Similarly, the proliferation of digital health technology cannot convince people to modify their behaviours nor promote meaningful use of elm-health apps. Third, deliberate digital health promotion and communication is needed to leverage opportunities in health technology. Fourth, the world needs researchers and experts who understand the broader determinants of health attitudes and are knowledgeable in synthesizing valid health information across various technological platforms, in support of health system needs. I address the implications of my findings and discuss future directions for policy and practitioners.","Obuaku-Igwe, C.","https://doi.org/10.1386/cjcs_00055_7","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Catalan Journal of Communication & Cultural Studies; 13(2):303-310, 2021.; Publication details: Catalan Journal of Communication & Cultural Studies; 13(2):303-310, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21993,""
"Socioeconomic and health impacts of fall armyworm in Ethiopia","Since 2016, fall armyworm (FAW) has threatened sub-Saharan 'Africa's fragile food systems and economic performance. Yet, there is limited evidence on this transboundary pest's economic and food security impacts in the region. Additionally, the health and environmental consequences of the insecticides being used to control FAW have not been studied. This paper presents evidence on the impacts of FAW on maize production, food security, and human and environmental health. We use a combination of an agroecology-based community survey and nationally representative data from an agricultural household survey to achieve our objectives. The results indicate that the pest causes an average annual loss of 36% in maize production, reducing 0.67 million tonnes of maize (0.225 million tonnes per year) between 2017 and 2019. The total economic loss is US$ 200 million, or 0.08% of the gross domestic product. The lost production could have met the per capita maize consumption of 4 million people. We also find that insecticides to control FAW have more significant toxic effects on the environment than on humans. This paper highlights governments and development partners need to invest in sustainable FAW control strategies to reduce maize production loss, improve food security, and protect human and environmental health.

"Valor behind the Burqa: Afghan women's fight against Covid-19","The paper studies the gendered impact of the pandemic in a war ravaged Afghanistan. For majority of Afghan women, the onslaught of Covid has exacerbated their already dire condition and adversely impacted their social, economical, physical and cultural aspects of life. The research also underlines that the imposition of lockdown has caused the reversal of war gains. The paper also highlights the notable works of various Afghan women carried out during the corona pandemic that has contributed to their emancipation and upliftment of the society at large. It brings forth strong and courageous women who are combatting terrorism, everyday conflicts, frequent bombings, societal restrictions and now the deadly coronavirus and yet contributing majorly in re-building the Afghan society. This paper is an attempt to dispel the dominant narrative of their state of helplessness and despondency around Afghan women before the withdrawal of American troops and Taliban takeover.

"Stressors and psychological distress: Music listening as a coping strategy for pre-service kindergarten teachers","Against the backdrop of the worldwide spread of COVID-19, this study aims to validate a model for coping with psychological distress and examine the effect of music listening, as a coping strategy, in moderating and lessening the effects of stressors on psychological distress. Based on 198 returned questionnaires from preservice kindergarten teachers, this study suggests students experienced such common mental health issues as stress, anxiety and depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Time pressures, general social mistreatment, academic alienation and developmental challenges were significant stressors predicting students' anxiety. Music listening played a prominent moderating role on the relationship between stressors and psychological wellbeing mental health/psychological distress. However, music with lyrics with a positive meaning may lessen the moderating effect of musical elements. This study suggests that music listening has a prominent moderating effect on health/psychological distress, while the implicit or explicit musical meaning of the music perceived by the audience determines its moderating effect.","Kong, S.

"Amine Functionalized Noble Metal: Metal Oxide Nanohybrid for Efficient Electrochemical Determination of 25-Hydroxy Vitamin-D-3 in Human Serum","Quantification of 25-hydroxy vitamin-D-3 (25-OHVD3) is important because its deficiency is related to numerous diseases, including osteoporosis, depression, diabetes, heart disease, certain autoimmune conditions, and even Covid-19. In the present study, noble metal-metal oxide nanohybrid based on L-cysteine functionalized gold decorated zirconia nanoparticles (Cys-Au@ZrO2 NPs) were synthesized with the objective of enhanced electrochemical behavior, stability, availability of functional group to covalently bind with biomolecules, and developing an efficient immunosensor for 25-OHVD3 detection. The formation of Au@ZrO2 NPs and further Cys functionalization was validated by various characterizations. Cys-Au@ZrO2 NPs were electrodeposited onto ITO substrate and further modified with antibodies specific to 25-OHVD3 (ab-25VD(3)) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) to build an immunosensing platform for 25-OHVD3 detection. The fabricated BSA/ab-25VD(3)/Cys-Au@ZrO2/ITO immunosensor demonstrated an improved sensitivity of 2.01 mu A ng(-1) ml cm(-2), LOD of 3.54 ng ml(-1) for the linear detection range of 1-50 ng ml(-1) with regression constant of 0.98. Moreover, the analytical performance of the BSA/ab-25VD(3)/Cys-Au@ZrO2/ITO immunosensor in determining 25-OHVD3 in human serum samples collected from four healthy people yielded satisfactory results that were highly correlated with the conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).","Chauhan, D.; Gupta, P.

"School recess and pandemic recovery efforts: ensuring a climate that supports positive social connection and meaningful play","As Canada's schools reopen, attention to healing the school community is essential. Given the considerable stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unsurprising that recent studies find Canadian children's mental health in decline. As social connection is tightly entwined with children's mental health, supporting school-based spaces for quality social interactions and play will be an important postpandemic recovery strategy. Children will need opportunities to re-establish positive social connections at school, and informal spaces such as recess and lunch are an ideal time to afford these opportunities. Yet many schoolyards have long been challenged by social conflict that can interfere with children's need to connect with peers. Therefore, efforts should be directed not only at mitigating the effects of social harm, but also toward ensuring social and physical landscapes that are meaningful, inclusive, and engaging for children and adolescents of all ages. Recommendations for postpandemic recovery are provided.","McNamara, L.","https://doi.org/10.1139/facets-2021-0081","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Facets; 6:1814-1830, 2021.; Publication details: Facets; 6:1814-1830, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21998,""
"COVID-19 school closures and social isolation in children and youth: prioritizing relationships in education","We pursue an evidence-informed argument that interpersonal relationships in childhood and adolescence are central to achieving learning outcomes and that school closures across various parts of Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic have compromised these critical relationships, jeopardizing educational attainment. We highlight how the centrality of relationships with peers and educators in achieving learning goals is well established in the literature. So too is the importance of peers in creating stable mental health and wellness for children and youth. The pandemic context has drastically interfered with ongoing wellness, exacerbating feelings of loneliness and social isolation, which takes a toll on what children and youth can achieve in the virtual classroom. In the interest of reducing harm, we call on provincial/territorial governments to move quickly to ensure schools are open in the fall and to think carefully and consult effectively before any further closure decisions are made. We understand that safety is paramount and as such offer a framework for planning a safe return where necessary. Now more than ever there is a need to prioritize social-emotional learning opportunities to protect young people from the lasting effects of social isolation and threats to the fundamental need to belong that have been induced or exacerbated by the pandemic.","Vaillancourt, T.; McDougall, P.; Comeau, J.; Finn, C.","https://doi.org/10.1139/facets-2021-0080","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Facets; 6:1795-1813, 2021.; Publication details: Facets; 6:1795-1813, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",21999,""
"Effectiveness of interventions to address the negative health outcomes of informal caregiving to older adults: protocol for an umbrella review","IntroductionInformal (unpaid) caregivers play an essential role in caring for older people, whose care needs are often not fully met by formal services. While providing informal care may be a positive experience, it can also exert a considerable strain on caregiversâ€™ physical and mental health. How to best support the needs of informal caregivers remains largely debated. This umbrella review (review of systematic reviews) aims to evaluate (1) whether effective interventions can mitigate the negative health outcomes of informal caregiving, (2) whether certain types of interventions are more effective than others, (3) whether effectiveness of interventions depends on caregiver/receiver, context or implementation characteristics and (4) how these interventions are perceived in terms of acceptability, feasibility and added value.Methods and analysisWe will include systematic reviews of primary studies focusing on the effectiveness of interventions (public or private, unifaceted or multifaceted, delivered by health or social care professionals or volunteers) aimed at reducing the impact of caregiving on caregiversâ€™ physical or mental health. This will also include quantitative and qualitative syntheses of implementation studies. The literature search will include the following databases: Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science. A key informant-guided search of grey literature will be performed. Quality appraisal will be conducted with the AMSTAR-2 checklist for quantitative reviews and with an ad hoc checklist for qualitative syntheses. Narrative and tabular summaries of extracted data will be produced, and framework synthesis will be employed for weaving together evidence from quantitative studies in effectiveness reviews with findings on implementation from qualitative studies.Ethics and disseminationThis umbrella review will use data from secondary sources and will not involve interactions with study participants;it is thus exempt from ethical approval.

"Sentiment Analysis of Autonomous Vehicles after Extreme Events Using Social Media Data","This paper aims to leverage social media data to understand the public opinion on autonomous driving after extreme events, including the Uber and Tesla crashes and the COVID-19 pandemic. Uber and Tesla crashes that happened consecutively in 2018 have posed uncertainty and the public concern toward the autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically increased people's fear of taking mass transit, while the social distancing policy could easily favor contactless travel experiences provided by AVs. To understand people's attitudinal changes before and after these extreme events, three sources of social media data are leveraged: Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. Sentiment analysis is performed with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) model to study the change in people's attitude toward AVs. Results show that after Uber and Tesla crashes, the proportion of people with a negative attitude increases, while after the pandemic, the proportion of people with a positive attitude increases. These results are quite consistent with our intuition. We then conduct regression analysis using XGBoost to analyze the impact of individual's demographic information on his/her sentiment toward AVs. We find that Age has the most significant effect on people's attitudes toward AVs. Engineers and entrepreneurs are more likely to introduce and discuss the AV technology in social media.

"Predicting Next Call Duration: A Future Direction to Promote Mental Health in the Age of Lockdown","When high school students leave their homes for a college education, they often face enormous changes and challenges in life, such as meeting new people, more responsibilities in life, and being away from family and their comfort zones. These sudden changes often lead to an elevation of stress and anxiety, affecting a student's health and well-being. Situations can even get worse in the age of global pandemics, such as COVID-19, when regular life and social activities are significantly disrupted due to lockdown or stay-at-home orders. Therefore, predicting phone call patterns (a measure of social engagement) based on various factors and activities of a person can be helpful to foster social engagement and promote health and well-being during sudden lifestyle changes. In this work, we investigate a cohort of 370 on-campus college students over three consecutive semesters and breaks between them to find various geo-temporal factors and activities that affect students' phone call behaviors and develop models that can predict the next call duration with a correlation of up to 0.89 between the actual and predicted duration using individual-level generalized linear models. Findings from this work can further be extended to other populations, and thereby, our findings will enable the design and delivery of new smartphone-based health interventions (guided feedback) to help people to adapt and cope up with situations that affect their lifestyle and social activities.","Vhaduri, S.; Dibbo, S.

"COVID-19 and Its Effects on the Driving Style of Spanish Drivers","Spain is one of the countries most affected by COVID-19. Until May 5, 2021 there have been 3.54 million people infected and 78,399 deaths according to the Johns Hopkins Institute. This has meant that Spain is one of the countries in the world where the most restrictive measures have been adopted and which have had a strong impact on the economic, social, and mental health of citizens. One of the consequences of this pandemic is a severe increase in the strain on the healthcare system. Many of those infected had to be admitted to hospitals and even to Intensive Care Units (ICU). In this scenario, it is essential to reduce traffic accidents in order to avoid overcrowded hospitals. However, the Spanish General Directorate of Traffic highlights in several traffic reports that despite the decrease in the volume and distance of trips, the number of traffic accidents has not altered significantly and even during some periods has been higher than before the pandemic. The aim of this work is to establish if there has been a change in the driving style of drivers during the pandemic and to identify the group of people adopting a more inefficient and unsafe driving style. To this end, a study was carried out with 30 volunteers and their current driving style was compared with their driving style before the pandemic. The results show that drivers have adopted a more aggressive driving style than before the pandemic, especially women and those who have suffered anxiety due to COVID-19.","Corcoba, V.; Paneda, X.

"Two rTMS sessions per week: a practical approach for treating major depressive disorder","Introduction Depression is one of the leading causes of disability in the world, and a disease that contributes greatly to the global burden of disease. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has proven to be a well-tolerated, effective treatment for depression. The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of an rTMS treatment scheme with a fewer number of sessions per week. Methods In total 91 adult university students with major depressive disorder (MDD). This was a double-blind, randomized clinical trial in which 15 sessions of rTMS were given to each one of two treatment groups made up of adults with active MDD. One treatment group received two sessions per week, the other received five. The study protocol included their respective sham rTMS groups. The patients who received active rTMS also participated in a follow-up procedure that consisted of two sessions of active rTMS per month for three more months. Results Measurements by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) showed that the groups which received active rTMS had higher percentages of antidepressant response at 96 and 95.5% for five and two sessions/week, respectively, compared to the sham rTMS groups: 27.3 and 4.5% for five and two sessions/week, respectively. Observations at the end of the 3-month follow-up phase showed that the improvements in HAMD scores were maintained in both groups. Conclusion This study contributes to demonstrating that rTMS with a more practical schedule of two sessions/week is an effective antidepressant treatment that could be considered the first choice for managing symptoms of depression.","Armas-Castaneda, G.; Ricardo-Garcell, J.; Reyes, J.

"Assessment of level of fear in adult patients undergoing elective urogynecologic and gynecologic procedures and surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic using the validated surgical fear questionnaire (SFQ)","Objective: To assess and trend fears surrounding elective surgeries and office procedures with a standardized questionnaire in benign gynecologic and urogynecologic patients during the Coronavirus-19 (COVID) pandemic.We hypothesized that COVID-related fear was greater in surgical patients over procedural patients, that surgical fearwould be greater than historic data, and that fear levels would increase with the course of the pandemic. Methods: This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study. Recruitment occurred from June 23, 2020 until March 23, 2021. Females 18 years or older presenting for elective, benign gynecologic or urogynecologic surgery or office procedures were eligible. Patients were excluded if non-English speaking or undergoing an emergent procedure or surgery. Fear was assessed with the Surgical Fear Questionnaire (SFQ), a validated 8-item survey that evaluates short term (questions 1-4) and long term (questions 5-8) fears related to surgery. We modified the SFQ to include 2-4 additional questions about the COVID-19 pandemic (mSFQ) and to apply to procedures (10 questions) and surgeries (14 questions) (Table 1). Questions were scored on a scale of 0-10 with 0 being 'not at all afraid' and 10 being 'very afraid'. Total SFQ scores and short and long term fear scores were compared between procedures and surgeries and to historic data (Theunissen et al, 2016). Results: 209 subjects undergoing 107 procedures or 102 surgeries completed the questionnaire. Demographics are shown in Table 1. The prevalence of chronic pain, depression, and anxiety was similar to national statistics. The most common procedure was urodynamics (n = 59, 55%). Themost common elective surgery was hysterectomy (n = 59, 57.8%). 72.5% surgeries were for urogynecologic indications. Fear assessed by the SFQ (12.21 Â± 16.21) was overall low and not different in subjects undergoing procedures versus surgery (12.38 Â± 12.44 vs 12.03 Â± 16.01, P = 0.958). Similarly, fear was not different between procedures vs surgery for short term (6.21 Â± 8.38 vs 6.81 Â± 8.44, P = 0.726) and long term fear (6.18 Â± 8.89 vs 5.22 Â± 8.20, P = 0.683). The mSFQ, which captured COVID-specific fears, demonstrated higher fear scores for both procedures and surgeries compared to SFQ (mSFQ 20.57 Â± 20.55 for procedures, 28.78 Â± 28.51 for surgeries versus 12.21 Â± 16.21 for SFQ). These included fear of hospitalization, overworked doctors, concern for family, etc (Table 1). There were no significant fluctuations in SFQ score in relation to critical COVID-19 events (Figure 1). We compared our data to the largest study of surgical fear in 428 women undergoing benign hysterectomy outside of a pandemic by Theunissen et al 2016 and found a significantly lower fear in our population in both the short (6.5 Â± 8.39 vs 16 Â± 9.9, P &lt; 0.001) and long term(5.71 Â± 8.56 vs 9.3 Â± 8.6, p &lt; 0.001) scores. This lower level of surgical fear persisted solely comparing our hysterectomy subjects to the aforementioned data in both short term (7.37 Â± 8.62 vs 16 Â± 9.9, p &lt; 0.001) and long term (5.12 Â± 7.14 vs 9.3 Â± 8.6, P &lt; 0.001) scores. Conclusions: Fear of surgeries and office procedures was overall low and consistent throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to historic data, our patients had lower levels of surgical fear. Fear scores increased with the addition of COVID-specific questions, indicating some fear surrounding having a procedure or surgery during the pandemic. Interpretation of our results is limited by the fact that the patients surveyed had already decided to continue in-person care.","Lai, E.; Grimes, C.; Kasoff, M.; Brailovschi, Y.; Brown-Thomas, T.

"Mental health status and risk factors during Covid-19 pandemic in the Croatia's adult population","Background The Covid-19 pandemic is associated with adverse mental health outcomes for people worldwide. Objective The study aimed to assess mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic and the key risk factors from the human ecology perspective in Croatia's adult population. Method An online panel survey with 1,201 adult participants (50.1% women) was done with a nationally representative sample in terms of gender, age, and country region four months after the nation lockdown began and two months after most of the restrictions were lifted. Indicators of mental health included symptoms of adjustment disorder (ADNM-8);depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS-21);symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PC-PTSD-5);and well-being (WHO-5). Results In the entire sample, 9.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.9%, 14.0%) of the participants were at risk of adjustment disorder, 7.7% (95% CI: 6.7%, 11.9%) were at risk of depression disorder, and 7.8% (95% CI: 5.3%, 10.3%) were at risk of anxiety disorder. In addition, 7.2% (95% CI: 5.3%, 10.2%) were experiencing high levels of stress. The average well-being score was 56.5 (SD = 21.91) on a scale from 0 to 100. Among the participants who have lifetime traumatic experience (n = 429), 14% (95% CI: 10.6%, 17.2%) were at risk for PTSD. Key risk factors for specific mental health outcomes differed, but the common ones included: current health status, previous mental health diagnosis, and psychological resilience. Being younger, having a below-average income, and excessively following news about Covid-19 were predictive for some of the mental health problems. Conclusions Together, the key risk factors identified in this study indicate the need for public health interventions addressing the general population's mental health, but also for specific risk groups. Lower rates of mental health symptoms assessed soon after lifting quarantine measures that have been found in other studies may indicate human resilience capacity.","Ajdukovic, D.; Bagaric, I.

"Screening for depression among chronically ill patients in community pharmacy settings: a pilot study in Bulgaria","Depression leads to a significant economic and financial burden, which determines the need for implementation of screening programs involving community pharmacists. The aim of this study was to screen patients with chronic conditions for depressive symptoms and to assess their current quality of life at community pharmacies in Sofia Province, Bulgaria. A pilot prospective anonymous survey among patients with chronic diseases was conducted. Questionnaires were used: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), EQ-5D-5L and a specially designed questions list. The data were analyzed statistically using MedCalc software version 16.4.1. A total of 119 chronically ill patients were screened for depression by community pharmacists for the period March 2020-August 2020 during and after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Women (59.7%) and patients over 60 years of age (&gt; 50%) predominated. Most patients had only one disease (47.2%), with the most common diseases being cardiovascular, followed by other endocrine and metabolic diseases. Of the respondents, 64.9% showed depressive symptoms, of which 50.9% were mild and 14% severe. The median pharmacotherapy cost was higher for patients with depression compared to patients who do not show depressive symptoms: BGN 28.50 compared to BGN 14.77. The obtained results suggest that the implementation of an early depression screening service in the community pharmacy settings would provide easy and timely access of patients to adequate mental care. The service would lead to improved quality of pharmaceutical care in Bulgaria and increased range of services that pharmacists offer in community pharmacy practice.","Vutova, Y.; Kamusheva, M.; Ignatova, D.; Milushewa, P.","https://doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2021.1980108","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Biotechnology & Biotechnological Equipment; 35(1):1393-1400, 2021.; Publication details: Biotechnology & Biotechnological Equipment; 35(1):1393-1400, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22013,""
"Concerns and reactions to COVID-19 in the confined population according to age and sex (Preocupaciones y reacciones ante el COVID-19 en poblaciÃ³n confinada segÃºn edad y gÃ©nero)","Given the situation of lockdown implemented because of the COVID-19 virus, there is a need to study the sociodemographic variables and risk factors associated with psychological problems and greater difficulty with adapting to the situation, which could in turn help in the development of psychological treatment offered during and after isolation. The objective of this study is to analyse whether age and sex are related to the concerns and reactions experienced by the population. Fifteen days after the official lockdown order, we sent out an online survey comprising 23 questions. A sample of 1,711 was collected, which included participants' sociodemographic data, previous personal traits, psychological reactions, health habits, concerns and health activities. The results of the analyses showed a statistically significant association between age and feeling overwhelmed or claustrophobic, tiredness, concern that a family member becomes infected with the disease, irritability, fear and sadness, and between sex and concern that a family member becomes infected with the disease, sadness and fear.

"Digital mental health in China: a systematic review","Mental health problems are highly prevalent in China;however, China's mental health services lack resources to deliver high-quality care to people in need. Digital mental health is a promising solution to this short-fall in view of the population's digital literacy. In this review, we aim to: (i) investigate the effectiveness, acceptability, usability, and safety of digital health technologies (DHTs) for people with mental health problems in China;(ii) critically appraise the literature;and (iii) make recommendations for future research directions. The databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI, WANFANG, and VIP were systemically searched for English and Chinese language articles evaluating DHTs for people with mental health problems in mainland China. Eligible studies were systematically reviewed. The heterogeneity of studies included precluded a meta-analysis. In total, 39 articles were retrieved, reporting on 32 DHTs for various mental health problems. Compared with the digital mental health field in the West, the Chinese studies targeted schizophrenia and substance use disorder more often and investigated social anxiety mediated by shame and culturally specific variants, DHTs were rarely developed in a co-production approach, and methodology quality was less rigorous. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review focused on digital mental health in the Chinese context including studies published in both English and the Chinese language. DHTs were acceptable and usable among Chinese people with mental health problems in general, similar to findings from the West. Due to heterogeneity across studies and a paucity of robust control trial research, conclusions about the efficacy of DHTs are lacking.","Zhang, Xiaolong, Lewis, ShÃ´n, Firth, Joseph, Chen, Xu, Bucci, Sandra","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291721003731","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Psychological Medicine; 51(15):2552-2570, 2021.; Publication details: Psychological Medicine; 51(15):2552-2570, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22017,""
"Scaling up public mental health care in Sub-Saharan Africa: insights from infectious disease","IntroductionModels estimate that the disability burden from mental disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will more than double in the next 40 years. Similar to HIV, mental disorders are stigmatized in many SSA settings and addressing them requires community engagement and long-term treatment. Yet, in contrast to HIV, the public mental healthcare cascade has not been sustained, despite robust data on scalable strategies. We draw on findings from our International AIDS Society (IAS) 2020 virtual workshop and make recommendations for next steps in the scale up of the SSA public mental healthcare continuum.DiscussionEarly HIV surveillance and care cascade targets are discussed as important strategies for HIV response in SSA that should be adopted for mental health. Advocacy, including engagement with civil society, and targeted economic arguments to policymakers, are reviewed in the context of HIV success in SSA. Parallel opportunities for mental disorders are identified. Learning from HIV, communication of strategies that advance mental health care needs in SSA must be prioritized for broad global audiences.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic is setting off a colossal escalation of global mental health care needs, well-publicized across scientific, media, policymaker, and civil society domains. The pandemic highlights disparities in healthcare access and reinvigorates the push for universal coverage. Learning from HIV strategies, we must seize this historical moment to improve the public mental health care cascade in SSA and capitalize on the powerful alliances ready to be forged.

"Influence of Rapid COVID-19 Vaccine Development on Vaccine Hesitancy","Introduction In the race to deploy vaccines to prevent COVID-19, there is a need to understand factors influencing vaccine hesitancy. Secondary risk theory is a useful framework to explain this, accounting for concerns about vaccine efficacy and safety. Methods Participants (N = 216) evaluated one of three different hypothetical vaccine scenarios describing an FDA-approved vaccine becoming available â€œnext week,â€ â€œin one year,â€ or â€œin two years.â€ Dependent variables were perceived vaccine efficacy, self-efficacy, perceived vaccine risk, and vaccination willingness. Covariates included vaccine conspiracy beliefs, science pessimism, media dependency, and perceived COVID-19 risk. Data analysis employed multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). Results Perceived vaccine efficacy was lowest for the next-week vaccine (<U+03B7>2p = .045). Self-efficacy was higher for the two-year vaccine than the next-week vaccine (<U+03B7>2p = .029). Perceived vaccine risk was higher for the next-week vaccine than for the one-year vaccine (<U+03B7>2p = .032). Vaccination willingness did not differ among experimental treatments. In addition, vaccine conspiracy beliefs were negatively related to perceived vaccine efficacy (<U+03B7>2p = .142), self-efficacy (<U+03B7>2p = .031), and vaccination willingness (<U+03B7>2p = .143) and positively related to perceived vaccine risk (<U+03B7>2p = .216). Conclusions The rapid development of the COVID-19 vaccine may have heightened public concerns over efficacy, availability, and safety. However, the current findings showed a general willingness to take even the most rapidly developed vaccine. Nonetheless, there remains a need to communicate publicly and transparently about vaccine efficacy and safety and work to reduce vaccine conspiracy beliefs.","Rosenthal, Sonny, Cummings, Christopher L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.11.014","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Vaccine;2021.; Publication details: Vaccine;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22021,""
"Full-coverage mapping and spatiotemporal variations of ground-level ozone (O3) pollution from 2013 to 2020 across China","Ozone (O3) is an important trace and greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, posing a threat to the ecological environment and human health at the ground level. Large-scale and long-term studies of O3 pollution in China are few due to highly limited direct ground and satellite measurements. This study offers a new perspective to estimate ground-level O3 from solar radiation intensity and surface temperature by employing an extended ensemble learning of the space-time extremely randomized trees (STET) model, together with ground-based observations, remote sensing products, atmospheric reanalysis, and an emission inventory. A full-coverage (100%), high-resolution (10Â km) and high-quality daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) ground-level O3 dataset covering China (called ChinaHighO3) from 2013 to 2020 was generated. Our MDA8 O3 estimates (predictions) are reliable, with an average out-of-sample (out-of-station) coefficient of determination of 0.87 (0.80) and root-mean-square error of 17.10 (21.10) Âµg/m3 in China. The unique advantage of the full coverage of our dataset allowed us to accurately capture a short-term severe O3 pollution exposure event that took place from 23 April to 8 May in 2020. Also, a rapid increase and recovery of O3 concentrations associated with variations in anthropogenic emissions were seen during and after the COVID-19 lockdown, respectively. Trends in O3 concentration showed an average growth rate of 2.49Â Âµg/m3/yr (pÂ &lt;Â 0.001) from 2013 to 2020, along with the continuous expansion of polluted areas exceeding the daily O3 standard (i.e., MDA8 O3Â =Â 160Â Âµg/m3). Summertime O3 concentrations and the probability of occurrence of daily O3 pollution have significantly increased since 2015, especially in the North China Plain and the main air pollution transmission belt (i.e., the â€œ2Â +Â 26â€ cities). However, a decline in both was seen in 2020, mainly due to the coordinated control of air pollution and ongoing COVID-19 effects. This carefully vetted and smoothed dataset is valuable for studies on air pollution and environmental health in China.","Wei, Jing, Li, Zhanqing, Li, Ke, Dickerson, Russell R.; Pinker, Rachel T.; Wang, Jun, Liu, Xiong, Sun, Lin, Xue, Wenhao, Cribb, Maureen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112775","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Remote Sensing of Environment;: 112775, 2021.; Publication details: Remote Sensing of Environment;: 112775, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22022,""
"Measurement of coronaphobia in older adults: Validation of the Spanish version of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale","Background and objective: The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) is an instrument that measures the severity of anxiety due to COVID-19 or coronaphobia. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults are the most vulnerable age group;therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the CAS in this group. Materials and method: 274 Peruvian older adults participated (Mage = 67.86;SD= 6.34, 64.6% women). In addition to the CAS, the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), and 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-2) were applied. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to assess the factor structure of the CAS and Item Response Theory was used to analyze item characteristics. A sequence of hierarchical variance models was used to evaluate the measurement invariance of the CAS according to age. To assess reliability, Cronbach's alpha coefficient (a) and the omega coefficient (<U+03C9>) were used. The correlations between the CAS score and the scores of the PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scales were calculated with Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). Results: The results of the CFA indicated that the unidimensional model of the CAS fitted the data adequately and showed very good reliability (a and <U+03C9> = .83). Likewise, all items provided high information and adequate discrimination, which allowed for better detection of average and high levels of coronaphobia in the older adult population. However, the CAS did not show evidence of being strictly invariant between older adults aged 60 to 65 years and 66 to 86 years. The CAS showed significant correlations with anxiety (r = .72;[95%CI: .66, .87] p&lt;.01) and depression (r = .53;[95%CI: .43, .76] p&lt;.01). Conclusion: The CAS in Spanish shows evidence of validity based on internal structure, convergent and divergent validity, as well as an adequate reliability estimate to assess coronaphobia in older adults. The CAS can be used to detect average and high levels of coronaphobia in the older adult population. Resumen Antecedentes y objetivo: La Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) es un instrumento que mide la severidad de la ansiedad por la COVID-19 o coronafobia. En el contexto de la pandemia de la COVID-19, los adultos mayores son el grupo de edad mÃ¡s vulnerable;por lo tanto, el objetivo del estudio fue evaluar las propiedades psicomÃ©tricas del CAS en este grupo. Materiales y MÃ©todo: Participaron 274 adultos mayores peruanos (Medad = 67.86;DE= 6.34, 64.6% mujeres). AdemÃ¡s del CAS, se aplicaron el 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) y el 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-2). Se utilizÃ³ un AnÃ¡lisis Factorial Confirmatorio (AFC), para evaluar la estructura factorial del CAS y la TeorÃ­a de Respuesta al Ãtem, para analizar las caracterÃ­sticas de los Ã­tems. Se utilizÃ³ una secuencia de modelos de varianza jerÃ¡rquicos para evaluar la invarianza de mediciÃ³n del CAS segÃºn edad. Para evaluar la confiabilidad, se utilizÃ³ el coeficiente alfa de Cronbach (a) y el coeficiente omega (<U+03C9>). Las correlaciones entre el puntaje del CAS, los puntajes de las escalas PHQ-2 y GAD-2, se calcularon con el coeficiente de correlaciÃ³n de Pearson (r). Resultados: Los resultados del AFC indicaron que el modelo unidimensional del CAS ajustÃ³ adecuadamente a los datos y mostrÃ³ una muy buena confiabilidad (a y <U+03C9> = .83). Asimismo, todos los Ã­tems brindaron una alta informaciÃ³n y adecuada discriminaciÃ³n;lo que permitiÃ³ detectar mejor los niveles promedio y alto de coronafobia en la poblaciÃ³n de adulta mayor. Sin embargo, el CAS no mostrÃ³ ser estrictamente invariante entre adultos mayores de 60 a 65 aÃ±os y 66 a 86 aÃ±os. El CAS mostrÃ³ correlaciones significativas con la ansiedad (r = .72;[IC95%: .66, .87] p&lt;.01) y depresiÃ³n (r = .53;[IC95%: .43, .76] p&lt;.01). ConclusiÃ³n: Se concluye que el CAS en espaÃ±ol muestra evidencias de validez basado en la estructura interna, validez convergente y divergente, asÃ­ como, una estimaciÃ³n de la fiabilidad adecuada para evaluar la coronafobia en adultos mayores. El CAS se puede utilizar para detectar niveles medios y altos de coronafobia en la poblaciÃ³n adulta mayor.","Caycho-RodrÃ­guez, TomÃ¡s, Vilca, Lindsey W.; PeÃ±a-Calero, Brian Norman, Barboza-Palomino, Miguel, White, Michael, Reyes-Bossio, Mario","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.regg.2021.09.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Revista EspaÃ±ola de GeriatrÃ­a y GerontologÃ­a;2021.; Publication details: Revista EspaÃ±ola de GeriatrÃ­a y GerontologÃ­a;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22023,""

"Relationships between local school closures due to the COVID-19 and mental health problems of children, adolescents, and parents in Japan","The widespread impacts of COVID-19 have affected both child and parent mental health worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between school closures due to COVID-19 and child and parent mental health in Japan. A sample of 1984 Japanese parents with children and adolescents aged 6â€“15 years participated. The parents responded to online questionnaires about their own mental health and that of their children cross-sectionally. Participants were divided into three school situations based on the past week: full school closure, partial school closure, and full school open. Results indicated that 2.02% (nÂ =Â 40) of the participants were in full school closure and 5.95% (nÂ =Â 118) of the participants were in partial school closure. The results indicated that, after controlling for other variables regarding the pandemic, full school closure was associated with much higher scores in both child problems and parental mental health problems compared to full school open. Moderately higher scores were found only for anxiety symptoms in both children and parents under partial school closure compared to where schools were fully open. Consideration of the needs of families is necessary in the context of both full and partial school closures to prevent deteriorating mental health.","Kishida, Kohei, Tsuda, Masami, Waite, Polly, Creswell, Cathy, Ishikawa, Shin-ichi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114276","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114276, 2021.; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114276, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22025,""

"Association between pet ownership and physical activity and mental health during the COVID-19 â€œcircuit breakerâ€ in Singapore","Introduction: The negative impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on mental health and physical activity is well reported. While prior studies showed a positive influence of pet ownership on physical activity and mental health, the interactions between the pandemic and pet ownership are not well studied. Objective: To determine the association between pet ownership, physical activity levels and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 19 to July 13, 2020 among Singapore residents aged 21 to 64 years through a previously published questionnaire. Inverse probability treatment weighting was used to develop mixed-effects models for outcome comparisons. We recorded participant data on pet ownership, duration and intensity of physical activity, and RAND 36-item Health Survey mental health domains during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 431 pet owners and 103 non-pet owners. A greater proportion of pet owners were female, non-married, employed and owned pets in the past. Pet owners reported 31.8 (95% CI 13.6 to 50;p = .001) more minutes per week of mild-intensity physical activity compared to non-pet owners. No statistically significant differences were found for moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity. Pet owners had better emotional well-being (<U+A7B5> = 9.66, 95% CI 4.97 to 14.4;p &lt; .001), energy (<U+A7B5> = 8.29, 95% CI 3.46 to 13.1;p = .001) and social functioning (<U+A7B5> = 11.2, 95% CI 5.03 to 17.4;p &lt; .001) scores than non-pet owners. However, no statistically significant difference was observed for general health scores. Pet owner physical activity levels, general health, emotional well-being and energy scores correlated positively with pet attachment scores. Conclusion: Pet ownership was associated with greater physical activity levels and better mental health, particularly in main caregivers with higher pet attachment scores. These findings suggest that pet ownership is beneficial to physical and mental well-being during periods of social isolation amidst a global pandemic.","Tan, J. S. Q.; Fung, W.; Tan, B. S.

"Management of Cystic Fibrosis during COVID-19: Patient Reported Outcomes based remote follow-up among CF patients in Denmark â€“ AÂ feasibility study","ABSTRACT Background Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are considered to be a COVID-19 risk group. In March 2020, a fast-track Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) solution was developed to ensure access to CF care without in-person hospital visits. This study investigated the feasibility of urgently replacing in-person appointments with remote monitoring using telephone consultations combined with PROs. We investigated patients and health care professionals' (HCPs) acceptance, recruitment rate, response rate, missing data, and attrition. Methods We included adult CF patients from the Department of Infectious Diseases at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark between April and June 2020. Patients filled in a disease-specific questionnaire including relevant clinical aspects, performed home spirometry, and sent in a sputum sample before a scheduled telephone consultation. Twelve participants who completed the questionnaire and had a telephone consultation were interviewed. Three physicians and three nurses from the CF clinical team participated in a focus group interview. Results Eighty patients were recruited for remote monitoring, and 41 patients filled in at least one questionnaire. Overall, both patients and HCPs found remote monitoring and use of PROs acceptable and useful. Patients experienced greater flexibility and found the questionnaire relevant and understandable but pointed out the need for items regarding mental health status and more adequate information about changes in follow-up and workflow. Conclusion Urgent reorganization of outpatient follow-up among CF patients due to COVID-19 was feasible in routine clinical practice. However, patient involvement should be a future point of attention to ensure a sustainable telehealth PRO solution.","RodkjÃ¦r, Lotte, Jeppesen, Majbritt, Schougaard, Liv","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2021.10.010","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Cystic Fibrosis;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Cystic Fibrosis;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22031,""
"PASCLex: A Comprehensive Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) Symptom Lexicon Derived from Electronic Health Record Clinical Notes","Objective To develop a comprehensive post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptom lexicon (PASCLex) from clinical notes to support PASC symptom identification and research. Methods We identified 26,117 COVID-19 positive patients from the Mass General Brighamâ€™s electronic health records (EHR) and extracted 328,879 clinical notes from their post-acute infection period (day 51-110 from first positive COVID-19 test). PASCLex incorporated Unified Medical Language SystemÂ® (UMLS) Metathesaurus concepts and synonyms based on selected semantic types. The MTERMS natural language processing (NLP) tool was used to automatically extract symptoms from a development dataset. The lexicon was iteratively revised with manual chart review, keyword search, concept consolidation, and evaluation of NLP output. We assessed the comprehensiveness of PASCLex and the NLP performance using a validation dataset and reported the symptom prevalence across the entire corpus. Results PASCLex included 355 symptoms consolidated from 1,520 UMLS concepts of 16,466 synonyms. NLP achieved an averaged precision of 0.94 and an estimated recall of 0.84. Symptoms with the highest frequency included pain (43.1%), anxiety (25.8%), depression (24.0%), fatigue (23.4%), joint pain (21.0%), shortness of breath (20.8%), headache (20.0%), nausea and/or vomiting (19.9%), myalgia (19.0%), and gastroesophageal reflux (18.6%). Discussion and Conclusion PASC symptoms are diverse. A comprehensive lexicon of PASC symptoms can be derived using an ontology-driven, EHR-guided and NLP-assisted approach. By using unstructured data, this approach may improve identification and analysis of patient symptoms in the EHR, and inform prospective study design, preventative care strategies, and therapeutic interventions for patient care.","Wang, Liqin, Foer, Dinah, MacPhaul, Erin, Lo, Ying-Chih, Bates, David W.; Zhou, Li","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103951","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Biomedical Informatics;: 103951, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Biomedical Informatics;: 103951, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22032,""
"The Global Prevalence of Depression and Anxiety Among Doctors During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Background This review provides an estimate of the global prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among doctors, based on analysis of evidence from the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A systematic review was conducted to identify suitable studies. Final searches were conducted on 3rd March 2021. Papers were initially screened by title and abstract, based on pre-agreed inclusion criteria, followed by full-text review of eligible studies. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Checklist for Prevalence Studies. Data from studies rated as low or medium risk of bias were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted to explore heterogeneity. Results Fifty-five studies were included after full-text review. Of these, thirty studies were assessed as low or medium risk of bias and were included in primary analyses. These comprised twenty-six studies of depression (31,447 participants) and thirty studies of anxiety (33,281 participants). Pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety was 20.5% (95% CI 16.0%-25.3%) and 25.8% (95% CI 20.4%-31.5%) respectively. Interpretation Evidence from the first year of the pandemic suggests that a significant proportion of doctors are experiencing high levels of symptoms of depression and anxiety, although not conclusively more so than pre-pandemic levels. Differences in study methodology and variation in job demands may account for some of the observed heterogeneity. Limitations Findings must be interpreted with caution due to the high heterogeneity and moderate risk of bias evident in the majority of included studies.","Johns, G.; Samuel, V.; Freemantle, L.; Lewis, J.; Waddington, L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.11.026","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22033,""

"Addressing the complex substance use and mental health needs of people leaving prison: Insights from developing a national inventory of services in Canada","Internationally, transitions from prison to the community are often precarious experiences for people who are living with substance use and mental health concerns. In Canada, a continuing opioid overdose crisis and overlapping challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic have generated urgency for scaling up community-based services that can meet the complex substance use and mental health needs of people leaving prison. In this commentary, we reflect on our experience with and knowledge gained by developing a national inventory of substance use and mental health services for criminal justice-involved persons who are re-entering the community. We learned that there is a scarcity of such community-based services specific to criminal justice-involved populations and a glaring lack of information about culturally safe and appropriate supports. Stakeholders from organisations across Canada identified that communities need a comprehensive array of low-barrier services, inclusive of harm reduction and substance use treatment services, to meet the diverse needs of people leaving prison. We recommend building greater investment in and awareness of community-driven, local programs, as well as enhancing efforts to engage people with lived and living experience in service design and provision. We also briefly describe a few programs to highlight examples of how to operationalise the themes that we observed to emerge while developing a national inventory of community-based substance use and mental health services for criminal justice-involved persons.","Watson, Tara Marie, Benassi, Paul Victor, Agic, Branka, Maharaj, Asha, Sockalingam, Sanjeev","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103523","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: International Journal of Drug Policy; 100:103523, 2022.; Publication details: International Journal of Drug Policy; 100:103523, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22036,""
"Stress, depression, sleep problems and unmet social needs: Baseline characteristics of low-income smokers in a randomized cessation trial","Background Low-income Americans smoke cigarettes at higher rates and quit less than other groups. Methods To increase their engagement in and success using evidence-based cessation methods, we tested two interventions using a 2x2 randomized factorial design: (1) telephone navigation to reduce financial strain and address social needs such as food, rent and utility payment;and (2) a specialized tobacco quitline designed for low-income smokers. From June 2017 to November 2020, we enrolled 1,944 low-income smokers in Missouri, USA, recruited through the Missouri 2-1-1 helpline, into the trial. This paper describes recruitment, key characteristics and life circumstances of this high-risk population. Results After eligibility screening, 1,944 participants completed baseline and were randomized. Participants were racially diverse (58% African American), poor (51%Â &lt;Â $10,000 annual pre-tax household income) and many reported less than high school education (30%). They reported a mean of 2.5 unmet social needs, especially childcare and paying bills, had high rates of stress, depressive symptoms and sleep problems, and most were in fair or poor health. There were few differences between these variables, and no differences between tobacco use and cessation variables, across the four study groups and between participants recruited pre and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions Trial recruitment through the 2-1-1 helpline is feasible for reaching a population of low-income smokers. Low-income smokers face myriad daily challenges beyond quitting smoking. Cessation interventions need to account for and address these life circumstances.

"The prevalence and correlates of depression before and after the COVID-19 pandemic declaration among urban refugee adolescents and youth in informal settlements in Kampala, Uganda: A longitudinal cohort study","Purpose : There is scant research examining urban refugee youth mental health outcomes, including potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We examine prevalence and ecosocial risk factors of depression in the periods before and after the COVID-19 pandemic declaration among urban refugee youth in Kampala, Uganda. Methods : Data from a cohort of refugee youth (n=367) aged 16-24 years were collected in periods before (February 2020) and after (December 2020) the WHO COVID-19 pandemic declaration. We developed crude and adjusted generalized estimating equation logistic regression models to examine demographic and ecosocial factors (food insecurity, social support, intimate partner violence) associated with depression, and include time-ecosocial interactions to examine if associations differed before and after the pandemic declaration. Results : The prevalence of depression was high, but there was no significant difference before (27.5%) and after (28.9%) the pandemic declaration (p=0.583). In adjusted models, food insecurity (aOR: 2.54;95% CI: 1.21-5.33) and experiencing violence (aOR: 2.53;95% CI: 1.07-5.96) were associated with increased depression, and social support was associated with decreased depression (aOR: 0.85;95% CI: 0.81-0.89). Conclusions : These findings highlight the urgent need for interventions to address chronic depression, food insecurity, and ongoing effects of violence exposure among urban refugee youth in Kampala.","Logie, Carmen H.; Berry, Isha, Okumu, Moses, Loutet, Miranda, McNamee, Clara, Hakiza, Robert, Musoke, Daniel Kibuuka, Mwima, Simon, Kyambadde, Peter, Mbuagbaw, Lawrence","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2021.11.005","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Annals of Epidemiology;2021.; Publication details: Annals of Epidemiology;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22038,""
"Association between depressive state and behavioral changes induced by the state of emergency for Coronavirus disease 2019: Evidence from university students in Japan","Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has caused numerous problems worldwide since 2020. The pandemic and subsequent quarantine policies have resulted in numerous psychological problems among students. The quarantine policy forced students to change their behavior and refrain from going out. To date, the relationship between behavioral and psychological changes following the implementation of the quarantine policy has not been investigated. We conducted a web-based survey to investigate the change in time spent out of the house between before and after the implementation of the quarantine policy and how this related to changes in depression. We collected data from 12,088 students, which included the Patients Health Questionnaire-9, frequency of going out, and demographics. We divided subjects into three categories based on the frequency of going out before and after the policy was put in place. Results showed that students who frequently went out before the pandemic and strictly followed the government policy were significantly more depressed than those who did not frequently go out. In contrast, students who had always been reluctant to go out did not have a tendency for depression to worsen. Our findings indicate that behavioral modification leads to depression in those who previously had active social lives.","Ogawa, Takafumi, Shiratori, Yuki, Tachikawa, Hirokazu, Sodeyama, Noriko, Ota, Miho, Midorikawa, Haruhiko, Arai, Tetsuaki","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2021.103445","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Acta Psychologica;: 103445, 2021.; Publication details: Acta Psychologica;: 103445, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22039,""
"Social Sustainability Challenges Towards Flexible Supply Chain Management: Post-COVID-19 Perspective","The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the global social sustainability of the supply chains, pushing them towards a more flexible management approach. However, there is a paucity of literature that focuses on social sustainability issues for emerging economies. In the post-COVID-19 period, firms around the world will face several critical challenges to social sustainability, which will hinder achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Against this backdrop, this study identifies the pressing challenges to social sustainability in the post-COVID-19 context by a literature review and opinions from an expert panel, focusing on the footwear supply chain. In this paper, the bestâ€“worst method is applied to compute the criticality of social sustainability challenges towards the flexibility of the supply chains. The study findings reveal that among the nine identified critical challenges, â€œhigh level of lay offâ€, â€œhealth protocol developmentâ€, â€œcomplexity in ensuring workplace safetyâ€, â€œfacing trouble in mental healthâ€, and â€œlack of government enforcement and regulations for social issuesâ€ are reported as the top five challenges, respectively. Furthermore, this study suggests several flexible managerial guidelines, which will help practitioners and policymakers to achieve SDGs considering the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Risk of chlorine dioxide as emerging contaminant during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: enzyme, cardiac, and behavior effects on amphibian tadpoles","Objective The use of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) increased in the last year to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its use as disinfectant and therapeutic human treatments against viral infections. The absence of toxicological studies and sanitary regulation of this contaminant represents a serious threat to human and environmental health worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute toxicity and sublethal effects of ClO2 on tadpoles of Trachycephalus typhonius, which is a common bioindicator species of contamination from aquatic ecosystems. Materials and methods Median lethal concentration (LC50), the lowest-observed effect concentration (LOEC), and the noobserved effect concentration (NOEC) were performed. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities, swimming behavior parameters, and cardiac rhythm were estimated on tadpoles of concentrations &lt;= LOEC exposed at 24 and 96 h. ANOVA and Dunnett's post-hoc comparisons were performed to define treatments significance (p &lt;= 0.05). Results The LC50 of ClO2 was 4.17 mg L-1 (confidence limits: 3.73-4.66). In addition, NOEC and LOEC values were 1.56 and 3.12 mg L-1 ClO2, respectively, at 48 h. AChE and GST activities, swimming parameters, and heart rates increased in sublethal exposure of ClO2 (0.78-1.56 mg L-1) at 24 h. However, both enzyme activities and swimming parameters decreased, whereas heart rates increased at 96 h. Conclusion Overall, this study determined that sublethal concentrations of ClO2 produced alterations on antioxidant systems, neurotoxicity reflected on swimming performances, and variations in cardiac rhythm on treated tadpoles. Thus, our findings highlighted the need for urgent monitoring of this chemical in the aquatic ecosystems.

"Quality of life following adult veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review","Background: Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) has been used successfully for the past decade in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) refractory to conventional ventilatory support. However, knowledge of the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in VV-ECMO patients is still limited. Thus, this study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the HRQoL following VV-ECMO support in ARDS patients. Methods: A systematic search was performed on PubMed and Web of Science databases from January 1st, 2009 to October 19th, 2020. Studies reporting on HRQoL following VV-ECMO for ARDS in adults were included. Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality. Results: Eight studies were eligible for inclusion, consisting of seven observational studies and one randomized controlled trial (total N = 441). All eight studies had a quantitative design and reported 265 VV-ECMO survivors to have a reduced HRQoL compared to a generally healthy population. Follow-up time varied between six months to three years. Additionally, only four studies (total N = 335) compared the HRQoL of VV-ECMO (N = 159) to conventionally treated survivors (N = 176), with one study showing a significantly better HRQoL in VV-ECMO survivors, while three studies were stating comparable HRQoL across groups. Notably, most survivors in these studies appeared to experience varying degrees of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Conclusions: ARDS survivors supported by VV-ECMO have a decline in HRQoL and suffered from physical and psychological impairments. This HRQoL reduction is comparable or even better to the HRQoL in conventionally treated ARDS survivors.","Kurniawati, E. R.; Rutjens, V. G. H.; Vranken, N. P. A.; Delnoij, T. S.

"BDFNet: Boundary-Assisted and Discriminative Feature Extraction Network for COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected billions of lives around the world since its first outbreak in 2019. The computed tomography (CT) is a valuable tool for the COVID-19 associated clinical diagnosis, and deep learning has been extensively used to improve the analysis of CT images. However, owing to the limitation of the publicly available COVID-19 imaging datasets and the randomness and variability of the infected areas, it is challenging for the current segmentation methods to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a novel boundary-assisted and discriminative feature extraction network (BDFNet), which can be used to improve the accuracy of segmentation. We adopt the triplet attention (TA) module to extract the discriminative image representation, and the adaptive feature fusion (AFF) module to fuse the texture information and shape information. In addition to the channel and spatial dimensions that are mainly used in previous models, the cross channel-special context is also obtained in our model via the TA module. Moreover, fused hierarchical boundary information is integrated through the application of the AFF module. According to experiments conducted on two publicly accessible COVID-19 datasets, COVID-19-CT-Seg and CC-CCII, BDFNet performs better than most cutting-edge segmentation algorithms in six widely used segmentation metrics.

"Efficiency of anticoagulant protein c system in patients with coronavirus infection caused by the SARS-COV-2","Background : The concept of immunothrombosis has established as a central pathogenic factor leading to thrombosis complications, respiratory failure, and a multiple organ failure in patents with COVID-19. Studying of the hypercoagulability in patients with COVID-19 could be useful for improving of disease's outcomes. Estimation of anticoagulants efficiency can be informative for thrombotic risk assessment. The highest interest presents protein C system, because, as we know, infection and inflammation lead to disfunction of this anticoagulant system. Aims : To estimate the efficiency of protein C anticoagulant system in COVID-19 patients. Methods : The study included 60 patients with COVID-19 and 21 healthy controls . Thrombin generation was assessed by CAT according to Hemker et al. Measure was conducted in platelet poor plasma with or without presence of thrombomodulin. The following parameters were determined: endogenous thrombin potential (ETP, nM*min), peak thrombin (Peak, nM). Sensitivity ETP and Peak for thrombomodulin were calculated as percent of decreasing of these parameters after adding thrombomodulin to the assay. Reduction of sensitivity for thrombomodulin indicates dysfunction of anticoagulant protein C system. Protein C activity and free protein S level were measured by 'ACL ELIT PRO', Instrumentation Laboratory, USA. STATISTICA 12.0 package was used. Results are presented as median with 95% confidence intervals, P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant (*). Results : Sensitivity ETP and Peak for thrombomodulin, protein C activity and free protein S level are presented in the table. Conclusions : The efficiency of protein C anticoagulant system is depressed in COVID-19 patients. It may be associate with protein S level decreasing. The disability of anticoagulant protein C system can lead to hypercoagulability and it may be cause of thrombotic complication.","Matvienko, O.; Korsakova, N.; Lerner, A.; Shvedova, T.; Papayan, L.; Golovina, O.","https://doi.org/10.1002/rth2.12589","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Research and Practice in Thrombosis and Haemostasis; 5(SUPPL 2), 2021.; Publication details: Research and Practice in Thrombosis and Haemostasis; 5(SUPPL 2), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22044,""
"Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic on Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer in Canada: A National Survey","Background and Aims: Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs) diagnosed with cancer encounter unique challenges and suboptimal health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered many societal changes that have further impacted these domains and require exploration to provide comprehensive care to them. Our study sought to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and cancer care of AYAs with cancer living in Canada. Methods: We conducted an online, voluntary, self-administered, cross-sectional, 49-item bilingual survey of AYAs with cancer living in Canada from January to February 2021. The survey included Kessler Psychological Distress Scale to assess psychological distress (k-10), Insomnia Severity Index to evaluate sleep and the UCLA loneliness scale to measure loneliness. Univariable and multivariable analyses were done to find the correlates of high psychological distress and negative impact on cancer care. Self-reported free text items underwent qualitative thematic analysis. Results: The survey was completed by 1063 participants, of which 805 responses (mean age Â± SD: 30.27 Â± 5.27 years) were included in the analysis. The high psychological distress (K-10= 25) was present in 68% of AYAs. Independent associations of high psychological distress included the presence of clinical insomnia, loneliness and pre-existing chronic health conditions. Nearly one-fourth had their cancer affected impacted by pandemic: delayed or cancellations of appointments (16%), diagnostic tests (12%), or treatments (11%). AYAs with a pre-existing mental or chronic health condition were at increased risk for having a negative impact of the pandemic on their cancer care. Common themes for optimizing cancer care during and after pandemic included improving healthcare visits, enhancing personalized care, and strategies for preventing COVID-19. Conclusions: AYAs with chronic physical or mental health conditions are at higher risk of experiencing inferior outcomes during this pandemic. Enhanced mental and physical health supports, personalized care, and patient engagement may help optimize the care of AYAs with cancer.","Howden, K.; Glidden, C.; Romanescu, R.; Hatala, A.; Garland, S.; Deleemans, J.; Scott, I.; Gupta, A.; Chalifour, K.; Eaton, G.; Bolton, J.; Mahar, A.; Oberoi, S.","https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.29349","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Pediatric Blood and Cancer; 68(SUPPL 5), 2021.; Publication details: Pediatric Blood and Cancer; 68(SUPPL 5), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22045,""
"The economic and social impact of COVID-19 on tourism and hospitality industry: A case study from Oman","The COVID-19 pandemic has incurred a substantial economic and social impact around the world. Many sectors have been drastically affected but the tourism and hospitality industry was one of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 outbreak globally. The coronavirus pandemic has caused direct losses of half-billion Omani Rial to the tourism sector. This pandemic has also exacerbated the mental health of business owners of the tourism and hospitality industry in Oman. This research aims to investigate the economic and social impacts of COVID-19 on the tourism and hospitality sector of Oman. The data was collected from business owners of micro, small, medium, and large size-companies operating in the tourism and hospitality industry. A structured questionnaire was distributed and data collection was done from September 2020 to January 2021. The finding of the study reveals a negative economic and social impact on the tourism and hospitality industry of Oman due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The economic impact includes financial loss, reduction in customer demand at a national and international level, disruptions in the logistics and distribution channels, ruined the relationship with suppliers, customers, and employees. The social impact included depression, irritation, anxiety, and stress among the business owners about the present and future conditions. This study has given valuable suggestion to mitigate the negative economic and social impact on the tourism and hospitality industry of Oman. The finding of the study will support the government to boost the tourism and hospitality industry in Oman.

"Leveraging COVID-19 vaccination to enhance hcv testing in priority populations","Background: Intersecting priority populations are disproportionately affected by HCV and COVID-19;including people who use drugs, those with mental health issues, and those who are homeless/street-involved. COVID-19 vaccine clinics present an opportunity for co-localization of HCV testing by leveraging resources and infrastructure that promote COVID-19 vaccination among these populations. Methods: HHCV Ab point-of-care testing (POCT) was offered at two COVID-19 vaccination sites: the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto, ON and the Ontario Addiction Treatment Centre (OATC) in North Bay, ON. Vaccine recipients (VRs) were staff, community members, or patients (CAMH);or patients and household members (OATC). HCV outreach workers approached VRs for testing, which was promoted by clinic staff. At OATC, VRs received a $5 coffee card incentive to undergo testing. At both sites, Ab POCT was done by fingerprick (OraQuick) during or after a 15-minute post-vaccine observation period. Results were provided after 5 minutes based on prior data showing this approach detects all viremic individuals (VIRCAN 5-Minute Rule). Dried blood spot (DBS) samples were collected by fingerprick for HCV RNA testing following Ab+ results. Results: CAMH - 2759 individuals received vaccine over 12 days (mean 230/day, range 102-350). 621 (23%) underwent Ab POCT (mean 52/day, range 16-106). The mean age was 46 yrs (range 12-87) and 307 (49%) were male. Staff constituted 55% of tested VRs with a positivity rate of 0% compared to 2.2% in patients/community members. Of 6 Ab+ individuals, 5 DBS samples were collected and 2 were RNA+. One Ab+ individual was counseled by phone to follow up for RNA testing due to a late Ab+ result (20'). OATC - 150 individuals received vaccine over 9 days (mean 17/day, range 11-33). 27 (18%) were recruited for Ab POCT (mean 3/day, range 0-10). The mean age was 37 yrs (range 25-56) and 14 (52%) were male. Seven individuals were known to be Ab+ and DBS samples were collected from each, of which 4 were RNA+. The remaining 20 individuals were all Ab- by POCT. Outreach and linkage to care is ongoing at both sites. Conclusion: Co-localization of HCV testing with COVID-19 vaccination enables reaching and re-engaging populations with a tenuous link to the healthcare system. HCV Ab POCT with the VIRCAN 5-Minute Rule followed by DBS sample collection is a quick, low-barrier approach that enables high throughput and ensures complete diagnosis of HCV.","Vanderhoff, A.; Biondi, M.

"Anxiety in cirrhosis: A prospective study on prevalence and development of a practical screening nomogram","Background: Anxiety is often under-diagnosed and undertreated in cirrhosis. To date, research on mood disorders in cirrhosis has mainly focused on depression, which is common and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Data on anxiety is limited, with little research studying the impact of anxiety on clinical outcomes. The prevalence of anxiety on cirrhosis remains poorly established. This is increasingly relevant during COVID-19, as the prevalence of anxiety has increased further within the general population. We used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to determine prevalence of anxiety and its association with clinical outcomes in cirrhosis, and developed a rapid cirrhosis-specific anxiety screening nomogram. Methods: We recruited patients with cirrhosis, aged 18-80, from three tertiary care clinics in Alberta. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) was used to screen for anxiety, as it is free of influence from somatic symptoms. Anxiety was diagnosed using the MINI within the same visit. The chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ) and EQ-VAS score were used to determine health related quality of life (HrQoL). Patients were followed virtually for up to 6 months to determine whether they had unplanned hospitalizations or deaths. Results: Of the 369 patients, 65 were excluded for being on anti-depressants, leaving a total of 304 patients for analysis. Using the MINI, we diagnosed anxiety in 17.1% of patients, with 8.2% also having comorbid depression. Anxious patients had lower HrQoL as assessed by CLDQ (P&lt;0.001) and EQ-VAS (P&lt;0.001), and had higher levels of frailty as determined by the Clinical Frailty Scale (P=0.004). We found no statistically significant difference in hospitalizations or death, in 6 months of followup, between anxious and non-anxious patients (P=0.14). The 8.2% of patients meeting diagnostic criteria for both anxiety and depression had worse CLDQ, EQ-VAS and Clinical Frailty scores than anxious-only or depressed-only patients. Multivariable analysis revealed active smoking and 3 HADS subcomponents as independent predictors of anxiety which were used to develop a screening nomogram for anxiety. Conclusion: In this pre-COVID-19 prospective study, we found anxiety to be prevalent with approximately one in five patients with cirrhosis being diagnosed with anxiety. Anxiety is associated with lower HrQoL and higher levels of frailty. As such, diagnosing and treating anxiety is clinically relevant and may improve HrQoL. By providing physicians with a short and easy to use screening tool, we are encouraging integration of anxiety screening into routine cirrhosis clinic visits with further testing for diagnosis and subsequent treatment as applicable. The developed cirrhosis-specific nomogram requires validation, but is promising for rapidly screening for anxiety within the cirrhosis population.","Patel, K.; Dang, T.; Farhat, K.; Abraldes, J.

"The COVID-19 Pandemic: Teacher Candidates' Views Regarding the Virus and Vaccination Process","In order for societies to normalize in educational, economic, social and mental health areas, the COVID-19 pandemic must be ended as soon as possible. Currently, the most critical factor in eliminating the pandemic seems to be the vaccine. Vaccination is one of the most successful public health interventions and is a cornerstone for communicable disease prevention. Both current teachers and teacher candidates should be competent in the field of health literacy as well as in the education and training process. In this study, we tried to reveal the views of teacher candidates regarding COVID-19 and its vaccines based on the studies reporting that anti-vaccination increased in individuals with more education. Six hundred thirty-eight teacher candidates participated in the study. The research data were collected through an 11-item questionnaire, and the data were analyzed using descriptive and cross-tabulation analyzes. Research findings mainly showed that vaccine acceptance was low, and most of the participants thought the virus is artificial. Another finding of the research revealed that most of the participants who complied with all the rules regarding COVID-19 did not get the virus;however, it was seen that nearly all of the participants who caught COVID-19 had an infected individual in their family. Given the importance of vaccination, measures should be taken for vaccination hesitation and rejection.","Salman, Muhammed, Akcaoglu, Mustafa Ã–ztÃ¼rk, ErgÃ¼n, Muammer","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+COVID-19+Pandemic:+Teacher+Candidates'+Views+Regarding+the+Virus+and+Vaccination+Process","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Educational Policy Analysis and Strategic Research; 16(3):150-166, 2021.; Publication details: Educational Policy Analysis and Strategic Research; 16(3):150-166, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22054,""
"The Nexus of Climate Change, COVID-19, and Environmental Justice on Children's Health","Climate change poses a threat to children, who are increasingly vulnerable, depending on adults to protect them from the impacts of these changes including extreme weather events, poor air and water quality and risk to mental health. Children living in poverty carry additional burdens and risks, living in environments that consistently experience poor air and water quality from polluting industries, compounded by the effects of climate change. COVID-19 has placed additional challenges to children's health and increases the complexity of addressing climate change and environmental justice. The intersection between climate change and COVID-19 exacerbates these existing disparities by impacting children's physical and mental health that are a direct product of poverty and structural racism. This article examines the nexus of climate change, COVID-19, and environmental justice that impacts the mental and physical health of children including anxiety, stress, adverse childhood experiences, and depression;increases in violence and aggression;and the effects of air pollution. Public health professionals and health care providers must be aware of national strategies that protect children from environmental health risks and emerging infectious diseases, such as climate change and COVID-19, respectively. Key Take Away Points: (1) Anthropogenic climate change poses a threat to the health of children, especially of those in marginalized communities;(2) COVID-19 has exacerbated these detrimental health impacts for children experiencing the effects of climate change;and (3) There are opportunities to protect children's health through equitable polices and programs.","Pennea, Emma, Anderko, Laura, Moore, Caroline, McDermott-Levy, Ruth","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Nexus+of+Climate+Change,+COVID-19,+and+Environmental+Justice+on+Children's+Health","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Applied Research on Children; 12(1), 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Applied Research on Children; 12(1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22055,""

"Psychological impact of covid-19 in the general population of india: A cross-sectional study during lockdown 30","A COVID-19 pandemic has caused public health crisis across the globe. People are under insurmountable psychological pressure which may lead to various psychological problems, such as anxiety, fear, depression, and insomnia. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in India to better understand their psychological distress, associated risk factors after one month of nationwide lock-down during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A cross-sectional, observational study was carried out in India. We used snowball sampling technique and the data was collected using an online self-designed semi-structured questionnaire developed by using google forms. Results: Findings revealed significant rise in perceived susceptibility to COVID-19. Around 62% were dreaded of COVID-19 infection and perceived to be at risk of the same. A significant association was found between perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and psychological distress (p value = 0.007) as well as between psychological distress with not having family around during lockdown (p value = 0.012). Discussion: As disease progresses, the psychological distress levels were also influenced by rising cases, media exposure, lock-down, and prevention and control measures taken against the epidemic situation. The Health Belief Model advocates that only those individuals who perceive themselves at risk of developing a disease will engage in behaviours to reduce their risk of developing the disease. Considering high perceived susceptibility for COVID-19, stimulus should be provided to the population for eliciting health promotion behaviours among them. The health promotion messages should be delivered using a mix of various effective communication strategies.","Kotwani, P.; Patwardhan, V.; Pandya, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+impact+of+covid-19+in+the+general+population+of+india:+A+cross-sectional+study+during+lockdown+3.0","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: International Journal on Disability and Human Development; 20(3):281-285, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal on Disability and Human Development; 20(3):281-285, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22059,""
"Biosocial ""Science Talk"": Using Informal Interactive Programs to Help Children Explore the Human Body's Relationship with the World around It","This paper describes the application of a ""biosocial"" approach to informal health and science education. As an engagement between biological and critical social sciences, biosocial theory has sought to re-articulate human bodies as fundamentally the product of interrelationships between the biological and social dimensions of human life. Applying this approach to health and science education, we conducted approximately 200 public demonstrations at a science museum with school-aged participants over a two-year period. These demonstrations were designed to describe cutting edge research into ""biosocial mechanisms"" such as allostatic load and epigenetics. We examined survey responses and informal conversation with participants in order to characterize key themes that emerged within these interactions. Our analysis identifies a distinct biosocial ""science talk"" characterized, at varying degrees of complexity, by an emphasis on complex inter-relationships between environments and biology, the mutability of bodies, and the role of social structures and personal experiences in shaping health outcomes. We argue that these forms of science talk reflect the highly individualized and relational functioning of the biosocial mechanisms. We contend that this approach is not only accessible and easily adaptable to informal science education, but of increasing relevance given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kinsey, Dirk, Hayes-Conroy, Allison, Das, Jayatri","https://www.google.com/search?q=Biosocial+Science+Talk:+Using+Informal+Interactive+Programs+to+Help+Children+Explore+the+Human+Body's+Relationship+with+the+World+around+It","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of STEM Outreach; 4(1), 2021.; Publication details: Journal of STEM Outreach; 4(1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22060,""
"Student Attitude to Distance Education: Pros and Cons","This article is aimed at identifying the peculiarities of students' attitude to distance education. As a leading method, the questionnaire method was used, which made it possible to identify the students' positive and negative attitudes regarding distance learning more effectively. The article considers students' ideas about distance learning, identifies the positive and negative aspects of the distance learning process. The authors of the article in the process of research revealed that many students of various fields of study are interested in participating in distance courses, but within the framework of mastering a second education. Some students note the usefulness of distance courses, the use of their materials at any time, and the convenience of going back to the materials they have completed at any time to fill in gaps or recall a topic. Some students reported a violation of the educational process in the distance format due to the repeated lack of Internet or its poor quality. Most of the students expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of contact communication in the distance learning process. It is proved that the majority of students believe that distance education will never replace traditional education. Mainly students of technical areas of study gave a negative assessment of the distance education system. It was revealed that students of various fields of study took distance courses that were held in other cities or countries. From the point of view of many students, educational websites have an inconvenient interface.","Illarionova, Lyudmila P.; Karzhanova, Natalya V.; Ishmuradova, Alfia M.; Nazarenko, Sergey V.; Korzhuev, Andrey V.; Ryazanova, Elena L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Student+Attitude+to+Distance+Education:+Pros+and+Cons","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Cypriot Journal of Educational Sciences; 16(3):1319-1327, 2021.; Publication details: Cypriot Journal of Educational Sciences; 16(3):1319-1327, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22061,""
"Compliance with 24-hour movement recommendations and health in university students during COVID-19 confinement","Objectives: i) examine the proportion of university students who meet Canadian 24- hour movement guidelines (Sleep + Screen + Physical Activity) during COVID-19 lockdown;ii) determine the physical and mental health risks associated with non-adherence with Canadian 24-hour movement guidelines. Method: a convenience sample of 98 university students (64 boys and 34 girls), aged 18-25 years, attending the Sports Science degree at University of Tras-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Portugal, were include. Self-reported physical activity was measured with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), screen time was assessed with two questions reporting the total of hours and minutes, per weekday or weekend, the students spend watching videos and playing video games, as well as the duration and quality of sleep during the weekdays or on weekends. Results: only 30.6% of the students meet the guidelines for sleep plus physical activity and sedentary behavior. Multivariate logistic regression shows that the variables associated with non-compliance with any of the recommendations are: father's professional status, unemployed or lay-off (OR=10.412, 95% CI: 1.256-86.325), poor and average health perception (OR=24.213, 95%CI: 1.323-443.074) and the quality of sleep, who never and sometimes sleeps well (OR=8.896, 95%CI: 1.807-43.788).

"Follow up for covid-19 in belfast city hospital","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic of Spring 2020, Belfast City Hospital functioned as Belfastâ€™s Nightingale facility. Evidence published during this time focused mainly on the acute management of the condition. Guidance on follow up and long-term management for patients recovering from COVID-19 was sparse. A specialist COVID-19 follow up service was devised in Belfast City Hospital led by a respiratory physician with physiotherapy and psychology input. Methods: Data was collected on all patients admitted to Belfast Nightingale unit. Patients admitted to Intensive Care at any stage in their admission were followed up separately by Intensive Care. Initial consultation was via telephone call for all eligible patients six weeks post discharge, followed by face-to-face consultation for those with symptoms at next available appointment, and a further face-to-face consultation at twelve weeks post hospital discharge. Patients were seen by respiratory physician, physiotherapy and psychology at each appointment. All patients who had initial changes on chest radiograph had 12 week follow up radiograph requested as per British Thoracic Society guidelines. Results: 29 patients were followed up after hospitalisation with COVID-19. Of these, 10 were brought for face-to-face consultations. Patients at clinic were all functionally independent with a median Medical Research Council dyspnoea score of 2 and a subjective assessment of their current health of median 50, on a visual analogue scale 0-100. Fatigue was common with all patients. Depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder were all reported from psychological review. Chest radiograph showed signs of improvement in 100% of clinic attendees. 90% of patients seen in clinic had normal or chronic obstructive patterns on spirometry, with one patient having a reduced transfer factor. Conclusion: Majority of patients did not require face-to-face review and were recovering well. Of the 10 patients seen in the respiratory led clinic, the main issues reported were fatigue and psychological issues. Respiratory symptoms were significantly improving in 9 out of the 10 patients seen. All patients have been introduced to psychology service whilst at clinic and will continue to receive necessary support.","Donaghy, A.

"Sources of Distress and Coping Strategies Among Emergency Physicians During COVID-19","Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been shown to increase levels of psychological distress among healthcare workers. Little is known, however, about specific positive and negative individual and organizational factors that affect the mental health of emergency physicians (EP) during COVID-19. Our objective was to assess these factors in a broad geographic sample of EPs in the United States. Methods: We conducted an electronic, prospective, cross-sectional national survey of EPs from October 6â€“December 29, 2020. Measures assessed negative mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and insomnia), positive work-related outcomes, and strategies used to cope with COVID-19. After preliminary analyses and internal reliability testing, we performed four separate three-stage hierarchical multiple regression analyses to examine individual and organizational predictive factors for psychological distress. Results: Response rate was 50%, with 517 EPs completing the survey from 11 different sites. Overall, 85% of respondents reported negative psychological effects due to COVID-19. Participants reported feeling more stressed (31%), lonelier (26%), more anxious (25%), more irritable (24%) and sadder (17.5%). Prevalence of mental health conditions was 17% for depression, 13% for anxiety, 7.5% for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 18% for insomnia. Regular exercise decreased from 69% to 56%, while daily alcohol use increased from 8% to 15%. Coping strategies of behavioral disengagement, self-blame, and venting were significant predictors of psychological distress, while humor and positive reframing were negatively associated with psychological distress. Conclusion: Emergency physicians have experienced high levels of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those using avoidant coping strategies were most likely to experience depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD, while humor and positive reframing were effective coping strategies.","Dehon, Erin, Zachrison, Kori S.; Peltzer-Jones, Jennifer, Tabatabai, Ramin R.; Clair, Elizabeth, Puskarich, Michael A.; Ondeyka, Amy, Dixon-Gordon, Katherine, Walter, Lauren A.; Situ-LaCasse, Elaine H.; Fix, Megan L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Sources+of+Distress+and+Coping+Strategies+Among+Emergency+Physicians+During+COVID-19","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: The Western Journal of Emergency Medicine; 22(6), 2021.; Publication details: The Western Journal of Emergency Medicine; 22(6), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22066,""

"Many patients with cancer are experiencing loneliness and related symptoms during the Covid-19 pandemic","The researchers note that while previous pre- and during COVID-19 studies found links between loneliness and the symptoms of anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and pain, this study is the first to evaluate all of these symptoms in the same group of patients. In addition to this sense of loneliness, they may be having feelings of anxiety, sadness, and fatigue, as well as problems sleeping and high rates of unrelieved pain - all at the same time,â€ said lead author Christine Miaskowski, RN, PhD, FAAN, of the University of California, San Francisco. [...]to decrease these feelings, patients and survivors can develop a schedule of social interactions;develop a structure to their daily activities;engage in regular exercise particularly in the outdoors;use stress reduction exercises;and eat a healthy diet.â€","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Many+patients+with+cancer+are+experiencing+loneliness+and+related+symptoms+during+the+Covid-19+pandemic","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Saudi Medical Journal; 42(7):803-804, 2021.; Publication details: Saudi Medical Journal; 42(7):803-804, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22070,""
"Adolescentsâ€™ Social Environment and Executive Functions Predict Long-term Mental Health and Feelings of Future Uncertainty Throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted adolescentsâ€™ mental health (i.e. mood and life satisfaction). Some adolescents are at risk to be disproportionally hit by the pandemic due to vulnerabilities in their social environment. In the present longitudinal study, we explored adolescentsâ€™ mood trajectories throughout the pandemic, and whether vulnerabilities in the social environment (i.e. household and socioeconomic hardship) predicted adolescentsâ€™ mental health directly and indirectly through feelings of uncertainty about the future. We also investigated whether executive functions and age buffered these relationships. In total, 177 Dutch-speaking adolescents aged 10 â€“ 18 years (Mage = 15.64, SDage = 1.72, 80% females at T1) participated in all three waves (T1= May 2020, T2 = November 2020, T3 = May 2021) of an online survey. Mood results demonstrated that feelings of vigor stabilized, after an initial dip between T1 and T2, but that feelings of tension and depression continued to increase throughout the pandemic. Higher exposure to household and socioeconomic hardship predicted negative mood and lower life satisfaction and was mediated by feelings of uncertainty about the future. Irrespective of the exposure to household and socioeconomic hardship, adolescents with better executive functions reported better mood in the aftermath of the pandemic, partially due to lower feelings of future uncertainty. However, no associations were observed with life satisfaction. These novel findings imply that adolescentsâ€™ mental health issues may outlast the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, executive functioning is a protective factor operating via feelings of future uncertainty, which makes them promising mechanistic targets for intervention.","Green, Kayla, Becht, Andrik, van de Groep, Suzanne, van der Cruijsen, Renske, Sweijen, Sophie, Crone, Eveline","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/zpy25","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22071,""
"Predicting Depression and Anxiety Among Adults with Disabilities During the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Purpose/Objective: Emerging research has highlighted sources of magnified stress and trauma for people with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, as compared to others in the general population. However, little research has examined the mental health impact of the pandemic on people with disabilities in relation to disability-related stigma, social isolation, and demographic characteristics. The present study therefore sought to identify predictors of depression and anxiety symptoms among U.S. adults with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.Research Methods/Designs: Data were collected online between October and December 2020. U.S. adults with disabilities (n = 441) completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, psychosocial processes, and a range of demographic and disability characteristics. Results: In our sample, 61.0% and 50.0% of participants met criteria for a probable diagnosis of major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, respectively. Participants also experienced significantly higher levels of disability-related stigma and social isolation compared to pre-pandemic norms. Hierarchical regression analyses identified higher social isolation, presence of chronic pain, younger age, higher disability-related stigma, and higher worries about contracting COVID-19 as significant predictors of both depression and anxiety symptoms.Conclusion/implications: This study highlights important demographic and psychosocial predictors of mental health risks for people with disabilities in the context of COVID-19. Findings further underscore the need to attend to those at elevated risk within the disability community as rehabilitation professionals, disability organizations, and policymakers work to support people with disabilities in post-pandemic recovery and create a more equitable response to ongoing and future public health crises.","Adler, Jonathan, Wang, Katie","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/zne42","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22072,""
"Changes in youth mental health, psychological wellbeing, and substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid review (preprint)","Background: The focus of this review was to assess changes in youth mental health, psychological wellbeing, or substance use, as well as changes or disruptions to the delivery of mental health or substance use services for young people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: We conducted a rapid review of the literature on our outcomes of interest among youth (age &lt;=25) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary studies and systematic reviews on change were eligible for inclusion. Searches were conducted in PubMed and Embase in May 2021, and two reviewers screened studies for inclusion. We report results using a narrative synthesis. Results: We included 156 primary publications. A variety of methods were used to assess change, including prospective assessment of longitudinal cohorts, retrospective recall by participants in cross-sectional and qualitative studies, and comparison of peri-pandemic data to pre-pandemic normative values. Publications regarding mental health (n = 121) and psychological wellbeing (n = 26) generally indicated poor outcomes during the pandemic period. Publications on substance use (n = 41) revealed overall declines or unchanged patterns of use, though certain groups reported increased or problematic use. Studies of service delivery (n = 11) indicated a generally positive reception for helplines and telehealth, although some youth experienced difficulties accessing mental health services. Conclusions: The evidence indicates negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on young peopleâ€™s mental health, although declines in alcohol and nicotine use were also found. Services will need to continue to adapt as the pandemic progresses, particularly to support disadvantaged youth who lack access to telehealth resources.","Zolopa, Camille, Burack, Jacob, O'Connor, Roisin, Corran, Charlotte, Lai, Jessica, Bomfim, Emiliana, DeGrace, Sarah, Dumont, Julianne, Larney, Sarah, Wendt, Dennis Charles","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/yuthm","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22073,""
"Factors predicting anxiety and depression symptoms among migrant workers in the Greater China area during the early COVID-19 pandemic: A brief report (preprint)","This study briefly reported the prevalence and factors predicting anxiety and depression symptoms among migrant workers in the Greater China area. An online survey was conducted between February and March 2020 among Indonesian migrant workers in Macau, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Data from 491 participants were analyzed using a series of hierarchical logistic regression. The prevalence rates for clinically meaningful symptoms of anxiety and depression were 31.8% and 26.9%, respectively. Factors predicting anxiety symptoms were age, marital status, income level, educational level, and Cantonese fluency. Older participants, married, have higher income and education, and are more fluent in Cantonese were less likely to experience anxiety than their counterparts. Factors predicting depression symptoms were age, marital status, English fluency, and Cantonese fluency. Older participants, married, and more fluent in English and Cantonese were less likely to experience depression than their counterparts. Stakeholders should consider these findings in public health planning to make it more inclusive for migrant workers.","Liem, Andrian","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/vpfyx","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22074,""
"Maternal Prenatal Somatization, Postnatal Depression, and Offspring Temperament During the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background. Researchers have begun to examine the psychological toll of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. Data are now emerging indicating that there may be long-term adverse effects of the pandemic on new mothers and on children born during this period. Methods. In a longitudinal study of maternal mental health and child emotional development during the pandemic, we conducted online assessments of a cohort of women at two time points: when they were pregnant at the beginning of the surge of the pandemic in the United States (N=725), and approximately one year postpartum (N=296), examining prenatal and postnatal maternal mental health symptoms and infant temperament. Results. Prenatal maternal symptoms of somatization, the number of people in the household with COVID-19 symptoms, and postnatal maternal depressive symptoms all were positively associated with infant negative affect. Further, postnatal maternal depressive symptoms mediated the relation between prenatal maternal symptoms of somatization and infant negative affect. Conclusions. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the persistence of mental health symptoms in potentially vulnerable groups and of the emotional development of children who were in utero during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Buthmann, Jessica Louise, Gotlib, Ian","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/sryx8","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22075,""
"Comparison of The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Saudi Nationals Arriving from Foreign Countries during Institutional Quarantine and After Being Released: An Analytical Cross-Sectional Study Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2021 (preprint)","Background: Being quarantined is an unpleasant experience for the persons who undergo it. Several studies showed there is a high prevalence of mental illnesses during quarantine which range from stress, depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, irritability, low mood, and insomnia. Objectives: This study aims to estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress due being quarantined for 14 days in individuals who returned to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from outside the country during COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 at one of the Ministry of Health designated quarantine centers and reassess participants a year after being released from the quarantine center to compare the outcomes. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study that employed 138 participants. Result: In terms of depression, 91 of the 138 individuals were categorized as normal, with 24 and 13 cases scoring mild and severe, respectively. Nine people, on the other hand, received extreme depression ratings based on their responses, with only one case being categorized as really severe depression. Anxiety levels were measured in this study's subjects. Six patients reported severe anxiety throughout the quarantine period, while 15 others had mild anxiety. Fortunately, the number of persons suffering from severe and moderate anxiety decreased after a year, with only one severe case and three reasonable examples left. At the time of quarantine, all 138 people were classified as normal (n=108), mild stress (n=19), or moderate stress (n=11). A year later, 126 people scored normal, ten people scored mild, and just two people rated significantly when their stress levels were assessed. Conclusion: The findings suggest that persons who are not in quarantine, and especially those who are in quarantine, require psychological assistance. People's health is more important than ever before, because a country's development is defined by the well-being of its citizens and investors.","Sakib, Nazmuz","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/qxuer","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22076,""
"Feasibility of an Online Acute Stressor in Preschool Children of Mothers with Depression (preprint)","Maternal depression is a risk factor for future mental health problems in offspring, with stress-system function as a candidate vulnerability factor. Here we present initial validation of an online matching-task paradigm in young children exposed to maternal depression (N=40), a first in stressor-paradigm research for this age group. Investigations of stress-system reactivity that can be conducted online are an innovative assessment approach, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicate high feasibility, with ~80% success across measures, similar-to or better-than in-person success rates in young children. Overall, the online matching task elicited significant HR but not cortisol reactivity. Individual differences in child mental health symptoms were a moderator of reactivity to the stressor such that children with lower, but not higher, behavioural problems exhibited the expected pattern of cortisol reactivity to the online matching task. Results are aligned with allostatic load models, which suggest down-regulation of stress-system reactivity as a result of experiencing adversity and mental health vulnerability. Consistent with in-person research, this suggests an early phenotype for the emergence of behaviour problems may be linked to altered stress-system reactivity. Results hold potential clinical implications for intervention development and the future of online stress-system research.","Paton, Allyson, Stienwandt, Shaelyn, Penner-Goeke, Lara, Giuliano, Ryan Jeffrey, Roos, Leslie","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/qtnxs","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22077,""
"The role of anxiety in mediating the relationship between information consumption and COVID-19 protective behaviours (preprint)","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns have been raised about an â€˜infodemicâ€™, with information and misinformation being spread across multiple channels and mediums. Information consumption has also been associated with increased anxiety throughout the pandemic. Thus, the present study investigates the mediating role of state anxiety on the relationship between information consumption (defined as mean frequency of information consumption multiplied by number of information sources) and COVID-19 protective behaviours. We compare results across Australian and United States samples and account for personal risk perception and belief in misinformation about COVID-19. Cross-sectional data collected between 28 and 30 April 2020 were analysed using Bayesian structural equation modelling among participants from Australia (N = 201), and the United States (N = 306). State anxiety scores were above the conventional clinical cut-off. Information consumption was positively associated with state anxiety, personal risk perception, and COVID-19 protective behaviours in the Australian and the United States samples. Additionally, the relationship between information consumption and COVID-19 protective behaviours was positively mediated by state anxiety in both nations, suggesting some functional benefits of anxiety. Differences in risk perception and belief in misinformation existed between the Australian and United States sample. Findings provide support for current guidance from organisations such as the WHO, APA, and APS on limiting information consumption to reduce anxiety. To effectively communicate critical public health messaging while minimising potential burdens on mental health, there is a need to develop and test interventions that assist people in calibrating the extent and nature of their information consumption.","van Antwerpen, Natasha, Searston, Rachel, Turnbull, Deborah","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/pb9jm","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22078,""
"Ecological systems contributors to internalizing symptoms in a national sample of adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Internalizing problems are common in adolescence and increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Leveraging data from a U.S. nationally diverse sample of 2,954 adolescents (ages 13-16), we examined the associations between factors at multiple levels of youthsâ€™ ecologies â€“ spanning indicators of threat and deprivation â€“ and their depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we examined how these associations differed by adolescentsâ€™ racial/ethnic groups. Consistent with socio-ecological models, we found that indicators of threat and deprivation at the adolescentsâ€™ immediate home, and more distal neighborhood environments were associated with their depression and anxiety symptoms. The patterns of associations were similar across racial/ethnic groups in multigroup structural equation models. Additionally, we found that mean levels of internalizing symptoms and socio-ecological predictors significantly differed across racial/ethnic groups. These findings have important implications for understanding multi-level contributors to mental health among adolescents which may inform research, practice, and policy.","Thorpe, Daneele, Mirhashem, Rebecca, Shen, Jenny, Roulston, Chantelle, Fox, Kathryn, Schleider, Jessica","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/hvy8q","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22079,""
"The impacts of COVID-19 on eating disorders and disordered eating: A mixed studies systematic review and implications for healthcare professionals, carers, and self (preprint)","Objective: The unique constraints to everyday life brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic have been shown to negatively impact those with pre-existing mental health issues such as eating disorders. While individuals with eating disorders or disordered eating behaviours represent a vulnerable group to COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the pandemic is yet to be fully established. As such, we systematically examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating disorders and disordered eating behaviours. Method: We searched electronic databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE for literature published until October 2021. Eligible studies were required to report on individuals with or without a diagnosed eating disorder or disordered eating behaviours who were exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Seventy-two studies met eligibility criteria with the majority supporting an increase in eating disorder or disordered eating behaviours associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, children and adolescents and individuals with a diagnosed eating disorder present a vulnerable group to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: This systematic review provides a timely insight into COVID-19 eating disorder literature and will assist in understanding possible future long-term impacts of the pandemic on eating disorders behaviours. It appears that the role of stress in the development and maintenance of eating disorders was intensified as a means to cope with the uncertainty of the pandemic. Future research is needed among understudied and minority groups and to examine the long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating disorders and disordered eating behaviours.","McLean, Courtney, Utpala, Ranjani, Sharp, Gemma","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/f27y8","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22080,""
"Construction and validation of a scale to measure loneliness and isolation during social distancing and its effect on mental health (preprint)","A variety of factors contribute to the degree to which a person feels lonely and socially isolated. These factors may be particularly relevant in times requiring social distancing, e.g., during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present the Loneliness and Isolation during Social Distancing (LISD) Scale. Extending existing trait measures, the LISD scale assesses loneliness and isolation on a state and trait level and reliably predicts individual differences in anxiety and depression. Data were collected online from two independent samples. Scale validation was based on exploratory factor analysis (EFA;Sample 1, N = 244) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA;Sample 2, N = 307). Multiple regression analyses were used to assess how the LISD scale predicts state anxiety and depression. The LISD scale showed satisfactory fit in both samples. Its five factors indicate loneliness and isolation, sociability and sense of belonging, social support, closeness, and connectedness. The LISD scale showed strong predictive power for state anxiety and depression, explaining 33% and 51% of variance, respectively. Anxiety and depression scores are particularly predicted by state feelings of loneliness and isolation as well as low dispositional sociability and sense of belonging. In turn, state loneliness and isolation are predicted by social support, connectedness and closeness (state and trait).We provide a novel scale which distinguishes between acute and general loneliness and isolation, while also capturing related protective and risk factors for mental health. The LISD scale could be a valuable addition to the assessment of mental health factors impacted by social distancing.","GrÃ¼ndahl, Marthe, WeiÃŸ, Martin, Maier, Lisa, Hewig, Johannes, Deckert, JÃ¼rgen, Hein, Grit","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/f7rp6","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22081,""
"Goal adjustment capacities in uncontrollable life circumstances: Benefits for psychological well-being during COVID-19 (preprint)","Goal adjustment capacities (i.e., goal disengagement and goal reengagement) are core self-regulatory resources theorized to buffer psychological well-being during intractable life circumstances. However, research has yet to examine whether these capacities protect well-being for individuals who encounter uncontrollable losses in their ability to pursue important life goals due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a nationally-representative sample of American adults aged 18-80 (n = 292), the present longitudinal study examined the influence of goal disengagement and reengagement on levels and change in psychological well-being for individuals who differed in perceived control over their goals early in the pandemic. Results from multilevel growth models showed that goal reengagement, but not goal disengagement, capacities predicted higher levels of well-being (lower perceived stress, depressive symptoms;higher life satisfaction, meaning in life) for individuals who reported pandemic-induced declines in control over their goals. Findings inform theories of motivation and self-regulation and point to the adaptive value of goal reengagement capacities during uncontrollable life circumstances.","Hamm, Jeremy, Tan, Jaron, Barlow, Meaghan, Delaney, Rachel, Duggan, Katherine Anne","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ej3k5","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22082,""
"Major depression among men and women in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","A multidimensional index that measures the health status of individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic has been developed. The COVID-19 Health Status Scale (CHSS), a combination of previously studied and newly created health status scales, assesses the physical, mental, and social well-being of adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study aimed to examine the differences between men and women in self-reported past major depressive disorder diagnosis during the COVID-19 lockdown in the United States using the CHSS self administered questionnaire. Participants were recruited using convenience sampling performed online through the SurveyMonkey Audience. The self-administered CHSS questionnaire has been pilot tested in an adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in the US. The study sample size included 173 participants aged 18 years and older. Results revealed that almost one-third of the study participants (31.2%) reported being diagnosed with past major depressive disorder, whereas 68.8% reported no past major depressive disorder diagnosis. The results of the estimated coefficients of the logistic regression analysis test showed that men were less likely to report major depression during the COVID-19 lockdown (Exp (B) = 0.45 for men;p &lt;0.05) than women. Although the results showed that almost two thirds of the participants reported no major depression diagnosis during the COVID-19 lockdown, the logistic regression analysis confirmed that the chances of men reporting major depressive disorder diagnosis were lesser than that of women and this difference was statistically significant.","Omary, Areen","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/2864m","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22083,""
"Social Determinants of Mental Health During a Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Belonging is a basic human need, with social isolation signaling a threat to biological fitness. Sensitivity to ostracism varies across individuals and the lifespan, peaking in adolescence. Government-imposed restrictions upon social interactions during COVID-19 may therefore be particularly detrimental to young people and those most sensitive to ostracism. Participants (N = 2367;89.95% female, 11-100 years) from three countries with differing levels of government restrictions (Australia, UK, and USA) were surveyed trice at three-month intervals (May 2020 â€“ April 2021). Young people, and those living under the tightest government restrictions, reported the worst mental health, with these inequalities in mental health remaining constant throughout the study period. Further dissection of these results revealed that young people high on social rejection sensitivity reported the most mental health problems at the final assessment. These findings help account for the greater impact of enforced social isolation on young peopleâ€™s mental health, and open novel avenues for intervention.","Minihan, Savannah, Orben, Amy, Songco, Annabel, Fox, Elaine, Ladouceur, Cecile, Mewton, Louise, moulds, michelle, Pfeifer, Jennifer, Van Harmelen, Anne-Laura, Schweizer, Susanne","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/64v7x","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22084,""

"Trends in Burnout and Psychological Distress in Hospital Staff Over 12 Months of The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Prospective Longitudinal Survey (preprint)","Background:  . The mental health effects of healthcare work during the COVID-19 pandemic have been substantial, but it is not known how long they will persist. This study aimed to determine if hospital workersâ€™ burnout and psychological distress increased monotonically over one year, during which waves of case numbers and hospitalizations waxed and waned, or followed some other pattern. Methods:  . A prospective longitudinal survey was conducted at four time-points over one year in a cohort of 538 hospital workers and learners, which included validated measures of burnout (emotional exhaustion scale of Maslach Burnout Inventory) and psychological distress (K6). Repeated measures ANOVA tested changes over time and differences between subjects by occupational role and age. The direction and magnitude of changes over time were investigated by plotting rates of high scores (using cut-offs) at each time-point compared to case rates of COVID-19 in the city in which the study took place. Results:  . There were significant changes in emotional exhaustion over time (F = 4.6, p = .004) and significant effects of occupational role (F = 11.4, p &lt; .001) and age (F = 12.3, p &lt; .001). The rate of high burnout was highest in nurses, followed by other healthcare professionals, other clinical staff, and lowest in non-clinical staff. Peak rates of high burnout occurred at the second or third measurement point for each occupational group, with lower rates at the fourth measurement point. Similarly to the results for emotional exhaustion, rates of high psychological distress peaked at the winter 2021 or spring 2021 measurement point in each occupational group and were highest in nurses. Conclusions: . Neither emotional exhaustion nor psychological distress was rising monotonically. Burnout and psychological distress were consistently related to occupational role and were highest in nurses. Although emotional exhaustion improved as the case rate of COVID-19 decreased, rates of high emotional exhaustion in nurses and other healthcare professionals remained higher than was typically measured in hospital-based healthcare workers prior to the pandemic. Ongoing monitoring of healthcare workersâ€™ mental health is warranted.

"Impact of COVID-19 on â€˜living wellâ€™ with mild-to-moderate dementia in the community: findings from the IDEAL cohort (preprint)","Background:  Negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with dementia have been widely-documented, but most studies have relied on carer reports and few have compared responses to information collected before the pandemic. Objective We aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on community-dwelling individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia and compare responses with pre-pandemic data. Methods During the second wave of the pandemic we conducted structured telephone interviews with 173 people with dementia and 242 carers acting as informants, all of whom had previously participated in the IDEAL cohort. Where possible we benchmarked responses against pre-pandemic data. Results Significant perceived negative impacts were identified in cognitive and functional skills and ability to engage in self-care and manage everyday activities, along with increased levels of loneliness and discontinuity in sense of self and a decline in perceived capability to â€˜live wellâ€™. Compared to pre-pandemic data there were lower levels of pain, depression and anxiety, higher levels of optimism, and better satisfaction with family support. There was little impact on physical health, mood, social connections and relationships, or perceptions of neighbourhood characteristics. Conclusion Efforts to mitigate negative impacts of pandemic-related restrictions and restore quality of life could focus on reablement to address the effects on participation in everyday activities, creating opportunities for social contact to reduce loneliness, and personalised planning to reconnect people with their pre-COVID selves. Such efforts may build on the resilience demonstrated by people with dementia and carers in coping with the pandemic.","Clare, Linda, Martyr, Anthony, Gamble, Laura, Pentecost, Claire, Collins, Rachel, Dawson, Eleanor, Hunt, Anna, Parker, Sophie, Allan, Louise, Burns, Alistair, Hillman, Alexandra, Litherland, Rachael, Quinn, Catherine, Matthews, Fiona, Victor, Christina","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1064195/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22087,""
"Post-COVID-19 illness trajectory: a multisystem investigation (preprint)","Background:  The pathophysiology and trajectory of multiorgan involvement in post-COVID-19 syndrome is uncertain. Methods: : A prospective, multicenter, longitudinal, cohort study involving post-COVID-19 patients enrolled in-hospital or early post-discharge (visit 1) and re-evaluated 28-60 days post-discharge (visit 2). Multisystem investigations included chest computed tomography with pulmonary and coronary angiography, cardiovascular and renal magnetic resonance imaging, digital electrocardiography, and multisystem biomarkers. The primary outcome was the adjudicated likelihood of myocarditis. Results: : 161 patients (mean age 55 years, 43% female) and 27 controls with similar age, sex, ethnicity, and vascular risk factors were enrolled from 22 May 2020 to 2 July 2021 and had a primary outcome evaluation. Compared to controls, at 28-60 days post-discharge, patients with COVID-19 had persisting evidence of cardio-renal involvement, systemic inflammation, and hemostasis pathway activation. Myocarditis was adjudicated as being not likely (n=17;10%), unlikely (n=56;35%), probable (n=67;42%) or very likely (n=21;13%). Acute kidney injury (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 3.40 (1.13, 11.84);p=0.038) and low hemoglobin A1c (0.26 (0.07, 0.87);p=0.035) were multivariable associates of adjudicated myocarditis. During convalescence, compared to controls, COVID-19 was associated with worse health-related quality of life (EQ5D-5L) (p&lt;0.001), illness perception (p&lt;0.001), anxiety and depression (p&lt;0.001), physical activity (p&lt;0.001) and predicted maximal oxygen utilization (ml/kg/min) (p&lt;0.001). These measures were associated with adjudicated myocarditis. Conclusions: : The illness trajectory of COVID-19 includes persisting cardio-renal inflammation, lung damage and hemostasis activation. Adjudicated myocarditis occurred in one in eight hospitalized patients and was associated with impairments in health status, physical and psychological wellbeing during community convalescence.

"Extending Validation of a Social Emotional Health Measure For Middle School Students (preprint)","Heightened by the global Covid-19 pandemic, awareness of the need to monitor youthsâ€™ social and emotional health increased. The Social Emotional Health Survey-Secondary-2020 (SEHS-S-2020) is a well-tested option for assessing student social emotional health and promoting mental health prevention, intervention, and multitiered systems of support efforts in schools. While a growing body of literature supports the SEHS-S-2020 measure for assessing student covitality, there is less validation evidence specifically for middle school-aged adolescents (Grades 6-8 in the U.S.). The present study aimed to fill this gap in the literature by examining its use for younger adolescents. Study participants included 9,426 students from 32 counties in California located across urban, suburban, and rural communities and 414 students in Grades 6-8 (ages 11-13 years) from two middle schools. Data analyses examined structural validity, internal consistency, measurement invariance, criterion validity, predictive validity, and response stability. Results indicate excellent fit indices for a four-level higher-order measurement model, with strong concurrent and one-year predictive validity coefficients, providing support for using the SEHS-S-2020 measure for use among young adolescents in middle school settings. The discussion focuses on implications for assessing studentsâ€™ psychosocial assets and universal school-based screening during this crucial developmental transition .","Furlong, Michael, Paz, Jennica, Carter, Delwin, Dowdy, Erin, Nylund-Gibson, Karen","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1051837/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22089,""
"Evaluation of Mental Health Status of the Pregnant Women Working in Hospitals During Covid-19 Era (preprint)","Background:  Women represent the majority of the healthcare workforce and many of these women are probably pregnant and working at the front-line during COVID-19 outbreak. In COVID-19 crisis healthcare workers experienced excessive issues and challenges that made them vulnerable for getting various mental health disorders. We aimed to evaluate the mental health state among pregnant health care workers in COVID-19 era. Methods:  This cross-sectional study included 64 pregnant clinical residents, general physicians, nurses and other medical staff who worked in the hospitals in Iran, from August 2020 to December 2020 using an anonymous online survey available on Google Form platform. The online survey consisted of socio demographic questions, pregnancy-related questions, and some questions about medical/drug history, The Persian versions of General Health Questionnaire â€“ 28 (GHQ-28), and Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) were also fulfilled by the participants. Results:  The mean age and gestational age of participants were 31.3Â±3.9 years, and 24.5Â±10.1 weeks. Psychological problems were moderate (total score GHQ-28&gt; 40) in 9.4% (n:6) of the pregnant health care workers (PHCW). The frequency of moderate/severe problems in the four subclasses, including somatic symptoms, anxiety/insomnia, social dysfunction, and depression were 9(14.1%), 25(39.0%), 7(10.9%), and 10(15.6%), respectively. According to CDAS, 26.5% of participants had moderate to severe COVID-19 related anxiety. COVID-19 related anxiety and its subclasses, physical and psychological, were significantly correlated with GHQ-28 total score and its subclasses, including somatic symptoms, anxiety/insomnia, social dysfunction, and depression among pregnant health care workers (P&lt;0.01). Conclusion:  According to the results of the current study, over 25% of the pregnant health care workers have moderate to severe COVID-19 related anxiety;so it is crucial for policymakers to focus on the mental health of the pregnant health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic. This study has major implications on health care practice.

"Positive Changes in Life Outcomes over the Pandemic in Chinese Adolescents: The Role of Resilience and Relation to Mental Health (preprint)","Background:  Although the existing literature has well documented the negative effects of COVID-19 on multiple life outcomes in adolescents, some research has also revealed that some life outcomes have become better during COVID-19. Scant research has specifically examined to what extent and in what aspects COVID-19 is beneficial to adolescent development so far. With person-centered approach, this research addressed this gap by: (1) exploring different profiles of positive changes in life outcomes in Chinese adolescents since the outbreak of COVID-19;(2) examining the role of resilience in relation to different profiles;(3) comparing mental health across adolescents categorized into different profiles. Method Participants were 2,567 Chinese adolescents aged 12 to 24. They rated how much their lives of different domains had experienced positive changes since the outbreak of the pandemic. They also answered the questionnaires that measured their resilience and mental health. Results Results of latent profile analysis revealed three different profiles: limited positive changes (33.3%), partial positive changes (49.5%), and overall strong positive changes (17.2%). Moreover, adolescents with a higher level of resilience were more likely to be categorized into the partial positive changes profile compared to the limited positive changes profile and into the overall strong positive changes profile compared to the other two profiles, after controlling for the covariates. Finally, adolescents in the overall strong positive changes profile had better mental health than their counterparts in the other two profiles.

"Time-Dependent Effects of Exposure to Nature and Perceived Behavioral Control over Social Distancing in Shared Open Spaces on Psychological Distress of Residents during Pandemic of COVID-19 (preprint)","Background:  Further research into the influence of the COVID-19 epidemic on mental health is needed. Some research has highlighted the positive effects of nature exposure on mental health, as well as the importance of subjective assessments of green spaces. Methods:  Considering both private and semi-public environments, the current longitudinal study examines the moderating effects of exposure to nature and perceived behavioral control over social distancing on the relationship between perceived interior crowding, social isolation, and psychological distress. Finally, it investigates whether these connections change through time. During the Iranian national lockdowns, data from 718 middle-aged women who completed an online questionnaire survey in two waves were used. Results:  and Conclusion : The findings of structural equation modeling back up the idea that social isolation plays a key role in the association between perceived interior crowding and psychological distress. Multi-Group Analysis revealed that exposure to nature reduced the negative effects of perceived interior crowding on psychological distress, as predicted. Nevertheless, this relationship is time-dependent and nature exposure during the time did not necessarily assist in reducing negative impacts. The current research adds to the body of knowledge by identifying perceived behavioral control as a buffer against the adverse effects of social isolation on psychological distress over time. These findings provide for a better understanding of psychological processes and could help in the promotion of design policies in the event of a pandemic.","Mousavinia, Seyyedeh Fatemeh","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1035834/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22092,""

"The Effects of Physical Activity on Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Systematic Review (preprint)","Introduction:  Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic affected countries worldwide and has changed peoplesâ€™ lives. A reduction in physical activity and an increase in mental health problems were observed. Thus, this systematic review aims to examine the association between physical activity and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : In January 2021, a search was applied to PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Eligibility criteria included cross-sectional, prospective, longitudinal study design and studies published in English;outcomes included physical activity and mental health (e.g., depressive symptoms, anxiety, positive and negative effects, well-being). Results: : Nineteen studies were included in this review. Overall, the studies suggested that higher physical activity is associated with higher well-being, quality of life as well as lower depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress, independently of age. There was no consensus for the optimal physical activity level for mitigating negative mental symptoms, neither for the frequency nor for the type of physical activity. Women were more vulnerable to mental health changes and men were more susceptive to physical activity changes. Conclusion:  Physical activity seems to be a good and effective choice to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. Public health policies should alert for alternatives to increment physical activity during the stay-at-home orders in many countries.","Marconcin, Priscila, Werneck, AndrÃ©, Peralta, Miguel, Ihle, Andreas, Gouveia, Ã‰lvio, Ferrari, Gerson, Sarmento, Hugo, Marques, Adilson","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1026835/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22094,""
"Understanding the Role of Student Stress, Personality and Coping on Learning Motivation and Mental Health During a Pandemic (preprint)","The aims explored associations between stress ratings and influences on coping on student mental health and motivation and compared defensive-pessimism against optimism as a strategy for learning motivation. Most research construes stress as distress, with little attempt to consider positive â€˜eustressâ€™ experiences. Undergraduate psychology students (N=162) were surveyed on student and pandemic-related stressors, personality, support, control, mental health and learning motivation. Overall, lack of motivation and procrastination were acute. Uplifting ratings of teaching and optimistic thinking were associated with good mental health, but context control was key. Hassle ratings of teaching lowered learning motivation. Support and conscientiousness bolstered learning motivation, with the latter an important buffer against hassle experiences on motivation. Openness was associated with the stress involved in learning. For those anxious-prone, defensive-pessimism was as effective as optimism was for those not anxious-prone, in stimulating learning motivation. Developing context control, support and strategies linked to personality could bolster student resilience during and post Covid-19.","Gibbons, Chris","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1021633/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22095,""

"Using Absolutist Word Frequency from Online Searches to Measure Population Mental Health Dynamics (preprint)","Purpose:  The assessment of population mental health relies on survey data from representative samples, which come with considerable costs. Drawing on research which established that absolutist words (e.g. never) are semantic markers for depression, we propose a new measure of population mental health based on the frequency of absolutist words in online search data (Absolute Thinking Index;ATI). Our aims were to first validate the ATI, and to use it to model public mental health dynamics in France and the UK during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods:  To do so, we extracted time series for a validated dictionary of 19 absolutist words, from which the ATI was computed (weekly averages, 2019-2020, n = 208) using Google Trends. We then tested the relationship between ATI and longitudinal survey data of population mental health in the UK and France. Results:  ATI was linked with survey depression scores in the UK, r = .68, 95%CI[.34,.86], ÃŸ = .23, 95%CI[.09,.37] in France and displayed similar trends. We finally assessed the pandemicâ€™s impact on ATI using Bayesian structural time-series models. These revealed that the pandemic increased ATI by 3.2%, 95%CI[2.1,4.2] in France and 3.7%, 95%CI[2.9,4.4] in the UK. Mixed-effects models showed that ATI was related to COVID-19 new deaths in both countries ÃŸ = .14, 95%CI[.14,.21]. Conclusion:  Our results demonstrate the validity of the ATI as a measure of population mental health (depression) in France and the UK.

"COVID-19-Related Distress Predicts Analog PTSD Symptoms After Exposure to an Analog Stressor (preprint)","The long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health is only starting to emerge. Beyond direct effects on mental health, it is crucial to investigate how negative psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic might affect etiological processes of different mental disorders. In the current online study, we investigated whether a negative psychological response to the pandemic might predispose individuals towards posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) development after exposure to a non-COVID-19-related traumatic stressor. Moreover, we examined if these effects are mediated by the strength of associative fear learning during trauma. Using an established analog procedure, we demonstrate that COVID-19-related distress predicts analog PTSD symptoms of a non-COVID-19-related stressor and that these effects are fully mediated by the strength of associative fear learning during exposure to the analog stressor. As such, our findings indicate that negative psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic should be considered as an emerging pretraumatic risk factor.","Friesen, Edith, Michael, Tanja, SchÃ¤fer, Sarah, Sopp, Roxanne","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-998687/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22098,""

We aimed at symptoms that were most relevant: COVID-19 related symptoms, cancer-related symptoms, mental health symptoms, and musculoskeletal symptoms. Design and settingRetrospective analysis of routine patient data from a practice based registration network in the Netherlands (population 40.000 patients;30 GPs).MethodWe compared data from the first nine months of the COVID-19 crisis to the preceding 5 years, and analyzed differences between the periods of time in the duration of symptoms before presentation, and the duration from the first presentation in general practice until diagnostic testing and referrals.ResultsWe found no indications that patients waited longer to contact the FP for newly presented health symptoms;only COVID-19 related symptoms were presented earlier to family practice (p&lt; 0.001).

However less focus is being paid towards the impact of COVID-19 on mental health of the patients. This study is a cross-sectional study, measuring the prevalence of emotional distress among patients with COVID-19 in the Maldivian population. Methods: : This study was conducted in Maldivian nations above 18 of age with COVID-19 who were admitted in isolation facilities. Patients who were on treatment for any other chronic medical conditions, severe and critical COVID-19 disease were excluded. This study was conducted over a period of 2months by administering a local translated version of DASS21 questionnaire. Results: : The total of 195 patients were included in this study.

"Consequences of Quarantine During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Food Intake and Body Weight: A Systematic Review (preprint)","Background:  Due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, some authorities have implemented measures to control the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), such as quarantine. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the results of the studies that investigated changes in eating habits, food intake, and body weight during the COVID-19 quarantine. Methods:  This review followed the recommendations of the PRISMA protocol and has registration in the PROSPERO under number CRD42020212491. Searches used databases PubMed, Medline, Scielo, and Lilacs. Two authors conducted the selection process blindly and independently using the Rayyan software (QCRI). Of 5,248 papers, we included 28 studies. Results:  Most of the included studies in this review presented data on changes in food intake (n = 22). These changes were especially towards the adoption of unhealthy eating habits such as an increase in the consumption of snacks and sweets;and a decrease in the intake of vegetables, fruits, fish, and dairy products (n = 21). Concerning body weight, the main change was towards weight gain (1.5 to 4.5 kg), which was positively associated with age (elderly);socioeconomic level (average socioeconomic level);increase of the intake of snacks, sweets, fried foods, and fast foods;and low consumption of vegetables. Besides, weight gain was inversely associated with physical activity and positively associated with sedentary time (n = 14). Conclusion:  In this sense, the summarized evidence points to a change in eating habits, food intake, and body weight, as well as a relevant association between unhealthy eating choices and weight gain during quarantine. The COVID-19 quarantine caused an interruption in the routine of daily life, which generated an impact on mental health, 3 eating habits, and physical activity. This review showed that during the quarantine some individuals changed their eating habits, mainly towards the adoption of unhealthy habits and gained weight.","Penna, Paula Moreira, Oliveira, Nathallia Maria Cotta, Castro, Luiza Carla Vidigal, Hermsdorff, Helen Hermana Miranda","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-953160/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22101,""
"Sleep Patterns and Sleep Disruptions in Preschoolers Midst the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown in Greece (preprint)","The COVID- 19 pandemic and the restrictions to minify contagion, affected globally the entire population. The prolonged home confinement during the COVID-19 outbreak changed dramatically the family life taking into consideration school closures, online education, continuous need for self-protection, restrictions of social interactions and work schedule alterations. Designed to examine the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on preschoolersâ€™ sleep this study documented sleep patterns during the COVID-19 lockdown and explored the effects of screen time and diet. Parents of 146 children provided survey data on their children's night-time sleep habits, dietary habits and screen time usage. Children's sleep problems were measured with the Children Sleep Habits Questionnaire. Descriptive and qualitative analyses showed that most parents (54.1%) reported that childrenâ€™s sleep patterns changed during the imposed home confinement. Children with more sleep problems were more likely to have increased screen exposure. The present study provides evidence on the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sleep behavior of Greek preschoolers. Focused action is probably needed to safeguard and promote childrenâ€™s overall physical and mental health outcomes during the pandemic and afterwards during the crisis recovery period.","Tatsiopoulou, Paraskevi, Holeva, Vasiliki, Nikopoulou, Vasiliki Aliki, Parlapani, Eleni, Diakogiannis, Ioannis","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-889902/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22102,""
"The Lockdown Impact Scale for Students (LISS) (preprint)","Background:  The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in many student populations learning online in lockdown. While the mental health consequences of lockdown are increasingly understood, the core features of â€˜cabin feverâ€™ are poorly described. Methods: : We conducted a questionnaire survey of 649 undergraduate medicine and health sciences students. Item content was developed based on current literature and input from student representatives. Results: : Mokken scaling identified seven questions that together formed a strongly unidimensional scale which comprised two domains : social isolation/cabin fever and demotivation / demoralisation. Scale scores were significantly associated with depression, self-rated mental health, impaired study efficacy and doomscrolling. Conclusions: : The adverse effects of lockdown on student wellbeing appear to be driven to an important extent by an experience of isolation and demotivation that correspond to narrative descriptions of cabin fever. In the foreseeable event of future pandemics, these experiences are a promising target for health promotion in students studying in lockdown.","Conroy, RonÃ¡n, Fitzgerald, Karen","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-811200/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22103,""
"Differences in Coping Strategies and Help-Seeking Behaviours among Australian Junior and Senior Doctors during the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background:  Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital medical staff (HMS) have faced significant personal, workplace, and financial disruption. Many have experienced psychosocial burden, exceeding already concerning baseline levels. This study examines the types and predictors of coping strategies and help-seeking behaviours utilised by Australian junior and senior HMS during the first year of the pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of Australian frontline healthcare workers was conducted between 27th August and 23rd October 2020. Data collected included demographics, personal and workplace disruptions, self-reported and validated mental health symptoms, coping strategies, and help-seeking. Results: The 9518 participants included 1966 hospital medical staff (62.1% senior, 37.9% junior). Both groups experienced a high burden of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout. Coping strategies varied by seniority, with maintaining exercise the most common strategy for both groups. Adverse mental health was associated with increased alcohol consumption. Engagement with professional support, although more frequent among junior staff, was uncommon in both groups. Conclusions: Junior and senior staff utilised different coping and help-seeking behaviours. Despite recognition of symptoms, very few HMS engaged formal support. The varied predictors of coping and help-seeking identified may inform targeted interventions to support these cohorts in current and future crises.","Pascoe, Amy, Paul, Eldho, Johnson, Douglas, Putland, Mark, Willis, Karen, Smallwood, Natasha","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202111.0191.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22104,""
"COVID-19 Limitations on Doodling as a Measure of Burnout (preprint)","Pre-COVID-19, doodling was identified as a measure of burnout in researchers attending a weekly, in-person health narratives research group manifesting team mindfulness. Under the group&rsquo;s supportive conditions, variations in doodling served to measure change in participants&rsquo;reported depression and anxiety&mdash;internal states directly associated with burnout, adversely affecting healthcare researchers, their employment, and their research. COVID-19 demanded social distancing during the group&rsquo;s 2020/21 academic meetings. Conducted online, the group&rsquo;s participants who chose to doodle did so alone during the pandemic. Whether the sequestering of group participants during COVID-19 altered the ability of doodling to act as a measure of depression and anxiety was investigated. Participants considered doodling during the group&rsquo;s online meetings increased their enjoyment and attention level&mdash;some expressed it helped them to relax. However, unlike face-to-face meetings during previous non-COVID-19 years, solitary doodling during online meetings was unable to reflect researchers&rsquo;depression or anxiety. COVID-19 limitations necessitating doodling alone maintained the benefits group members saw in doodling but hampered the ability of doodling to act as a measure of burnout in contrast to previous in-person doodling. This result is seen to correspond to one aspect of the group&rsquo;s change in team mindfulness resulting from COVID-19 constraints.","Nash, Carol","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202111.0059.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22105,""

"An Online Cultural Experience for Mental Health in People Aged 16-24 Compared to a Typical Museum Website: A Randomised Controlled Trial (preprint)","Background: The mental health of young people is a major public health concern that has been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is growing interest in cultural assets such as museums to improve mental health. However, there is a dearth of experimental research regarding the impact of cultural assets on common mental disorders in young adults, and in online experiences, which may improve accessibility.Methods/design: The O-ACE POP (Online Active Community Engagement Proof of Principle) study is a randomised controlled trial of a co-produced online museum experience named Ways of Being (WoB) compared with the Ashmolean Website (Ash) on negative affect, positive affect and symptoms of anxiety and depression (K10) over a 3-day intervention phase followed by a 6-week follow up assessment.Findings: 463 people aged 16-24 were randomised: 231 to WoB and 232 to Ash and 349 (74%) completed to 6 weeks. Negative affect was lower over the intervention phase in those allocated to WoB than Ash (WoB-Ash n=448, NA -0.158, p=0Â·010). For males (179, 39%), those aged 18-24 (422, 91%), non-white ethnic groups (88, 19%), regular users of online culture (238, 51%), those not on antidepressants (363, 78%), and individuals without probable moderate-severe mental health problems (327, 71%) at baseline, negative affect was significantly lower in those allocated to WoB compared to the Ash. Mean K10 reduced over the trial period, from 27Â·1 (95% CI= 26Â·6-27Â·7) to 23Â·3 (95% CI= 22Â·5-24Â·1), as did negative affect whereas positive affect remained relatively stable. Trial recruitment was rapid and feedback positive with broad geographical, occupational and ethnic diversity.Interpretation: Cultural interventions may improve MH outcomes in a measurable way. Populations that are underserved, both clinically and in research such as non-white ethnic groups, non-students and males and were reached in this study. This demonstrates the importance of measuring psychometric outcomes and the potential for co-produced community cultural resources to support mental health.Trial Registration: Trial Registration: NCT04663594Funding: This study is sponsored by the University of Oxford COVID-19 Research Response Fundand supported by the NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre, The WestminsterFoundation and the Huo Family FoundationDeclaration of Interest: AKP and MV were supported by a grant provided by the Huo Family Foundation.

"Pandemic and its Impact on the Rural Youth: Teaching Resilience through Literature (preprint)","Writers have responded to contemporary epidemics and diseases in their own unique ways depending on which disease or illness is represented. They have found expression in varied forms of literature. It has been a medium of projecting sympathetic, empathetic, and realistic points of views. On scrutiny, one can find references of the social responses to pandemics available in literature, like interaction among human beings and interface between people and state, and what strategies were followed/ adopted to maintain health systems. Further, illness does not necessarily mean only the physical. It can be psychological as well, which the writers often identify and represent in their works. It would, therefore, be fruitful to consider psychoanalytic theory in the context of the effects and consequences of a pandemic. A poem or prose not only mirrors the world around or imparts wisdom or acts as a matter-of-fact project possibility, but is also a reliable source that soothes the mind, body, and soul. It has a therapeutic impact, especially when preserving life is the primary objective and concern. Research has also shown that bibliotherapy is a treatment for various ailments, like depression and mood upliftment, preventing dementia, and cognitive ageing. Considering all these, the paper seeks to identify, while developing an understanding of pandemics, how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the youth, particularly girls aged 17-21 in select rural areas of Haryana, its social, economic, and psychological consequences, and draw certain signposts that can work as a steering to an inclusive and resilient society.","Singh, Dr Priyanka, Attri, Shalini","https://www.google.com/search?q=Pandemic+and+its+Impact+on+the+Rural+Youth:+Teaching+Resilience+through+Literature+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22108,""
"Speaker and Time-aware Joint Contextual Learning for Dialogue-act Classification in Counselling Conversations (preprint)","The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought the mental health of people under risk. Social counselling has gained remarkable significance in this environment. Unlike general goal-oriented dialogues, a conversation between a patient and a therapist is considerably implicit, though the objective of the conversation is quite apparent. In such a case, understanding the intent of the patient is imperative in providing effective counselling in therapy sessions, and the same applies to a dialogue system as well. In this work, we take forward a small but an important step in the development of an automated dialogue system for mental-health counselling. We develop a novel dataset, named HOPE, to provide a platform for the dialogue-act classification in counselling conversations. We identify the requirement of such conversation and propose twelve domain-specific dialogue-act (DAC) labels. We collect 12.9K utterances from publicly-available counselling session videos on YouTube, extract their transcripts, clean, and annotate them with DAC labels. Further, we propose SPARTA, a transformer-based architecture with a novel speaker- and time-aware contextual learning for the dialogue-act classification. Our evaluation shows convincing performance over several baselines, achieving state-of-the-art on HOPE. We also supplement our experiments with extensive empirical and qualitative analyses of SPARTA.","Malhotra, Ganeshan, Waheed, Abdul, Srivastava, Aseem, Akhtar, Md Shad, Chakraborty, Tanmoy","https://www.google.com/search?q=Speaker+and+Time-aware+Joint+Contextual+Learning+for+Dialogue-act+Classification+in+Counselling+Conversations+(preprint)","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22109,""

It will assess how learning advancements made during this time helped families of children with disabilities and how it has improved education. The sampling procedure would have some specific parameters. It is thought that case sampling, which can be performed quickly, will be beneficial because of the Pandemic and Movement Control Restrictions.

"Pandemic Profiteers Exposed: A COVID-19 Pandemic Profits TAx as One Essential Tool to Reverse Inequalities and Rebuild Better Post-Pandemic, Oxfam America (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the deep systemic inequalities and massive failures in our economic system, leaving tens of millions of people in the United States without jobs, devastating public services, and bankrupting countless small businesses. Yet as we face our deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression, a subset of companies is experiencing windfall profits. Seventeen of the top 25 most profitable US corporations, including Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Facebook, Pfizer, and Visa, are expected to make almost $85 billion more in 2020 super-profits compared to previous years, this research shows. If we continue with business as usual, these windfall profits will not be handed out to workers in wages, wonâ€™t be used to lower consumer prices, nor used to pay a bit more in taxes to fund healthcare workers. These profits will be paid to shareholders, a group of largely white, rich men who already control the vast majority of our countryâ€™s corporate stock. The wealthiest 10 percent of Americans own 87 percent of all corporate stock in the US, compared to less than 1 percent of shares owned by the bottom half. Racial disparities are even more stark. this paper estimates that 9 out of every 10 dollars of pandemic profits will end up with white Americans in 2020. Black and Latinx familiesâ€”already disproportionately affected by COVID-19â€”receive only 16 cents each. COVID-19 presents us with a choice as a society: Do we want to continue distributing our economic resources to the already-wealthy and well-connected, or shall we choose to redeploy this money into the once-in-a-century fight against COVID-19 and the inequalities it brings in its wake?

"Has China's Labor Contract Law Curtailed Economic Growth? (preprint)","As China reformed its economy during the past 44 years, it experienced the fastest sustained expansion by a major economy in history, with an annual rate of GDP growth averaging nearly 10% from 1978 to 2018. In the past decade, however, the rate of growth has noticeably slowed, falling to just under 7% on the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2018. Though GDP growth over 6% might be considered admirable in many nations, in China it has sparked a debate about the causes of the slowdown. One suspect is Chinaâ€™s 2008 Labor Contract Law (LCL), which provides workers with certain rights against firings and other adverse employment actions. Critics of the law claim its provisions threaten to stifle the Chinese economy by unduly restricting employersâ€™ ability to terminate unproductive workers and adjust their workforce to changing economic conditions. In the past, the Chinese government strongly supported the LCL. The issue for the present is whether that support should continue. This article provides the first detailed comparative study of the LCL and reveals that Chinese law imposes constraints no more restrictive than the average among OECD countries. The article also challenges the contention that provisions of the LCL have caused slower growth and adversely affected Chinese labor markets. Theoretical models generate only ambiguous and inconsistent predictions concerning the effects of employment protections on labor market performance. And the available empirical evidence likewise fails to show any consistent pattern of adverse effects associated with employment protection laws. We argue that this economic literature casts considerable doubt on the causal claim that Chinese labor law has reduced the countryâ€™s growth rate or depressed employment. Limited coverage and under-enforcement further diminish the likelihood that Chinaâ€™s labor regulations have harmed the economy. Thus, the Chinese government should look skeptically on claims that reducing the employment protections in the LCL will reignite economic growth.","Ding, Wenwen, Verkerke, J.

English Abstract: At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, many praised the government's response. Daily life was not drastically affected, and infections were kept at bay without a national lockdown policy. However, there were also criticisms on how the country handled its border policies, health programs, the slow vaccination roll-out, and the adequacy of the support it provided its residents. How did Filipinos in Japan experience these issues during the pandemic, especially since they are far from their families in the Philippines? This study represents the narratives of anxiety, traveling, staying, and delays by Filipinos in Japan during the pandemic. Through interviews with Filipino students and workers in Japan, this study finds that while the pandemic challenged their mental health, their resilience remained.

Ã¢â‚¬Æ’A total of 188 women, 96 pregnant and 92 non-pregnant were included. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) were applied to the participants after obtaining sociodemographic data. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’The depression scores of pregnant and non-pregnant women were similar (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.846). We found that the depression scores were significantly higher among the group of participants who have lower economic status (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.046). Moreover, the depression score was significantly higher among women who lost their income during the pandemic (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.027). The score on the ASEX was significantly higher, and sexual dysfunction was more prevalent among women who have lower levels of schooling and income (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05).

Investigar a depressÃƒÂ£o e as funÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes sexuais de mulheres grÃƒÂ¡vidas e nÃƒÂ£o grÃƒÂ¡vidas durante a pandemia de Covid-19. MÃƒÂ©TODOS: Um total de 188 mulheres, 96 grÃƒÂ¡vidas e 92 nÃƒÂ£o grÃƒÂ¡vidas, foram incluÃƒÂ­das. O InventÃƒÂ¡rio de DepressÃƒÂ£o de Beck (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI, em inglÃƒÂªs) e a Escala de ExperiÃƒÂªncias Sexuais do Arizona (Arizona Sexual Experience Scale, ASEX, em inglÃƒÂªs) foram aplicados aos participantes apÃƒÂ³s a obtenÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o dos dados sociodemogrÃƒÂ¡ficos. As pontuaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes de depressÃƒÂ£o de mulheres grÃƒÂ¡vidas e nÃƒÂ£o grÃƒÂ¡vidas foram semelhantes (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0,846).

A cross-sectional, multic'entre quantitative study was conducted among surgical nurses in Anhui province. SAS, SDS and SSRS scales were used for the investigation. Data were collected between 3 March 2020 to 19 March 2020. A total of 3,492 surgical nurses completed the survey. The average level of anxiety and depression of surgical nurses were higher than that of the Chinese norm. Levels of social support for surgical nurses were significantly negatively associated with the degree of anxiety and depression. Fertility status, participation in care for COVID-19 patients, likelihood of being infected with COVID-19 and social support were significantly influencing surgical nurses' anxiety degree. Similarly, these characteristics were significantly associated with the odds of depression symptoms in surgical nurses. These findings suggest that targeted psychological interventions to promote mental health of surgical nurses need to be immediately implemented.","Ren, Zhou, Fan, Li, Zhang, Shen, Yu, Jiang, Yu, Duan, Peng, Cheng, Wu, Wu, Ye","https://doi.org/10.1002/nop2.1127","20211116","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; social support; surgical nurses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22118,""
"Differential effects of COVID-19 and containment measures on mental health: Evidence from ITALI-Italian Lives, the Italian household panel","This study used a subsample of a household panel study in Italy to track changes in mental health before the onset of COVID-19 and into the first lockdown period, from late April to early September 2020. The results of the random-effects regression analyses fitted on a sample of respondents aged 16 years and older (N = 897) proved that there was a substantial and statistically significant short-term deterioration in mental health (from 78,5 to 67,9; ÃŽÂ² = -10.5, p &lt; .001; Cohen's d -.445), as measured by a composite index derived from the mental component of the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). The findings also showed heterogeneity in the COVID-related effects. On the one hand, evidence has emerged that the pandemic acted as a great leveller of pre-existing differences in mental health across people of different ages: the decrease was most pronounced among those aged 16-34 (from 84,2 to 66,5; ÃŽÂ² = -17.7, p &lt; .001; Cohen's d -.744); however, the magnitude of change reduced as age increased and turned to be non-significant among individuals aged 70 and over. On the other hand, the COVID-19 emergency widened the mental health gender gap and created new inequalities, based on the age of the youngest child being taken care of within the household.","Lucchini, Gerosa, Pancheva, Pisati, Respi, Riva","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259989","20211116","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22119,""
"Investigating the use of digital health technology to monitor COVID-19 and its effects: Protocol for Covid Collab, an observational study","The ubiquity of mobile phones and increasing use of wearable fitness trackers offers a wide-ranging window into people's health and well-being. There are clear advantages in using remote monitoring technologies to gain an insight into health, particularly under the shadow of the current COVID-19 pandemic. The Covid Collab study was set up to investigate the feasibility of identifying, monitoring, and understanding the stratification of COVID-19 infection and recovery through remote monitoring technologies. Additionally, we will assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social measures on people's behaviour, physical health, and mental well-being. Participants remotely enrolled on the study through the Mass Science app to donate both historic and prospective mobile phone data, fitness tracking wearable data, and regular COVID-19 and mental health related surveys. Data is being recorded for the period of the pandemic, notably including pre, during and post acute infection phase. We plan to carry out analyses in several areas, covering symptomatology, risk factors, machine learning-based classification of illness, and trajectories of recovery, mental well-being, and activity. Covid Collab is a crowdsourced study using remote monitoring technologies to investigate the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 2021 there are over 17000 participants, largely from the United Kingdom, with enrolment ongoing. This paper introduces a remotely enrolled crowd-sourced study recording mobile health data throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Association of SARS-CoV-2 Infection With Psychological Distress, Psychotropic Prescribing, Fatigue, and Sleep Problems Among UK Primary Care Patients","Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with fatigue and sleep problems long after the acute phase of COVID-19. In addition, there are concerns of SARS-CoV-2 infection causing psychiatric illness; however, evidence of a direct effect is inconclusive. To assess risk of risk of incident or repeat psychiatric illness, fatigue, or sleep problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection and to analyze changes according to demographic subgroups. This cohort study assembled matched cohorts using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum, a UK primary care registry of 11Ã¢â‚¬Â¯923Ã¢â‚¬Â¯499 individuals aged 16 years or older. Patients were followed-up for up to 10 months, from February 1 to December 9, 2020. Individuals with less than 2 years of historical data or less than 1 week follow-up were excluded. Individuals with positive results on a SARS-CoV-2 test without prior mental illness or with anxiety or depression, psychosis, fatigue, or sleep problems were matched with up to 4 controls based on sex, general practice, and year of birth. Controls were individuals who had negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. Data were analyzed from January to July 2021. SARS-CoV-2 infection, determined via polymerase chain reaction testing. Cox proportional hazard models estimated the association between a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and subsequent psychiatric morbidity (depression, anxiety, psychosis, or self-harm), sleep problems, fatigue, or psychotropic prescribing. Models adjusted for comorbidities, ethnicity, smoking, and body mass index. Of 11Ã¢â‚¬Â¯923Ã¢â‚¬Â¯105 eligible individuals (6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯011Ã¢â‚¬Â¯020 [50.4%] women and 5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯912Ã¢â‚¬Â¯085 [49.6%] men; median [IQR] age, 44 [30-61] years), 232Ã¢â‚¬Â¯780 individuals (2.0%) had positive result on a SARS-CoV-2 test. After applying selection criteria, 86Ã¢â‚¬Â¯922 individuals were in the matched cohort without prior mental illness, 19Ã¢â‚¬Â¯020 individuals had prior anxiety or depression, 1036 individuals had psychosis, 4152 individuals had fatigue, and 4539 individuals had sleep problems. After adjusting for observed confounders, there was an association between positive SARS-CoV-2 test results and psychiatric morbidity (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.83; 95% CI, 1.66-2.02), fatigue (aHR, 5.98; 95% CI, 5.33-6.71), and sleep problems (aHR, 3.16; 95% CI, 2.64-3.78). However, there was a similar risk of incident psychiatric morbidity for those with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test results (aHR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.65-1.77) and a larger increase associated with influenza (aHR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.55-5.75). In this cohort study of individuals registered at an English primary care practice during the pandemic, there was consistent evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased risk of fatigue and sleep problems. However, the results from the negative control analysis suggest that unobserved confounding may be responsible for at least some of the positive association between COVID-19 and psychiatric morbidity.","Abel, Carr, Ashcroft, Chalder, Chew-Graham, Hope, Kapur, McManus, Steeg, Webb, Pierce","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.34803","20211116","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22121,""

To study the association of proximity of COVID-19 with symptoms of anxiety and depression in university students. This trend study analyzed weekly cross-sectional surveys of probabilistic samples of students from the University of British Columbia for 13 weeks through the first wave of COVID-19. The main variable assessed was propinquity of COVID-19, defined as ""knowing someone who tested positive for COVID-19"", which was specified at different levels: knowing someone anywhere globally, in Canada, in Vancouver, in their course, or at home. Proximity was included in multivariable linear regressions to assess its association with primary outcomes, including 30-day symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Of 1,388 respondents (adjusted response rate=50%), 5.6% knew someone with COVID-19 in Vancouver, 0.8% in their course, and 0.3% at home. Ten percent were overwhelmed and unable to access help. Knowing someone in Vancouver was associated with an 11 percentage-point increase in the probability of 30-day anxiety symptoms (SE=0,05; pÃ¢â€°Â¤0,05), moderated by gender, with a significant interaction of the exposure and being female (coefficient= 20(SE=0,09), pÃ¢â€°Â¤0,05).

Linguistically, racially, and ethnically diverse caregivers (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°286) of young children completed measures of caregiver mental health, caregiver pandemic-related stress, and child mental health (i.e., externalizing, internalizing, prosocial behavior) across three time points in the spring of 2020. Using autoregressive cross-lagged analyses, impaired caregiver mental health at Time 1 (April 2020) predicted increased caregiver pandemic-related stress at Time 2 (May 2020). Caregiver pandemic-related stress at Time 1 predicted increased child internalizing symptoms at Time 2 which, in turn, predicted increased caregiver pandemic-related stress at Time 3 (July 2020). Lastly, impaired caregiver mental health at Time 2 (May 2020) predicted increased child externalizing symptoms at Time 3 (July 2020). Assessing transactional relationships between child and caregiver mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic is important to inform models of risk and resilience. Interventions at the level of the caregiver, the child, and/or the family should be considered as a way to interrupt potential negative developmental cascades.","Robertson, Piscitello, Schmidt, Mallar, Davidson, Natale","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-021-00422-1","20211116","COVID-19; Caregiver well-being; Child mental health; Coronavirus; Resilience; Risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22131,""
"Changes in the pattern of suicide attempters visiting the emergency room after COVID-19 pandemic: an observational cross sectional study","This study aimed to find out the change in the rate and pattern of suicide attempts during severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19 pandemic period. This study was a retrospective analysis of data collected as a part of an emergency room-based post-suicide management program. The data were collected through interviews and from medical records of suicide attempts, maintained in the emergency room, from January 19 to October 31, 2020, during the ""COVID-19 period,"" and those who attempted suicide from January 19 to October 31, 2019 ""pre-COVID-19 period."" We extracted educational background, marital status, occupation, presence of domestic partner, history of mental illness, alcohol consumption, history of previous suicide attempts; suicide attempt method and location (i.e., at home or a place other than home) at the time of attempt, and whether the attempt was a mass suicide. In addition, we compared patient severity between ""COVID-19 period"" and ""pre-COVID-19 period"" using the initial KTAS (South Korean triage and acuity scale) level, consciousness level, and systolic blood pressure. In 2012, KTAS was developed through the Ministry of Health and Welfare's research project to establish triage system in South Korea. The analysis of the number of suicide attempts during ""pre-COVID-19 period"" and "" COVID-19 period"" showed that the number of suicide attempts during ""COVID-19 period"" (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°440) increased compared to the ""pre-COVID-19 period"" (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°400). Moreover, the method of suicide attempts during ""COVID-19 period"" included overdose of drugs such as hypnotics, antipsychotics, and pesticides that were already possessed by the patient increased compared to the ""pre-COVID-19 period"" (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). At the time of the visit to the emergency room, high KTAS level, low level of consciousness, and low systolic blood pressure, were observed, which were significantly different between ""COVID-19 period"" and ""pre-COVID-19 period"" (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). With the worldwide COVID-19 virus spread, suicide rate and suicide attempts at home have significantly increased. In addition, patient severity was higher in the ""COVID-19 period"" than that in the ""pre-COVID-19 period."" The increasing suicide attempt rate should be controlled by cooperation between the emergency room and regional organizations.","Kang, Lee, Ji, Yu, Jang, Kim, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03570-y","20211116","Attempted suicide; COVID-19; Emergency room; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22132,""
"Prevalence and factors associated with post-traumatic stress disorder in healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a cross-sectional survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant threats to both the physical and psychological health of healthcare workers working in the front-line combating COVID-19. However, studies regarding the medium to long term impact of COVID-19 on mental health among healthcare workers are limited. Therefore, we conducted this cross-sectional survey to investigate the prevalence, factors and impact of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 8 months after the end of the outbreak in Wuhan, China. A web-based questionnaire was delivered as a link via the communication application WeChat to those healthcare workers who worked at several COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°units during the outbreak (from December 2019 to April 2020) in Wuhan, China. The questionnaire included questions on social-demographic data, the post-traumatic stress disorder checklist-5 (PCL-5), the family care index questionnaire (Adaptation, Partnership, Growth, Affection and Resolve, APGAR), and the quality-of-life scale (QOL). The prevalence, risk and protective factors, and impact of PTSD on healthcare workers were subsequently analyzed. Among the 659 participants, 90 healthcare workers were still suffering from PTSD 8 months after the end of the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, in which avoidance and negative impact were the most affected dimensions. Suffering from chronic disease, experiencing social isolation, and job dissatisfaction came up as independent risk factors for PTSD, while obtaining COVID-19 related information at an appropriate frequency, good family function, and working in well-prepared mobile cabin hospitals served as protective factors. The impact of PTSD on COVID-19 exposed healthcare workers was apparent by shortened sleeping time, feeling of loneliness, poorer quality of life and intention to resign. Eight months after the end of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, the level of PTSD in healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 was still high. Apart from the commonly recognized risk factors, comorbid chronic disease was identified as a new independent risk factor for developing PTSD. For countries where the pandemic is still ongoing or in case of future outbreaks of new communicable diseases, this study may contribute to preventing cases of PTSD in healthcare workers exposed to infectious diseases under such circumstances.","Pan, Xu, Kuang, Zhang, Fang, Gui, Li, Tefsen, Zha, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03589-1","20211116","COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Mental health; PTSD; Risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22133,""
"Digital personal assistants are smart ways for assistive technology to aid the health and wellbeing of patients and carers","Digital health solutions such as assistive technologies create significant opportunities to optimise the effectiveness of both health and social care delivery. Assistive technologies include 'low-tech' items, such as memory aids and digital calendars or 'high-tech' items, like health tracking devices and wearables. Depending on the type of assistive devices, they can be used to improve quality of life, effect lifestyle improvements and increase levels of independence. Acceptance of technology among patients and carers depends on various factors such as perceived skills and competencies in using the device, expectations, trust and reliability. This service evaluation explored the impact of a pilot service redesign focused on improving health and wellbeing by the use of a voice-activated device 'smart speaker', Alexa Echo Show 8. A service evaluation/market research was conducted for a pilot service redesign programme. Data were collected via a survey in person or telephone and from two focus groups of patients (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°44) and informal carers (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7). The age of the study participants ranged from 50 to 90Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. Also, the participants belonged to two types of cohort: one specifically focused on diabetes and the other on a range of long-term health conditions such as multiple sclerosis, dementia, depression and others. The device had a positive impact on the health and social well-being of the users; many direct and indirect benefits were identified. Both patients and carers had positive attitudes towards using the device. Self-reported benefits included: reminders for medications and appointments improved adherence and disease control; increased independence and productivity; and for those living alone, the device helped combat their loneliness and low mood. The findings from the study help to realise the potential of assistive technology for empowering supporting health/social care. Especially, the season of COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for remote management of health, the use of assistive technology could have a pivotal role to play with the sustainability of health/social care provision by promoting shared care between the care provider and service user. Further evaluation can explore the key drivers and barriers for implementing assistive technologies, especially in people who are ageing and with long-term health conditions.","Balasubramanian, Beaney, Chambers","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-021-02436-y","20211116","Assistive device; Assistive technology; Diabetes; Health; Healthcare; Long-term condition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22134,""
"The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and residency training of family medicine residents: findings from a nationwide cross-sectional survey in Turkey","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on resident training in different branches and affected the physical and mental health of frontline residents adversely. This nationwide cross-sectional survey aimed to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on family medicine residents in Turkey, including the levels of depression and burnout. An anonymous online survey was distributed to all family medicine residents via e-mail and a web link between 28.11.2020 and 12.12.2020. Information on sociodemographic data and the residency programme were evaluated, and factors associated with depression and burnout were examined using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Burnout Measure-Short Version (BMS) respectively. Although the weekly average working hours of the 477 respondents increased significantly during the pandemic (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), the average weekly working time in the Family Medicine (FM) outpatient clinic decreased. The greatest concern of 58.3% of the residents was fear of transmitting COVID-19 to their family members. 90.2% of the residents stated that training programmes were negatively or very negatively affected. According to PHQ-9 scores, 15.7% of residents had moderately severe, and 14.9% severe depression. The BMS scores of the residents demonstrated that 24.1% had a very severe burnout problem, and 23.3% should seek professional help as soon as possible. Being single, having no children, female gender, lack of personal protective equipments and increased contact time with COVID-19 patients were associated with higher scores in the depression and burnout scales (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on training programmes for FM residents, who are at the forefront of the pandemic in Turkey, and this situation is closely related to depression and burnout. Due to the unpredictability of the pandemic, long-term plans should be made for the training needs of residents in order to protect their physical and mental health.","Ãƒâ€¡evik, Ungan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-021-01576-9","20211116","Burnout; COVID-19; Depression; Education; Family medicine; Graduate medical education; Pandemic; Primary care; Resident; Turkey; Work-related stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","",22135,""
