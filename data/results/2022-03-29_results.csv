"How does the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Indonesia's Islamic stock returns?","The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has ripped down the worldwide economies since the beginning of 2020. The stock market was one of the economic sectors that experienced depression and crashed during the pandemic. In this study we mount an investigation on how Indonesiaâ€™s large-scale social restrictions (known as PSBB) the announcement of the daily growth in total confirmed and death cases by COVID-19 affect the dynamic of Islamic stock returns in the Jakarta Islamic Index. This study used panel regression to test the effect between variables with market-to-book ratio and market capitalization ruled as a control variable. This study concluded that the announcement of daily growth in total confirmed cases by COVID-19 and the implementation of PSBB has a negative effect on the deterioration of the Islamic stock markets stability. Therefore, the higher growth of the total confirmed cases by COVID-19 and the tightening of the PSBB that was announced and implemented by the government would impact on the volatility of market and shareholders returns negatively. Interestingly this study also found that there was a positive and significant relationship between the daily growth of death cases and stock return. Furthermore, the sectors of consumer goods mining and trading counted as the most performed market during the pandemic crisis.","Agustin Isnaini, Nuzula","https://doi.org/10.31106/jema.v18i1.9235","","Database: Indonesian Research; Publication type: article; Publication details: JEMA: Jurnal Ilmiah Bidang Akuntansi dan Manajemen; 18(1):21-35, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29140,""

"The New Great Depression in the Context of Coronavirus Pandemic: A Test of Keynesian Theory for Russian Regions","J.M. Keynes is the author of the economic model which made it possible to overcome the Great Depression in the United States. The cornerstone of the theory is income. The regulatory measures of J.M. Keynes start from the fact that the behavior of the population in the long and short term is different. Using the data on the income of the population in the regions of Russia before the crisis and during crisis periods (caused by the coronavirus pandemic) of 2018Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2020, the authors test a hypothesis connected with the transformation of behavior models. In particular, the issue of changes in the proportions of savings and consumption of the population in the regions of Russia was studied. To confirm the hypothesis defined in the study, the clustering of regions was carried out, which allows us to draw conclusions about the isolation of more homogeneous groups of regions. The identified five clusters allow us to fully determine the main trends of consumer behavior and confirm the hypothesis set in the study. The results obtained allow us to speak about the relevance of the application of J.M. KeynesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ approaches to this crisis situation. It is also important to speak about the possibility of further research of the policy proposed at the moment which deals with the issues facing the global economy. The calculation of the ratio of the marginal and average consumption rate makes it possible to use the tools of the US economic policy of the early 20 th century in the modern social and economic reality. Using this research, the trends were identified and new threats associated with the virtualization of the economy were identified, which can become a kind of a trigger for a new Great Depression. The most important tasks at the moment are a deep fundamental study and description of the patterns of development of regional economic systems of various types and an analysis of the impact of various negative factors and shocks on their dynamics.Alternate : Ãâ€ÃÂ¶.ÃÅ“.

"Transforming the Concept of Human Capital Health in the Context of the COVID-19","The situation with the rapid progress of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has become the context for writing this article. The authors believe that the scientific development of sociological topics on the transformation of human capital health should be combined with the socio-philosophical discourse, which is part of modern social theory. The factor of fundamental uncertainty that affects all forms of human existence and universal relations in this context is quite significant. reflections on the universal principles of the world in connection with the coronavirus pandemic led the authors to understand the possibility of an ontological prerequisite for the growth of entropy (disorder) as a spectrum of disorganizing and destructive trends in nature and society, which reflect the modern ways of development of social systems in terms of the dichotomy of order and chaos. The pandemic began to spread rapidly in many countries, and time was lost. The leaders of many countries did not immediately realize that there is a high risk of medical and economic collapse. The proposed article is devoted to topical issues of human health capital in the context of modern shocks / turbulences, which are closely related to both the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus infection in the world and the associated unclear consequences of fundamental uncertainty. The article suggests theories, which formed the basis of the author's vision of problems of the transformation of human health capital: Marx (the commodification of medicine;new methods of production, shifts in global trading patterns);Durkheim (social theory of suicide and anomie;social rituals that shape solidarity);Weber (theory of bureaucratization and rationalization as applied to medicine and health, modern hospitals and clinics);Parsons (the concept of ""the role of the patient);Bourdieu (concepts of social capital, habitus, health);Habermas (colonization of medicine and the life-world) and others. The authors believe that the COVID-19 coronavirus as a trigger triggered the socio-economic mechanisms of many systems, exposed the weakest points in the social fabric of various societies and sharply aggravated all the socio-economic imbalances that have accumulated for decades in the world and in Russia.

Many countries have applied telemental health approaches to managing and treating mental disorders. This review study aimed to investigate the role of information technology, especially telemental health, in managing psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence Acquisition: This study was conducted in four phases: Identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion. Keywords were selected from MeSH to search the principal medical databases. Finally, important information was extracted from nine selected papers, including the author names, study setting, purpose, technology, method, intervention, and results. Results: Some studies provided telepsychiatry to people whose mental problems developed during COVID-19. Another study explained the telepsychological service for patients with mental illness before the epidemic. Most articles signified the influential role of telehealth in screening and reducing social contacts. Besides, this technology played a significant role in providing mental health services. Conclusions: The study showed that telemental health and telepsychiatry approaches effectively promote the mental health and well-being of participants with various mental problems. In implementing these approaches, some items such as allocating suffi- cient funds, preparing appropriate infrastructure, providing training for users, defining suitable evaluation methods, and considering confidentiality and privacy need to be considered.

"Barbiturate-related hospitalisations, drug treatment episodes, and deaths in Australia, 2000-2018","Objectives: To determine the characteristics and population rates of barbiturate-related hospitalisations, treatment episodes, and deaths in Australia, 2000-2018. Design, setting: Analysis of national data on barbiturate-related hospitalisations (National Hospital Morbidity Database, 1999-2000 to 2017-18), drug treatment episodes (Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Services National Minimum Data Set, 2002-03 to 2017-18), and deaths (National Coronial Information System, 2000-01 to 2016-17). Main outcome measures: Population rates directly age-standardised to the 2001 Australian standard population;average annual percentage change (AAPC) in rates estimated by Joinpoint regression. Results: We identified 1250 barbiturate-related hospitalisations ( 791 cases of deliberate self-harm [63%]), 993 drug treatment episodes (195 cases with barbiturates as the principal drug of concern [ 20%]), and 511 deaths during the respective analysis periods. The barbiturate-related hospitalisation rate declined from 0.56 in 1999-2000 to 0.14 per 100 000 population in 2017-18 (AAPC,-6.0%;95% CI,-7.2% to-4.8%);the declines in hospitalisations related to accidental poisoning (AAPC,-5.8%;95% CI,-9.1% to-2.4%) and intentional self-harm (AAPC,-5.6%;95% CI,-6.9% to-4.2%) were each statistically significant. Despite a drop from 0.67 in 2002-03 to 0.23 per 100 000 in 2003-04, the drug treatment episode rate did not decline significantly (AAPC,-6.7%;95% CI,-16% to +4.0%). The population rate of barbiturate-related deaths increased from 0.07 in 2000-01 to 0.19 per 100 000 population in 2016-17 (AAPC, +9.3%;95% CI, +6.2-12%);the rate of intentional self-harm deaths increased (AAPC, +11%;95% CI, +7.4-15%), but not that of accidental deaths (AAPC,-0.3%;95% CI,-4.1% to +3.8%). Conclusions: While prescribing and community use of barbiturates has declined, the population rate of intentional self-harm using barbiturates has increased. The major harm associated with these drugs is now suicide.","Darke, S.; Chrzanowska, A.; Campbell, G.; Zahra, E.; Lappin, J.","https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.51306","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medical Journal of Australia; 216(4):194-+, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29151,""
"Psychological observations of the parents on their children during COVID-19 pandemic social isolation in Jazan, Saudi Arabia","Background: Social isolation was imposed as the best preventive measure worldwide for the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the psychological effects of this measure among Saudi families in the Jazan province to assess its impact on children during this period. Methods: This study was a cross-section investigation conducted in the Jazan province that is located in the southwest part of the country. Data collection was conducted during May 2020 during the country-wise curfew in Saudi Arabia and targeted parents living in Jazan with a minimum of one child above the age of 5 years using a self-administered web-based questionnaire. Results: In total, 408 valid questionnaires were collected. About 50.5% (n = 206) of the parents reported their children as having abnormal psychological observation at the time of their social isolation, which is significantly associated with living status, the number of children (especially when the family has fewer than two children &lt;5 years old), and if any relatives or friends got COVID-19 or quarantined. The psychological effects ranged from anxiety, sleeping disturbance, fear of death, feeling frustrated or bored and violence. Conclusion: Our findings, although limited to observations of parents concerning their children, suggest that social isolation could be a possible risk factor for the development of more serious psychological ramifications in the future such as depression and anxiety.

"The socioeconomic apprehensions of a pregnant woman around COVID-19 â€“ Do we need to be worried?","Introduction: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become the most severe intercontinental health challenge and pregnant women are deemed to be a special population group. The COVID-19-related restrictions on visiting the hospital for antenatal check-up and procedures may be distressing for them. The present study aims at assessing the level of anxiety and risk perception of pregnant women during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional observational study included all pregnant women who were above 18 years of age, irrespective of their gestational age. They were administered the pre-designed, pre-tested questionnaire via face-to-face interview. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and its influence on women's experience including her worries were collected. Data analysis was done using SPSS software version 22. Results: A total of 130 pregnant women with a mean maternal age of 26.1 Â± 6.5 years were enrolled in the study. The mean gestational age of the women was 19 Â± 4.7 weeks and most of them were in the second trimester (48.5%). Most of the pregnant women encountered the adverse socioeconomic influence of COVID-19 on their daily life (55.6% somewhat, 9.1% moderately so, 1.1% very much). Majority of them reported that they had limited their social activities (78.5%) and amorous relationship with their partner (30.8%). Also, around 59.2% of antenatal women experienced a moderate level and 40.7% had a mild level of anxiety. Conclusion: It is essential for obstetric providers to do prompt identification of mental health concerns in perinatal women and to liaise with mental health professionals to provide relevant interference.

"Developing a brief acceptance and commitment therapy model for industrial psychologists","Orientation: Mental health distress is on the rise, which has significant implications for labour productivity. Industrial psychologists, who are equipped to offer work-based counselling, can play a vital role in alleviating this burden. Research purpose: This study was an investigation of current literature on industrial psychologists as counsellors, with a focus on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) as a framework to deliver brief work-based counselling. The aim was to offer a practical model of counselling, derived from the literature, for industrial psychologists to perform work-based counselling. Motivation for the study: There is a paucity of literature pertaining to evidence-based guidelines that industrial psychologists can follow to provide counselling. This study attempts to expand industrial psychologistsâ€™ counselling skill set by proposing an ACT intervention that can be applied as a brief counselling process in the workplace. Research approach/design and method: A systematic literature review of three separate literature streams yielded 1297 publications. After further analysis, 25 publications that met the criteria for relevance and quality were considered to create a model for workplace counselling. Main findings: Attention to the role of industrial psychologists as counsellors dwindled after the 1960s but has recently been given renewed attention by South African scholars. The literature review of experimental ACT designs revealed evidence-based guidelines that were combined to create the ACT for Work Well-being Model. Practical/managerial implications: The ACT for Work Well-being Model is a brief counselling protocol to offer systematic steps that industrial psychologists can implement during brief work-based counselling to address anxiety and depressive symptoms. Contribution/value-add: The proposed model is designed to stimulate further empirical validation and ensure evidence-based practice.","van Lill, Xander, van Lill, Rinet","https://doi.org/10.4102/sajip.v48i0.1897","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: SA Journal of Industrial Psychology; 48, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29154,""

"Predictors of eHealth Literacy and Its Associations with Preventive Behaviors, Fear of COVID-19, Anxiety, and Depression among Undergraduate Nursing Students: A Cross-Sectional Survey","Background: The infodemic has been co-existing with the COVID-19 pandemic with an influx of misinformation and conspiracy theories. These affect people's psychological health and adherence to preventive measures. eHealth literacy (eHEALS) may help with alleviating the negative effects of the infodemic. As nursing students are future healthcare professionals, having adequate eHEALS skills is critically important in their clinical practice, safety, and health. This study aimed to (1) explore the eHEALS level and its associated factors, and (2) examine the associations of eHEALS with preventive behaviors, fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19S), anxiety, and depression among nursing students. Methods: We surveyed 1851 nursing students from 7 April to 31 May 2020 from eight universities across Vietnam. Data were collected, including demographic characteristics, eHEALS, adherence to preventive behaviors (handwashing, mask-wearing, physical distancing), FCV-19S, anxiety, and depression. Linear and logistic regression analyses were performed appropriately to examine associations. Results: The mean score of eHEALS was 31.4 &plusmn;4.4. The eHEALS score was significantly higher in males (unstandardized regression coefficient, B, 0.94;95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 0.15 to 1.73;p = 0.019), and students with a better ability to pay for medication (B, 0.79;95% CI, 0.39 to 1.19;p &lt; 0.001), as compared to their counterparts. Nursing students with a higher eHEALS score had a higher likelihood of adhering to hand-washing (odds ratio, OR, 1.18;95% CI, 1.15 to 1.22;p &lt; 0.001), mask-wearing (OR, 1.15;95% CI, 1.12 to 1.19;p &lt; 0.001), keeping a safe physical distance (OR, 1.20;95% CI, 1.15 to 1.25;p &lt; 0.001), and had a lower anxiety likelihood (OR, 0.95;95% CI, 0.92 to 0.99;p = 0.011). Conclusions: Nursing students who were men and with better ability to pay for medication had higher eHEALS scores. Those with higher eHEALS scores had better adherence to preventive measures, and better psychological health. The development of strategies to improve eHEALS of nursing students may contribute to COVID-19 containment and improve their psychological health.","Tran, Ha T. T.; Nguyen, Minh H.; Pham, Thu T.

"The Short-Term Psychological Impact of Covid-19: A Systematic Review of the Literature","Covid-19 has originally spread in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease causes respiratory impairments and many other complications, such as fatigue, fever, muscle soreness and, in some cases, diarrhea and nausea, and can lead to death. The correlation between infectious diseases and psychological distress has already emerged during other epidemics, for example during SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Ebola. We conducted this systematic review to investigate the short-term psychological consequences of Covid-19 on the general population. Through a thematic analysis procedure, recurring themes have been identified. The most significant results concern the impact of social media, anxiety, and depression. In particular, fake news reported by the media increase the level of anxiety experienced by the population, and factors like being young or being old, being a student, being single or widow, along with a low level of education, further exacerbate anxiety symptoms. On the other hand, following the guidelines proposed by the government and having clear and comprehensible information were identified as protective factors. Our findings highlighted the need to monitor the high-risk population and to investigate the long-term effects of the pandemic.","Panzeri, M.; Santarpia, G.; Poli, C.

"Baseline situational analysis in Bangladesh, Jordan, Paraguay, the Philippines, Ukraine, and Zimbabwe for the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health: Universal Health Coverage for Mental Health","Introduction Mental, neurological and substance use conditions lead to tremendous suffering, yet globally access to effective care is limited. In line with the 13th General Programme of Work (GPW 13), in 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health: Universal Health Coverage for Mental Health to advance mental health policies, advocacy, and human rights and to scale up access to quality and affordable care for people living with mental health conditions. Six countries were selected as â€˜early-adopterâ€™ countries for the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health in the initial phase. Our objective was to rapidly and comprehensively assess the strength of mental health systems in each country with the goal of informing national priority-setting at the outset of the Initiative. Methods We used a modified version of the Program for Improving Mental Health Care (PRIME) situational analysis tool. We used a participatory process to document national demographic and population health characteristics;environmental, sociopolitical, and health-related threats;the status of mental health policies and plans;the prevalence of mental disorders and treatment coverage;and the availability of resources for mental health. Results Each country had distinct needs, though several common themes emerged. Most were dealing with crises with serious implications for population mental health. None had sufficient mental health services to meet their needs. All aimed to decentralize and deinstitutionalize mental health services, to integrate mental health care into primary health care, and to devote more financial and human resources to mental health systems. All cited insufficient and inequitably distributed specialist human resources for mental health as a major impediment. Conclusions This rapid assessment facilitated priority-setting for mental health system strengthening by national stakeholders. Next steps include convening design workshops in each country and initiating monitoring and evaluation procedures.","Kemp, Christopher G.; Concepcion, Tessa, Helal Uddin, Ahmed, Anwar, Nazneen, Baingana, Florence, Bennett, Ian M.; Bruni, Andrea, Chisholm, Dan, Dawani, Hania, Erazo, Marcia, Hossain, Saima Wazed, January, James, Ladyk-Bryzghalova, Alisa, Momotaz, Hasina, Munongo, Edmore, Renato Oliveira e, Souza, Sala, Giovanni, Schafer, Alison, Sukhovii, Oleksii, Taboada, Luis, Mark Van, Ommeren, Ann Vander, Stoep, Vergara, Jasmine, Waters, Chloe, Kestel, Devora, Collins, Pamela Y.","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265570","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: PLoS One; 17(3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29158,""
"Employment status and its associated factors for patients 12 months after intensive care: Secondary analysis of the SMAP-HoPe study","Background Returning to work is a serious issue that affects patients who are discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU). This study aimed to clarify the employment status and the perceived household financial status of ICU patients 12 months following ICU discharge. Additionally, we evaluated whether there exists an association between depressive symptoms and subsequent unemployment status. Methods This study was a subgroup analysis of the published Survey of Multicenter Assessment with Postal questionnaire for Post-Intensive Care Syndrome for Home Living Patients (the SMAP-HoPe study) in Japan. Eligible patients were those who were employed before ICU admission, stayed in the ICU for at least three nights between October 2019 and July 2020, and lived at home for 12 months after discharge. We assessed the employment status, subjective cognitive functions, household financial status, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and EuroQOL-5 dimensions of physical function at 12 months following intensive care. Results This study included 328 patients, with a median age of 64 (interquartile range [IQR], 52â€“72) years. Of these, 79 (24%) were unemployed 12 months after ICU discharge. The number of patients who reported worsened financial status was significantly higher in the unemployed group (p&lt;0.01) than in the employed group. Multivariable analysis showed that higher age (odds ratio [OR], 1.06;95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03â€“1.08]) and greater severity of depressive symptoms (OR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.05â€“1.23]) were independent factors for unemployment status at 12 months after ICU discharge. Conclusions We found that 24.1% of our patients who had been employed prior to ICU admission were subsequently unemployed following ICU discharge and that depressive symptoms were associated with unemployment status. The government and the local municipalities should provide medical and financial support to such patients. Additionally, community and workplace support for such patients are warranted.","Unoki, Takeshi, Kitayama, Mio, Sakuramoto, Hideaki, Ouchi, Akira, Kuribara, Tomoki, Yamaguchi, Takako, Uemura, Sakura, Fukuda, Yuko, Haruna, Junpei, Tsujimoto, Takahiro, Hino, Mayumi, Shiba, Yuko, Nagao, Takumi, Shirasaka, Masako, Satoi, Yosuke, Toyoshima, Miki, Masuda, Yoshiki, on behalf of the, Smap-HoPe Study Project","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263441","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: PLoS One; 17(3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29159,""
"Quasi-Experimental Study Comparing CBT, MBCT, Activity-Based Supportive Counselling for Hongkong Delinquent Youth","Purpose: This study compared Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), and Activity-based Supportive Counselling (treatment-as-usual;TAU) for reducing delinquency, psychological risk factors, mental health symptoms, and improving the quality of life among at-risk youths in Hong Kong outreaching social services. Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, non-custodial youths with delinquency and mental health issues underwent eight sessions of CBT (n = 24), MBCT (n = 30), or TAU (n = 61). Results: Dependent-sample t-test showed CBT reduced mental health symptoms and delinquency. TAU reduced mental health symptoms and improved quality of life. MBCT resulted in no significant change. Time x group ANCOVA underscored TAU in improving quality of life. Hierarchical linear regression showed decreases in delinquency and mental health symptoms mediated by decreases in psychological risk factors. Discussion: Results suggest that outreaching social service agencies in Hong Kong could enhance their intervention by augmenting the sports and leisure activities of TAU with structured CBT programs.","Wong, D.

"Promoting Student Well-Being Through Classroom Interventions","IntroductionBecause of their regular contact with students, faculty can find themselves in the position of needing to support student?s emotional needs, a task for which not everyone feels well trained.Statement of the ProblemCOVID-19 has exacerbated existing mental health concerns and created additional problems related to low levels of motivation, increased loneliness, and heightened levels of stress.Literature ReviewFortunately, psychological science can explain the causes of these symptoms as well as offer evidence-based interventions. The literature related to motivation, loneliness, and stress is reviewed with an emphasis placed on common studies or theories that are covered in typical psychology curriculums.Teaching ImplicationsEvidence-based classroom interventions and assignments designed to promote student well-being are discussed.ConclusionGrounding discussions of student?s emotional reactions within the psychological literature may help instructors without a mental health background better support student?s emotional needs, illustrate course concepts, and model the practice of clinical science while helping to promote student well-being.","Ibaraki, Alicia","https://doi.org/10.1177/00986283211063582","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Teaching of Psychology;: 00986283211063582, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29161,""
"Extended Reality Technologies: Expanding Therapeutic Approaches for PTSD","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop after severe or prolonged life-threatening events, such as those caused by war, accidents, and other traumas (e.g., fires, assault, near-drowning) (12). Persons with PTSD often relive their traumatic event in flashbacks and/or nightmares (13, 14). Individuals with PTSD also may experience severe anxiety when exposed to scenarios reminiscent of the original trauma and often avoid anything (mentally or physically) that reminds them of the trauma they experienced (12). Additional symptoms of PTSD include persistent alertness and mental hyperarousal, insomnia, irritability, hypervigilance, and low concentration, as well as reckless and self-destructive behaviors (e.g., illicit drug use, risky sexual behaviors, deliberate self-harm) (12-14). In PTSD, the trauma-related episodes are typically followed by distressing physiological responses that result in cognitive and behavioral avoidance, a coping mechanism aimed at reducing psychological distress and physiological hyperarousal (15). However, this avoidance only reinforces fear and thwarts adaptive processing of traumatic memories, thus perpetuating PTSD symptoms (15, 16). Caring for persons with PTSD, particularly military serv-icemembers deployed during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, has created challenges for existing healthcare systems (17-19). These challenges have recently been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the need to adapt management approaches to mental health symptoms such as fear, anxiety, depression, avoidance, and PTSD to pandemic-related healthcare deliver constraints (20). Accordingly, there is a need for improved assessments and evidence-based treatments that effectively reduce PTSD-associated psychological distress and func-tional disability.","Lopez-Ojeda, W.; Hurley, R.

"Association between maternal perceived capacity in life and physical punishment of teenage children: a longitudinal analysis of a population-based cohort in Tokyo, Japan","ObjectivesPerceived capacity denotes a subjective sense of having resources to cope with strains and hardships, and hence maternal perceived capacity may be protective against risk factors for child maltreatment. This study investigated the longitudinal association between maternal perceived capacity in life and child maltreatment.DesignThis population-based longitudinal study used self-reported questionnaires from the Tokyo Teen Cohort study (TTC), a large community-based cohort study conducted in Japan between 2014 and 2019.SettingMotherâ€“child pairs were randomly recruited from the resident registries of three municipalities in Tokyo, Japan.MethodsA total of 2515 mothers participated. Mothersâ€™ perceived capacity in life was evaluated using the self-reported TTC wave 2 survey when their children were 12 years old. Mothers rated the extent to which they had capacity in terms of time, finance, physical well-being, mental well-being and life in general. Physical punishment, which is linked to more severe childhood maltreatment, was assessed using a question about the use of physical punishment at the wave 3 survey when children were 14 years old.ResultsAfter controlling for baseline covariates (including maternal social support, age, marital status, annual household income, educational attainment, childâ€™s age, gender, sibling and birth order, and behavioural difficulties), higher perceived capacity in finance (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.99, p=0.026) and mental well-being (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.98, p=0.005) were associated with less frequent use of physical punishment with 14-year-old children.ConclusionsMaternal perceived capacity in finance and mental well-being may decrease the risk of frequent use of physical punishment at the 2-year follow-up. Child maltreatment prevention strategies should aim to empower mothers and promote their perceived capacity in financial management and mental health.","Nakanishi, Miharu, Yamasaki, Syudo, Niimura, Junko, Endo, Kaori, Nakajima, Naomi, Stanyon, Daniel, Baba, Kaori, Oikawa, Nao, Hosozawa, Mariko, Ando, Shuntaro, Hiraiwa-Hasegawa, Mariko, Kasai, Kiyoto, Nishida, Atsushi","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058862","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Open; 12(3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29163,""
"Developing an evaluation framework for assessing the impact of recovery colleges: protocol for a participatory stakeholder engagement process and cocreated scoping review","IntroductionRecovery colleges (RCs) are mental health centres aimed at equipping people with skills to live a meaningful life despite the presence of mental distress. Unique to them is the aspect of cocreation;RCs are designed collaboratively with people of lived experiences of mental health and addictions and care providers. Despite established benefits, there remains a lack of empirical evidence on how RCs work and on their impact.AimsWe aim to address this gap by designing a cocreated evaluation framework for RCs. This will be accomplished by engaging RC student/facilitators to provide perspectives on RCs/RC evaluation and cocreate a scoping review identifying evaluation gaps in the literature. Themes identified through these processes will form the evaluation framework.Methods and analysisTwo methodologies will be used to explore RC evaluation: student/facilitator engagement and a scoping review of current published and grey literature on RC evaluation. Engagement will be achieved using a participatory action research approach consisting of informant interviews of ~25 RC students/facilitators across Canada, which will be thematically analysed. The scoping review will follow methodology described by Arksey and Oâ€™Malley modified to support cocreation. Concurrent conducting of the engagement process and scoping review will allow RC students and peer facilitators the opportunity to shape RC evaluations, address gaps in the literature and codesign an evaluation framework focused on recovery-oriented processes and outcomes mattering most to RCs students/facilitators.Ethics and disseminationEthics approval was received for the RC student/facilitator engagement component from the Centre for Addictions and Mental Health Research Ethics Board (#042â€“2020) and Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences (#20â€“013-B). Scoping review results will be copresented through national and international medical education conferences and published in open-access peer-reviewed journals. Furthermore, a dissemination strategy on evaluation for the national RC community will be created.","Lin, Elizabeth, Harris, Holly, Gruszecki, Sam, Costa-Dookhan, Kenya A.; Rodak, Terri, Sockalingam, Sanjeev, Soklaridis, Sophie","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-055289","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Open; 12(3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29164,""
"Efficacy of virtual reality-based interventions for patients with breast cancer symptom and rehabilitation management: a systematic review and meta-analysis","ObjectivesTo determine the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-based intervention on the symptoms and rehabilitation management in patients with breast cancer.DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.Study selectionWe included all eligible randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies (published in English and Chinese).ParticipantsPatients with breast cancer (=18 years) undergoing cancer treatment.InterventionsAny intervention administered to improve the symptoms and rehabilitation of patients with breast cancer. The control group was given conventional care.OutcomesAll outcomes were as follows: pain, fatigue, anxiety, depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and range of motion of upper limb in patients with breast cancer.Data sourcesWe searched PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL and SinoMed, four electronic databases, covering the database establishment period to January 2022.Review methodsTwo reviewers independently extracted content and data consistent with the prespecified framework and assessed risk bias. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool data across trials. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager V.5.4.ResultsA total of eight studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this study. The combined effect size showed that VR was positive for improving patientsâ€™ anxiety(standard mean differenc (SMD)=-2.07, 95% CI= (-3.81 to -0.34), I2=95%) and abduction of upper limbs (MD=15.54, 95% CI= (12.79 to 18.29), I2=0%), but fatigue (SMD=-0.92, 95% CI= (-4.47 to 2.62), I2=99%) was not. Qualitative analysis showed VR improved patients' depressive symptoms, pain and cognitive function.ConclusionsVR technology has a good effect on symptoms and rehabilitation management of patients with breast cancer, but the quality of evidence is low, and the sample size is small. To date, there are few intervention studies, therefore, giving precise recommendation or conclusion is difficult. We have a favourable view of this, and more clinical studies are needed in the future to improve the credibility of the results.","Zhang, Huayi, Xu, Hui, Zhen-xiang, Zhang, Zhang, Qiushi","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051808","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Open; 12(3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29165,""
"COVID-19 and the relationships and involvement of nonresident fathers","Objective To support nonresident fathers in maintaining involvement and relationships with their children during the COVID-19 pandemic, we must understand how such fathers have been impacted thus far by the pandemic. Background All families have been impacted by the pandemic, but fathers who do not reside with their children are particularly likely to be negatively impacted. Social distancing, restrictions on travel, job loss/economic downturn, family court closures, and numerous other effects of the COVID-19 crisis impact the ability of nonresident fathers to maintain relationships and involvement with their children. Method The current study analyzed retrospective data from 373 nonresident U.S. fathers to assess perceived parenting and coparenting changes during the pandemic, as well as whether coparenting relationships and mental health were associated with their involvement and relationships with their children. Results On average, fathers' involvement, father?child relationship quality, and coparenting support declined, but wide variability also existed, with a substantial minority of fathers reporting increased involvement. Coparenting support was positively associated with current levels of involvement and relationship quality as well as changes to both since the pandemic, but mental health was inconsistently associated with outcomes. Conclusion and Implications To keep these average declines from becoming permanent, future research should investigate what factors foster higher involvement and improved relationships. Practitioners should offer additional support to nonresident fathers to promote their involvement and relationships in ways compatible with evolving restrictions.","Adamsons, Kari","https://doi.org/10.1111/fare.12663","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Family Relations; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29166,""
"A systemic supervisory methodology and approach used during COVID times: Collective cut-outs â€“ a gift from the left hand","This paper sets out to explore the use of a systemic reflexive exercise called ?Collective Cut-Outs?, detailing its methodology and usefulness with ?frontline? mental health practitioners within supervision and teaching contexts. We draw on the use of storytelling, image, creativity and the usefulness of the left hand (right brain) in clinical mental health contexts and focus on its value in reflexive supervisory groups. We also aim to give voice to the experiences of ?frontline? Black Asian Minority Ethnic (BAME) clinicians in an inner-city mental health team during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Collective Cut-Out exercise and its methodology provide a framework to help facilitate reflexive spaces that promote mindful group exercise and the subsequent expression of personal and professional resonance. The subjects of clinical challenge and collective resilience are also brought forth. We offer a case study in the second part of the paper, outlining the use of the exercise in a reflexive group supervisory context.

"Health literacy and mental health of school principals Results from a German cross-sectional survey","Purpose&gt;School principals are generally seen as key facilitators for the delivery and long-term implementation of activities on school health promotion, including health literacy. However, there is little evidence on the health literacy and health status of this occupational group. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the health literacy of school principals and its association with mental health indicators.Design/methodology/approach&gt;A cross-sectional online survey with German school principals and members of the management board (vice principals) was conducted (nÂ =Â 680, 68.3% female). Demographic (gender, age) and work characteristics (type of school, professional role) as well as health literacy served as independent variables. Mental health as a dependent variable included well-being, emotional exhaustion and psychosomatic complaints. Next to uni- and bivariate analysis, a series of binary logistic regression models was performed.Findings&gt;Of the respondents, 29.2% showed a limited health literacy with significant differences to the disadvantage of male principals. With regard to mental health, respondents aged over 60 years and those from schools for children with special educational needs were less often affected by low well-being as well as frequent emotional exhaustion and psychosomatic complaints. Taking into account demographic and work characteristics, regression models revealed significant associations between a low level of health literacy and poor mental health across all indicators.Research limitations/implications&gt;The cross-sectional nature of this study does not allow to draw conclusions about the causal pathways between health literacy and mental health. Although the sample has been weighted, the results cannot be generalized to the whole population of school principals. There is a need for evidence-based interventions aiming at promoting health literacy and mental health tailored to the needs of school principals.Originality/value&gt;This is the first study to investigate health literacy and its association with health indicators among school principals.","Dadaczynski, Kevin, Kotarski, Claudia, Rathmann, Katharina, Orkan, Okan","https://doi.org/10.1108/HE-10-2020-0094","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Education; 122(3):350-363, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29168,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Womenâ€™s Adjustment Following Pregnancy Loss","There are a variety of constraints to accessing social support following pregnancy loss that can negatively impact women. Being able to seek and receive needed social support following pregnancy loss may be further complicated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The current study explored the experiences and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women who have experienced miscarriage or stillbirth. Results showed that the pandemic exacerbated womenâ€™s feelings of grief, trauma, depression and anxiety. These findings indicate that addressing the mental health needs of women who have experienced pregnancy loss during the pandemic should be evaluated and addressed.

"The uptake and outcomes of an online self-help mindfulness programme during COVID-19","Objectives Methods Results Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has had negative mental health impacts. Online psychological interventions can facilitate rapid access to mental health resources. This study examined the outcomes of a 4-lesson, self-help online mindfulness course during the early months of the pandemic in Australia.5058 adults commenced the Introduction to Mindfulness course and completed measures of psychological distress (Kessler-10) and wellbeing (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale). 3696 individuals commenced their course between 2016 and 2019 (â€œpre-COVIDâ€ group), while 1362 started their course between 12 March 2020 and 31 July 2020 (â€œduring-COVIDâ€ group).Participants in the during-COVID-pandemic group reported slightly lower levels of psychological distress and higher levels of wellbeing compared to the pre-COVID group. In both groups, the mindfulness course was associated with medium effect size reductions in psychological distress (g =Â .49-.55) and small effect size improvements in wellbeing (g =Â .27-.41).The mindfulness course was associated with reduced psychological distress before and during the pandemic. Results underscore the generalisability of online mindfulness interventions to pandemic situations. KEY POINTS What is already known about this topic: The mental health impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have been substantial. Mental health service provision has adapted to meet community health needs in the wake of the pandemic. It is unclear if the effectiveness of online mental health interventions will generalise to pandemic conditions.

"Unravelling the complex interactions between self-awareness, cognitive change, and mood at 6-months post-stroke using the Y-shaped model","We investigated the relationships between cognitive change following stroke, awareness of cognitive impairments, and mood to further understanding of change processes influencing psychological outcomes post-stroke in line with the ""Y-shaped"" process model. Patients (n = 143;M-age = 73 years, SD = 13.73;74 males) were assessed at 3-weeks (T1) and 6-months (T2) post-stroke and had completed the Oxford Cognitive Screen (T1 and T2), the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ;T2), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS;T2). An ANCOVA controlling for disability relating to activities of daily living (ADL) revealed that awareness of cognitive impairment was significantly lower in participants with moderate-severe cognitive impairment. Regression analysis indicated that greater awareness of cognitive impairment and reduced independence in ADL were associated with greater emotional distress at T2. Cognitive improvement was associated with lower emotional distressat T2. Contrary to the awareness hypothesis, moderation analyses suggest that this effect was largest for those most cognitively impaired at T1. Findings emphasize the importance of monitoring stroke patients' capacity to be self-aware when assessing and formulating long-term post-stroke distress and have potential implications for improving long-term emotional status in those most cognitively impaired post-stroke, e.g., through psychoeducation, cognitive rehabilitation, and emotional support.","Wheeler, M.; Williams, O.

"Exploring the experiences, psychological well-being and needs of frontline healthcare workers of government hospitals in India: a qualitative study","The present study aims to understand the experiences, challenges, psychological well-being and needs of clinical and non-clinical government healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Hyderabad-Karnataka (H-K) region. This qualitative study used purposive sampling method to recruit 221 HCWs working in the H-K region government hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with those HCWs who agreed to participate. The data analyzed using conventional content analysis revealed three main themes: (1) experiences and challenges faced by HCWs;(2) psychological well-being and coping strategies used by HCWs;and (3) experience of and need for social support. The main findings of the current study are as follows: The HCWs experienced fear and apprehension during the early stages of the pandemic, but gradually, their fears reduced, and they perceived the situation to be the â€œnew normalâ€. They experienced work-related (scarcity of resources, problems with PPE, communication issues, violence, and stigma) and family-related (fear of infecting family members, choosing work over family, inability to undertake family roles) challenges while serving during the pandemic. They reported increased psychological issues (psychological distress, experience of loss, and feelings of guilt and helplessness). Conversely, they reported a need for emotional stability. The HCWs reported using adaptive (emotion-focused, problem-focused, and religious) and maladaptive (avoidance and substance abuse) coping strategies to cope with these challenges and psychological problems. They also sought social support (from family, friends, colleagues, and superiors) and raised the need for organizational, personal, and societal support to cope with the pandemic. The HCWs experienced physical and psychological burnout, especially from stretching beyond the assigned roles due to a shortage of resources and workforce. However, amidst juggling with work and family responsibilities, HCWs were found to be emotionally stable and reported to have a positive outlook in general.

"Relationship between family history of alcohol problems and different clusters of depressive symptoms","Objectives: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a multifactorial syndrome with significant interactions between genetic and environmental factors. This study specifically investigates the association between family history of alcohol problems (FHAP) and family history of depression (FHD), and how these relate to different clusters of depressive symptoms. Methods: Correlations between FHAP and FHD and different clusters of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were studied. We sampled 333 employees from a general hospital who had been receiving a psychiatric consultation between 2005 and 2012. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models were conducted to explore these correlations. Results: There was a significant positive correlation between FHAP and BDI affective score. This result remained significant even after the adjustment for other variables considered as important factors for MDD, such as gender, age, marital status, education, ethnic group and FHD. More specifically, FHAP was correlated with dissatisfaction and episodes of crying among the affective symptoms. FHAP showed no statistical difference in any of the other clusters score or in the BDI total score. Moreover, as expected, we found a correlation between FHD and BDI total score and Somatic and Cognitive clusters. Conclusion: FHAP should be routinely investigated in individuals presenting with depressive symptoms. This is especially important in cases presenting with dissatisfaction and episodes of crying in patients who do not endorse criteria for MDD. Due to study limitations, the findings require replication by neurobiological, epidemiological and clinical studies.","Castaldelli-Maia, J. M.; Silva, N.

The overall objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of TrIGR in reducing deployment-related guilt. The overarching hypothesis is that TrIGR will reduce guilt, shame, and related distress, and these improvements will be significantly greater than in the comparison condition, Supportive Care Therapy (SCT). The study is a Stage 2 randomized, controlled trial of TrIGR compared to SCT. Recruitment of participants takes place at two VA Medical Centers (San Diego, CA and Providence, RI). 150 OEF/OIF Veterans will be randomized to TrIGR or SCT (at least 75 in San Diego).

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed intervention, Practice of Acceptance, Awareness, and Compassion in Caregiving (PAACC) that integrates mindfulness training with caregiving skills training. Several studies have shown effectiveness of mindfulness in decreasing caregiver burden in caregivers of individuals with cognitive deficits, but most of them did not provide caregiving skills training with mindfulness. Our study hypothesis is that intervention such as PAACC which combines education, skill building, and mindfulness practices will enhance caregiving skills and will reduce caregiver stress as well as increase quality of life of the care recipient.

The survey was created by BHIVA/CHIVA and PHE and was piloted prior to circulation to all HIV clinics within the UK on 3 July 2020. The survey questions were designed to assess the impact of the first wave of COVID-19 on HIV clinics and lead/senior HIV clinicians. Clinicians' responses were collected between 3 July 2020 and 17 September 2020. The survey responses were collated, and non-statistical analysis was performed. The results of the survey confirmed that services had undergone substantial changes, including a shift from face-to-face consults to predominantly virtual consultations. Some clinicians' responses suggested that the first wave had many negative effects on people living with HIV, including their ability to access mental health services. The first wave of COVID-19 caused significant changes to HIV services within the UK. There was a shift toward the use of technology in healthcare, and results from subsequent clinician surveys carried out since the first wave of COVID-19 will reflect the ongoing transformation of care towards a more virtual service.","Shanks, Shah, Williams, Asboe, Anderson, Delpech, Ely, Waters","https://doi.org/10.1111/hiv.13307","20220328","COVID-19; HIV; pandemic; services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29182,""

Results showed a higher prevalence of moderate anxiety and depression symptoms in the 2020 than in the 2012 and 2016 cohorts, but differences in mean scores were absent or small. The prevalence of sleep problems, fatigue, use of medicines for symptoms did not differ between the three cohorts. The use of mental health services was more prevalent in the 2020 than in 2016 cohort, but there was already a statistical trend of higher use in the 2016 compared to the 2012 cohort. No differences in the incidence of any MHP, based on data of the previous year (2011, 2015, and 2019, respectively) were found.

TheÃ‚Â patient health questionnaire-4 was utilized to assess anxiety and depressive symptoms. An additional questionnaire to assess specific concerns related to T1D and COVID-19 was administered to the T1D group to explore potential causes for increased psychosocial burden. T1D was associated with a five-times higher risk of anxiety symptoms. Increased anxiety symptoms in T1D group appear to be, at least in part, due to fear of higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection and uncertainty regarding access to diabetes supplies. This study provides a snapshot of mental well-being in a diverse population of patients with T1D in the acute phase of a crisis and underscores the need for timely, accurate medical information and distribution of medical resources for pediatric T1D population.","Wade, Burton, Akinseye, Nelson, Smith-Young, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1515/jpem-2022-0002","20220328","COVID-19; anxiety; pediatric type 1 diabetes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29184,""
"Dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety in nonpsychotic psychiatric outpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic: A network analysis","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound impact on the mental health of people worldwide. This study examined dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety in nonpsychotic psychiatric outpatients during the pandemic using the coronavirus anxiety scale (CAS) and examined the relationship between coronavirus anxiety and clinical symptoms using network analysis. In this cross-sectional study, 192 patients who first visited the psychiatric outpatient clinic of Severance Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic with chief complaints of depressed mood, anxiety, somatic symptoms, or insomnia were included. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients with and without dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety. Network analysis was conducted to estimate the network of coronavirus anxiety and depressive, anxious, and hypochondriacal psychopathology. The results showed that 7.8% of patients exhibited dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety (CASÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°5). Patients with dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety showed higher levels of health worry, somatic preoccupation, and subjective anxiety compared to patients without dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety. In the network analysis, the health worry node (Item 6 of the WI) showed the greatest number of connections with coronavirus anxiety nodes. These findings suggest that health worry may be an important bridge symptom that connects coronavirus anxiety and other clinical psychopathology. Patients with elevated health worries should be carefully monitored during the COVID-19 pandemic for exacerbation of previous symptoms and COVID-19-related psychopathology. Understanding the psychological factors in the face of the pandemic and their relationships with clinical psychiatric symptoms would help people prevent and overcome mental health problems during the pandemic.","Kim, Seo, Lee, Jeon, Park, Kim, Kang","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23256","20220328","COVID-19; anxiety; anxiety disorders; coronavirus; depressive disorders; somatoform disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29185,""
"Mental health services for all: Factors influencing desire for mental health services among underresourced adults during COVID-19","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has substantially impacted psychological health in the U.S and has disproportionately impacted underresourced individuals. Despite the higher need for mental health services during this time, service availability and access were disrupted due to increased demand, social distancing recommendations, and stay-at-home orders. Thus, it is crucial to understand factors that predict the desire for psychological services for underresourced individuals. The present study examined factors at multiple levels of Bronfenbrenner's socioecological model (Bronfenbrenner, 1994) to determine which factors best predicted the desire for mental health services including individual, group, in-person, and online services. The sample consisted of 155 underresourced adults in North Carolina. Participants completed an online survey of mental health symptoms, coping strategies, COVID-19 related stressors, and provided demographic information including ZIP code, which was used to classify urban-central and urban-outlying dwellers. Results from univariate general linear models demonstrated that depression symptoms, venting as a coping strategy, COVID-related stress, and living in more rural regions were all significant predictors of the desire for psychological services. Venting as a predictor of the desire for services may signify a general misunderstanding regarding the purpose of psychotherapy as well as the need for individuals to gain social support and connectedness during a pandemic. This study helps to clarify individual-level and contextual factors that impact the desire for psychological services during a global pandemic.

Papers were included into this review (1) if they included trauma-focused interventions; (2) if the intervention was delivered virtually; and (3) if the article was published in the English-language. Twenty-one papers met inclusion criteria and were included for analysis. Findings from the rapid review demonstrate that virtual interventions that incorporate trauma-focused treatment are scarce. Online interventions that incorporate trauma-focused treatment for this at-risk group are limited in scope, and effectiveness data are preliminary in nature. Additionally, there is limited evidence of acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of virtual interventions for ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse populations experiencing domestic violence and sexual violence. Accessing virtual interventions was also highlighted as a barrier to among participants in studies included in the review.

"Generalized Anxiety Mediates the Relationship Between Loneliness and Sleep Quality Amongst Young Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Since the outbreak of COVID-19, restrictions to minimize its spread have had a profound effect. Government instigated restrictions, such as social isolation, have affected millions worldwide, and the downstream consequences of perceived loneliness upon mental health and sleep are largely unknown. A total of 1662 individuals participated in an online survey. Loneliness, anxiety, and sleep quality were assessed using the UCLA Loneliness Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorders scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. Higher levels of perceived loneliness, as well as each one-unit increase in anxiety, were independent predictors of poor sleep quality, where OR = 1.16 (95% CI: 1.03-1.31) and 1.16 (1.11-1.21), respectively, and after adjustment. In our path analysis, we revealed significant direct effects between loneliness and sleep quality (ÃŽÂ² = 0.25, <i>p</i> &lt; .001), as well as generalized anxiety and sleep quality (ÃŽÂ² = 0.28, <i>p</i> &lt; .001), and generalized anxiety mediated the relationship between loneliness and sleep quality (ÃŽÂ² = 0.33, <i>p</i> &lt; .001). Heightened anxiety and perceived loneliness appear to be significant drivers of poor sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Sentiment and emotion trends in nurses' tweets about the COVID-19 pandemic","Twitter is being increasingly used by nursing professionals to share ideas, information, and opinions about the global pandemic, yet there continues to be a lack of research on how nurse sentiment is associated with major events happening on the frontline. The purpose of the study was to quantitatively identify sentiments, emotions, and trends in nurses' tweets and to explore the variations in sentiments and emotions over a period in 2020 with respect to the number of cases and deaths of COVID-19 worldwide. A cross-sectional data mining study was held from March 3, 2020 through December 3, 2020. The tweets related to COVID-19 were downloaded using the tweet IDs available from a public website. Data were processed and filtered by searching for keywords related to nursing in the profile description field using the R software and JMP Pro Version 16 and the sentiment analysis of each tweet was done using AFINN, Bing, and NRC lexicon. A total of 13,868 tweets from the Twitter accounts of self-identified nurses were included in the final analysis. The sentiment scores of nurses' tweets fluctuated over time and some clear patterns emerged related to the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Joy decreased and sadness increased over time as the pandemic impacts increased. Our study shows that Twitter data can be leveraged to study the emotions and sentiments of nurses, and the findings suggest that the emotional realm of nurses was affected during the COVID-19 pandemic according to the emotional trends observed in tweets.

"What catalyzes the proactive recovery of peasants from the COVID-19 pandemic? A livelihood perspective in Ningqiang County, China","The livelihood recovery strategy is utilized for peasants during the COVID-19 pandemic. This strategy serves a salient role to help them recover from the relevant hazardous impacts. Disaster risk has been a major concern among hazards for the increasing likelihood of exposure and vulnerability, especially in the process of poverty alleviation in China. However, few studies have discussed the factors and mechanisms that influence peasants to adopt livelihood recovery strategies in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Based on a case study of Ningqiang County, China, this study explores the mechanisms that catalyze the proactive recovery of peasants from the COVID-19 pandemic from a livelihood perspective. Methodologically, the study proposes a framework that integrates the modified pressure-state-response (PSR) framework and the sustainable livelihoods approach (SLA), and it employs structure equation modeling (SEM) approach to examine how specific factors affect peasants to proactively adopt livelihood strategies to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate that the COVID-19 pressure significantly increases the risk perception of peasants and decreases their livelihood capital. Further, the decreased livelihood capital, the improvement of risk perception and supportive policy will promote peasants to adopt livelihood recovery strategies. Moreover, the results specify that risk perception and supportive policy mediate the relation between livelihood capital and recovery strategy. The findings will be beneficial for policymakers and researchers to understand the mechanisms that peasants adopt livelihood strategies to recover from disasters, and can serve as references for formulating disaster risk reduction and resilience policies.","Zhao, Guo, Peng","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.102920","20220328","COVID-19; Disaster recovery; Livelihood strategy; Pressure-state-response framework; Rural China","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29191,""
"Psychosocial predictors of anxiety and depression in a sample of healthcare workers in Botswana during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multicenter cross-sectional study","This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on healthcare workers across multiple hospitals in different districts in Botswana. We conducted a cross-sectional study in five public-funded hospitals from three districts in Botswana from 1 June 2020 to 30 October 2020. We used the neuroticism subscale of the 44-item Big Five Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire, the Oslo 3-item Social Support Scale, the Anxiety Rating Scale, and the 14-item Resilience Scale to obtain data from 355 healthcare workers. The participants' mean age (standard deviation) was 33.77 (6.84) years. More females (207, 59%) responded than males (144, 41%). Anxiety and depression were experienced by 14% and 23% of the participants, respectively. After multiple regression analyses, neuroticism predicted depression (<i>B</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.22; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and anxiety disorder (<i>B</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.31; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Lower educational status (<i>B</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.13; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007) predicted anxiety and younger age (<i>B</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.10; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.038) predicted depression, while resilience negatively correlated with both disorders.

"Factors Associated with Distress Among Medical Staff During the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Peru","The current COVID-19 pandemic affects the mental health of medical staff. Our objective was to evaluate the factors that are associated with the distress of physicians in two general hospitals in Lima, Peru. A cross-sectional correlational survey study was carried out. Physicians completed The Impact of Event Scale-Revised-22 (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). A total of 310 physicians completed the survey, 36.5% of whom reported distress symptoms. Higher levels of distress were reached by women, by those with a prior psychiatric diagnosis, by those who considered that the hospital does not provide adequate personal protective equipment, and by those who perceived stigma from family members. Multiple regression analysis showed that there is a correlation between distress symptoms and anxiety symptoms, (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.509), depressive symptoms (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.305), the total hours/week worked in the Emergency Department (<i>B</i>=-0.142), and the stigma perception (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.096).

"Psychological Well-Being During the Second Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediation Role of Generalized Anxiety","The outbreak of the COVID-19 has largely impacted individuals' health and lifestyles. This study aimed to investigate people's psychological well-being during the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. We selected six indicators of psychological well-being: fear of COVID-19, loneliness, social interaction anxiety, generalized anxiety, PTSD, and depression. A sample of 231 Italian participants (56.3% women), with a mean age of 32.7 (<i>SD</i>=12.61), completed an online survey from February to March 2021, during the so called ""second wave"". It included the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), the UCLA Loneliness Scale- Version 3, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS). Apart from loneliness, women reported lower levels of psychological well-being than men. Fairly good associations between all the detected variables were found. Based on a mediation model evaluation (in which generalized anxiety was introduced as a mediator in the relationship between fear of COVID-19, PTSD, loneliness, social interaction anxiety, and depression), except for social interaction anxiety, total and partial mediation effects suggested that generalized anxiety played a crucial role in exacerbating depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Our outcomes may expand the knowledge about the psychological well-being during the pandemic experience, with a focus on the mediating role of generalized anxiety.","Faraci, Bottaro, Valenti, Craparo","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S354083","20220328","fear; generalized anxiety; loneliness; mediation model; pandemic; psychological well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29194,""
"[Self-perceived health status in health workers 3 and 6 months after a SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19)]","After the acute period of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19), multi-organ signs and symptoms may remain. This study tried to compare the perception of the state of health and the sequelae in Navarra-Osasunbidea health workers after COVID-19, with the previous situation through the Health Survey. Through a descriptive cross-sectional study, using a reduced questionnaire from the 2017 National Health Survey sent to health workers from the Navarre-Osasunbidea Health Service COVID-19 cases after 3 and 6 months, from April to July 2021 and compared with 2017. Differences were described through means, percentages and prevalence ratio, with 95% confidence intervals. Of 938 surveys sent, 93 of 3 months (46.3%) and 305 of 6 months (41.4%) were received, 87% of women and 13% of men and 43 years of average age and 64.3% were from nursing and 19.1% from medicine. The percentage that assessed their health status as good or very good was significantly lower at 6 months than health workers and the general population in 2017 (70.2% vs 80.4% and 75.5%), the limitation for the habitual activity (39.8% and 35.1% vs 18.3%), headache 2.7 times more frequent, the days of activity restriction (41.5 and 26.7 vs 7.5) and on bed. Mental health problems, concentration (45.2% and 43.9%), loss of sleep (44.1% and 43.3%) and consumption of tranquilizers and antidepressants (2 and 3 times more) stood out, although not of medical consultations.

"Predictors of happiness during the COVID-19 pandemic in mothers of infants and/or preschoolers: a pre-COVID-19 comparative study in Japan","Happiness may help to prevent negative physiological outcomes in response to life events; however, factors contributing to happiness during the COVID-19 pandemic have not been longitudinally investigated. This study explored the predictors of happiness in mothers of young children in Japan using comparable data that were obtained before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted the baseline survey in February 2020, and 4 months later, we also conducted the follow-up survey. Throughout all 47 prefectures in Japan, 4,700 (100 respondents/prefecture) mothers of infants and/or preschoolers (0-6 years) participated in the baseline online survey; 2,489 of these also participated in the follow-up survey. We performed hierarchical multiple regression analysis and our final model indicated that maternal happiness during COVID-19 pandemic was positively related to employment status (homemaker, ÃŽÂ² = 0.052, p = 0.014), levels of available social support (average, ÃŽÂ² = 0.052, p = 0.012, high, ÃŽÂ² = 0.055, p = 0.010) and happiness score before the pandemic (ÃŽÂ² = 0.467, p &lt; 0.001), and satisfaction toward the measures against the COVID-19 at partners' workplace (average, ÃŽÂ² = 0.129, p &lt; 0.001; high, ÃŽÂ² = 0.279, p &lt; 0.001), preventive behavior against COVID-19 (average, ÃŽÂ² = 0.055, p = 0.002; high, ÃŽÂ² = 0.045, p = 0.015) and positive attitudes/thinking (ÃŽÂ² = 0.087, p &lt; 0.001) during the pandemic. In contrast, poor mental health (K6 Ã¢â€°Â¥5, ÃŽÂ² = -0.042, p = 0.011) before the pandemic and negative changes during the pandemic (Ã¢â€°Â¥3, ÃŽÂ² = -0.085, p &lt; 0.001) were negatively related to maternal happiness during the pandemic. Our final model explained 44.9% of the variance in mothers' happiness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Satisfaction toward the measures against the COVID-19 at partners' workplace, preventive behavior, and positive attitudes/thinking were especially important for maternal happiness during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Depression among schoolchildren and adolescents aged 9-17 years during the outbreak of COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 in Beijing: a cross-sectional online survey","The COVID-19 outbreak and related confinement have highly impacted psychological health among children and adolescents. This study aimed to explore the potential risk factors for depression among primary and middle school students and provide advices for psychological interventions during the outbreaks. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 18 primary and middle school students via quota sampling in Beijing during March 2020. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to assess depression. Differences between characteristics and depression were examined by chi-square tests. Multivariate logistic regression was used to reveal the potential risk factors for depression. A total of 7377 participants were included. The proportion of depression was 29.7%. Students in rural areas, with higher school categories, in graduating grades, with poor or excessive sleep duration, and without daily exercise were associated with a higher proportion of depression. Furthermore, students with a higher knowledge performance of COVID-19 showed a lower proportion of depression (odds ratio [OR]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.900, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]: 0.888-0.913). Students who worried about academic performance (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.919, 95% CI: 1.718-2.144) or COVID-19 infection (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.450, 95% CI: 1.268-1.658) exhibited a high proportion of depression. The proportion of depression among primary and middle school students was negatively associated with the knowledge score and positively associated with their worry.

"Survivors' Concerns During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative Insights From the National Sexual Assault Online Hotline","With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of stay-at-home orders in March 2020, experts warned of the possible threat of increased interpersonal violence among individuals isolated with abusers. Researchers have sought to understand how the pandemic impacted victims primarily through the analysis of administrative data sources, such as hospital and police records. However, the preponderance of this data shows a decrease in formal help-seeking among victims during the pandemic, speaking to an impaired access to services but limiting our understanding of other ways in which the pandemic has affected survivors. To overcome these limitations, we examined data collected about users of the National Sexual Assault Online Hotline (NSAOH). Information was collected through staff based on retrospective recall following one-on-one chat sessions with 470 victims of sexual violence who contacted the NSAOH in the first six months of the pandemic and discussed COVID-19-related concerns. We qualitatively examined open-ended descriptions of COVID-19-related concerns and identified the four most common: (1) mental health concerns, (2) creation or exacerbation of an unsafe living situation, (3) not being able to access services, and (4) not having access to a mandatory reporter or trusted adult. These findings demonstrate the myriad ways in which the pandemic affected the lives of victims of sexual violence and can inform practices for services and practitioners to best meet the needs of survivors moving forward. Specifically, these findings highlight the need for more accessible mental health services and funding for sexual assault service providers, as well as the importance of safety planning, particularly in times of crisis.","Elliott, Bardwell, Kamke, Mullin, Goodman","https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605221080936","20220328","COVID-19; mental health; qualitative analysis; sexual abuse; sexual violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29199,""

"COVID-19 Prevention Practices Among Prisoners, in Southern Ethiopia","Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease with high attack and case fatality rate. Since WHO's declaration of disease as pandemic in March 2020, the unprecedented global crises have been happening. To curb and reduce such crises, multi-dimensional international efforts have been made, particularly, infection prevention measures has been developed. However, there was a wide gap of implementing COVID-19 prevention measures from rural to urban, from institution to institution and from person to person. Therefore, the aim of this study was to measure the level of prevention practice towards COVID 19 and associated factors in prison, in Sidama National Regional State, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study using quantitative method of data collection was conducted in November, 2020 among 422 prisoners in two prisons. Data were collected by trained nurses using structured questionnaires. We analyzed data using SPSS version 24 software. Descriptive statistics and bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed to identify factors associated with prevention practices of COVID-19. More than one-fifth (22%; 95% CI: 19%, 26%) of respondents had good preventive practice. Participants who had a history of alcohol intake were 1.79 times less likely to implement good preventive practice for COVID-19 (AOR = 1.79; 95% CI; 1.09, 2.93). The respondents who had negative attitude towards COVID-19 infection were 1.69 times more likely to have poor prevention practice (AOR = 1.69; 95% CI: 1.02, 2.81). In this study, COVID-19 prevention practice among prisoners was very low. Negative attitude and previous alcohol taking history were factors associated with poor prevention practice. Accordingly, the researchers recommends to the concerned body to design educational intervention to change the attitude towards COVID-19 and other infectious diseases and behaviors of the prisoners.","Chea Hankalo, Alemayehu, Fikre, Shona","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S350257","20220328","COVID-19; Ethiopia; Sidama; prevention practice; prison","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29201,""
"Extraversion and Neuroticism on College Freshmen's Depressive Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Social Support","This study aims to explore the direct effects of extraversion and neuroticism on college freshmen's depressive symptoms and their indirect effects via social support under the background of COVID-19. A total of 3,563 college freshmen were surveyed using the extraversion and neuroticism scales of the Chinese version of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), the Chinese version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). Partial correlation analyses and regression analyses were used. (1) Extraversion had a significant and negative predictive effect on depressive symptoms, while neuroticism positively predicted depressive symptoms. The interaction effect between extraversion and neuroticism on depressive symptoms was also significant. Neuroticism had a greater impact on depressive symptoms in college freshmen with low levels of extraversion. (2) Furthermore, social support partially mediated the relationships between extraversion and depressive symptoms, and neuroticism and depressive symptoms. Extraversion and neuroticism can directly affect college freshmen' s depressive symptoms, and have indirect effects via the mediating role of social support. Additionally, extraversion interacts with neuroticism, and extraversion plays a protective role in the effect of neuroticism on depressive symptoms. These findings help identify college freshmen at high risk of depression and design effective prevention or intervention measures for them.","Yu, Hu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.822699","20220328","depressive symptoms; extraversion; multiple mediating effects; neuroticism; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29202,""
"Using Mindfulness-Based Interventions to Support Self-regulation in Young Children: A Review of the Literature","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a rise in stress, mental health concerns, and externalizing behaviors in children and their caregivers across the globe and illuminated the need to reduce stress levels and support self-regulation skills in even the youngest of children. The goal of this literature review is to describe what research has shown about the use of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) to support young children's self-regulation in early childhood settings. A total of 18 research studies conducted between 2010 and 2021 were identified. The main purposes of the studies reviewed were to examine the effects of MBIs on the development of emotional, behavioral, and cognitive self-regulation. Results showed that teachers generally found mindfulness practices feasible, acceptable, and effective in their classrooms. Although MBIs were found to have mixed effects on self-regulation in young children, positive effects on self-regulation were significantly greater for children in need of additional support, including those with difficulties or delays in developing self-regulation skills. The current review found a wide variety of MBIs used in early childhood settings globally. The results of this review suggest that teaching mindfulness practices to young children and their caregivers can both support the development of self-regulation of young children and foster socially and emotionally healthy environments in which this development can occur.","Bockmann, Yu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-022-01333-2","20220328","Early childhood; Mindfulness; Mindfulness-based interventions; Self-regulation; Young children","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29203,""
"You before me: How vertical collectivism and feelings of threat predicted more socially desirable behaviour during COVID-19 pandemic","The present study investigated the relationship between outward orientation and COVID-related prosocial behavior, including adherence to containment measures, caring for others and providing support, limiting one's social life and responsible purchasing behavior. A sample of 500 Slovaks (250 women) aged between 18 and 86 (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°44.32, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.66) participated in the study and responded to questions concerning their sociodemographic and personality characteristics, collectivism and individualism, the consciousness of future consequences and emotional responses to the pandemic. The results show that apart from the perceived threat of COVID-19, vertical collectivism is among the strongest antecedents of COVID-related prosocial behavior. Specifically, feelings of threat, vertical collectivism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, liberalism, and education predicted more prosocial behavior during the pandemic. Consequently, the study indicates that while excessive fear may have adverse effects on individuals' well-being, appealing to and cultivating collectivistic sentiments could contribute not only to containing the pandemic but also to making others' lives more bearable while it lasts.","Ã„Å’avojovÃƒÂ¡, Adamus, BallovÃƒÂ¡ MikuÃ…Â¡kovÃƒÂ¡","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03003-3","20220328","Big five; COVID-19; Collectivism; Future orientation; Helplessness; Threat","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29204,""
"Association of Economic Recession and Social Distancing With Pediatric Non-accidental Trauma During COVID-19","There has been concern that the incidence of non-accidental trauma (NAT) cases in children would rise during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the combination of social isolation and economic depression. Our goal was to evaluate NAT incidence and severity during the pandemic across multiple US cities. Multi-institutional, retrospective cohort study comparing NAT rates in children &lt;18Ã‚Â y old during the COVID-19 pandemic (March-August 2020) with a recent historical data (January 2015-February 2020) and during a previous economic recession (January 2007-December 2011) at level 1 Pediatric Trauma Centers. Comparisons were made in local and national macroeconomic indicators. Overall rates of NAT during March-August 2020 did not increase compared to historical data (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.8). Severity of injuries did not increase during the pandemic as measured by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.97) or mortality (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.7), but Injury Severity Score (ISS) slightly decreased (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.018). Racial differences between time periods were seen, with increased proportions of NAT occurring in African-Americans during the pandemic (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). NAT rates over time had low correlation (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.32) with historical averages, suggesting a difference from previous years. Older children (Ã¢â€°Â¥3 y) had increased NAT rates during the pandemic. Overall NAT rates had low inverse correlation with unemployment (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.37) and moderate inverse correlation with the stock market (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.6). Significant variation between sites was observed. Overall NAT rates in children did not increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, but rates were highly variable by site and increases were seen in African-Americans and older children. Further studies are warranted to explore local influences on NAT rates.","Lewit, Kotagal, Duron, Falcone, Fortenberry, Greene, Leonard, Makoroff, Midura, Moody, Ramaiah, Gosain, Slidell","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2022.02.038","20220327","Abuse; COVID-19; Economic; Maltreatment; Non-accidental trauma; Pediatric; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29205,""

"Editorial: Stepping Up Care to Reach More Families","There are not enough of us. That was true even before the COVID-19 pandemic, which has only made the need for mental health services more acute.<sup>1,2</sup> There are roughly 30,500 practicing psychiatrists in the United States, and 106,000 licensed psychologists, and perhaps a million mental health practitioners worldwide. That translates to roughly one psychologist per 3,000 persons in the United States, one psychiatrist per 11,000 persons in the United States, and one provider per 8000 persons globally.<sup>3,4</sup> That is obviously inadequate. Ramping up the training of professionals is not a sufficient solution. Even large percentage increases in the number of freshly minted providers still miss the mark by several orders of magnitude.","Youngstrom","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2022.03.006","20220327","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29207,""
"Using What We Know About Threat Reactivity Models to Understand Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by unprecedented levels of stress and threats in a variety of domains (e.g., health, livelihood). Individual differences in threat reactivity may explain why some individuals are at elevated risk for the development or maintenance of psychopathology during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article describes several prominent models, mechanisms, and components of threat reactivity (e.g., appraisals, intolerance of uncertainty, avoidance) and discusses how they might help improve understanding of changes in psychopathology during and following the COVID-19 pandemic.","Carter Funkhouser","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0156-75C-39A","20220329","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; threat; covid-19; anxiety; fear","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29208,""
"Life satisfaction and mental health from age 17 to 21 years in a general population sample","Background: Whilst evidence suggests associations between life satisfaction (LS) and mental health (MH), few studies have investigated the direction of effects in middle adolescence and emerging adulthood. In emerging adulthood, evidence indicates reciprocal associations and no gender differences, whereas in early and middle adolescence results are mixed and differ across gender. This is the first study to investigate this question in the crucial developmental transition from middle adolescence to emerging adulthood. Methods: Cross-lagged longitudinal analysis of data from a pooled sample of six pseudo-cohorts including information from 661 young people born in 1992 to 1998 who participated in the UK Household Longitudinal Study at ages 17, 19, and 21. LS was assessed using a 7-points overall LS scale, MH was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12, Likert scoring). Results: We found no associations between LS and MH in the 17-19 transition and bidirectional associations in the 19-21 transition. There were no substantial gender differences in either transition. Conclusions: LS and MH predict each other in the transition from late adolescence (age 19) to emerging adulthood (age 21) for both males and females.","Jose Marquez et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0228-1CE-FA7","20220329","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; young adults; direction of effects; gender; mental health; adolescence; life satisfaction; wellbeing","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","",29209,""
