"COVID-19 Lockdown: Housing Built Environmentâ€™s Effects on Mental Health","Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic on 11 March, severe lockdown measures have been adopted by the Italian Government  For over two months of stay-at-home orders, houses became the only place where people slept, ate, worked, practiced sports, and socialized  As consolidated evidence exists on housing as a determinant of health, it is of great interest to explore the impact that COVID-19 response-related lockdown measures have had on mental health and well-being  We conducted a large web-based survey on 8177 students from a university institute in Milan, Northern Italy, one of the regions most heavily hit by the pandemic in Europe  As emerged from our analysis, poor housing is associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms during lockdown  In particular, living in apartments &lt;60 m2 with poor views and scarce indoor quality is associated with, respectively, 1 31 (95% CI: 1046â€“1637), 1 368 (95% CI: 1166â€“1605), and 2 253 (95% CI: 1918â€“2647) times the risk of moderateâ€“severe and severe depressive symptoms  Subjects reporting worsened working performance from home were over four times more likely to also report depression (OR = 4 28, 95% CI: 3713â€“4924)  Housing design strategies should focus on larger and more livable living spaces facing green areas  We argue that a strengthened multi-interdisciplinary approach, involving urban planning, public mental health, environmental health, epidemiology, and sociology, is needed to investigate the effects of the built environment on mental health, so as to inform welfare and housing policies centered on population well-being","Amerio, Andrea; Brambilla, Andrea; Morganti, Alessandro; Aguglia, Andrea; Bianchi, Davide; Santi, Francesca; Costantini, Luigi; Odone, Anna; Costanza, Alessandra; Signorelli, Carlo; Serafini, Gianluca; Amore, Mario; Capolongo, Stefano","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17165973","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;17(16):5973-5973, 2020.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;17(16):5973-5973, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-21","",3996,""
"Migrant workers in China need emergency psychological interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak","The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been found in more than 200 countries worldwide since December, 2019  In China, a major reason for the rapid transmission of the COVID-19 in early stage of the outbreak is the huge numbers of passengers boarding their ""last train home"" to meet family members during the Spring Festival  Most of these travelers were internal migrant workers  In order to reduce the risk of the COVID-19 transmission, public transportation networks were suspended, and many migrant workers who returned to their hometowns needed to be quarantined for 2 weeks, which led to the delay of returning back to cities to work  Many businesses have temporarily closed because of the risk of COVID-19 transmission, leading to unemployment of many workers  Sudden loss of income and further quarantine enforcement in cities can exacerbate existing mental health problems or trigger new mental disorders among affected migrant workers  However, to date no specific guidelines or strategies about mental health services of migrant workers have been released  Health authorities and professionals should pay more attention to this vulnerable group and provide timely mental health service support for those in need","Liu, Zi-Han; Zhao, Yan-Jie; Feng, Yuan; Zhang, Qinge; Zhong, Bao-Liang; Cheung, Teris; Hall, Brian J.; Xiang, Yu-Tao","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00608-w","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Globalization and Health;16(1):75-75, 2020.; Publication details: Globalization and Health;16(1):75-75, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-21","",3997,""

"Telemental Health for Child Trauma Treatment during and post-COVID-19: Limitations and Considerations","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented disruptions and stress in the lives of children and families internationally  Heightened family stress and turmoil can increase risk for child maltreatment  As a result, child maltreatment experts are concerned that there will be an influx of children requiring trauma assessment and treatment during, and after COVID-19  As physical distancing measures have been implemented and will likely persist into 2021, organizations providing trauma treatment to children and their families have had to rapidly pivot to telemental health to maintain service delivery with clients  While the benefits of telemental health have been identified in the broader child mental health literature, including reduced barriers to access, increased cost effectiveness, and broad availability of services, there are unique limitations to its implementation within a child maltreatment population, such as challenges with attention and emotion regulation skills, difficulties identifying dissociative symptoms, and increased time with perpetrators of abuse due to shelter in place orders  These limitations are exacerbated for children and families who are most marginalized and facing the highest levels of social and economic barriers  Lack of access to reliable technology, lack of a private or confidential space for sessions, and reluctance to process trauma in the absence of a safe environment, are all barriers to conducting effective trauma treatment over telemental health  This article discusses both the benefits and barriers to telemental health in a child maltreatment population and offers considerations for child trauma service provision, program development, and policy during and post the COVID-19 pandemic","Racine, Nicole; Hartwick, Cailey; Collin-VÃ©zina, Delphine; Madigan, Sheri","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104698","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Child Abuse & Neglect;2020.; Publication details: Child Abuse & Neglect;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-21","",4003,""
"Personal Protective Equipment and Mental Health Symptoms Among Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic","OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between access to adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and mental health outcomes among a sample of U.S. nurses. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered in May 2020 to Michigan nurses via three statewide nursing organizations (nÃ¢<U+0080><U+008A>=Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>695 respondents). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with mental health symptoms. RESULTS: Nurses lacking access to adequate PPE (24.9%, nÃ¢<U+0080><U+008A>=Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>163) were more likely to report symptoms of depression (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.31, 2.94; pÃ¢<U+0080><U+008A>=Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>.001), anxiety (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.12, 2.40; pÃ¢<U+0080><U+008A>=Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>.01) and post-traumatic stress disorder (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.22, 2.74; pÃ¢<U+0080><U+008A>=Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>.003). CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare organizations should be aware of the magnitude of mental health problems among nurses and vigilant in providing them with adequate PPE as the pandemic continues.","Arnetz, Judith E; Goetz, Courtney M; Sudan, Sukhesh; Arble, Eamonn; Janisse, James; Arnetz, Bengt B","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000001999","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Occup Environ Med;2020 Aug 13.; Publication details: J Occup Environ Med;2020 Aug 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-21","",4004,""
"Psychiatric Aspects of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Treatment in the Wake of Coronavirus Disease-2019: Psychopharmacological Interactions and Neuropsychiatric Sequelae","BACKGROUND: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are among several experimental treatments being investigated in the urgent response to the coronavirus disease-2019. With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs' neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications. OBJECTIVE: Clarify evidence base regarding the psychiatric side effects and psychiatric drug interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. METHODS: A literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950 to 2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. RESULTS: First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels. Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents. Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of ""psychosis after chloroquine."" Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports. Weak evidence suggests a possible association of hydroxychloroquine exposure and increased suicidal ideation. It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications; however, overdose of these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for coronavirus disease-2019 treatment is not known. Best practice mayÂ include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for coronavirus disease-2019, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.","Hamm, Brandon S; Rosenthal, Lisa J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.022","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychosomatics;2020 Jul 08.; Publication details: Psychosomatics;2020 Jul 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-21","",4005,""
"Gender differences in the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on unpaid care work and psychological distress in the UK","School and nursery closures and homeworking during the Covid-19 crisis have resulted in an immediate increase in unpaid care work, particularly for parents. Amongst contemporary couples in the UK, women spent more time than men doing housework, childcare and caring for adults prior to the crisis; thus, lockdown draws new attention to gender inequality in divisions of unpaid care work. This study aims to answer how couples in the UK divided childcare and housework during lockdown and whether this is associated with changes in levels of psychological distress. Data for this study come from the April and May waves of Understanding Society Covid-19 study. Psychological distress was measured using the GHQ score (ranges from 0 to 36). Unpaid care work included men and womenâ€™s hours spent on childcare and housework and the impact of increased unpaid care work on employment schedules. We found that every week, women spent 5 more hours on housework and 10 more hours on childcare than men during lockdown, and this increased housework and childcare was associated with higher levels of psychological distress for women. One-third of parents adapted their work patterns because of childcare/ homeschooling. Men and women who adapted their work patterns had on average 1.16 and 1.39 higher GHQ scores than those who did not. This association was much stronger if he or she was the only member in the household who adapted their work patterns, or if she was a lone mother. Only 10% of fathers reduced work hours due to care work compared to 20% of mothers. Fathers had more psychological distress if they reduced work hours but she did not, compared to neither reducing work hours. Our research suggests that lockdown has hit people with young families and lone mothers particularly hard in terms of mental health, and continued gender inequality in divisions of unpaid care work during lockdown may be putting women at a greater risk of psychological distress.","Baowen Xue et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-6C7-E11","20200821","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; mental health; covid; lone mothers; domestic work; gender inequality; divisions of unpaid care","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-21","",4006,""
