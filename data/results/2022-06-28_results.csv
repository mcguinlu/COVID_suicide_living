"Patients with affective disorders profit most from telemedical treatment: Evidence from a naturalistic patient cohort during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic telemedicine became essential in maintaining diagnostic procedures and treatment in psychiatry. However, it is still an open question if telemedicine is a feasible treatment option for all groups of psychiatric patients alike. This prospective monocentric observational trial was conducted to assess the general applicability of telemedical treatment in a naturalistic psychiatric outpatient cohort and to identify groups of disorders and clusters of psychopathology that respond particularly well to telemedical treatment considering sociodemographic characteristics and patients' perspectives. Methods: Patients were recruited April 2020 - April 2021 and asked to fill out the WHO-5 and the SCL-90R at baseline, after 4-6 and 8-12 weeks and a feedback-survey. Additionally, medical records, psychopathology, psychosocial functioning and sociodemographic data were analyzed. Primary outcomes were well-being, psychopathology and functioning during treatment. Secondly, diagnostic groups and psychopathology linked to a superior treatment-response were determined with respect to patients' subjective experiences. Results: Out of 1.385 patients, 254 - mostly with hyperkinetic (35.3%) and depressive disorders (24.6%) - took part. Well-being and SCL-90R total scores improved substantially (both p<0.001). CGI and GAF scores were worse in depressed subjects (both p<0.05). Improvement was mainly seen in depressed patients; chronic disorders experienced a decline in well-being. Sociodemographic characteristics could not explain this difference. Particularly female (r=0.413) patients found telepsychiatry equivalent to conventional treatment. The more virtual sessions participants attended the more likely they were to find telepsychiatry equal to conventional treatment (r=0.231). Conclusions: Telemedicine is an effective treatment for patients with depression under naturalistic conditions. Telemedical consultations are a simple and reliable way of monitoring symptom severity and directing treatment choices during the treatment of depressive disorders. Patients with depression benefited more from telemedical treatment compared to participants with chronic non episodic psychiatric disorders. Future research needs to concentrate on improving telemedical treatment options suited for the latter conditions. Psychiatric telemedicine yielded overall high degrees of satisfaction among users.","Tobias Rohrmann; Peter Praus; Tanja Proctor; Anastasia Benedyk; Heike Tost; Oliver Hennig; Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg; Anna-Sophia Wahl","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.06.23.22276832","20220627","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33385,""

"SELF-PERCEPTION OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IN TEACHERS OF THE SUCRE HIGHER TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE","Introduction: University teaching exposes considerably to occupational stress. Objective: We determined the self-perception of health in teachers of a Higher Technological Institute of Quito, Ecuador, during COVID-19. Material and Methods: This was a mixed, non-experimental, crosssectional, descriptive study carried out with 106 teachers. The Goldberg GHQ-30 questionnaire was applied, associating variables with Chi-square, Crammerâ€™s V and odds ratios. Results: 23.6% of teachers presented psychosomatic symptoms evidencing lack of energy, perception of illness, headaches and generalized fatigue. Gender and career had significant relationships with mental health disturbances. Three careers confirmed significant relationships with psychosomatic symptoms. Conclusions: Greater mental health impairment was demonstrated in psychosomatic symptomatology. The problems in anxiety and insomnia were rooted in the threat of losing their job and the impossibility of supporting their family in COVID-19.","NoroÃ±a Salcedo, D. R.; FalcÃ³n, V.

"DAY-TO-DAY IMPACT of COVID-19 ASSOCIATED with RISK of OVERDOSE: 3PNO COHORT FINDINGS","Background: People who use unregulated drugs (PWUD) in Canada and the United States (US) are contending with the intersection of two simultaneous health crises: the COVID-19 pandemic and the longstanding drug poisoning crisis. However, the possible contributions of COVID-related factors to increases in overdoses during the pandemic are not well understood. Our study objectives were to assess the prevalence of non-fatal overdose and identify factors associated with overdose among participants in nine prospective cohorts of PWUD in urban centers in Canada (Vancouver, BC) and the US (Baltimore, MD;Miami, FL;Chicago, IL;Los Angeles, CA) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We further sought to examine the prevalence of and identify factors associated with reporting being highly impacted day-to-day by COVID-19. Methods: Data were derived from the nine cohorts in the NIDA-funded C3PNO consortium between May, 2020 and April, 2021. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with nonfatal overdose and day-to-day impact among participants who had used unregulated drugs in the past month. Results: Among 885 participants, 253 (28.6%) were female and 41 (4.6%) had reported experiencing a non-fatal overdose. Most of the sample reported being worried and approximately half reported being highly impacted day-to-day by the pandemic. In multivariable analyses, individuals who had experienced an overdose were more likely to be female (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]=2.18;95% Confidence Interval [CI]:1.10-4.30);unstably housed/homeless (AOR = 2.16;95% CI: 1.11-4.26);engaged in medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) (AOR = 2.45;95% CI: 1.19-4.97);and highly impacted day-to-day by COVID-19 (AOR = 2.42;95% CI: 1.22-5.10). In a second multivariable model, highly-impacted individuals were more likely to report higher levels of COVID-related worry (AOR = 1.30;95% CI: 1.23-1.37) and stocking up on drugs (AOR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.09-2.32) due to the pandemic. Conclusion: Our findings indicate a need for a multi-level approach involving the spectrum of care services to meet the elevated risks of overdose in the context of the dual crises, particularly among women, those unstably housed/homeless and those who reported being highly impacted day-to-day by the pandemic. Efforts to prevent overdose, however, should prioritize addressing the root causes of the drug poisoning crisis, such as the continuous exposure to toxic and contaminated unregulated drug supplies among PWUD.","Moallef, S.; Genberg, B.

"CSF and BLOOD ANALYSES in PARTICIPANTS with POST-COVID-19 NEUROPSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS","Background: The pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric symptoms persisting months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is poorly understood. We examined clinical and laboratory parameters in participants with post-acute COVID-19 neuropsychiatric symptom to assess for systemic and nervous system immune perturbations. Methods: Participants with a history of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and ongoing neurologic symptoms were enrolled in an observational study that collected medical history;detailed post-COVID symptom survey;and paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. In addition to standard clinical labs, neopterin and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (anti-spike, RBD, and nucleocapsid) were measured by ELISA. Non-parametric tests were used to compare CSF and blood findings between the post-COVID participants and pre-COVID-19 era healthy controls. Results: Post-COVID participants (n=27) and controls (n=21) were similar in age (median 51 and 46 years), but there was a greater proportion of females (67% vs 24%;p=0.004) and white participants in the post-COVID cohort (63% vs 24%;p=0.04). The post-COVID study visit was a median of 264 days (IQR 59-332) after acute COVID-19 symptom onset. 35% were hospitalized during their acute illness;12% required intensive care. 33% had previously been treated with medications for mental health conditions. The most frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms were cognitive impairment (67%), mood symptoms (67%), headache (56%), and neuropathy (41%). Blood c-reactive protein, T cell count, and T cell subset frequency (CD4% and CD8%) were similar between groups, while D-dimer was higher in the post-COVID cohort (median 0.48 vs 0.27 mg/L;p = 0.019) (Figure). CSF WBC, protein, neopterin, and CSF/blood albumin ratio were similar between the groups;the frequency of CSF lymphocytes was lower in the post-COVID cohort (p = 0.05) (Figure 1). Antibodies against at least one SARS-CoV-2 antigen were detected in 7/10 CSF and 8/9 blood samples in the post-COVID CSF (antibody reactivity range 1.5 to 55-fold greater than to control antigens). Conclusion: In this small cohort of post-COVID participants with neurologic symptoms, we found limited differences in CSF and blood markers when compared to pre-pandemic healthy controls. Deeper immunophenotyping in a larger number of participants may provide greater insight into subtle differences. The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in CSF months after acute infection warrants further investigation.","McAlpine, L.

"POST-COVID19 QUALITY of LIFE: LOW SATISFACTION with PHYSICAL and MENTAL HEALTH STATUS","Background: After the acute phase of infection, new, recurring or ongoing symptoms related to COVID19 may persist for weeks or months. Aims of our study were to size the impact of these symptoms on physical (PH) and mental (MH) health status and quality of life (QoL), reported by patients (pts), and to investigate factors influencing the perception of PH, MH, and QoL. Methods: We included pts referred to the post-COVID19 outpatient service, with and without prior hospitalization (PHosp), evaluated at 3,6 and 12 months after the acute infection. Demographic, clinical and pharmacological data were collected in an electronic system. At each visit, the Short-Form 36-item questionnaire (SF-36), assessing the perception of PH and MH, and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), ranging from 0 to 100, of the EQ5D, assessing QoL, were administered. Student's T-test was employed for comparisons and linear regression was used to identify factors associated with PH, MH, and QoL. In a subgroup of patients, we assessed the presence of anxiety and depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances through the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI II) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaires, respectively. Results: Out of a total of 914 assessments, we considered the first one of each pt (n=572): median (IQR) age of 55 years (47-62), 53% male, 38% with at least 1 comorbidity, 54% with PHosp, median distance from acute infection of 4.8 months (3.6-7.1). The mean of each subscale assessed in SF-36 was significantly lower than the normative values of the Italian population (Figure 1) and it remained stable over time. Female gender, the presence of comorbidities, and the use of corticosteroids during the acute infection were associated with a worse perception of PH, MH, and QoL;pts with PHosp reported a better MH overall (Figure 2). Alterations in BAI, BDI II, and PSQI were associated with worse perceptions of PH, MH, and HRQoL, in the subgroup of 265 patients in whom they were evaluated. Conclusion: In our study, post-COVID19 pts reported a significantly worse perception of PH and MH status compared to the Italian normative group, and a higher risk was demonstrated for female pts, pts with comorbidities and pts treated with corticosteroids. Moreover, the presence of anxious-depressive symptoms and poor sleep quality was correlated to a worse perception of health status and QoL. A systematic monitoring of these aspects is mandatory to properly manage pts in the post-COVID19 period.","Mastrorosa, I.; Pinnetti, C.; Duca, G. D.; Lorenzini, P.; Vergori, A.; Camici, M.; Brita, A.

"COVID-19 and the HIV CARE CONTINUUM in C3PNO COHORTS","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the normal delivery of HIV care, altered social support networks, and caused economic insecurity. People with HIV (PWH) are vulnerable to such disruptions, particularly if they have a history of substance use. We describe engagement in care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for PWH during the pandemic. Methods: From May 2020 to February 2021, 773 PWH enrolled in 6 existing cohorts completed 1495 surveys about substance use and engagement in HIV care during the COVID-19 pandemic. We described the prevalence and correlates of having missed a visit with an HIV provider in the past month and having missed a dose of ART in the past week. Results: Thirteen percent of people missed an HIV visit in the past month. Missing a visit was associated with unstable housing, food insecurity, anxiety, low resiliency, disruptions to mental health care, and substance use including cigarette smoking, hazardous alcohol use, cocaine, and cannabis use. Nineteen percent of people reported missing at least one dose of ART in the week prior to their survey. Missing a dose of ART was associated with being a man, low resiliency, disruptions to mental health care, cigarette smoking, hazardous alcohol use, cocaine, and cannabis use, and experiencing disruptions to substance use treatment. Conclusion: Social determinants of health, substance use, and disruptions to mental health and substance use treatment were associated with poorer engagement in HIV care. Close attention to continuity of care during times of social disruption is especially critical for PWH.","Lesko, C. R.; Keruly, J. C.; Moore, R.; Shen, N.; Pytell, J. D.; Lau, B.; Fojo, A.

"PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC AMONG WOMEN UNDERGOING INFERTILITY CARE, A FRENCH COHORT - PSYCOVART","OBJECTIVE: To assess psychological state of women who experienced postponement of ART care during the first COVID-19 wave in a French public ward of reproductive medicine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online anonymous survey was emailed between July and August 2020 to all women whose infertility care have been delayed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety, depression, and stress were assessed using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Feelings about COVID- 19 outbreak, lockdown and suspension of fertility care were assessed by Multiple- Choice Questions and Visual Analog Scales. RESULTS: 435 women answered to the survey (response rate 34,6%). Mean levels of the HADS-A (anxiety), HADS-D (depression) and PSS10 were respectively 7,58(Â±3,85), 4,51(Â±3,48), and 27(Â±6,75). Prevalence of stress was 50,8% and almost half of women presented clear or suggestive anxiety symptoms (respectively 21,6% and 25,7%). Stress and anxiety rates were much higher than those expected in infertile population. Increased stress was observed in women above 35 years and those stopped 'in cycle' or during pre-treatment for in-vitro fertilization or frozen embryo transfer. Patient with history of depression or anxiety had a higher prevalence of perceived stress (p= 0,0006). Postponement was perceived as 'unbearable' for women experiencing stress (p=0,0032). After the first wave of pandemic, pregnancy desire remained the same and 84,3% of women wanted to resume fertility care as soon as possible. CONCLUSIONS: Stopping fertility care during the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant psychological impact on women with an increase of stress, and anxiety. Psychological counseling should always be offered especially during this difficult period.

"ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN COVID-19 PANDEMIC CONDITIONS AND MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH AND MATERNAL-INFANT BONDING","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between the psychosocial effects of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and maternal mental health and maternal-fetal bonding in a sample of pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an online, observational, surveybased study.Women were recruited from the outpatient Obstetrics and Gynecology and Psychiatry clinics of a hospital in the Midwest and via community online advertisements. Women aged 18 to 45 years old and currently pregnant in their second or third trimester were eligible to participate. Data was collected between June 2020 and April 2021.Women completed the surveys online at a location of their choosing using the institution's REDCap survey software. Descriptive and frequency statistics assessed characteristics of the study sample and Pearson's r correlation statistics were conducted to examine the associations between psychosocial stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic and maternal depression and anxiety and maternal-fetal bonding using validated instruments. Thematic assessment of qualitative, shortanswer responses assessing participants' perspectives of the positive and negative impacts of the pandemic on their maternal-fetal bonding was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 30 women completed the survey at the time of this analysis. The mean age was 32.07 (SD = 0.67) years and the majority of women (n = 26, 86%) were Caucasian. Three women (10%) reported receiving assisted reproductive technology for their current pregnancy. Greater psychosocial stress due to the pandemic conditions, assessed by the COVID-19 Family Stress Screener, was associated with higher depression scores assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (r = .50, p &lt; .05) and higher anxiety scores assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder- 7 Item Scale (r =.48, p &lt; .05). There was a marginally significant association indicating greater psychosocial stress due to pandemic conditions was associated with more positive maternal-infant bonding assessed by the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale (r = .37, p = .05 ). Themes derived from qualitative items indicated that women identified more time spent at home due to furlough or working from home and fewer social obligations due to physical distancing allowed them to have more time and energy to focus on maternal-fetal bonding. Themes also indicated that fear of contracting COVID-19 and greater demands for caring for current children were negative effects of the pandemic that may contribute to higher anxiety and barriers to bonding. CONCLUSIONS: Greater psychosocial stress during COVID-19 pandemic conditions is related to higher levels of maternal depression and anxiety in pregnancy. However, some psychosocial effects (e.g., more time spent at home and with immediate family) may also contribute to greater opportunities for women to focus on maternal-fetal bonding. IMPACT STATEMENT: Assessment of levels of psychosocial stress due to pandemic conditions by reproductive medicine health care providers may allow for the identification of women at greater risk for maternal depression and anxiety.","Kelley, E.

"PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IN WOMEN CONSIDERING OR UNDERGOING FERTILITY TREATMENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and any associations with vaccination beliefs in women considering or undergoing fertility treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IRB approval was obtained. Crosssectional anonymous surveys of patients were collected from a single academic fertility center. Assessment of trust in the medical system was conducted via the Medical Mistrust Index (MMI) and mental health was evaluated via the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-8) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Attitudes regarding COVID vaccination was collected. Descriptive data and chi-square analysis with pairwise Bonferroni adjusted Z-tests and ANOVA was used to examine the MMI, GAD-7, and PHQ-8. RESULTS: To date, a total of 1130/3595 surveys have been received, response rate = 31.4%. The participants were 35.82 years old (SD=4.102), married (89.2%), nulliparous (69.3%), White (77.8%) Asian (9.3%), Hispanic (4.4%) Black (4.4%), 28.1% reported &gt; 1 year of infertility and 31.5% &gt; 2 years of infertility. 50.3% were currently receiving or had received psychotherapy in the past, 36.2% reported a history of medication use for mood, depression or anxiety. Among the participants, 23.1% reported initiating psychotherapy and/or medical treatment for mood, depression and/or anxiety after March 2020. Mild (32.9%), moderate (49.4%), moderately severe (14.1%) and severe (3.6%) symptoms of depression were reported on the PHQ-8. Similar levels of distress were seen on the GAD-7 scale, with mild (47.0%), moderate (39.1%) and severe (13.9%) anxiety symptoms reported. Both the PHQ-8 and GAD-7 indicate that participants have been in distress since the beginning of the pandemic. Participants with the highest MMI scores had higher GAD-7 scores (p=0.01), reported more concerns about vaccine side effects on fertility and/or ability to get pregnant and believed that the vaccine can cause abnormalities in a fetus or one's body (p&lt;0.05). GAD-7 and PHQ-8 scores were not associated with vaccine hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant levels of anxiety and depression were found in the majority of participants. Although many participants reported receiving psychological treatment prior to the pandemic, almost a quarter of women reported initiation of mental health treatments after the onset of the pandemic. Although psychological distress was not related to vaccine hesitancy, those with higher levels of anxiety reported greater mistrust in the medical system. IMPACT STATEMENT: There are high rates of anxiety and depression amongst women currently considering or undergoing fertility treatments with almost 25% of participants initiating mental health treatment after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher mistrust in the healthcare system was associated with increased anxiety symptoms. This suggests an even greater current need to offer psychological support to this group of patients.","Kassi, L. A.; Lawson, A. K.; Feinberg, E. C.; Swanson, A.; Pavone, M.

"HIV PREVENTION in VULNERABLE POPULATIONS: GENERATING EVIDENCE to REDUCE INEQUALITIES","The HIV epidemic in Latin America remains concentrated in large urban centers, with vulnerable populations suffering the highest burden, particularly MSM and transgender women. In the last 10 years, the number of new HIV infections remained high and stable, and although ART coverage led to a significant decrease in AIDS-related mortality, the decrease was lower in Latin America when compared to the other regions. Brazil accounts for more than one-third of the HIV burden of the region. It was the first low-/middle-income country to provide access to universal treatment to individuals living with HIV. Brazil's actions towards the AIDS crisis assumed a human rights-based approach, integrating both prevention and treatment efforts into its universal health care system. Brazil's civil society organizations play a crucial role in shaping the initial and ongoing response. Since 2014, a ""Treat All"" policy of providing antiretroviral treatment in addition to comprehensive services including HIV testing and laboratory monitoring, and pre-exposure prophylaxis has been in place. The impact of the policies on people living with HIV resulted in an improved quality of life and a decline in overall morbidity and mortality. Nonetheless, important challenges remain, including a high and stable HIV incidence among key populations, and a high prevalence of late treatment initiation and of early mortality from AIDS causes, impacting the multiple steps of the continuum of care. This presentation will (a) present recent epidemiologic data on the HIV epidemic in Latin America, (b) describe and detail the characteristics of the Brazilian response to the HIV epidemic and the current status of the epidemic in Brazil, and (c) share Brazil's contribution to cutting edge AIDS research and its impact on public health policies. The latter will focus on how the data emanating from research efforts have contributed to major innovations for the HIV prevention and care agenda. Areas highlighted include pMTCT, tuberculosis, ART strategies for treatment and prevention including pre-exposure prophylaxis, and vulnerable populations, particularly young MSM and transgender women, HPV, reproductive health, and COVID-19. These research advances were only made possible through close engagement with the community. It is through this strong community engagement that we aim to reduce stigma and discrimination while promoting human rights.","Grinsztejn, B.","https://www.google.com/search?q=HIV+PREVENTION+in+VULNERABLE+POPULATIONS:+GENERATING+EVIDENCE+to+REDUCE+INEQUALITIES","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Topics in Antiviral Medicine; 30(1 SUPPL):3-4, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33399,""
"THE ONGOING IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON STRESSORS DURING FERTILITY TREATMENT","OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine how various stressors related to COVID-19 impacted the patient experience during fertility treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed to patients at a private fertility clinic via the patient portal. Survey questions investigated patient demographics and feelings of anxiety regarding COVID-19 related stressors. Baseline levels of anxiety were measured by GAD-7, a 7-question generalized anxiety disorder scale. Patient confidence in their fertility treatment and potential changes to their treatment plan due to COVID-19 were assessed. Responses ranged from â€œnot at allâ€ to â€œall of the timeâ€. Survey responses were analyzed at two different points, on Feb 5th with 290 participants and April 11th with 647 to determine average response and response frequencies. RESULTS: Of the initial 290 participants, 89% were women with an average age of 33.8. 58.9% reported pursuing fertility treatment for at least a year. The average GAD-7 Anxiety Severity Score for this cohort was 5.79, indicating an overall feeling of mild anxiety among respondents. 59% of respondents reported COVID-19 health concerns as one of their causes of stress, but only 29% reported considering or ultimately delaying treatment due to the pandemic. The data was again analyzed with 647 participants, of whom 80% were women with an average age of 34.5. 47.8% reported pursuing fertility treatment for at least a year. The average GAD-7 Anxiety Severity Score was 5.01 for this cohort, indicating a reduced overall feeling of mild anxiety. 52% of respondents reported COVID-19 health concerns as one of their causes of stress, but only 17% reported considering or deciding to delay treatment due to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals struggling to conceive often report feelings of depression and anxiety. Over the past year, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to cause increased stress, anxiety, and feelings of depression across almost all populations. For those already experiencing heightened levels of stress and anxiety prior to the pandemic, the effect of increased stress and worry may have detrimental effects on health outcomes. While the cause-and-effect relationship between stress and infertility is still unclear, it is important to consider how the COVID-19 pandemic leads to increased distress among infertility patients and how this may impact perceived treatment outcomes. In comparing results between data collection on Feb. 5th and April 11th, it appears that patients may be experiencing a reduction in stress regarding COVID-19. As the pandemic continues to evolve in terms of vaccine, treatment, and spread mitigation plans, patients continue to be resilient in adapting to COVID-19. Being aware of the increased levels of stress and anxiety experienced by patients during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis can help healthcare providers alleviate some of these worries. IMPACT STATEMENT: Various stressors, particularly during COVID-19 may impact a patient's experience in their fertility treatment, allowing healthcare providers an opportunity to help mitigate these during care.","Dynia, S.; Amir, J.; Peschansky, C.; Usmani, S.; Grimm, L.; Lynn, R.; Patel, S.; Vitale, K.; Arabi, A.; Beltsos, A.; Jeelani, R.; Louden, E.","https://www.google.com/search?q=THE+ONGOING+IMPACT+OF+COVID-19+ON+STRESSORS+DURING+FERTILITY+TREATMENT","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Fertility and Sterility; 116(3 SUPPL):e300, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33400,""
"THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON WOMEN PREGNANT FOLLOWING ART: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY","OBJECTIVE: Longitudinal evaluation of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women following assisted reproductive technology (ART) and to compare them to women seeking infertility treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective longitudinal cohort study from April to June 2020. Respondents who completed an initial anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire in April were sent two further questionnaires during May and June 2020. RESULTS: A total of 821, 619 and 456 women pregnant following ART completed a first survey in April and subsequent surveys in May and June, respectively. A further 2684, 1965 and 1463 women seeking infertility treatment completed the surveys in the same sequence. During the first surge of the pandemic in New England, United States, 30% of pregnant and 34% of non-pregnant women reported a pre-existing diagnosis of anxiety (p=0.02) with 6% of pregnant and 11% of non-pregnant women taking anxiolytic medication (p&lt;0.001). Pregnant respondents reported higher levels of anxiety (p=0.02) but lower levels of sadness (p=0.001) than non-pregnant patients, and more non-pregnant women were taking antidepressant medication (p=0.001).More pregnant patients cited COVID-19 as their most significant stressor in surveys 1 (52%) and 2 (39%) than nonpregnant patients still seeking infertility treatment in surveys 1 (37%) and 2 (25%;both p&lt;0.001). Further, at survey 2, pregnant patients reported feeling significantly less sad (p&lt;0.001) but the anxiety levels did not differ between groups (p=0.5). On survey 3, pregnant patients reported significantly less anxiety (p=0.02) and sadness (p&lt;0.001);levels of loneliness did not differ. Pregnant patients reported that their job was their top stressor while infertility patients rated infertility as the most stressful aspect of their lives (p&lt;0.001). Pregnant participants were more concerned about becoming infected with Covid-19 during pregnancy than non-pregnant participants (p&lt;0.001) and about a poor pregnancy outcome due to Covid-19 infection (p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a significant psychological impact on women pregnant following ART and, over the first few months of the pandemic, it remained their top stressor. However, women still experiencing infertility ranked infertility as a greater stressor than the pandemic. This may have been because infertility patients were unable to receive treatment during the study period. IMPACT STATEMENT: The pandemic had a serious impact on the psychological health of infertility patients but patients pregnant after ART continued to express a heightened level of stress specifically because of the pandemic. Given how challenging it was for them to achieve their pregnancy, tailoring specific stress reduction strategies for women pregnant after ART should be considered now and for future global challenges.","Domar, A.

"QUINOLINIC ACID IS A BIOMARKER of COVID-19-ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT","Background: COVID-19 infection-associated cognitive and olfaction impairments have an unclear pathogenesis, possibly related to systemic disease severity, hypoxia, or illness-associated anxiety and depression. A biomarker for these neurocognitive changes is lacking. The kynurenine pathway (KP) is an interferon stimulated myeloid cell mediated tryptophan degradation pathway important in immune tolerance, neurotoxicity and vascular injury, that is dysregulated in COVID-19. We hypothesized that neurocognitive impairments were associated with an activated KP. Methods: The current analysis includes COVID-19 patients as part of the ADAPT study, a prospective cohort (St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Australia). Disease severity was assessed with 18 acute symptoms and hospitalization status. Blood samples were taken 2 months (N=136) and 4 months (N=121) post diagnosis along with cognitive (Cogstate Computerized Battery, CBB;NIH toolbox Odor Identification Test, OIT) and mental health screenings (DMI-10;IESR, SPHERE-34 Psychological subscale grouped into a composite score). KP metabolites (PIC, QUIN, 3HK, 3HAA, AA, KYN, TRP, log for analyses except for TRP) were measured by GC-MS and uHPLC. The CBB and OIT data were demographically-corrected. CBB follow-up data was also corrected for practice effect. Linear mixed effect regression models with time effect (days post diagnosis) tested whether cognition, and olfaction were associated the KP (main and time interaction);while correcting for disease severity, mental health and comorbidities. Results: 136 patients: mean age=46Â±15;40% females;90% English speaking background;disease severity: 40% mild, 50% moderate, 10% severe/hospitalised;34% treated comorbidities. At 2 months post diagnosis, 16% had cognitive impairment, and 25% had impaired olfaction. Cognitive impairment was more common in those with anosmia (p=.05). At 4 months, 23% had cognition impairment and 20% had impaired olfaction. QUIN (p=.001), 3HAA (p&lt;.0001) increased over the study period, while TRP decreased (p=.02). QUIN level associated with poorer cognitive scores (p=.0007;QUIN (nM) between 800-1000 was most predictive). There was no time*QUIN interaction. QUIN association to cognition persisted when severe cases were excluded (p&lt;.005). Conclusion: COVID-19 is associated with KP activation, and the latter with cognitive impairment. QUIN was the only biomarker associated with cognitive impairment, and may be useful in monitoring and elucidating COVID-19 neuropathogenesis and treatment.","Cysique, L.

"PERSISTENT COVID-19 SYMPTOMS ARE HIGHLY PREVALENT 12 MONTHS after HOSPITALIZATION","Background: Persistent COVID-19 symptoms have been reported up to six months (M6) after hospital discharge. Little is known on the frequency and the nature of persistent symptoms beyond M6. Here we assessed, in the longitudinal prospective French COVID-19 cohort, symptoms that persisted twelve months after admission for COVID-19. Methods: Hospitalized patients with a virologically-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Follow-up was planned with a physician's visit at M3, M6 and M12 post-admission. At M12, manual assessment of muscle strength of each limb was assessed using the modified Medical Muscle Research council Scale for testing muscle strength (mMRC). Patients were also interviewed on health-related quality-of-life (SF-12) and on psychological distress (HADS). Associations between persistence of = 3 symptoms at M12 and clinical characteristics at admission were assessed through bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: By September 2021, M12 data were available for 737 patients enrolled between February 3rd and July 15th 2020. Median age was 61 years, 64% were men and 37% were admitted to intensive care unit during the acute phase. At M12 visit, 27% of participants had = 3 symptoms, with no change between M6 and M12 globally. Fatigue (46%), dyspnea (33%) and joint pain (21%) were the 3 most frequently reported symptoms. Presence of = 3 symptoms was associated with both anxiety and depression, an impaired quality of life and mMRC scale &lt; 57. The mean percentage of predicted value of distance walked in 6 min (6MWT) was 88% (IQR 74-100) for the 163 patients who realised the 6MWT, this percentage was lower in patients who reported dyspnea (85% [IQR 71;99] vs 95% [IQR 76;101], p=0.04). Compared to men, women more often reported presence of = 3 symptoms (39% vs 21%), depression and anxiety (respectively, 12% vs 6% and 21% vs 10%), an altered quality of life for the physical component only (54% vs 46%), and a slight or a moderate disability (respectively, 20% vs 14% and 6% vs 4%). Women had less often returned to work than men (34% vs 23%). Conclusion: A fourth of individuals admitted to hospital for COVID-19 still had =3 persistent symptoms at M12 post-discharge, with no improvement between M6 and M12. Also, 25% of those who initially had a professional occupation were not back to work at M12. Women reported more often =3 symptoms, suffered more from anxiety and depression, and had less often returned to work than men.","Chirouze, C.; Bachelet, D.; Hulot, J.

"MENSTRUATION IRREGULARITIES among REPRODUCTIVE-AGE WOMEN during the COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Background: Women have reported increased menstrual irregularities during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unknown if this is due to biological (i.e., the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination) and/or psychosocial factors. This study examined menstrual irregularities during the COVID-19 pandemic and the association of abnormal menses with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, stress, and mental health among reproductive age women. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 182 HIV-negative, sexually active, 18-to 45-year-old cisgender women was conducted on biobehavioral factors influencing HIV risk. From January 2019 to September 2021, participants completed a survey of menstrual irregularities over the previous three months, previous month condomless vaginal intercourse, and plans to conceive. Starting October 2020, SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were measured using an FDA EUA rapid test assay using whole blood, and participants completed the Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the Loneliness Brief Form, the Perceived Stress Scale. History of COVID-19 vaccination was self-reported. Menstrual irregularities were compared by recruitment date (pre-pandemic vs. during pandemic/after April 2020) and by IgG antibody status. Logistic regression models tested if the presence of antibodies was associated with menstrual irregularities when controlling for age (in all models) and stress, depression, and loneliness in separate models. Results: Key variables are illustrated in Table 1. Menstrual irregularities did not differ by enrollment date. About half of women (n=36) had detectable IgG;5 had been vaccinated. Controlling for age, women with detectable IgG had 7.3, 95% CI [1.5, 36.5], times the odds of menstrual irregularities. Neither age, stress, nor mental health were associated with irregular menstruation. Among unvaccinated women (n=31), 35% with IgG antibodies had irregular menstruation compared to 0% without IgG antibodies. Among women with no plans to conceive, 74% had condomless intercourse, of whom 11% had irregular menstruation. Conclusion: Findings suggest a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and irregular menstruation that was not accounted for by stress or mental health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, increased condom use and routine pregnancy testing may be merited among women not intending to conceive.","Cherenack, E. M.; Salazar, A.

During P, treating patients with chronic disease burden, i.e., cancer (O), with O drugs and achieving high medication adherence was reported to be challenging, e.g., delayed/missed provider visits, prescriptions, lab tests, and P-related financial difficulties and feelings of depression or anxiety. OBJECTIVE: There are two objectives that characterize how the P may be associated with changes in: 1. adherence to specialty pharmacy O medications (O-SP-D) and 2. O patient- reported quality of life (QoL). METHODS: A retrospective, observational, pre-/post- design study of 393 USA O patients' adherence to O-SP-D and their reported QoL was conducted Pre-P (1/1-12/31/2019) and Post-P (3/1-8/31/2020). Patient assessments (PA), including medication therapy management (SPMTM) and the EQ-5D-5L QoL instrument, occurred at start-of-care (SOC) and 7-10 days before refills (F-U). Descriptive statics were used to calculate Pre-P Dimensional means before and after starting O-SP-D with SPMTM and again at F-U Post-P. The means of QoL measures in the Pre-P and Post-P periods were compared for differences, representing improved or diminished QoL associated with P. The mean medication possession ratio (MPR or adherence) was calculated, using the F-U from Pre-P and Post-P. RESULTS: MPR was 0.976 Pre-P and 0.98 during Post-P (0.4% improvement). Differences between QoL means Pre-P vs Post-P were: Mobility -0.31 (31%), Self-Care 0 (no change), Usual Activities -0.02 (2%), Pain/Discomfort -0.09 (9%), Anxiety/Depression -0.3 (30%), Overall Health State +2.37 (2.4%).

"MENTAL HEALTH & ALCOHOL USE in PEOPLE with & WITHOUT HIV before & during COVID-19","Background: Increases in the prevalence of mental health symptoms during global pandemics have been observed. We hypothesized that people with HIV (PWH) and without HIV (HIV-) would experience an increase in mental health symptoms and alcohol use after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and that PWH would experience a greater increase than HIV-individuals. Methods: Participants were recruited from two established cohorts of PWH and HIV-adults in Omaha, Nebraska for whom baseline data including mental health and alcohol use assessments had been collected prior to the pandemic. Participants were excluded from the original cohorts if they had any known psychiatric diagnosis or were taking antipsychotics or anticonvulsants. Participants were reassessed utilizing the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Alcohol Use Identification Test (AUDIT), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) between February and April 2021. All outcomes were evaluated using generalized linear mixed models. Results: Of the 95 participants who completed all questionnaires, 50 were PWH and 45 HIV-. Groups did not statistically differ in age, sex, race or ethnicity (mean: 45.67 years;69.5% male;74% non-Hispanic white). Pre-pandemic mean BDI-II, BAI, AUDIT and PSQI scores were higher in PWH versus HIV-. After the onset of the pandemic, mean BDI-II and AUDIT scores increased significantly in both groups (see Table;P&lt;.001 and P=0.003, respectively) and AUDIT scores were significantly higher in males than females (P=.002). Measures of binge drinking and alcohol misuse as well as mean BAI and PSQI scores increased numerically intra-pandemic. Intra-pandemic mean BDI-II and AUDIT scores increased more among HIV-than PWH, but not significantly so. The percentage of PWH and HIV-participants who moved into a more severe category of depression as measured by the BDI-II (eg, from minimal to moderate) after the onset of the pandemic was identical (18%). Conclusion: Measures of depression and alcohol use increased significantly after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in people with and without HIV. Although there were no significant differences in the changes between the groups, PWH had higher baseline scores so the increases in this group may have more clinical impacts. Screening for symptoms of mental health and alcohol use is critical, especially in PWH during a pandemic. Future work will explore the longer-term impact of the pandemic on mental health symptoms and alcohol use.","Bares, S.; May, P.; Sayles, H.; Furl, R.; Wilson, T.","https://www.google.com/search?q=MENTAL+HEALTH+&+ALCOHOL+USE+in+PEOPLE+with+&+WITHOUT+HIV+before+&+during+COVID-19","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Topics in Antiviral Medicine; 30(1 SUPPL):248-249, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33408,""

"Psychological distress and behavioral changes in pregnant and postpartum individuals during the Covid-19 pandemic","To determine the psychological and behavioural effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on a Canadian cohort of individuals during pregnancy and the postpartum period. In 2020, individuals between 20 weeks gestation and 3 months postpartum receiving maternity care from an urban Canadian clinic were invited to complete a questionnaire. The purpose-built questionnaire used validated scales including the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and questions from a SARS study. One hundred nine people completed the questionnaire (response rate, 55%) of whom 57% (n = 62) were postpartum. Most respondents (107, 98%) were married and had completed post-secondary education (104, 95%). Despite these protective factors, moderate to severe levels of depression (22%), anxiety (19%) and stress (27%), were recorded using the DASS-21, and 25% of participants (26) had depression (score Ã¢â€°Â¥11) using the EPDS. Despite high social support in all MOS domains (median scores 84-100), a majority of participants reported loneliness (69, 67%) and were nearly or totally housebound (65, 64%). About half of participants worried about themselves (50, 46.3%) or their baby (59, 54%) contracting COVID-19, while the majority postponed (80, 74.1%) and cancelled (79, 73.2%) prenatal appointments. Being homebound or feeling lonely / lacking support were significant risk factors for psychological distress (P = 0.02) whereas exercise and strong social support were protective (P &lt; 0.05). Pregnant and postpartum individuals experienced moderate to severe depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Exercise and strong social support were protective. Health care provider enquiry of home circumstances and activity may identify individuals needing enhanced supports.","Kolker, Biringer, Bytautas, Kukan, Carroll","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2022.06.008","20220627","Anxiety; Covid-19; Depression; Pregnancy; Social Support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33410,""
"Prenatal stress from the COVID-19 pandemic predicts maternal postpartum anxiety as moderated by psychological factors: The Australian BITTOC Study","While there have been reports of increased perinatal anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic (Stepowicz et al., 2020), there has been a lack of research on the relative importance of objective hardship and subjective distress. In this study, we explored the extent to which resilience, tolerance of uncertainty, and cognitive appraisal of the pandemic's consequences moderate the effect of prenatal objective hardship and subjective distress due to the pandemic on 2-month postpartum anxiety. Data were collected as part of the Birth in the Time of COVID (BITTOC) study. We measured objective hardship and subjective distress, mental health, and potential psychological moderators in 419 pregnant women residing in Australia, and at two months postpartum. Hierarchical multiple regressions were used. Objective hardship and subjective distress independently predicted postpartum anxiety. All three psychological factors moderated the effect of objective hardship on anxiety. For women with low/neutral resilience, or low/moderate tolerance of uncertainty, or a negative cognitive appraisal, greater objective hardship predicted higher postpartum anxiety. Conversely, for women with high resilience, or high tolerance of uncertainty, or neutral/positive cognitive appraisal, there was no association. Only a neutral/positive cognitive appraisal significantly buffered the effect of subjective distress on anxiety. Participants self-selected themselves into the study. The generalizability of our results could be restricted to women of higher socio-economic status. These findings help us better understand options for intervention and assessment of vulnerable women during times of stress, along with the mechanisms by which COVID-related stress during pregnancy contributes to postpartum anxiety.","Di Paolo, King, McLean, Lequertier, Elgbeili, Kildea, Dahlen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.06.055","20220627","Anxiety; Cognitive appraisal; Covid-19; Prenatal maternal stress; Resilience; Tolerance of uncertainty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33411,""
"Correlates of past year suicidal thoughts among sexual and gender minority young adults: A machine learning analysis","Sexual and gender minority populations are at elevated risk of experiencing suicidal thoughts and attempting suicide. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated mental health and substance use challenges among this population. We aimed to examine the relative importance and effects of intersectional factors and strong interactions associated with the risk of suicidal thoughts among Canadian lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and Two Spirit (LGBTQI2S+) young adults. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among LGBTQI2SÃ‚Â +Ã‚Â participants aged 16-29 years living in two Canadian provinces (Ontario, Quebec). Among 1414 participants (mean age 21.90 years), 61% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 857) participants reported suicidal thoughts in last 12 months. We built a random forest model to predict the risk of having past year suicidal thoughts, which achieved high performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84. The top 10 correlates identified were: seeking help from health professionals for mental health or substance use issues since the start of the pandemic, current self-rated mental health status, insulted by parents or adults in childhood, ever heard that being identifying as LGBTQI2S+ is not normal, age in years, past week feeling depressed, lifetime diagnosis of mental illness, lifetime diagnosis of depressive disorder, past week feeling sad, ever pretended to be straight or cisgender to be accepted. The increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts for those having mental health challenges or facing minority stressors is more pronounced in those living in urban areas or being unemployed than those living in rural areas or being employed.","Kundu, Fu, Grace, Logie, Abramovich, Baskerville, Yager, Schwartz, Mitsakakis, Planinac, Chaiton","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.06.013","20220627","Machine learning; Mental health; Sexual and gender minority; Suicide; Young adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33412,""

"[Sleep disorders in post-COVID syndrome - a problem of psychiatry or neurology?]","The pandemic of coronavirus infection, which has begun in 2019, has not ended to this day. COVID-19 adversely affects human health not only in the acute period of the disease, but also in the long-run: in a large percentage of cases, recovery takes very long, patients require and often have problems returning to their baseline. During the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, researchers noted that about 10-20% of patients didn't fully recover three weeks after the onset of the disease. It is still not clear how long the recovery period can last, and what are the reasons of different time course of the recovery. Long-term recovery after a viral infection is a non-unique feature of COVID-19, which does not facilitate the management of patients with post-COVID syndrome. The impact on mental health after COVID-19 is significant, and at least 30% of those, who have been ill, may have symptoms of anxiety and/or depression after the acute phase of the disease. Since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there has been an increase in somnological disorders by 42%, while every third COVID-19 patient reports altered sleep patterns. In post-COVID-19 syndrome, this condition is referred to as Coronasomnia (COVID-somnia). The success of therapy of this condition depends on reporting and treating mental disorders in patients, as anxiety and depression are often accompanied by sleep disorders, that is, there is a bidirectional influence of mental disorders on the quality of sleep. The article provides data on two anti-anxiety drugs (noofen and adaptol) that help to treat the manifestations of post-COVID syndrome accompanied by sleep disorders.

"[Sleep at an anxious times]","In recent years, the problem of sleep disturbance has become particularly acute. The epidemic of coronavirus infection and lockdowns, the flow of contradictory information, as well as the decline in well-being have led to an almost threefold increase in the frequency of sleep disorders against the background of a surge in anxiety and depressive disorders. At the same time, the impact on sleep of foreign policy events and domestic tensions is still awaiting evaluation.

"Tracking the psychological and socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: A methodological report from Wave 5 of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study","The COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study was established in March 2020 to monitor the psychological and socio-economic impact of the pandemic in the UK and other countries. This paper describes the protocol for Wave 5 (March-April 2021). The survey assessed: COVID-19 related experiences; experiences of common mental health disorders; psychological characteristics; and social and political attitudes. Adults who participated in any previous wave (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4949) were re-invited to participate. Weights were calculated using a survey raking algorithm to ensure the longitudinal panel was nationally representative in terms of gender, age, and household income, amongst other factors. Overall, 2520 adults participated. A total of 2377 adults who participated in the previous survey wave (November-December 2020) were re-interviewed at Wave 5 (61.5% retention rate). Attrition between these two waves was predicted by younger age, lower household income, children living in the household, and treatment for mental health difficulties. Of the adults recruited into the C19PRC study at baseline, 57.4% (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1162) participated in Wave 5. The raking procedure re-balanced the longitudinal panel to within 1.5% of population estimates for selected socio-demographic characteristics. This paper outlines the growing strength of the publicly available C19PRC Study data for COVID-19-related interdisciplinary research.","McBride, Butter, Murphy, Hartman, McKay, Hyland, Shevlin, Bennett, Stocks, Lloyd, Gibson-Miller, Levita, Mason, Martinez, ValliÃƒÂ¨res, Karatzias, Bentall","https://doi.org/10.1002/mpr.1928","20220627","COVID-19; attrition; longitudinal survey; mental health; psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33416,""
"Association Between Telemedicine Use in Nonmetropolitan Counties and Quality of Care Received by Medicare Beneficiaries With Serious Mental Illness","Access to specialty mental health care remains challenging for people with serious mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Whether expansion of telemedicine is associated with improved access and quality of care for these patients is unclear. To assess whether greater telemedicine use in a nonmetropolitan county is associated with quality measures, including use of specialty mental health care and medication adherence. In this cohort study, the variable uptake of telemental health visits was examined across a national sample of fee-for-service claims from Medicare beneficiaries in 2916 nonmetropolitan counties between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018. Beneficiaries with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders and/or bipolar I disorder during the study period were included. For each year of the study, each county was categorized based on per capita telemental health service use (none, low, moderate, and high). The association between telemental health service use in the county and quality measures was tested using a multivariate model controlling for both patient characteristics and county fixed effects. Analyses were conducted from January 1 to April 11, 2022. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine reimbursement was limited to nonmetropolitan beneficiaries. Receipt of a minimum of 2 specialty mental health service visits (telemedicine or in-person) in the year, number of months per year with medication, hospitalization rate, and outpatient follow-up visits after a mental health hospitalization in a year. In 2018, there were 2916 counties with 118Ã¢â‚¬Â¯170 patients (77 068 [65.2%] men; mean [SD] age, 58.3 [15.6] years) in the sample. The fraction of counties that had high telemental health service use increased from 2% in 2010 to 17% in 2018. In 2018 there were 1.08 telemental health service visits per patient in the high telemental health counties. Compared with no telemental health care in the county, patients in high-use counties were 1.2 percentage points (95% CI, 0.81-1.60 percentage points) (8.0% relative increase) more likely to have a minimum number of specialty mental health service visits, 13.7 percentage points (95% CI, 5.1-22.3 percentage points) (6.5% relative increase) more likely to have outpatient follow-up within 7 days of a mental health hospitalization, and 0.47 percentage points (95% CI, 0.25-0.69 percentage points) (7.6% relative increase) more likely to be hospitalized in a year. Telemental health service use was not associated with changes in medication adherence. The findings of this study suggest that greater use of telemental health visits in a county was associated with modest increases in contact with outpatient specialty mental health care professionals and greater likelihood of follow-up after hospitalization. No substantive changes in medication adherence were noted and an increase in mental health hospitalizations occurred.","Wang, Huskamp, Rose, Busch, Uscher-Pines, Raja, Mehrotra","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.18730","20220627","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33417,""
"""Changes in alcohol use during COVID-19 and associations with contextual and individual difference variables: A systematic review and meta-analysis"" Correction to Acuff et al (2022)","Reports an error in ""Changes in alcohol use during COVID-19 and associations with contextual and individual difference variables: A systematic review and meta-analysis"" by Samuel F. Acuff, Justin C. Strickland, Jalie A. Tucker and James G. Murphy (<i>Psychology of Addictive Behaviors</i>, 2022[Feb], Vol 36[1], 1-19). In the article, (https://doi.org/10.1037/adb0000796), Table 1 omitted information for the Start date and End date of data collection for the Alpers et al. (2021) study, and a clarifying note has been added to Table 1. All versions of this article have been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2022-04435-001.) Objective: The present study meta-analyzed studies examining changes in alcohol consumption during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and systematically reviewed contextual and individual difference factors related to these changes. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) protocol, studies were gathered via PsycINFO, PubMed/MEDLINE, and preprint databases (published April 29, 2021) that examined individual-level changes in consumption during the initial COVID-19 mitigation measures (before October 2020). Next, sample proportion increases and decreases in consumption, in addition to mean change in consumption variables from pre- to during-COVID, were meta-analyzed, and contextual and individual difference variables related to consumption changes during the pandemic were summarized. One hundred and twenty-eight studies provided data from 58 countries (<i>M n</i> = 3,876; <i>Mdn n</i> = 1,092; aggregate sample <i>n</i> = 492,235). The average mean change in alcohol consumption was nonsignificant (Cohen's <i>d</i> = -0.01, <i>p</i> = .68); however, meta-analysis revealed that 23% of participants reported increases in consumption and 23% reported decreases. These changes were moderated by per capita gross domestic product and country. Narrative synthesis revealed multiple predictors of increased drinking, including contextual changes (e.g., children at home, income loss, working remotely), individual difference variables (being female, a young-to-middle aged adult, or Black), and mental health/alcohol-related risk factors (e.g., depression). The identified factors associated with increased alcohol consumption should be considered in planning behavioral health services during future crisis events that abruptly alter everyday environments in ways that increase stress and decrease access to naturally occurring rewards.

"[Characteristics of student response to pandemic in cross-cultural context]","Of the work is a cross-cultural analysis of the characteristics of student response in a pandemic situation. The sample consisted of students of NSMU and the Kazakh National University. Al-Farabi in the amount of 37 people aged 20 to 23; The battery of psychological methods was compiled by Spielberger and Khanina; Mississippi Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Scale (civil version) and PSM-25 Psychological Stress Scale. 52.7% of respondents showed an average level of stress, 47.3% - a low level, which indicates insufficient psychological adaptation to psychological stress. High rates of personal and situational anxiety were diagnosed in 67.57% of cases; the average level of reactive anxiety - in 29.73% of cases and personal - in 27.03% of respondents. The majority of respondents showed average levels of post-traumatic stress reactions (50%, <i>n</i>=37), while a low level of post-traumatic stress reactions occurs in 11 (14.87%) people, a low level - in 17 (22.97%) people and increased - in 9 (12.16%) people. Stress level indicators tend to have significant differences: the frequency of occurrence of average stress indicators in the sample of students from Kazakhstan is higher (75.6%) compared to Russian students (24.32%) (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). Adapting to changing academic workloads in a pandemic situation does not contribute to the psychological well-being of students, as evidenced by the results of diagnosing anxiety and post-traumatic stress reactions. The results obtained emphasize the importance of taking into account cultural factors in stressful situations. Cross-cultural differences in the level of emotional response of students in a pandemic situation were revealed.

"[Stress, anxiety, depression and burnout in healthcare workers during the first two outbreaks of COVID-19 in Russia]","To assess the levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout and risk factors in frontline healthcare workers during first two outbreaks of COVID-19 in Russia. We conducted two surveys in May and October 2020. Data of 2195 frontline healthcare workers were collected. Stress, anxiety, depression, burnout and perceived stress were assessed using the Russian versions of SAVE-9, GAD-7, PHQ-9, MBI and PSS-10 scales, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the risk factors. In May 2020 25.5% of healthcare workers had high level of anxiety, 30.4% - high level of stress. In October 2020 the rates of stress, anxiety, depression, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and perceived stress were 34.2%, 36.6%, 45.5%, 74.2%, 37.7%, 67.8%, respectively. Moreover, 2.4% of HCWs almost every day had suicidal thoughts. The rate of anxiety was higher in October 2020 compared with May 2020 (36.6% vs. 25.5%). Revealed risk factors included: female gender, younger age, being a physician, working for over a week, living outside of Moscow or Saint Petersburg, the absence of vaccination against COVID-19. The results of this study demonstrate the urgent need for supportive programs to the frontline healthcare workers fighting COVID-19 and its increasing significance over time. Such programs should mainly focus on revealed risk groups and potentially modifiable risk factors.

"BEREAVEMENT AND COVID-19: PREVALENCE, COMORBIDITY, AND ASSOCIATED FEATURES AMONG UKRAINIAN SAMPLE","The aim: To examine the features of experiences of bereavement reactions and the severity of comorbid mental health problems in persons who lost loved ones during the pandemic. Materials and methods: 191 volunteers aged 18-60 years participated in this study. All participants were tested during 2018-2020. To assess the mental health problems was used International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and a set of IAPT scales; to the psycho-emotional distress severity associated with loss of loved ones - Inventory of Complicated Grief, with verification of symptoms of complicated grief based on an independent assessment of two experts; and the quality of life satisfaction was assessed by the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, Short Form. Results: The results show an association between the severity of symptoms of depression, general anxiety, social avoidance, and loss during the pandemic. The level of psycho-emotional distress was associated with the experience of bereavement as a traumatic event for a group of participants who experienced loss during the pandemic and, at the same time, before the pandemic was associated with the severity of depression. Regardless of the time of loss, people who demonstrated signs of complicated grief have a more pronounced comorbid psychopathology, a higher level of psycho-emotional distress, and a lower level of satisfaction with life quality. Conclusions: It has been established that a person's ability to experience loss as a traumatic experience and grieve during the pandemic is modified with the context of the life situation and reflects those challenges that impose quarantine restrictions.","Avramchuk, Plevachuk, Koval","https://doi.org/10.36740/WLek202205212","20220627"," COVID-19 pandemic ;  anxiety disorders ;  bereavement ;  complicated grief ;  depression ","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33421,""
"Changes in mental and sexual health among MSM using HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: longitudinal analysis of the SwissPrEPared cohort study","Changes in mental and sexual health among men having sex with men (MSM) due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic remain unclear. Design: Longitudinal analysis of an ongoing, multicentre, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) cohort (NCT03893188) in Switzerland. Participants: HIV-negative MSM aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 who completed at least one questionnaire before and one after the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Outcomes: Primary: mental health, defined as anxiety and depression scores assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. Secondary: sexual behaviour, well-being, PrEP use and disruption of care. Outcomes were assessed over seven periods corresponding to different SARS-CoV-2 prevention measures in Switzerland. We performed pairwise comparisons between periods (Wilcoxon signed rank test). Data from 1,043 participants were included. Whilst anxiety scores remained stable over time, depression scores worsened in the second wave and the second lockdown period compared to pre-pandemic scores. This was confirmed by pairwise comparisons (pre-SARS-CoV-2/second wave and pre-SARS-CoV-2/second lockdown: p &lt;0.001). Downward trends in sexual activity,sexualized substance use, and a switch from daily to ""event-driven"" PrEP were found. Disruption of care affected 42.6% (790/1856) of daily PrEP users' follow-up visits. In this longitudinal analysis of a PrEP cohort enrolling MSM, depression scores worsened in the second wave and the second lockdown compared to the pre-pandemic period.","Winter, Hovaguimian, Kouyos, Schmidt, Bernasconi, Braun, Calmy, Notter, Stoeckle, Surial, Christinet, Cavassini, Depmeier, LÃƒÂ¤uchli, Boffi El Amari, Reinacher, Rasi, Bruggmann, Haerry, Bize, Low, Lehner, Quednow, Fehr, Hampel","https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2022.w30192","20220627","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33422,""
"Associations of health-related quality of life with depression and stigma in MERS-CoV survivors during the recovery period","We explored factors related to health-related quality of life (HRQOL), including psychiatric symptoms and stigma related to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, among MERS-CoV survivors during the recovery period.Sixty-three MERS-COV survivors were recruited from five hospitals for a cohort study, one year after their infection in 2015. The subjects' demographic information and medical conditions associated with MERS-CoV were recorded. HRQOL was evaluated using the Short Form-8 Health Survey (SF-8). Depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, chronic fatigue, and perceived stigma were assessed using several questionnairesThe mean physical component summary (PCS) and mean mental component summary (MCS) of the SF-8 score were below 50Ã¢â‚¬Å T (43.47Ã¢â‚¬Å Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Å 9.60, 45.74Ã¢â‚¬Å Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Å 10.18). Depression, chronic fatigue, posttraumatic stress symptoms and stigma were negatively correlated with the SF-8 PCS and MCS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the PCS was associated with stigma (OR 8.66, 95% CI 1.96-38.23), whereas MCS was associated with depression (OR 26.62, 95% CI 3.56-198.85).The estimated HRQOL of MERS-CoV survivors during recovery was poor and appeared to be associated with depression and MERS-related stigma.","Ahn, Kim, Lee, Park, Lee, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000029440","20220627","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33423,""
"The effectiveness of e-healthcare interventions for mental health of nurses: A PRISMA-compliant systematic review of randomized controlled trials","Mental health problems, including burnout among nurses, are common and important. With the rapid development of information and communication technologies and the rise in use of smartphones, the use of e-mental health strategies is increasing in public and clinical settings, and initial clinical trials using this intervention have been conducted. This systematic review evaluated whether e-healthcare interventions improve burnout and other mental health aspects in nurses. Six electronic databases including MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Elsevier), the Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and PsycARTICLES were searched to collect relevant randomized controlled trials up to January 28, 2021, using e-healthcare interventions for mental health in nurses. The e-healthcare intervention was classified as web-based, smartphone-based, and real-time online interventions. The primary outcome was burnout in this population. Due to the heterogeneity of the interventions used in the included studies, quantitative synthesis was not performed, but included studies were analyzed qualitatively. Also, the details of e-healthcare for the mental health of nurses were analyzed. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool. Seven randomized controlled trials were included in this study. The 20-minute session of an online form of the emotional freedom technique was reported to significantly improve burnout severity compared to no intervention (PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å .001). Other outcomes, such as career identity, quality of work life, workplace bullying, job stress, turnover intention, distress, anxiety, and resilience in nurses, were also reported to be improved by e-healthcare interventions. The methodological quality of the included studies was generally poor. In conclusion, there was some evidence that e-healthcare interventions may improve mental health outcomes, including burnout in nurses, compared with no intervention. However, due to the poor methodological quality and wide heterogeneity of the interventions and outcomes in the included studies, we were not able to reach sufficiently reliable conclusions. E-healthcare intervention for nurses in the new coronavirus disease era was discussed. High-quality clinical trials in this area should be conducted in the future.","Park, Jung, Ha, Lee, Kim, Sim, Choi, Kwon","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000029125","20220627","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33424,""
"Disentangling crucial factors of the pandemic in Brazil: Effect of lockdown restrictions on mental health","Quarantine and social distance restrictions have been enforced worldwide to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The effects of these measures on mental health are recognised, but remaining unclear, is whether these effects are a consequence of the virus itself or policies that are enforced to prevent it. The present study investigated the impact of lockdown restrictions on anxiety and depression at two different times in 2020. Data were collected from 118 participants from all regions of Brazil. After easing quarantine restrictions in the second half of 2020, two natural groups were formed. One group included participants who voluntarily remained at home (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 73). The other group consisted of those who decided to leave home (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 45). A linear mixed model was used to determine the effects of group and time and their interaction. The McNemar test was used to determine intragroup differences in perceptions and concerns about COVID-19. Logistic regression identified predictors of high and stable depression and anxiety. None of the factors or their interactions was significant. Indicators of depression and anxiety remained stable over time, regardless of whether the participants left home or remained at home. Significantly, a strong and stable agreement with quarantine was found. The participants agreed that COVID-19 was a threat to public health. Political orientation was a predictor of high and stable levels of depression but not anxiety. Participants who self-identified as liberal politically were at a greater risk of developing depression. The results suggest that the lockdown policy did not contribute to disruptions of mental health, which instead was a consequence of the pandemic and virus itself. We also found wide and strong support amongst the participants for lockdown and mandatory stay-at-home policies.","AnunciaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o, Portugal, Andrade, Marques, Landeira-Fernandez","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13878","20220627","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; linear mixed model; longitudinal design; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33425,""

"The comparative mental health of Australian doctors before and during COVID-19: A population-based approach","Occupational surveys of doctors consistently show higher rates of depression and anxiety than reported in general population surveys, findings replicated in all other occupational groups, suggesting potential selection bias. We evaluated the comparative mental health of different occupations in Australia from the same sampling frame over the past 6 years and assessed whether COVID-19 differentially affected different occupational groups. We analysed six annual data waves (2015-2020) from the nationally representative 'Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia' study. Mental health (Mental Health Inventory-5 from the 36-Item Short Form Survey) and life satisfaction scores of doctors over this period were compared with five other professions and all other employees. Regression models were adjusted for age, gender, income and work hours. Two-way analysis of variance examined the comparative changes in mental health among occupations between 2019 and after exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2020. The sample of 15,174 employed respondents included 106 doctors. The 5-year mean mental health score for doctors (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°78.7; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.1) was significantly higher than that for teachers (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°75.6; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.9), nurses and midwives (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°76.6; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.9), lawyers (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°74.2; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.1), accountants (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°74.2; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.5) and all other employed respondents (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°73.1, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.7) (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Cognitive wellbeing comparisons were similar. There were no significant changes in professionals' mental health over this period except for an improvement in engineers and a decline for teachers. From 2019 to 2020, all occupations suffered mental health declines without any significant inter-occupational differences. Australian doctors identified from a population-based sample rather than occupational surveys reported better levels of mental health and greater life satisfaction than most professions prior to COVID-19 without experiencing the worsening seen in the general employed population over the past 5 years. From 2020, there was a mental health decline in all of the employed population, not disproportionately affecting doctors. Although over-representing Australian trained general practitioners, the results from both this sample and other tentative findings challenge the discourse in medical advocacy, but need more formal comparative studies to confirm.","Hoang, Morris, Naehrig, Glozier","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221106677","20220627","COVID-19; HILDA; Mental health; doctors; life satisfaction; occupations; physicians; population","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33427,""
"Barbershops as a setting for supporting men's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study from the UK","Previous research has highlighted the need to promote help-seeking by men with mental health problems. To investigate barbers' views about offering mental health support for men in barbershops, with a specific focus on the psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a sequential mixed-methods qualitative design with online data collection. In Phase 1, 30 barbers in Southern England completed surveys exploring perceptions of their clients' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, experiences of informal supportive roles and scope for providing formal mental health support in barbershops. Phase 2 involved member validation interviews and explored practice implications with three Phase 1 respondents. Thematic analysis identified three overarching themes: 'more than a haircut' (describing how the physical and relational contexts of barbershops can offer a supportive environment for clients); 'impacts of COVID-19' (describing stressors related to the pandemic and implications for clients' mental health and barber-client relationships); and 'formal mental health strategies' (describing opportunities for, and potential barriers to, formalising mental health support in barbershops). Barbers were aware of their clients' worsening mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Barbershops were generally considered to be a suitable setting in which to promote good mental health, monitor for signs of mental ill health and provide information about local mental health services. Future work is needed to co-produce and evaluate formal mental health promotion and prevention strategies in barbershops. Particular attention should be given to service innovations that preserve the credibility and trust that are fundamental to the barbershop experience for many males.","Ogborn, Bowden-Howe, Burd, Kleijn, Michelson","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.520","20220627","COVID-19; community interventions; gender; public mental health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33428,""
"Sensitization Symptoms are Associated with Psychological and Cognitive Variables in COVID-19 Survivors Exhibiting post-COVID Pain","To investigate the association between demographic, clinical, psychological, cognitive, and health-related variables and the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) in previously hospitalized COVID-19 survivors exhibiting ""de novo"" post-COVID pain. Seventy-seven (n=77) COVID-19 survivors with ""de novo"" post-COVID pain completed demographic (age, height, weight), clinical (duration and intensity of the pain), psychological (depressive/anxiety levels and sleep quality), cognitive (catastrophizing and kinesiophobia levels) and health-related quality of life variables as well as the CSI. A multivariable correlation analysis was conducted to determine the association between variables and a stepwise multiple linear regression model was performed to identify CSI predictors. Patients were assessed a mean of 6.0 (SD 0.8) months after hospital discharge. Twenty-six (33.7%) individuals showed indications of sensitization associated symptoms (CSI scoreÃ¢â€°Â¥40 points). The CSI score was positively associated with pain intensity (r: .371), anxiety (r: .784), depressive (r: .709), catastrophizing (r: .620) and kinesiophobia (r: .359) levels (all, P&lt;.001). The stepwise regression analysis revealed that 60.2% of CSI was explained by anxiety levels and pain intensity.

"The Association Between Exposure to COVID-19 and Mental Health Outcomes Among Healthcare Workers","Due to the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care systems, there has been great interest in the mental wellbeing of healthcare workers. While most studies investigated mental health outcomes among frontline vs. non-frontline healthcare workers, little is known about the impact of various work-related variables. The present study aimed to examine the association between work-related [i.e., having contact with COVID-19 patients, being redeployed due to the pandemic and availability of sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE)] and subjective (i.e., worries about getting infected or infecting others) exposures and self-reported mental health outcomes (i.e., psychological distress, depressive symptoms, and posttraumatic stress symptoms). Between February and May 2021, 994 healthcare workers employed at a variety of healthcare settings in the Netherlands filled out an online survey as part of the COVID-19 HEalth caRe wOrkErS (HEROES) study. Mental health outcomes were measured using the General Health Questionnaire-12, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5. Approximately 13% reported depressive symptoms, 37% experienced psychological distress, and 20% reported posttraumatic stress symptoms. Multilevel linear models consisted of three levels: individual (work-related and subjective exposures), healthcare center (aggregated redeployment and availability of sufficient PPE), and regional (cumulative COVID-19 infection and death rates). Worries about infection were associated with all three mental health outcomes, whereas insufficient PPE was associated with psychological distress and depressive symptoms. There were no differences in outcomes between healthcare centers or provinces with different COVID-19 infection and death rates. Our findings highlight the importance of adequate PPE provision and the subjective experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors should be part of interventions aimed at mitigating adverse mental health outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Czepiel, Hoek, van der Markt, Rutten, Veling, Schirmbeck, Mascayano, Susser, van der Ven","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.896843","20220627","COVID-19; depression; healthcare workers (HCWs); mental health; personal protective equipment (PPE); posttraumatic stress; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33431,""
"Age, Motivation, and Emotion Regulation Skills Predict Treatment Outcome in an Internet-Based Self-Help Intervention for COVID-19 Related Psychological Distress","First evidence suggests that internet-based self-help interventions effectively reduce COVID-19 related psychological distress. However, it is yet unclear which participant characteristics are associated with better treatment outcomes. Therefore, we conducted secondary analyses on data from a randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of a 3-week internet-based self-help intervention for COVID-19 related psychological distress. In this exploratory analysis, we examined several predictors ranging from sociodemographic variables to psychological distress, resource-related, and treatment-related variables. This includes, for example, age, motivation, and emotion regulation skills. Treatment outcomes were defined as post-treatment depressive symptoms and post-treatment resilience. In a total of 107 participants with at least mild depressive symptoms, possible predictor variables and treatment outcomes were assessed using self-report measures. For example, emotion regulation skills were assessed by the Self-report measure for the assessment of emotion regulation skills. In a first step, we performed a separate linear regression analysis for each potential predictor. In a second step, predictors meeting a significant threshold of <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 were entered in linear multiple regression models. Baseline scores of the respective outcome measure were controlled for. The mean age of the participants was 40.36 years (SD = 14.59, range = 18-81 years) with the majority being female (<i>n</i> = 87, 81.3%). Younger age predicted lower post-treatment depressive symptoms. Additionally, higher motivation to use the intervention and better pre-treatment emotion regulation skills predicted higher post-treatment resilience. The current study provides preliminary evidence regarding the relationship between participant characteristics and treatment outcome in internet-based self-help interventions for COVID-19 related distress. Our results suggest that under the circumstances surrounding COVID-19 such interventions might be particularly beneficial for young adults regarding depressive symptoms. Moreover, focusing on participants' existing strengths might be a promising approach to promote resilience through internet-based self-help interventions. However, since this was an exploratory analysis in an uncontrolled setting, further studies are needed to draw firm conclusions about the relationship of participant characteristics and treatment outcome in internet-based self-help interventions for COVID-19 related psychological distress.","Brog, Hegy, Berger, Znoj","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.835356","20220627","COVID-19; depressive symptoms (DSs); internet-based self-help; psychological distress; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33432,""
"Assessment of Psychological Distress in Health Care Workers During the First two Waves of COVID-19: A Follow-up of a Canadian Longitudinal Study","Health care workers (HCW) exposed to COVID-19 risk experiencing psychological distress. Little is known regarding longitudinal perspectives and evolutions of psychological distress within this population. The objective of this study is to extend the results of our previous study to the pandemic's second wave. This prospective cohort study was conducted from May 8, 2020, to January 24, 2021, and includes 787 HCW. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Descriptive statistics illustrated the evolution of psychological distress indicators, whereas latent class analysis helped identify trajectories. The results showed that a lower proportion of HCW exceeded the clinical threshold during the second wave (36,5% vs. 31,1%). As in the first wave, most of our sample fell onto the resilient trajectory (67.22%). We adapted the name of the remaining trajectories to better suit their evolution: rapid recovery (15.76%), slow recovery (9.66%), and delayed (7.37%). Approximately two-thirds of the HCW did not manifest significant distress. For those who did, the distress was transient. We observed a trend of positive adaptability among HCW, considering that the proportion of HCW experiencing psychological distress exceeding clinical threshold remained lower than during the first wave. Our data highlight the dynamic nature of psychological distress. To be able to detect psychological distress as it arises, HCW should use self-monitoring as an essential tool. This vigilance would allow institutions to offer timely support and resources for those experiencing psychological distress.","Dufour, Bergeron, Guay, Geoffrion","https://doi.org/10.1177/24705470221108144","20220627","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health-care workers; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33433,""
"Psychological Resilience Among Older Japanese Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Psychological resilience refers to the ability to cope with adversities, and deficits in resilience might lead to mental illness. The COVID-19 pandemic has had impact on psychological resilience for older adults, but there are as yet no data on its impacts on the mental health of older adults who were living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological resilience in older adults with MCI and to explore associated physical and psychosocial factors. In this cross-sectional study of 268 older adults aged 65-85, we defined MCI as age- and education-adjusted cognitive decline with a standard deviation of 1.0 or more from the reference threshold. During December 2020 to April 2021, we carried out to all participants the 10-item version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10) to measure psychological resilience. We also conducted a comprehensive geriatric assessment including sleep quality and depressive symptoms (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale, respectively). To identify factors associated with CD-RISC-10 scores (mean: 23.3 Ã‚Â± 0.4), multiple regression analysis revealed that older age [coefficient = 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.06-0.39] was significantly correlated with higher scores, whereas poor sleep quality (coefficient = -2.06, 95% <i>CI</i> = -3.93 to -0.19) and depressive symptoms (coefficient = -2.95, 95% <i>CI</i> = -5.70 to -0.21) were significantly correlated with lower scores. In this study, older adults with MCI showed low psychological resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, and people with low psychological resilience indicated poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms. Our findings suggest directions for devising interventions to maintain mental health and psychological resilience among the vulnerable population of older adults with MCI living under the socially isolated conditions of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Our recommendation includes continuous assessment of this population and appropriate care for poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms.","Matsumoto, Sugimoto, Kuroda, Uchida, Kishino, Arai, Sakurai","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.898990","20220627","CD-RISC-10; COVID-19; depressive symptoms; mild cognitive impairment; older adults; psychological resilience; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33434,""
"Decrease in Social Zeitgebers Is Associated With Worsened Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder: Findings During the Pandemic in Japan","Delay in sleep-wake rhythms was observed in the general population during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD) may have also experienced exacerbation of symptoms, but no studies have investigated this topic. In this study, we aimed to retrospectively examine the changes in symptoms of outpatients with DSWPD both before and during the pandemic and to identify the factors associated with the exacerbation of sleep-wake rhythms. We included outpatients with DSWPD aged 16 years or older who visited the outpatient clinic due to sleep disorders between January and September 2020. Decreased social zeitgebers was defined as a reduction of 50% or more in the frequency of commuting to school or work during the COVID-19 pandemic. The severity of DSWPD was assessed using the clinical global impressions - severity of illness (CGI-S) at two points: before and during the pandemic. We defined the worsened, unchanged, and improved groups as those whose CGI-S scores worsened by at least one point, remained unchanged, and improved by at least one point, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with worsened DSWPD symptoms. Sixty patients with DSWPD were eligible for this study. Even before the pandemic, patients who were unemployed or did not attend school tended to show more severe DSWPD symptoms. During the pandemic, 27 patients belonged to the worsened group; 28 patients, unchanged group; and 5 patients, improved group. Decreased social zeitgebers (odds ratio [OR] = 6.668, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.653-26.891, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and comorbid mood disorders (OR = 8.876, 95% CI: 1.714-45.974, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) showed independent significant associations with the worsening of DSWPD symptoms. During the pandemic, the symptoms of DSWPD tended to worsen.

"The Influence of Adverse Childhood Experiences in Pain Management: Mechanisms, Processes, and Trauma-Informed Care","Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) increase the likelihood of reduced physical and psychological health in adulthood. Though understanding and psychological management of traumatic experiences is growing, the empirical exploration of ACEs and physical clinical outcomes remains under-represented and under-explored. This topical review aimed to highlight the role of ACEs in the experience of chronic pain, pain management services and clinical decision making by: (1) providing an overview of the relationship between ACEs and chronic pain; (2) identifying biopsychosocial mechanisms through which ACEs may increase risk of persistent pain; (3) highlighting the impact of ACEs on patient adherence and completion of pain management treatment; and (4) providing practical clinical implications for pain management. Review findings demonstrated that in chronic pain, ACEs are associated with increased pain complications, pain catastrophizing and depression and the combination of these factors further heightens the risk of early treatment attrition. The pervasive detrimental impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on ACEs and their cyclical effects on pain are discussed in the context of psychological decline during long treatment waitlists. The review highlights how people with pain can be further supported in pain services by maintaining trauma-informed practices and acknowledging the impact of ACEs on chronic pain and detrimental health outcomes. Clinicians who are ACE-informed have the potential to minimize the negative influence of ACEs on treatment outcomes, ultimately optimizing the impact of pain management services.","Tidmarsh, Harrison, Ravindran, Matthews, Finlay","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpain.2022.923866","20220627","ACEs; chronic pain; fear-avoidance; pain catastrophizing; person-centered care; treatment adherence and completion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33436,""
"Emerging adults facing the COVID-19 pandemic: emotion dysregulation, mentalizing, and psychological symptoms","Settled in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the present short-term longitudinal study aims to investigate the relation between emotion dysregulation, mentalizing (both certainty and uncertainty about mental states), and psychological symptoms in a sample of 83 emerging adults (M<sub>age</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 22.18 years, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.36) over a continuous period started with COVID-19 spreads. Results display significant positive associations between psychological symptoms and both emotion dysregulation and uncertainty about mental states, while an inverse association with certainty about mental states was found. A moderation model was also performed, showing a significant negative association between emotion dysregulation and psychological symptoms at low levels of uncertainty about mental states. Conversely, a marginally significant positive association occurs at high levels of uncertainty about mental states. In other words, the presence of individual impairments in perceiving one's own/others mind may increase the negative consequences of emotion dysregulation on reported psychological symptoms. To sum up, our findings highlight the importance of considering mentalizing as a possible key factor for the promotion of emerging adults' mental health also in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Charpentier Mora, Bastianoni, Cavanna, Bizzi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03322-5","20220627","COVID-19; Emotion dysregulation; Longitudinal study; Mentalizing; Psychological symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33437,""
"Cognitive after-effects and associated correlates among post-illness COVID-19 survivors: a cross-sectional study, Egypt","COVID-19's after-effects among survivors are of increased concern. The cognitive aftermath of COVID-19 virus infection was underrated. This study aimed to identify and compare the cognitive impairment (CI) and its correlates among COVID-19 survivors and control subjects. A total of 85 adults who survived COVID-19 virus infection and an equal number of control subjects (matched for age, sex, education, and socioeconomic level) were included in this study. They were recruited from Zagazig University Hospitals, Sharkia Province, Egypt. All subjects were interviewed utilizing a semistructured demographic and clinical checklist, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test, and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). More than half of COVID-19 survivors experienced CI (compared to only 8% of control subjects).

"A gamified app for supporting undergraduate students' mental health: A feasibility and usability study","Resilience, a person's mental ability to deal with challenging situations adaptively, is an important life skill. Supporting students in building psychological resilience and coping during crises (with the COVID-19 pandemic being a prime example) is crucial. Very few mobile applications (apps) for mental health explicitly report behavioral change techniques. Moreover, only a handful of the apps that support resilience are gamified, or use smartphone sensors readily available in modern smartphones for health self-management, or were designed for use by a nonclinical population. This study describes the design of a prototype for a gamified, theory-based mobile app that utilizes the Internet of Things to provide personalized data and enhance undergraduate students' resilience. A total of 74 participants evaluated the prototype and completed an online questionnaire during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The questionnaire included questions examining the design's feasibility for supporting resilience and questions on the System Usability Scale evaluating its usability. Regarding the evaluation of the prototype on improving psychological resilience, positive responses (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.76 out of 5, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.82) were received for all functions (goal setting for studying, socializing and physical exercise, progress monitoring using sensors or self-reporting, reflection, motivational badges). The System Usability Scale returned an evaluation score of 72.9, indicating a satisfactory degree of usability. The resilience app is a promising proof of concept. Combining Internet of Things capabilities with active user interaction while incorporating behavior change techniques in a gamified environment was well accepted by students. Implications for the design of gamified environments for well-being are drawn. Future research will empirically validate its design using quasi-experimental methods.","Nicolaidou, Aristeidis, Lambrinos","https://doi.org/10.1177/20552076221109059","20220627","COVID-19; Mobile apps; behavioral change techniques; higher education; internet of things; mental health; prevention intervention; resilience building; smartphone sensors; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33439,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdowns on Refugee Mental Health: A Narrative Review","With over 80Ã‚Â million persons around the world forcibly displaced from their homes, 26.3 of whom are refugees, recent estimates indicate that the number of forced migrants has reached an all-time high (UNHCR, 2020). Already at a disadvantage, the closures of schools and key community resources aimed at combating the spread of the virus during the early stages of the pandemic contributed to further distress on the well-being of refugees. Recognizing that forced migrants are a vulnerable and underserved population and that the COVID-19 virus and the lockdowns put in place to reduce its spread severely worsened their multidimensional stressors, the authors used a qualitative narrative review with attention to the thematic analysis model to explore the impact of lockdowns on refugees' mental health by reviewing publications from April 2020 through May 2021.

A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 666 randomly selected participants. Interview-assisted structured questionnaire was used to collect data, and alcohol use disorder identification test was employed to measure alcohol use disorder. The data were entered in to Epi info version 7 and exported in to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Both bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis were used to identify significant factors related with alcohol use disorder. In the multivariate model, variables with p valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05 were considered as a statistical significant factor for the outcome variable.

"Trait Empathy Modulates Patterns of Personal and Social Emotions During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused profound consequences on people's personal and social feelings worldwide. However, little is known about whether individual differences in empathy, a prosocial trait, may affect the emotional feelings under such threat. To address this, we measured 345 Chinese participants' personal emotions (e.g., active, nervous), social emotions (i.e., fearful and empathetic feelings about various social groups), and their empathy traits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the representational similarity analysis (RSA), we calculated the pattern similarity of personal emotions and found the similarity between the positive and negative emotions was less in the high vs. low empathy groups. In addition, people with high (vs. low) empathy traits were more likely to have fearful and sympathetic feelings about the disease-related people (i.e., depression patients, suspected COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 patients, flu patients, SARS patients, AIDS patients, schizophrenic patients) and showed more pattern dissimilarity in the two social feelings toward the disease-related people. These findings suggest a prominent role of trait empathy in modulating emotions across different domains, strengthening the polarization of personal emotions as well as enlarging social feelings toward a set of stigmatized groups when facing a pandemic threat.","He, Zhu, Chen, Mu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.893328","20220627","COVID-19; emotion; empathy; representational similarity analysis; threat","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33442,""
"Mental Health Management of English Teachers in English Teaching Under the COVID-19 Era","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new challenges and attention to the mental health of all social groups, making mental health increasingly necessary and important. However, people only focus on the mental health of undergraduates, and the mental health of teachers has not received much attention from society. College teachers are the backbone of the teachers' group, and their mental health not only affects the teaching quality and research level but also plays an important role in the mental health and personality development of undergraduates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, online teaching is a major challenge for college teachers, especially English teachers. To this end, this article proposes a bipartite graph convolutional network (BGCN) model based on the psychological test questionnaire and its structural characteristics for the recognition of the mental health crisis. Experimental results show that the proposed BGCN model is superior to neural network algorithms and other machine learning algorithms in accuracy, precision, F1, and recall and can be well used for the mental health management of English teachers in the era of COVID-19.","Ding, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.916886","20220627","COVID-19; English teachers; bipartite; graph convolutional networks; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33443,""
"The Impact of the Epidemiological Situation Resulting From COVID-19 Pandemic on Selected Aspects of Mental Health Among Patients With Cancer-Silesia Province (Poland)","The study aimed to assess the level of disease acceptance as well as the wellbeing and emotions that accompany cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study involved 1,000 patients of the oncology centers (Silesia, Poland). The following questionnaires were used for the study: WHO-5-Well-Being Index, BDI-Beck Depression Inventory, disease acceptance scale, and proprietary multiple-choice questions regarding the impact of the epidemic situation on the respondents' lives so far. The questionnaire study was conducted twice: in March-October 2020 (the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland) and March-October 2021 (renewed tightening of sanitary restrictions in Poland). The differences between the given periods were statistically analyzed. At the time of the study, the respondents felt mainly anxiety related to the possibility of contracting COVID-19, the possibility of infecting a loved one, or staying in quarantine. Anxiety was also caused by the vision of poorer access to health services. Along with the duration of the epidemic, the acceptance of neoplastic disease has decreased and the incidence of depressive symptoms has increased. The wellbeing of the respondents deteriorated significantly during the pandemic. The respondents, in their daily functioning, were mainly accompanied by anxiety. The risk of depression has increased and the acceptance of the disease has decreased significantly.","Grajek, BiaÃ…â€šek-Dratwa","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.857326","20220627","COVID-19; depression; disease acceptance; lockdown; oncology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33444,""
"Screening Tool for Mental Health Problems During COVID-19 Pandemic: Psychometrics and Associations With Sex, Grieving, Contagion, and Seeking Psychological Care","The COVID-19 pandemic has created a public mental health crisis. Brief, valid electronic tools are required to evaluate mental health status, identify specific risk factors, and offer treatment when needed. To determine the construct validity, reliability, and measurement invariance of a brief screening tool for mental health symptoms by sex, loss of loved ones, personal COVID-19 status, and psychological care-seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the aim involved establishing a predictive pattern between the mental health variables. A total sample of 27,320 Mexican participants, with a mean age of 32 years (<i>SD</i> = 12.24, <i>range</i> = 18-80), 67% women (<i>n</i> = 18,308), 23.10% with a loss of loved ones (<i>n</i> = 6,308), 18.3% with COVID-19 status (<i>n</i> = 5,005), and 18.40% seeking psychological care (<i>n</i> = 5,026), completed a questionnaire through a WebApp, containing socio-demographic data (sex, loss of loved ones, COVID-19 status, and psychological care-seeking) and the dimensions from the Posttraumatic Checklist, Depression-Generalized Anxiety Questionnaires, and Health Anxiety-Somatization scales. We used the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA: through maximum likelihood to continuous variable data, as an estimation method), the invariance measurement, and the structural equational modeling (SEM) to provide evidence of the construct validity of the scale and the valid path between variables. We analyzed the measurement invariance for each dimension by comparison groups to examine the extent to which the items showed comparable psychometric properties. The tool included eight dimensions: four posttraumatic stress symptoms -intrusion, avoidance, hyperactivation, and numbing, as well as depression, generalized anxiety, health anxiety, and somatization The tool's multidimensionality, was confirmed through the CFA and SEM. The participants' characteristics made it possible to describe the measurement invariance of scales because of the participants' attributes. Additionally, our findings indicated that women reported high generalized anxiety, hyperactivation, and depression. Those who lost loved ones reported elevated levels of intrusion and health anxiety symptoms. Participants who reported having COVID-19 presented with high levels of generalized anxiety symptoms. Those who sought psychological care reported high levels of generalized anxiety, intrusion, hyperactivation, and health anxiety symptoms. Our findings also show that intrusion was predicted by the avoidance dimension, while health anxiety was predicted by the intrusion dimension. Generalized anxiety was predicted by the health anxiety and hyperactivation dimensions, and hyperactivation was predicted by the depression one. Depression and somatization were predicted by the health anxiety dimension. Last, numbing was predicted by the depression and avoidance dimensions. Our findings indicate that it was possible to validate the factor structure of posttraumatic stress symptoms and their relationship with depression, anxiety, and somatization, describing the specific bias as a function of sociodemographic COVID-19-related variables. We also describe the predictive pattern between the mental health variables. These mental health problems were identified in the community and primary health care scenarios through the CFA and the SEM, considering the PCL, depression, generalized anxiety, health anxiety, and somatization scales adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, future studies should describe the diagnosis of mental health disorders, assessing the cut-off points in the tool to discriminate between the presence and absence of conditions and mental health cut-off points. Community and primary care screening will lead to effective early interventions to reduce the mental health risks associated with the current pandemic. Future studies should follow up on the results of this study and assess consistency with diagnoses of mental health disorders and evaluate the effect of remote psychological help. Moreover, in the future, researchers should monitor the process and the time that has elapsed between the occurrence of traumatic events and the development of posttraumatic stress and other mental health risks through brief electronic measurement tools such as those used in this study.","Morales ChainÃƒÂ©, Robles GarcÃƒÂ­a, LÃƒÂ³pez Montoya, Bosch Maldonado, Beristain Aguirre, TreviÃƒÂ±o Santa Cruz, Palafox, Lira ChÃƒÂ¡vez, BarragÃƒÂ¡n Torres, Rangel GÃƒÂ³mez","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.882573","20220627","CFA; COVID-19; measurement invariance; mental health symptoms; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33445,""
"Young Adults' Loneliness and Depression During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Moderated Mediation Model","Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019, millions of people have been infected with the disease. The COVID-19 pandemic also produced severe mental health problems, such as loneliness and depression. The present study aimed to examine the mediating role of cognitive reappraisal and moderating role of resilience in the relationship between young adults' loneliness and depression during the pandemic by adopting a cross-sectional research approach. In March 2020, 654 young adults (18-29 years old) were recruited to complete the measures for loneliness, depression, emotion regulation, and resilience. Results found that loneliness was positively and moderately associated with depression (<i>r</i> = 0.531, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and that both loneliness and depression were separately negatively associated with cognitive reappraisal (<i>r</i> = -0.348, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; <i>r</i> = -0.424, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and resilience (<i>r</i> = -0.436, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; <i>r</i> = -0.419, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The results indicated that both loneliness and depression were not associated with expressive suppression (<i>r</i> = 0.067, <i>p</i> = 0.087; <i>r</i> = -0.002, <i>p</i> = 0.961). The moderated mediation model results revealed that only cognitive reappraisal partially mediated the relationship between loneliness and depression (<i>b</i> = -0.301; <i>Boot</i> 95% <i>CI</i> = -0.388, -0.215). In addition, the results of the moderated mediation model indicated that resilience moderated the association between loneliness and depression (<i>b</i> = 0.035, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, <i>Boot 95% CI</i> = 0.014, 0.055), while also moderated the impact of cognitive reappraisal on depression (<i>b</i> = -0.031, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, <i>Boot 95% CI</i> = -0.058, -0.005). These findings have practical implications that broaden our understanding of depression in young adults and shed light on how to enhance cognitive reappraisal and resilience as a means of combating depression in this age group during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lv, Yu, Li, Tan, Ye, Xiao, Zhu, Guo, Liu, Gao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.842738","20220627","cognitive reappraisal; depression; loneliness; protective factors; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33446,""
"The psychological impact of quarantine due to COVID-19: A systematic review of risk, protective factors and interventions using socio-ecological model framework","Though quarantine is a pertinent control measure for the spread of COVID-19, it is equally important to consider its negative impacts, as it causes severe psychological, emotional, and financial problems not only for those who are quarantined but also for many others who are directly or indirectly connected to those who are quarantined. There appears to be a need to synthesise the available literature evidence on the psychological impact of quarantine experience, especially the multilevel risk factors that make individuals vulnerable to psychological impact and the protective factors to deal with the negative effects of quarantine. This systematic review attempted to identify the various psychological impacts associated with the experience of quarantine, the risk and protective factors and list out various psycho-social interventions that can minimise the risks and facilitate the protective factors associated with the experience of quarantine. A systematic search adhering to the PRISMA guidelines was performed in four databases PubMed, Scopus, PsycNet, Web of Science and 10518 articles related to COVID-19 and quarantine were obtained. After screening processes and quality assessment using standard checklist 74 articles that fulfilled the eligibility criteria were chosen for the final review. Individuals subjected to quarantine had anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, sleep problems, and somatic difficulties. Some of the key risk factors during quarantine are young age, female gender, low money, fear of infection, poor sleep quality, reduced physical activity, increased sedentary behaviours, and a lack of social support. Financial difficulties and stigma remained risk factors even after the quarantine period had ended. Key protective factors were coping skills, home based exercise, leisure, recreational activities, maintaining relationships using social media and availability of mental health services. The findings also highlight the necessity for tele mental health interventions to address the psychological effects of quarantine. Multilevel interventions are required to minimise the impact of risk factors and enhance protective factors.","Rajkumar, Rajan, Daniel, Lakshmi, John, George, Abraham, Varghese","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09765","20220627","COVID-19; Health risk factors; Health-protective factors; Pandemic; Psychological impacts; Quarantine; Socio-ecological model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33447,""

"Mental health symptoms one year after acute COVID-19 infection: Prevalence and risk factors","Emerging evidence suggests that mental health symptoms in COVID-19 survivors are higher than expected, possibly indicating that such symptoms are more likely to develop post-infection than just persist as a residual component of the acute phase. It is thus imperative to investigate the potential development of a post-COVID mental health syndrome in the longer-term and identify its risk factors. A prospective study investigated mental health symptoms associated with COVID-19 and its determinants over a 12-month period following the disease onset in all consecutive adult inpatients and outpatients with COVID-19 attending a tertiary referral hospital from March to May 2020. A total of 479 patients (female, 52.6%) were followed-up for 12 months after COVID-19 onset. Of them, 47.2% were still presenting with at least one symptom. While most symptoms subsided as compared to COVID-19 onset (all <i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), a significant increase was observed only for symptoms of psychiatric disorders (10.2%) and lack of concentration and focus (20%; all <i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Patients presenting with symptoms related to multiple body systems 12 months after contracting COVID-19 (all <i>p</i>Ã‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â 0.034) were more likely to suffer from mental health domain-related symptoms at follow-up. Also, a higher risk of presenting with lack of concentration and focus 12 months post infection was found in those suffering of psychiatric symptoms at COVID-19 onset (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.005). Findings of this study may have important public health implications, as they underlie the increased need for mental health support in COVID-19 survivors. Nuevas evidencias sugieren que los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de salud mental en los supervivientes de COVID-19 son mayores de lo esperado, lo que posiblemente indica que es mÃƒÂ¡s probable que dichos sÃƒÂ­ntomas se desarrollen despuÃƒÂ©s de la infecciÃƒÂ³n en vez de sÃƒÂ³lo persistir como componente residual de la fase aguda. Por lo tanto, es imperativo investigar el posible desarrollo de un sÃƒÂ­ndrome de salud mental post-COVID a largo plazo e identificar sus factores de riesgo. Un estudio prospectivo investigÃƒÂ³ los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de salud mental asociados a la COVID-19 y sus determinantes durante un periodo de 12 meses tras el inicio de la enfermedad en todos los pacientes adultos consecutivos con COVID-19, hospitalizados y ambulatorios, que acudieron a un hospital de tercer nivel entre marzo y mayo de 2020.

"","University students are particularly vulnerable to mental health issues, with anxiety and depression identified as the most common conditions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, self-isolation, and difficulties linked to online teaching and learning have increased their burden of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Thus, the urgent need to intervene in favour of these vulnerable subjects, together with the difficulties in delivering in-person interventions because of lockdowns and restrictions, has led to prioritize digital mental health strategies. This study aimed at systematically reviewing the existing literature on digital mental health interventions targeting anxiety and depressive symptoms in university students during the COVID-19 emergency. Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, and PsycInfo databases identified eight randomized controlled trials. Regarding anxiety symptoms, digitally delivered cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, and mind-body practice techniques emerged as valid strategies, while digital positive psychology and mindfulness-based interventions showed mixed results. On the other hand, digitally delivered dialectical behaviour therapy and positive psychology interventions have shown some efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms.

"Urgent care and suicidal behavior in the child and adolescent population in a psychiatric emergency department in a Spanish province during the two COVID-19 states of alarm","The COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown may have an impact in mental health among youth, but reports of psychiatry emergency department encounters in young Spanish population are scarce. The aim of this study is to characterize the reasons for psychiatric urgent care of youth during COVID-19 pandemic in our hospital. This cross-sectional study compare visits to the psychiatry emergency department and their characteristics in young patients in the province of Lleida before and after the pandemic with special attention to the two states of alarm and suicidal behavior. Information regarding sociodemographic status, chief complaints, diagnosis, characteristics of suicidal behavior, and other data were obtained from the electronic medical records. Within the total psychiatric emergency attendances, youth patients increased a 83.5% in the second state of alarm (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001). In this period patients were younger (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.006), had less psychiatric history (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.017) and their living conditions changed with an increase of those living with relatives (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.004). Suicidal ideation care increased without statistical significance (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.073). Multiple logistic regression identifies independent risk factors for suicidal behavior being female (OR: 2.88 [1.39-5.98]), living with relatives (OR: 3.49 [1.43-8.54]), and having a diagnosis of depression (OR: 6.34 [3.58-11.24]). The number of young people seen in psychiatric emergencies during the chronic stage of the pandemic increased, and these were getting younger and without previous psychiatric contact. The trend to higher rates of suicidal ideation indicates that youth experienced elevated distress during these periods, especially women, living with relatives and presenting depression.

Previous studies about events requiring situations of isolation suggested that mental health problems may occur among the general population and, more specifically, vulnerable groups such as individuals with serious mental illness (SMI). This study aims to assess the psychological effect of confinement in patients with mental illness admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit. In this longitudinal study, IDER (State-Trait Depression Inventory) and STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) questionnaires were used at two different times (at the beginning and after the lockdown) of the pandemic to evaluate the depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively, in a population of patients who had been previously admitted to the Psychiatry Unit of the Basurto University Hospital. 95 participants completed the IDER questionnaire in the first measurement, with a mean score of 24.56 (SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8.18) for state and 23.57 (SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8.14) for trait. In the case of STAI, the mean score was 27.86 (SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 15.19) for the state and 30.49 (SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 14.71) for the trait. No differences between the first and the second time were found in anxiety and depression levels. People with personality disorders presented high levels of anxiety. Individuals with a personality disorder showed the highest scores in anxiety and depression. Nevertheless, strict confinement did not affect this population, despite the literature that evidence that the pandemic has worsened people's mental health with SMI. El COVID-19 se ha extendido ampliamente desde su apariciÃƒÂ³n a finales del aÃƒÂ±o 2019. En EspaÃƒÂ±a se estableciÃƒÂ³ un confinamiento domiciliario que comenzÃƒÂ³ el 15 de marzo de 2020 y tuvo una duraciÃƒÂ³n de 99 dÃƒÂ­as. Estudios previos sobre situaciones que implican aislamiento indican un empeoramiento en la salud mental de la poblaciÃƒÂ³n general, y especÃƒÂ­ficamente en personas con un trastorno mental grave. El objetivo de este estudio es evaluar el efecto psicolÃƒÂ³gico del confinamiento en pacientes con trastorno mental grave. Se emplearon los cuestionarios IDER (State-Trait Depression Inventory) y STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) al inicio del confinamiento y despuÃƒÂ©s del mismo, para evaluar sÃƒÂ­ntomas de depresiÃƒÂ³n y ansiedad, respectivamente, en una poblaciÃƒÂ³n de pacientes que habÃƒÂ­an precisado previamente un ingreso hospitalario en la unidad de hospitalizaciÃƒÂ³n psiquiÃƒÂ¡trica en el Hospital universitario de Basurto. En la primera evaluaciÃƒÂ³n, 95 participantes completaron el cuestionario IDER, obteniendo una puntuaciÃƒÂ³n media de 24,56 (DEÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8,18) para el estado y 23,57 (DEÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8,14) para el rasgo. En el cuestionario STAI se obtuvo una puntuaciÃƒÂ³n media de 27,86 (DEÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 15,19) para el estado y de 30,49 (DEÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 14,71) para el rasgo. No se hallaron diferencias entre los niveles de ansiedad y depresiÃƒÂ³n de las 2 evaluaciones. Los individuos con trastorno de la personalidad presentaron altos niveles de ansiedad. Los individuos con trastorno de la personalidad obtuvieron los resultados mÃƒÂ¡s altos en ansiedad y depresiÃƒÂ³n. El confinamiento estricto no afectÃƒÂ³ a esta poblaciÃƒÂ³n, a pesar de la evidencia existente sobre un empeoramiento en la salud mental en pacientes con trastorno mental grave durante la pandemia.","Pedruzo, Catalan, Aymerich, Bordenave, Estevez, GÃƒÂ³mez, Herrero, Laborda, Mancebo, MartÃƒÂ­nez, Pacho, Paniagua, PÃƒÂ©rez, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Torres","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2022.04.004","20220627","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mental health; Serious mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33455,""
"Covid-19 PPE distribution planning with demand priorities and supply uncertainties","The recent Covid-19 outbreak put healthcare resources under enormous pressure. Governments and healthcare authorities faced major challenges in securing and delivering critical supplies such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and test kits. As timely distribution of critical supplies exceeded government resources, certain sectors, negatively impacted by the pandemic, offered their storage and distribution capabilities; both helping with the crisis and creating economic revenue. We investigate the problem of optimally leveraging the capacity and efficiency of underutilized distribution networks to enhance the capability of government supply networks to meet healthcare needs for critical supplies. We model the problem as a dynamic distribution planning problem that decides on the re-purposing of storage facilities, the allocation of demand, and the timely distribution of limited PPE supplies to different jurisdictions. From a resource provider's perspective, the goal is to maximize demand fulfillment based on priorities set out by the government, as well as maximize economic value to participating networks. As uncertainty is a prevalent feature of the problem, we adopt a robust framework due to the lack of historical data on such supply uncertainties. We provide a mixed integer programming formulation for the adversarial problem and present a cutting plane algorithm to solve the robust model efficiently under both polyhedral and ellipsoidal uncertainty sets. We build a case study for the province of Ontario, Canada, and run extensive analysis of the service and economic value trade-off, and the effects of modelling demand priorities and supply uncertainties.","Baloch, Gzara, Elhedhli","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2022.105913","20220627","Demand fulfillment; Distribution; Personal protective equipment; Robust optimization; Uncertainty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33456,""
"Willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 is equal in individuals with affective disorders and healthy controls","Affective disorders such as major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder are associated with higher infection rates and a more severe course of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In turn, COVID-19 could trigger mental disease relapse. Vaccinations lead to a reduction of infections and the prevention of severe courses. This work aims to survey the willingness of individuals with affective disorders to get vaccinated and concerns about vaccinations. An online study (April-May 2021) assessed the current infection and vaccination rate amongst individuals with affective disorder in Austria by surveying attitudes towards the vaccination, the willingness to get vaccinated soon and possible reasons for decision. The analyses included 59 individuals with affective disorders and 59 healthy controls, matched for sex and age. There was an overall high willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Individuals with affective disorders were more skeptical about vaccinations in general but there was no significant difference between the groups in the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19. In both groups reasons for waiting were mainly fears of acute and/or long-term side effects and the fast development of the vaccines. It was a cross sectional design. Due to the online design, no objective rating of current psychopathological symptoms was assessed. Willingness to get vaccinated in general and against COVID-19 in particular were self-created variables, whereas item statistics and factor analysis were conducted. Because of the higher risk for individuals with affective disorders, preventive strategies like vaccinating should be promoted in this group. It is important to help individuals with AD to overcome barriers such as negative beliefs and concerns about acute and/or long-term side effects.","Fellendorf, Bonkat, Platzer, SchÃƒÂ¶nthaler, Ratzenhofer, Bengesser, Dalkner, Reininghaus","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvacx.2022.100186","20220627","Affective disorder; Bipolar disorder; COVID-19; Depression; Vaccination; Willingness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33457,""
"Depression in pregnant and postpartum women during COVID-19 pandemic: systematic review and meta-analysis","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a global pandemic in March 2020 and caused a big crisis, especially the health crisis. Pregnant and postpartum women experienced significant physical, social, and mental changes that put them at higher risk for several conditions during the pandemic. This study aimed to report the prevalence of depression in pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligible studies were identified using several databases. Prevalence analysis was conducted using MedCalc ver. 19.5.1. This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO on July 12, 2021 with registration number CRD42021266976. We included 54 studies with 95.326 participants. The overall prevalence of depression was 32.60% among pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. The rate was higher among pregnant women (31.49%) compared to postpartum women (27.64%). The prevalence of depression among pregnant and postpartum women increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Adrianto, Caesarlia, Pajala","https://doi.org/10.5468/ogs.21265","20220627","COVID-19; Depression; Meta-analysis; Postpartum; Pregnant","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33458,""

"Were anxiety, depression and psychological distress associated with local mortality rates during COVID-19 outbreak in Italy? Findings from the COMET study","The mental health of the Italian population declined at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, nationwide population prevalence estimates may not effectively reproduce the heterogeneity in distress responses to the pandemic. In particular, contextual determinants specific to COVID-19 pandemic need to be considered. We thus aimed to explore the association between local COVID-19 mortality rates and mental health response among the general population. We capitalised on data (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 17,628) from a large, cross-sectional, national survey, the COMET study, run between March and May 2020. While psychological distress was measured by General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21) was used to assess relevant domains. In addition, a Covid-19 mortality ratio was built to compare single regional mortality rates to the national estimate and official statistics were used to control for other area-level determinants. Adjusted ordered regression analyses showed an association between mortality ratio and moderate (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.10, 95%CI 1.03-1.18) and severe (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.11, 95%CI 1.03-1.21) DASS-21 anxiety levels. No effects of mortality ratio on GHQ-12 scores and DASS-21 depression and stress levels, uniformly high across the country, were estimated. Although we could not find any association between regional COVID-19 mortality ratio and depression or psychological distress, anxiety levels were significantly increased among subjects from areas with the highest mortality rates. Local mortality rate seems a meaningful driver for anxiety among the general population. Considering the potentially long-lasting scenario, local public health authorities should provide neighbouring communities with preventive interventions reducing psychological isolation and anxiety levels.","CarrÃƒÂ , Crocamo, Bartoli, Riboldi, Sampogna, Luciano, Albert, Carmassi, Cirulli, Dell'Osso, Menculini, Nanni, Pompili, Sani, Volpe, Fiorillo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.06.018","20220626","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mortality rate; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33460,""
"Parental surveillance of OCD and mental health symptoms during COVID-19: A longitudinal study of Australian children, adolescents and families","To ensure the needs of children and families are met for the remainder of the COVID-19 situation and beyond there is a demand for a specific response strategy. This longitudinal study will investigate the impact of COVID-19 on Australian parental and childhood mental health symptoms, particularly OCD symptoms, examining the stability of this relationship over time and the needs and preferences for mental health support in response to child symptoms. A total of 141 parents completed a questionnaire during the lockdown period in Australia (June-September 2020). Thirty-five of them completed a follow-up questionnaire during the post-lockdown period (November 2020-January 2021). The questionnaire assessed COVID-19 experiences/worries/knowledge, child OCD, and child/parental anxiety and depression. Sub-samples of youth were determined based on parent-report of an existing diagnosis of any mental health (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 24), of OCD (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 22), or no mental health diagnosis (i.e., healthy, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 81). Results: Parents reported a significant positive association between increased parental worries regarding COVID-19, and their own as well as their child's mental health symptoms. The current sample of children experienced elevated symptom severity for OCD symptoms during COVID-19. The OCD group reported significant reductions in child OCD symptoms at post-lockdown. The any mental health diagnosed children are at greater risk of developing OCD symptoms and reported strong preferences for increased support as a result. The exploratory nature of this study adds further insight into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child OCD and parent mental health symptoms and the stability of symptoms over time.","Kroon, Bothma, Mathieu, Fontenelle, Farrell","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.06.002","20220626","COVID-19; Children; Family; Mental health; OCD","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33461,""
"A prospective study of transdiagnostic psychiatric symptoms associated with burnout and functional difficulties in COVID-19 frontline healthcare workers","Frontline healthcare workers (FHCWs) responding to the COVID-19 pandemic develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms. Such symptoms are associated with burnout, occupational and relational difficulties. In the current study, we examined the prospective association between acute transdiagnostic COVID-19-related PTSD, MDD, and GAD symptoms at pandemic outset, and burnout and functional difficulties several months later in FHCWs in New York City. Wave 1 symptoms of COVID-19-related PTSD, MDD, and GAD, were assessed in 787 FHCWs from April 14 to May 11th, 2020. Burnout and occupational difficulties were assessed at wave 1 and wave 2, approximately 7 months later. After adjusting for wave 1 burnout, wave 1 MDD symptoms, particularly sleep difficulties, loss of interest, and feeling tired/having little energy, collectively explained 42% incremental variance in this outcome. After adjusting for wave 1 work difficulties, MDD and PTSD symptoms, particularly feeling tired/having little energy, loss of interest, and negative expectations of self/world, collectively explained 42% incremental variance in this outcome. After adjusting for wave 1 relationship difficulties, MDD, GAD, and PTSD symptoms, particularly depressed mood, irritability, and appetite disturbance, explained 26% incremental variance in this outcome. Results highlight psychiatric symptoms assessed during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic that may help predict burnout and work and relationship difficulties in FHCWs. Early interventions aimed at ameliorating transdiagnostic symptoms of MDD, PTSD, and GAD may help mitigate risk for burnout and functional difficulties in this population.","Kachadourian, Murrough, Kaplan, Kaplan, Feingold, Feder, Charney, Southwick, Peccoralo, DePierro, Ripp, Pietrzak","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.05.034","20220626","Burnout; Frontline healthcare workers; Mental health impact; Occupational outcomes; Relationship outcomes; SARS COVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33462,""
"Mourning in a Pandemic: The Differential Impact of Widowhood on Mental Health During COVID-19","The death of a spouse is an established predictor of mental health decline that foreshadows worsening physical health and elevated mortality. The millions widowed by COVID-19 worldwide may experience even worse health outcomes than comparable pre-pandemic widows given the particularities of dying, mourning, and grieving during a pandemic defined by protracted social isolation, economic precarity, and general uncertainty. If COVID-19 pandemic bereavement is more strongly associated with mental health challenges than pre-pandemic bereavement, the large new cohort of COVID-19 widow(er)s may be at substantial risk of downstream health problems long after the pandemic abates. We pooled population-based Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe data from 27 countries for two distinct periods: (1) pre-pandemic (Wave 8, fielded October 2019 to March 2020; N = 46,266) and (2) early-pandemic (COVID Supplement, fielded June to August 2020; N = 55,796). The analysis used a difference-in-difference design to assess whether a spouse dying from COVID-19 presents unique mental health risks (self-reported depression, loneliness, and trouble sleeping), compared to pre-pandemic recent spousal deaths. We find strong associations between recent spousal death and poor mental health before and during the pandemic. However, our difference-in-difference estimates indicate those whose spouses died of COVID-19 have higher risks of self-reported depression and loneliness, but not trouble sleeping, than expected based on pre-pandemic associations. These results highlight that the millions of COVID-19 widow(er)s face extreme mental health risks, eclipsing those experienced by surviving spouses pre-pandemic, furthering concerns about the pandemic's lasting impacts on health.","Wang, Smith-Greenaway, Bauldry, Margolis, Verdery","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbac085","20220626","COVID-19; bereavement; mental health; widowhood","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33463,""
"Engagement of people with lived experience of dementia advisory group and cross-cutting program: reflections on the first year","The objective of this paper is to describe the activities, challenges and mitigation strategies, lessons learned and reflections on the importance of engagement from the first year of the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA) Engagement of People with Lived Experience of Dementia (EPLED) Advisory Group and cross-cutting program. EPLED was created to support persons with dementia and care partners to be actively involved in the CCNA research process. The Advisory Group was formed to work with CCNA researchers and programs to develop new ways to further collaborate and advance the methods of patient engagement in research on dementia. A role profile and recruitment poster were developed and, after interviews, 17 people were invited to join the Advisory Group. We planned three online EPLED meetings to take place between July-August of 2020, with one in-person meeting to be held in Canada. Due to COVID-19, we moved all of these meetings online. In the first year, EPLED and the Advisory Group met seven times formally, four times informally, developed a website, engaged with CCNA research projects, participated in CCNA ""Central"" activities and formulated an evaluation plan. For researchers and people with lived experience of dementia, motivations for patient engagement included challenging stigma, making meaning from their experience (such as building relationships and having their voices heard) and contributing to research. Common challenges to engagement were related to navigating the impact of COVID-19, such as difficulty in getting to know each other and technical issues with video-conference software. We learned that developing trusting relationships, providing education, offering support, being flexible and acknowledging tensions between research, practice and lived experience, were vital to the success of the Advisory Group. The first year of the EPLED Advisory Group demonstrated the potential contributions of people with lived experience of dementia as partners in research. Building these collaborations with individuals and communities-people living with dementia, care partners, researchers and research institutions-has the potential for positive impact across these groups and, ultimately, improve the lives of people living with dementia and their care partners. In this paper, we describe the development of the Canadian Consortium of Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA) Engagement of People with Lived Experience of Dementia (EPLED) cross-cutting program and the first year of the EPLED Advisory Group. EPLED was created to build opportunities for patient engagement in the CCNAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s research on dementia. People living with dementia and current/former friends, family and care partners were recruited from across Canada to join the Advisory Group. In the first year, the Advisory Group met seven times formally, four times informally, developed a website, engaged with CCNA research projects, participated in CCNA Ã¢â‚¬Å“CentralÃ¢â‚¬Â activities and formulated an evaluation plan. Challenges included the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, online meetings, and differing expectations and priorities.

"Mental health-related communication in a virtual community: text mining analysis of a digital exchange platform during the Covid-19 pandemic","Virtual communities played an important role in mental health and well-being during the Covid-19 pandemic by providing access to others and thereby preventing loneliness. The pandemic has accelerated the urge for digital solutions for people with pre-existing mental health problems. So far, it remains unclear how the people concerned communicate with each other and benefit from peer-to-peer support on a moderated digital platform. The aim of the project was to identify and describe the communication patterns and verbal expression of users on the inCLOUsiv platform during the first lockdown in 2020. Discussions in forums and live chats on inCLOUsiv were analysed using text mining, which included frequency, correlation, n-gram and sentiment analyses. The communication behaviour of users on inCLOUsiv was benevolent and supportive; and 72% of the identified sentiments were positive. Users addressed the topics of 'corona', 'anxiety' and 'crisis' and shared coping strategies. The benevolent interaction between users on inCLOUsiv is in line with other virtual communities for Covid-19 and the potential for peer-to-peer support. Users can benefit from each other's experiences and support each other. Virtual communities can be used as an adjuvant to existing therapy, particularly in times of reduced access to local health services.","Golz, Richter, Sprecher, Gurtner","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04080-1","20220627","Covid-19; Mental health; Sentiment analysis; Text mining; Virtual communities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33465,""
"Evaluation of cognitive, mental, and sleep patterns of post-acute COVID-19 patients and their correlation with thorax CT","In this study, we have evaluated the cognitive, mental, and sleep patterns of post-COVID patients 2 months after their hospitalization, and after scoring their hospitalization thorax CTs, we have compared the degree of the lung involvement with cognitive and mental states of the patients. Forty post-COVID patients were included in our study. Patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 and who had thorax CT scan at the admission were included in the study. Thorax CT scans of the patients were scored using chest severity scoring (CT-SS). The Mini-Mental State Examination test (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Hamilton Depression and Hamilton Anxiety scales of all the participants were evaluated by the same person. Early stage cognitive impairment was detected in 15% of post-COVID patients in the MMSE test and mean MMSE test score was 26.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.1. The MoCA test detected cognitive impairment in 55% of the patients, and the mean MoCA score was 19.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.2. Furthermore, all patients showed depressive symptoms in Hamilton Depression Scoring System and 57.5% of the patients showed anxiety symptoms in the Hamilton Anxiety Scoring System. The mean Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index of the patients was 10.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.1, and it was found to be higher than normal. The mean CT-SS scores, which used to evaluate the lung involvement, of the patients were 4.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.6. We did not find any correlation between patients' cognitive tests and CT-SS scores. When these results are taken into consideration, our study has shown that the neuropsychiatric symptoms of the patients who had COVID-19 continued even after 2Ã‚Â months of their illness. Therefore, long-term rehabilitation of these patients, including cognitive education and psychological services, should be continued.","BolattÃƒÂ¼rk, Soylu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13760-022-02001-3","20220625","COVID-19; Cognition; Psychopathology; Tomography","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33466,""
"Cardiopulmonary predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19: What are the findings?","Since 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the leading cause of mortality worldwide. To determine independent predictors of mortality in COVID-19, and identify any associations between pulmonary disease severity and cardiac involvement. Clinical, laboratory, electrocardiography and computed tomography (CT) imaging data were collected from 389 consecutive patients with COVID-19. Patients were divided into alive and deceased groups. Independent predictors of mortality were identified. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed, based on patients having a troponin concentration&gt;99th percentile (cardiac injury) and a CT severity score Ã¢â€°Â¥18. The mortality rate was 29.3%. Cardiac injury (odds ratio [OR] 2.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-4.18; P=0.018), CT score Ã¢â€°Â¥18 (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.15-4.34; P=0.017), localized ST depression (OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.33-10.67; P=0.012), hemiblocks (OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.47-6.48; P=0.003) and history of leukaemia/lymphoma (OR 3.76, 95% CI 1.37-10.29; P=0.010) were identified as independent predictors of mortality. Additionally, patients with cardiac injury and CT score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 18 were identified to have a significantly shorter survival time (mean 14.21 days, 95% CI 10.45-17.98 days) than all other subgroups. There were no associations between CT severity score and electrocardiogram or cardiac injury in our results. Our findings suggest that using CT imaging and electrocardiogram characteristics together can provide a better means of predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19. We identified cardiac injury, CT score Ã¢â€°Â¥18, presence of left or right hemiblocks on initial electrocardiogram, localized ST depression and history of haematological malignancies as independent predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Kavosi, Nayebi Rad, Atef Yekta, Tamartash, Dini, Javadi Nejad, Aghaghazvini, Javinani, Mohammadzadegan, Fotook Kiaei","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acvd.2022.04.008","20220625","Atteinte myocardique; COVID-19; CT score; Cardiac injury; Electrocardiography; Score calcique pulmonaire; Troponin; Ãƒâ€°lectrocardiogramme; Ãƒâ€°lÃƒÂ©vation de la troponine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-28","",33467,""
"Psychological Distress of Healthcare Workers in QuÃƒÂ©bec (Canada) During the Second and the Third Pandemic Waves","We aimed to measure the prevalence of psychological distress among Quebec healthcare workers (HCWs) during the second and third pandemic waves and to assess the effect of psychosocial risk factors (PSRs) on work-related psychological distress among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected (cases) and non-infected (controls) HCWs. A self-administered survey was used to measure validated indicators of psychological distress (K6 scale) and PSR (questions based on Karasek and Siegrist models, value conflicts, and work-life balance). Adjusted robust Poisson models were used to estimate prevalence ratios. Four thousand sixty eight cases and 4152 controls completed the survey.
