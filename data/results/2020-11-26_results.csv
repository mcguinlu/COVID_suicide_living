"METABOLIC CHANGES ON THE BACKGROUND OF ACUTE EXPOSURE TO PARACETAMOL AND EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HEPATOPROTECTIVE DRUGS","Introduction  In modern conditions, caused by the pandemic of a new type of viral infection Covid 19, the use of paracetamol, which has hepatotoxic properties in overdose, has increased  It seems relevant to study metabolic disorders in the liver in acute paracetamol intoxication and evaluate the effectiveness of the timely use of hepatoprotective drugs  The purpose of this study is an experimental assessment of metabolic changes at the early stages of paracetamol exposure and pharmacological correction of toxic liver lesions with oxymethyluracil in comparison with known hepatoprotectors - ademetionine and Mexidol  Material and methods  Acute intragastric administration of paracetamol to laboratory animals was performed, and the corrective effect of the drug oxymethyluracil was studied in comparison with â€œHeptorâ€ and â€œMexidolâ€  Biochemical studies of biomaterial of laboratory animals were conducted  Results  The analysis found the use of known hepatoprotectors and oxymethyluracil after exposure to paracetamol to normalize the biochemical parameters that characterize the functional state of the liver in laboratory animals  Conclusion  Oxymethyluracil, along with known hepatoprotectors, has a protective effect on the liver of laboratory animals under acute exposure to paracetamol comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, the corrective action of â€œHeptorâ€ and â€œMexidolâ€

"Psychological and psychiatric aspects of unusual living conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic","The article examines the psychological and psychiatric aspects of unusual living conditions caused by the pandemic of the novel coronavirus infection COVID-19  The features of the formation of psychopathological disorders in the population during an unfavorable epidemiological situation are analyzed  Five periods of their development are identified, which were characterized by their specific features depending on the influence of various factors (patterns of development of the infectious process, the nature of its information support, organizational measures taken, etc )  In the study of the psychological and pathopsychological characteristics of the response under conditions of an unfavorable epidemiological situation, it was established that their structure and clinical features had, along with the general patterns (characteristic for each of the periods of the development of the epidemic situation), a number of specific features  In the course of studying the psychological and psychiatric aspects of unusual conditions of existence (forced self-isolation), three groups of people were identified, according to their age and the nature of their professional activities  It was established that the psychological forms of response and the features of psychopathological manifestations in the conditions of an unfavorable epidemiological situation caused by COVID-19 were characterized by heterogeneity and polymorphism and were determined both by the course of the epidemic process and by the influence of various biomedical, socio-psychological, informational, and professional household pathogenic factors  Of particular importance was the fact that the degree of influence of these factors on the mental health of people was largely determined by the gradually increasing asteni<U+0441> effect of each of them (the â€œvicious circleâ€), with the formation of a â€œfavorable asthenic soilâ€ that promotes the development of more marked and persistent mental and psychosomatic disorders  <U+0412> <U+0441><U+0442><U+0430><U+0442><U+044C><U+0435>

"UNDERSTANDING THE PERCEPTION AND HIERARCHY OF RISKS: AN ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICO-SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE WITH COVID-19 IN MIND","The purpose of this article is to examine risk perception among some specific stakeholders, including international intergovernmental bodies, private western-based corporates, and among European public opinion surveys  We also address concerns of the Russian Federation and the impact of Chinaâ€™s Belt and Road Initiative  Perception of risks is key to policy decision-making and probably more important than risk assessment  We offer a medico-scientific perspective based on factual evidence drawn mostly from official websites and publications  Our first goal is to understand if sufficient attention is given to human health, disease prevention and control relative to economic and financial considerations  Our second goal is to promote a translational and interprofessional approach to global risk prioritization by cooperation between the medico-scientific community and the financial-economic world  To this end, we examine the benefits for the practice of economic risk assessment of engaging biomedical expertise focused on global environmental health  Maintenance, expansion and sustainability of the human enterprise require health and wellness

"AMBIVALENT PROSPECTION: COVID-RELATED ATTITUDES IN PATIENTS WITH SUBSTANCE DEPENDENCE","The study explored associations between individual characteristics that are considered markers of suicidal and non-suicidal self-destruction (substance dependence;hopelessness, and impulsiveness), prospection (or future thinking), and attitudes to a novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19)  After all inclusion/exclusion criteria were met, the sample (N=102) included two comparison groups: Group 1 comprised male in-patients diagnosed with substance dependence (N=62), and Group 2 consisted of males without this diagnosis (N=40)  Methods: Beck's Hopelessness Scale;Barratt's Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11);self-defining future projections (SDFP) generation task;COVID-19 self-report measure  Results: Groups had almost similar levels of declared COVID-related attitudes, but differed significantly in impulsiveness and hopelessness  SDFPs in Group 1 differed from those in Group 2 as to their phenomenological (shorter time perspective;more negative;less frequently simulated), content (higher frequency of Relationship and lower frequency of Achievement events), and psychological characteristics (lower Competence and Autonomy)  Groups had different patterns of correlations between COVID-related and psychological parameters associated with self-destruction, as well as between all these parameters and SDFP characteristics  We also found evidence in favor of the hypothesis regarding protective function of prospection  Conclusions: We were able to confirm the association between dysfunctional COVID-related attitudes and individual characteristics that are frequently considered to be markers of non-suicidal self-destruction only partially  Nonetheless, the identified dissociation between declared COVID recognition and willingness to observe epidemiological precautions and actual neglect of those may require future study","Tuchina, Olga D.; Agibalova, Tatiana V.; Panov, Alexey S.; Shustov, Dmitri I.; Bryun, Evgeny A.; Buzik, Oleg Zh","https://doi.org/10.17759/cpp.2020280307","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Konsultativnaya Psikhologiya I Psikhoterapiya-Counseling Psychology and Psychotherapy;28(3):100-121, 2020.; Publication details: Konsultativnaya Psikhologiya I Psikhoterapiya-Counseling Psychology and Psychotherapy;28(3):100-121, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-26","",7497,""

"Psychiatric care organization and mental health disorders in people of countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic 2020 (review)","In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, 50 patients and 30 medical personnel were infected in a psychiatric hospital in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China), which required the Ministry of Health of China to urgently analyze the situation and develop a set of measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus and organizing a full and safe psychiatric care  The reasons for this situation could be the lack of reserve beds for psychiatric patients, low awareness of psychiatrists in diagnosing and treating infectious diseases, the separation of the psychiatric care system between the two departments, and the cramped living conditions of patients in psychiatric hospitals  More than 500 psychiatrists from across the country were sent to Wuhan to fill staff  Psychiatric patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 were transferred to temporary psychiatric hospitals organized in gymnasiums and exhibition centers  Severely ill psychiatric patients COVID-19 were transferred to hospital infectious diseases  A single patient routing system was organized, a shift schedule for doctors was introduced  To reduce the burden on public transport, the outpatient unit of psychiatric care was taken to regional hospitals, which had previously dealt only with forensic psychiatry and the control of patients with addictive disorders  Based on the experience of Wuhan, psychiatric communities from different countries proposed a list of practical recommendations designed to reduce the risks of spreading the infection and optimize the work of psychiatric care  Before admission to the general department of a psychiatric hospital, a fourteen-day observation of incoming patients in a separate room is necessary  It is necessary to ensure full remote monitoring of outpatients  It is necessary to increase the awareness of staff about infectious diseases, methods for their diagnosis and treatment  All hospitals should have a reserve bed capacity, which can be used for the rehabilitation and socialization of patients in quiet times  Hospitals must be provided with a sufficient number of tests, drugs, and personal protective equipment  Outpatients need to be fully provided with access to medical and psychotherapeutic therapy using telemedicine technologies to minimize the risk of infection  It is crucial to restructure the appointment of doctors by introducing work on a shift schedule: two weeks in two weeks, which will not only ensure a good rest but also allow doctors to be quarantined after each shift  <U+0412> <U+0443><U+0441><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+044F><U+0445>

"Influenza Vaccination among Underserved African-American Older Adults","Background  Racial disparities in influenza vaccination among underserved minority older adults are a public health problem  Understanding the factors that impact influenza vaccination behaviors among underserved older African-Americans could lead to more effective communication and delivery strategies  Aims  We aimed to investigate rate and factors associated with seasonal influenza vaccination among underserved African-American older adults  We were particularly interested in the roles of demographic factors, socioeconomic status, and continuity and patient satisfaction with medical care, as well as physical and mental health status  Methods  This community-based cross-sectional study recruited 620 African-American older adults residing in South Los Angeles, one of the most under-resources areas within Los Angeles County, with a population of over one million  Bivariate and multiple regression analyses were performed to document independent correlates of influenza vaccination  Results  One out of three underserved African-American older adults aged 65 years and older residing in South Los Angeles had never been vaccinated against the influenza  Only 49% of participants reported being vaccinated within the 12 months prior to the interview  One out of five participants admitted that their health care provider recommended influenza vaccination  However, only 45% followed their providerâ€™s recommendations  Multivariate logistic regression shows that old-old (=75 years), participants who lived alone, those with a lower level of continuity of care and satisfaction with the accessibility, availability, and quality of care, and participants with a higher number of depression symptoms were less likely to be vaccinated  As expected, participants who indicated that their physician had advised them to obtain a flu vaccination were more likely to be vaccinated  Our data shows that only gender was associated with self-report of being advised to have a flu shot  Discussion  One of the most striking aspects of this study is that no association between influenza vaccination and being diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other major chronic condition was detected  Our study confirmed that both continuity of care and satisfaction with access, availability, and quality of medical care are strongly associated with current influenza vaccinations  We documented that participants with a higher number of depression symptoms were less likely to be vaccinated  Conclusion  These findings highlight the role that culturally acceptable and accessible usual source of care van play as a gatekeeper to facilitate and implement flu vaccination among underserved minority older adults  Consistent disparities in influenza vaccine uptake among underserved African-American older adults, coupled with a disproportionate burden of chronic diseases, places them at high risk for undesired outcomes associated with influenza  As depression is more chronic/disabling and is less likely to be treated in African-Americans, there is a need to screen and treat depression as a strategy to enhance preventive care management such as vaccination of underserved African-American older adults  Quantification of associations between lower vaccine uptake and both depression symptoms as well as living alone should enable health professionals target underserved African-American older adults who are isolated and suffer from depression to reduce vaccine-related inequalities","Bazargan, Mohsen, Wisseh, Cheryl, Adinkrah, Edward, Ameli, Hoorolnesa, Santana, Delia, Cobb, Sharon, Assari, Shervin","https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/2160894","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: BioMed Research International;2020, 2020.; Publication details: BioMed Research International;2020, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-26","",7505,""

"The COVID-19 pandemic and global environmental change: Emerging research needs","The outbreak of COVID-19 raised numerous questions on the interactions between the occurrence of new infections, the environment, climate and health. The European Union requested the H2020 HERA project which aims at setting priorities in research on environment, climate and health, to identify relevant research needs regarding Covid-19. The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be related to urbanization, habitat destruction, live animal trade, intensive livestock farming and global travel. The contribution of climate and air pollution requires additional studies. Importantly, the severity of COVID-19 depends on the interactions between the viral infection, ageing and chronic diseases such as metabolic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and obesity which are themselves influenced by environmental stressors. The mechanisms of these interactions deserve additional scrutiny. Both the pandemic and the social response to the disease have elicited an array of behavioural and societal changes that may remain long after the pandemic and that may have long term health effects including on mental health. Recovery plans are currently being discussed or implemented and the environmental and health impacts of those plans are not clearly foreseen.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical education: Medical students' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding electronic learning","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unprecedented disruption in medical education and healthcare systems worldwide. The disease can cause life-threatening conditions and it presents challenges for medical education, as instructors must deliver lectures safely, while ensuring the integrity and continuity of the medical education process. It is therefore important to assess the usability of online learning methods, and to determine their feasibility and adequacy for medical students. We aimed to provide an overview of the situation experienced by medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of medical students regarding electronic medical education. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with medical students from more than 13 medical schools in Libya. A paper-based and online survey was conducted using email and social media. The survey requested demographic and socioeconomic information, as well as information related to medical online learning and electronic devices; medical education status during the COVID-19 pandemic; mental health assessments; and e-learning knowledge, attitudes, and practices. A total of 3,348 valid questionnaires were retrieved. Most respondents (64.7%) disagreed that e-learning could be implemented easily in Libya. While 54.1% of the respondents agreed that interactive discussion is achievable by means of e-learning. However, only 21.1% agreed that e-learning could be used for clinical aspects, as compared with 54.8% who disagreed with this statement and 24% who were neutral. Only 27.7% of the respondents had participated in online medical educational programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, while 65% reported using the internet for participating in study groups and discussions. There is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet. As such, the pandemic will undeniably continue to disrupt medical education and training. As we face the prospect of a second wave of virus transmission, we must take certain measures and make changes to minimize the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on medical education and on the progression of training. The time for change is now, and there should be support and enthusiasm for providing valid solutions to reduce this disruption, such as online training and virtual clinical experience. These measures could then be followed by hands-on experience that is provided in a safe environment.","Alsoufi, Alsuyihili, Msherghi, Elhadi, Atiyah, Ashini, Ashwieb, Ghula, Ben Hasan, Abudabuos, Alameen, Abokhdhir, Anaiba, Nagib, Shuwayyah, Benothman, Arrefae, Alkhwayildi, Alhadi, Zaid, Elhadi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242905","20201125","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-26","",7532,""
"The digital Help to Overcome Problems Effectively (Hope) Programme for people living with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic: Protocol for a feasibility randomised controlled trial","During the COVID-19 lockdown period in the UK that began on 23 March 2020, more than a quarter of a million people with cancer (PWC) reported worsening mental health. Help to Overcome Problems Effectively (Hope) is a self-management programme for PWC, designed to provide support for distress, unmet needs and poor psychological health. In light of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, digital delivery of the Hope programme has become ever more vital for PWC. Previous pre-post studies of the digital Hope programme have found reduced anxiety and depression and improved wellbeing for PWC. However, evaluation of this evidence has been limited by the lack of a control group in these previous studies. We now present a protocol for a feasibility randomised controlled trial of the digital Hope programme for PWC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes will be recruitment, drop-out and adherence rates, estimations of sample and effect size. To detect signals of efficacy, secondary outcomes will be participant mental health and wellbeing. Participants will be recruited by Macmillan Cancer Support (MCS) through their social media networks. The study will employ a feasibility waitlist randomised controlled trial (RCT) design, with PWC being randomised to join the digital Hope Programme immediately (IG) or join a six-week waiting list (WLCG) with a 1:1 allocation ratio. PWC will complete digital measures of depression, anxiety, mental wellbeing and confidence in managing their own health. Online questionnaires will be administered preprogramme and six weeks postprogramme. All people who had requested access to the Hope Programme from Macmillan Cancer Support (N=61) will be invited to participate in the trial. Baseline data collection commenced in April 2020, and the Hope Programme began for the IG in May 2020 and for the WLCG in June 2020. Postprogramme data collection was completed by the end of August 2020. This feasibility study will provide data to inform the design of a future definitive trial. Wider scale provision of the digital Hope Programme has potential to improve the lives of thousands of PWC and reduce the burden on healthcare providers during these unprecedented times.  <AbstractText Label=""INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">DERR1-10.2196/24264.","Wright, Martin, Clyne, Clark, McGillion, Matouskova, Turner","https://doi.org/10.2196/24264","20201125","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-26","",7533,""
"Perceived Care and Well-being of Patients With Cancer and Matched Norm Participants in the COVID-19 Crisis: Results of a Survey of Participants in the Dutch PROFILES Registry","As the resolution of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis is unforeseeable, and/or a second wave of infections may arrive in the fall of 2020, it is important to evaluate patients' perspectives to learn from this. To assess how Dutch patients with cancer perceive cancer treatment and follow-up care (including experiences with telephone and video consultations [TC/VC]) and patients' well-being in comparison with a norm population during the COVID-19 crisis. Cross-sectional study of patients participating in the Dutch Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial Treatment and Long-term Evaluation of Survivorship (PROFILES) registry and a norm population who completed a questionnaire from April to May 2020. Logistic regression analysis assessed factors associated with changes in cancer care (treatment or follow-up appointment postponed/canceled or changed to TC/VC). Differences in quality of life, anxiety/depression, and loneliness between patients and age-matched and sex-matched norm participants were evaluated with regression models. The online questionnaire was completed by 4094 patients (48.6% response), of whom most were male (2493 [60.9%]) and had a mean (SD) age of 63.0 (11.1) years. Of these respondents, 886 (21.7%) patients received treatment; 2725 (55.6%) received follow-up care. Treatment or follow-up appointments were canceled for 390 (10.8%) patients, whereas 160 of 886 (18.1%) in treatment and 234 of 2725 (8.6%) in follow-up had it replaced by a TC/VC. Systemic therapy, active surveillance, or surgery were associated with cancellation of treatment or follow-up appointment. Younger age, female sex, comorbidities, metastasized cancer, being worried about getting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and receiving supportive care were associated with replacement of a consultation with a TC/VC. Patients and norm participants reported that the COVID-19 crisis made them contact their general practitioner (852 of 4068 [20.9%] and 218 of 979 [22.3%]) or medical specialist/nurse (585 of 4068 [14.4%] and 144 of 979 [14.7%]) less quickly when they had physical complaints or concerns. Most patients who had a TC/VC preferred a face-to-face consultation, but 151 of 394 (38.3%) were willing to use a TC/VC again. Patients with cancer were more worried about getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared with the 977 norm participants (917 of 4094 [22.4%] vs 175 of 977 [17.9%]). Quality of life, anxiety, and depression were comparable, but norm participants more often reported loneliness (114 of 977 [11.7%] vs 287 of 4094 [7.0%]) than patients with cancer (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.009). Among patients with cancer in the Netherlands, 1 in 3 reported changes in cancer care in the first weeks of the COVID-19 crisis. Long-term outcomes need to be monitored. The crisis may affect the mental well-being of the general population relatively more than that of patients with cancer.","van de Poll-Franse, de Rooij, Horevoorts, May, Vink, Koopman, van Laarhoven, Besselink, Oerlemans, Husson, Beijer, Ezendam, Raijmakers, Wollersheim, Hoedjes, Siesling, van Eenbergen, Mols","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.6093","20201125","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-26","",7534,""
"PUBG-related suicides during the COVID-19 pandemic: Three cases from Pakistan","The present case report presents the most extreme negative aspects of gaming, namely PUBG-related suicide during the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic in Pakistan. Three suicide cases of extreme gamers occurred within a few days of each other in Lahore, Pakistan. All three were young males aged 16-20 years and their suicides appear to be related to PUBG addiction. It is likely that all three individuals experienced other predisposing factors relating to psychological instability. For vulnerable groups such as adolescents and emerging adults who have psychological predispositions and/or other comorbidities, engrossing videogames which take up many hours a day such as PUBG may pose a risk which in the most extreme cases may be fatal.","Mamun, Ullah, Usman, Griffiths","https://doi.org/10.1111/ppc.12640","20201125","PUBG; Pakistani youths; PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds; self-harm; suicide; video gaming","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-26","",7535,""
"Risk and resilience of well-being in caregivers of young children in response to the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting communities worldwide, with direct effects of illness and mortality, and indirect effects on economies, workplaces, schools/daycares, and social life. However, we understand very little about the effects of this pandemic on families of young children. We used a risk and resilience model to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on mental health in diverse caregivers (N = 286) with children ages birth to 5. We evaluated the hypotheses that (a) pandemic stress and caregiver-reported child psychosocial concerns correlate with caregivers' mental health symptoms and (b) caregivers' pandemic-related self-efficacy and coping mediate these relationships. Caregivers completed surveys in April-May 2020 assessing pandemic stress (e.g., health, finances, and housing), child psychosocial problems, coping strategies, and self-efficacy to manage family needs. Our primary outcome was caregivers' self-reported changes in mental health symptoms since the outbreak. Path analysis revealed that higher pandemic stress was associated with caregivers' reduced confidence in meeting their family's needs related to COVID-19, which correlated with worse caregiver mental health symptoms. Greater child psychosocial problems also predicted worse caregiver mental health symptoms. Findings suggest that pandemic stress, child psychosocial problems, and caregiver self-efficacy are interrelated in their influence on caregivers' mental health. While further research is needed to examine strategies to foster resilience and buffer the pandemic's effects on caregiver mental health, this is a first step in evaluating the psychosocial effects of this pandemic in families of young children. Clinical implications are discussed for a tiered response to mitigate the pandemic's impacts on family functioning.","Davidson, Schmidt, Mallar, Mahmoud, Rothenberg, Hernandez, Berkovits, Jent, Delamater, Natale","https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibaa124","20201125","COVID-19; Caregiver well-being; Coronavirus; Mental health; Resilience; Risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-26","",7536,""
"Technology meets tradition: a hybrid model for implementing digital tools in neuropsychology","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the provision of mental health care services and the ability to provide neuropsychological evaluations. The inability to conduct traditional evaluations has left neuropsychologists with the unprecedented task of determining how to modify existing paradigms while balancing the need to provide services and adhere to safety parameters. The COVID-19 literature suggests clinicians are modifying their evaluations based on the following models: (1) continuing to administer in-person evaluations; (2) discontinuing all evaluations due to issues related to standardization, test security, and patient-specific characteristics; (3) conducting virtual evaluations; and/or (4) adopting a hybrid model incorporating both traditional and technology-based modalities. Given the challenges with models 1-3, along with the modifications in telehealth guidelines and insurance reimbursement rates, neuropsychologists are more poised than ever to solidify the implementation of a hybrid model that lasts beyond COVID-19. We introduce the term Hybrid Neuropsychology, a model for the future of neuropsychological evaluations that includes three Action Items: (1) building a technology-based practice; (2) integrating data science; and (3) engaging with innovators in other fields. Hybrid Neuropsychology will enable clinicians to effectively modernize their practice, improve health care equity, and ensure neuropsychology secures its place in a technology-based world.","Singh, Germine","https://doi.org/10.1080/09540261.2020.1835839","20201125","COVID-19; Neuropsychology; clinical practice; digital technology; teleneuropsychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-26","",7537,""

"COVID-19 and Mental Health/Substance Use Disorders on Reddit: A Longitudinal Study","COVID-19 pandemic has adversely and disproportionately impacted people suffering from mental health issues and substance use problems. This has been exacerbated by social isolation during the pandemic and the social stigma associated with mental health and substance use disorders, making people reluctant to share their struggles and seek help. Due to the anonymity and privacy they provide, social media emerged as a convenient medium for people to share their experiences about their day to day struggles. Reddit is a well-recognized social media platform that provides focused and structured forums called subreddits, that users subscribe to and discuss their experiences with others. Temporal assessment of the topical correlation between social media postings about mental health/substance use and postings about Coronavirus is crucial to better understand public sentiment on the pandemic and its evolving impact, especially related to vulnerable populations. In this study, we conduct a longitudinal topical analysis of postings between subreddits r/depression, r/Anxiety, r/SuicideWatch, and r/Coronavirus, and postings between subreddits r/opiates, r/OpiatesRecovery, r/addiction, and r/Coronavirus from January 2020 - October 2020. Our results show a high topical correlation between postings in r/depression and r/Coronavirus in September 2020. Further, the topical correlation between postings on substance use disorders and Coronavirus fluctuates, showing the highest correlation in August 2020. By monitoring these trends from platforms such as Reddit, epidemiologists, and mental health professionals can gain insights into the challenges faced by communities for targeted interventions.","Alambo, Padhee, Banerjee, Thirunarayan","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+and+Mental+Health/Substance+Use+Disorders+on+Reddit:+A+Longitudinal+Study.","20201125","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-26","",7539,""
"Examining the Impact of COVID-19 on Parental Stress: A Study of Foster Parents","The overarching purpose of this exploratory study was to understand how foster parents' parenting-related stress levels have changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the role of sociodemographic characteristics in exacerbating risk for increased stress. Participants were electronically surveyed about their pre- and post-pandemic parenting-related stress, using an adapted version of the parenting stress scale. Nine-hundred and ninety foster parents (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°990) participated in the study. Overall, foster parents reported significant increases along three specific domains of stress-namely, parenting stress, lack of control, and parental satisfaction (reverse-scored). Analyses for group differences on the post-only scores indicated that foster parents who are not married, or who report poorer mental health (i.e., &quot;good&quot;, versus &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;excellent&quot;) or financial circumstances (i.e., as indicated by not reliably having more income than expenses) may face increased risk for exacerbated stress during this pandemic. Findings from this study indicate that parental stress-levels among foster parents have increased since the start of COVID-19. These findings are not only troubling for foster caregivers, but may also have implications for the youth in their care. Ultimately, results from this study indicate the need to better support foster parents, in general, and during public health crises, specifically.","Miller, Cooley, Mihalec-Adkins","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10560-020-00725-w","20201125","Coronavirus; Covid-19; Foster parents; Pandemic; Parental stress; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-26","",7540,""
"Influence of social isolation caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the psychological characteristics of hospitalized schizophrenia patients: a case-control study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been classified as a pandemic, and mental hospitals located in epidemic centers have been affected. Social isolation is an important and irreplaceable measure to control the spread of the epidemic. In this study, schizophrenic patients who were subjected to social isolation after close contact with COVID-19 patients were used as participants to explore the impact of social isolation on common inflammatory indicators and psychological characteristics. A total of 30 patients with schizophrenia were recruited from Wuhan Mental Health Center. In addition, 30 ordinary schizophrenic patients were matched with the isolation group and were recruited from another branch of Wuhan Mental Health Center as controls. We compared the differences in common inflammatory indicators and psychological characteristics between the isolated group and the control group, and longitudinal comparison of the differences in the above indicators before and after isolation among the isolation group. The Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS) score, Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) score of the isolation group were significantly higher than those of the control group (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00, 0.00, 0.00, respectively).

The study aims to assess the relations between social impact and mental health among adults living in Spain during COVID-19 lockdown measures, taking a gender-based approach into account. We conducted a cross-sectional study among adults living in Spain during the lockdown of COVID-19 with an online survey from 8 April to 28 May 2020. The main variable was mental health measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale for anxiety and the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression. Sex-stratified multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to assess the association between social impact variables, anxiety and depression. A total of 7053 people completed this survey. A total of 31.2% of women and 17.7% of men reported anxiety. Depression levels were reported in 28.5% of women and 16.7% of men. A higher proportion of anxiety and depression levels was found in the younger population (18-35 years), especially in women. Poorer mental health was mainly related to fear of COVID-19 infection, with higher anxiety levels especially in women (adjusted ordinal OR (aOR): 4.23, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 3.68 to 4.87) and worsened economy with higher levels of depression in women (aOR: 1.51, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.24 to 1.84), and perceived inadequate housing to cope with lockdown was especially associated with anxiety in men (aOR: 2.53, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.93 to 3.44).

"Benefits of Sexual Activity on Psychological, Relational, and Sexual Health During the COVID-19 Breakout","The COVID-19-related lockdown has profoundly changed human behaviors and habits, impairing general and psychological well-being. Along with psychosocial consequences, it is possible that sexual behavior was also affected. With the present study, we evaluated the impact of the community-wide containment and consequent social distancing on the intrapsychic, relational, and sexual health through standardized psychometric tools. A case-control study was performed through a web-based survey and comparing subjects of both genders with (group A, NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2,608) and without (group B, NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4,213) sexual activity during lockdown. The Welch and chi-square tests were used to assess differences between groups. Univariate analysis of covariance, logistic regression models, and structural equation modeling were performed to measure influence and mediation effects of sexual activity on psychological, relational, and sexual outcomes. Main outcome measures were General Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression, Dyadic Adjustment Scale for quality of relationship and a set of well-validated sexological inventories (International Index of Erectile Function, Female Sexual Function Index, and male-female versions of the Orgasmometer). Anxiety and depression scores were significantly lower in subjects sexually active during lockdown. Analysis of covariance identified gender, sexual activity, and living without partner during lockdown as significantly affecting anxiety and depression scores (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .0001). Logistic regression models showed that lack of sexual activity during lockdown was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing anxiety and depression (OR: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.12 - 1.57, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001] and 1.34 [95% CI: 1.15 - 1.57, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .0001], respectively). Structural equation modeling evidenced the protective role of sexual activity toward psychological distress (ÃŽÂ²<sub>males</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.18 and ÃŽÂ²<sub>females</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.14), relational health (ÃŽÂ²<sub>males</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.26 and ÃŽÂ²<sub>females</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.29) and sexual health, both directly (ÃŽÂ²<sub>males</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.43 and ÃŽÂ²<sub>females</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.31), and indirectly (ÃŽÂ²<sub>males</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.13 and ÃŽÂ²<sub>females</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.13). The demonstrated mutual influence of sexual health on psychological and relational health could direct the clinical community toward a reinterpretation of the relationship among these factors. Based on a large number of subjects and well-validated psychometric tools, this study elucidated the protective role of sexual activity for psychological distress, as well for relational and sexual health. Main limitations were the web-based characteristics of the protocol and the retrospective nature of prelockdown data on psychorelational and sexual health of subjects recruited. COVID-19 lockdown dramatically impacted on psychological, relational, and sexual health of the population. In this scenario, sexual activity played a protective effect, in both genders, on the quarantine-related plague of anxiety and mood disorders. Mollaioli D, Sansone A, Ciocca G, etÃ‚Â al.

"The Early Impact of the Covid-19 Emergency on Mental Health Workers: A Survey in Lombardy, Italy","Lombardy was the epicenter of the Covid-19 outbreak in Italy, and in March 2020 the rapid escalation in cases prompted the Italian Government to decree a mandatory lockdown and to introduce safety practices in mental health services. The general objective of the study is to evaluate the early impact of the Covid-19 emergency and quarantine on the well-being and work practices of mental health service personnel and professionals. Data were collected through an online survey of workers and professionals working with people with mental health problems in Lombardy in several outpatient and inpatient services. Their socio-demographic characteristics, professional background, description of working conditions during lockdown and psychological distress levels were collected. All analyses were performed on a sample of 241. Approximately, 31% of the participants obtained a severe score in at least one of the burnout dimensions, 11.6% showed moderate or severe levels of anxiety, and 6.6% had a moderate or severe level of depression.
