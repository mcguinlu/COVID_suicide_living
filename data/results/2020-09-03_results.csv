0 01)  The rates of high and very high suicide risk, severe sleep problems, severe or extremely severe anxiety, and severe or extremely severe depression were also significantly higher in the case group (9 57%, 12 23%, 4 79% and 7 98%, respectively) than in the control group (3 79%, 1 80%, 0 80% and 1 80%, respectively;P &lt; 0 01)  <U+2461>The total scores of suicide risk, PSQI, SAS, and SDS and the factor scores of PSQI were all higher in the case group than in the control group (P &lt; 0 01)  <U+2462>The total scores of suicide risk, SAS, SDS, PSQI and the factor scores of PSQI were all positively correlated in COVID-19 patients, and the total score of suicide risk was also positively correlated with age  <U+2463>Sleep problems, anxiety, depression and age entered the regression equation with suicide risk as dependent variables  Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 have severe sleep and psychological problems, which contribute to a high suicide risk of the patients  Age, anxiety, depression and poor sleep quality were all risk factors for a high suicide risk in COVID-19 patients, and among them poor sleep quality was the most significant risk factor;

"Ambient Air Pollution Increases the Risk of Cerebrovascular and Neuropsychiatric Disorders through Induction of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress","Exposure to ambient air pollution is a well-established determinant of health and disease. The Lancet Commission on pollution and health concludes that air pollution is the leading environmental cause of global disease and premature death. Indeed, there is a growing body of evidence that links air pollution not only to adverse cardiorespiratory effects but also to increased risk of cerebrovascular and neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite being a relatively new area of investigation, overall, there is mounting recent evidence showing that exposure to multiple air pollutants, in particular to fine particles, may affect the central nervous system (CNS) and brain health, thereby contributing to increased risk of stroke, dementia, Parkinson's disease, cognitive dysfunction, neurodevelopmental disorders, depression and other related conditions. The underlying molecular mechanisms of susceptibility and disease remain largely elusive. However, emerging evidence suggests inflammation and oxidative stress to be crucial factors in the pathogenesis of air pollution-induced disorders, driven by the enhanced production of proinflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species in response to exposure to various air pollutants. From a public health perspective, mitigation measures are urgent to reduce the burden of disease and premature mortality from ambient air pollution.","Hahad, Omar; Lelieveld, Jos; Birklein, Frank; Lieb, Klaus; Daiber, Andreas; MÃ¼nzel, Thomas","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms21124306","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Mol Sci;21(12)2020 Jun 17.; Publication details: Int J Mol Sci;21(12)2020 Jun 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-03","",4341,""

"Healthcare professionals' perceptions of critical care resource availability and factors associated with mental well-being during COVID-19: Results from a US survey","Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on intensive care unit (ICU) providers' perceptions of resource availability and evaluating factors associated with emotional distress/burnout can inform interventions to promote provider well-being. Between April 23-May 7, 2020, we electronically administered a survey to physicians, nurses, respiratory therapist (RTs) and advanced practice providers (APPs) caring for COVID-19 patients in the US. We conducted multivariate regression to assess associations between concerns, reported lack of resources and three outcomes: emotional distress/burnout (primary outcome), and two secondary outcomes: 1) fear that hospital is unable to keep providers safe, and 2) concern about transmitting COVID-19 to family/community. We included 1,651 respondents from all 50 states; 47% nurses, 25% physicians, 17% RTs, 11% APPS. Shortages of intensivists and ICU nurses were reported by 12% and 28% of providers, respectively. The largest supply restrictions reported were for powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs); (56% reporting restricted availability). Provider concerns included worries about transmitting COVID-19 to family/community (66%), emotional distress/burnout (58%), and insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) (40%). After adjustment, emotional distress/burnout was significantly associated with insufficient PPE access (aRR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.32 - 1.55), stigma from community (aRR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.24 - 1.41), and poor communication with supervisors (aRR:1.13, 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.21). Insufficient PPE access was the strongest predictor of feeling that the hospital is unable to keep providers safe and worries about transmitting infection to families/communities. Addressing insufficient PPE access, poor communication from supervisors, and community stigma may improve provider mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sharma, Creutzfeldt, Lewis, Patel, Hartog, Jannotta, Blissitt, Kross, Kassebaum, Greer, Curtis, Wahlster","https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1311","20200902","COVID-19; burnout; critical care resources; healthcare provider; mental health; personal protective equipment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-03","",4346,""
"Fertility patients under COVID-19: Attitudes, Perceptions, and Psychological Reactions","What are the perceptions of infertility patients and the factors correlating with their psychological distress, following suspension of fertility treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic? Most patients preferred to resume treatment given the chance regardless of background characteristics; higher self-mastery and greater perceived social support were associated with lower distress, while feeling helpless was associated with higher distress. Infertility diagnosis and treatment frequently result in significant psychological distress. Recently published data has shown that clinic closure during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a sharp increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression among infertile patients undergoing IVF and was perceived as an uncontrollable and stressful event. Personal resources play an important protective role in times of crisis, helping reduce levels of distress. This cross-sectional questionnaire study included patients whose fertility treatment was suspended following the COVID-19 pandemic, in a tertiary hospital. The survey was delivered to 297 patients within 12 days at the beginning of April 2020. The self-administered questionnaire included items addressing: 1. patients' demographic characteristics, 2. anxiety related to COVID-19 infection risk and level of social support, 3. patients' perceptions of the new guidelines and description of subsequently related emotions, and 4. two validated scales assessing levels of emotional distress and self-mastery. Multivariate analysis was conducted to assess factors alleviating or increasing emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were 168 patients who completed the survey, giving a response rate of 57%. Study variables in the regression model explained 38.9% of the variance in psychological distress experienced by patients during treatment suspension. None of the background characteristics (e.g. age, marital status, parity, economic level or duration of treatments) had a significant contribution. Feeling helpless following the suspension of treatments was associated with higher distress (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Higher self-mastery and greater perceived social support were associated with lower distress (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Despite the ministry of health's decision, 72% of patients wished to resume treatment at the time of survey. This was a cross-sectional study, thus information about patients' characteristics prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was not available. The length and implications of this pandemic are unknown. Therefore, the ability to draw conclusions about the psychological consequences of the crisis is limited at this point of time. Personal resources play an important protective role in times of crisis, helping to reduce levels of distress. Study Ã¯Â¬Ândings suggest that attention should be paid to strengthening and empowering patients' personal resources together with directly confronting and containing feelings of helplessness. In line with the ESHRE guidelines, especially at this time of high levels of distress, it is imperative to offer emotional support to reduce stress and concerns. Furthermore, as the pandemic is stabilising, resumption of treatment should be considered as soon as appropriate according to local conditions. This study was funded by the IVF unit of the Shamir Medical Center. All authors declare no conflicts of interest.","Ben-Kimhy, Youngster, Medina-Artom, Avraham, Gat, Haham, Hourvitz, Kedem","https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/deaa248","20200902","COVID-19; IVF; fertility treatments; infertility; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-03","",4347,""
"COVID-19 News Exposure as a Modifiable Risk Factor of Psychological Symptoms: Can an Official WhatsApp Channel Help?","In a global pandemic, digital technology offers innovative methods to disseminate public health messages. As an example, the messenger application WhatsApp was adopted by both the World Health Organization and government agencies to provide updates on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). During a time when rumours and excessive news threaten psychological well-being, these services allow for rapid transmission of information and may boost resilience. In this study, we sought to: (1) assess well-being during the pandemic; (2) replicate prior findings linking exposure to COVID-19 news with psychological distress; and (3) examine whether subscription to an official WhatsApp channel can mitigate this risk. Across 8 weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak (7 March - 21 April 2020), we conducted a survey of 1145 adults in Singapore. As the primary outcome measure, participants completed the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). As predictor variables, participants also answered questions pertaining to: (1) their exposure to COVID-19 news; (2) their use of the Singapore government's WhatsApp channel; and (3) their demographics. Within the sample, 7.9% of participants had severe or extremely severe symptoms on at least one DASS-21 subscale. Depression scores were associated with increased duration spent receiving COVID-19 updates, whereas use of the official WhatsApp channel emerged as a protective factor (b = -.07, t(863) = -2.04, P = 0.04). Similarly, increased anxiety scores were associated with increased exposure to both updates and rumours, but this risk was mitigated by trust in the government's WhatsApp messages (b = -.05, t(863) = -2.13, P = 0.03). Finally, although stress symptoms increased with the duration spent receiving updates, these symptoms were not significantly related to WhatsApp use. Our findings suggest that messenger apps may be an effective medium to disseminate pandemic-related information, allowing official agencies to reach a broad sector of the population rapidly. In turn, this use may promote public well-being amidst an 'infodemic'.

"Prevalence of Depression Symptoms in US Adults Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the policies to contain it have been a near ubiquitous exposure in the US with unknown effects on depression symptoms. To estimate the prevalence of and risk factors associated with depression symptoms among US adults during vs before the COVID-19 pandemic. This nationally representative survey study used 2 population-based surveys of US adults aged 18 or older. During COVID-19, estimates were derived from the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study, conducted from March 31, 2020, to April 13, 2020. Before COVID-19 estimates were derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted from 2017 to 2018. Data were analyzed from April 15 to 20, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic and outcomes associated with the measures to mitigate it. Depression symptoms, defined using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 cutoff of 10 or higher. Categories of depression symptoms were defined as none (score, 0-4), mild (score, 5-9), moderate (score, 10-14), moderately severe (score, 15-19), and severe (score, Ã¢â€°Â¥20). A total of 1470 participants completed the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being survey (completion rate, 64.3%), and after removing those with missing data, the final during-COVID-19 sample included 1441 participants (619 participants [43.0%] aged 18-39 years; 723 [50.2%] men; 933 [64.7%] non-Hispanic White). The pre-COVID-19 sample included 5065 participants (1704 participants [37.8%] aged 18-39 years; 2588 [51.4%] women; 1790 [62.9%] non-Hispanic White). Depression symptom prevalence was higher in every category during COVID-19 compared with before (mild: 24.6% [95% CI, 21.8%-27.7%] vs 16.2% [95% CI, 15.1%-17.4%]; moderate: 14.8% [95% CI, 12.6%-17.4%] vs 5.7% [95% CI, 4.8%-6.9%]; moderately severe: 7.9% [95% CI, 6.3%-9.8%] vs 2.1% [95% CI, 1.6%-2.8%]; severe: 5.1% [95% CI, 3.8%-6.9%] vs 0.7% [95% CI, 0.5%-0.9%]). Higher risk of depression symptoms during COVID-19 was associated with having lower income (odds ratio, 2.37 [95% CI, 1.26-4.43]), having less than $5000 in savings (odds ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.02-2.26]), and exposure to more stressors (odds ratio, 3.05 [95% CI, 1.95-4.77]). These findings suggest that prevalence of depression symptoms in the US was more than 3-fold higher during COVID-19 compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with lower social resources, lower economic resources, and greater exposure to stressors (eg, job loss) reported a greater burden of depression symptoms. Post-COVID-19 plans should account for the probable increase in mental illness to come, particularly among at-risk populations.","Ettman, Abdalla, Cohen, Sampson, Vivier, Galea","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.19686","20200902","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-03","",4349,""

Information about the pandemic is constant in the media. Moreover, social distancing has been adopted in Brazil to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which may have economic and psychosocial consequences. This study aimed to verify the factors associated with indicators of mental disorders symptoms in residents of Rio Grande do Sul during the initial period of the social distancing policy. The study was approved by CONEP. There were 799 participants, aged between 18 and 75 years (M = 36.56; SD = 12.88); 82.7% were women, who answered a sociodemographic questionnaire of social distancing and the Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20). The results indicated that having decreased income in the period, being part of the risk group and being more exposed to information about deaths and infected, are factors that can significantly harm mental health in this pandemic period. Investigating social determinants that contribute to greater vulnerability to the mental illness of the population is vital in the field of collective health for the planning of public actions and policies.","Duarte, Santo, Lima, Giordani, Trentini","https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232020259.16472020","20200902","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-03","",4352,""
"The pandemic in prison: interventions and overisolation","Prisional health is, in its essence, public health. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a great threat to the world and has shown that preventing the disease escalation in prisons integrates the novel corona virus clash in society in general. Up to this moment, the most effective known measure to curb the disease spread is social isolation. Nevertheless, in penal institutions, often overcrowded, social isolation becomes difficult to carry out and, when it happens, it takes the enclosed population to overisolation, with consequences to their mental health. Besides, prisoners suffer with clogged up environment, lack of materials for personal hygiene, poor basic sanitary conditions and difficulties in accessing health services. This paper deals with a narrative review on the pandemic effects in prisons and how government and civil society have organized themselves in order to reduce the disease consequences at those places. The text has been divided into three sections: the first with literature review on the current health theme; the second discusses how different countries have been dealing with the prison situation in the pandemic context, and, the last part focuses on how the Brazilian Penal System has reacted to the new disease.","Carvalho, Santos, Santos","https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232020259.15682020","20200902","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-03","",4353,""

As a result of the rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths, population and health personnel, have experienced psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and stress. Although scientific information on COVID-19 is constantly increasing, it mainly focuses on genetic, epidemiological aspects, and public health measures, leaving aside possible effects on mental health. In order to summarize the current evidence, we present a narrative review of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. So far, the presence of anxiety, depression, and stress has been reported mostly in general population. Nonetheless, mental health issues have also been reported in health care workers, especially among female professionals, nurses, and those who work directly with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. In efforts to reduce the spread of the disease, attention should be paid to the diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues. We believe that addressing them adequately will empower Peru to contain and eradicate COVID-19.

"Adolescents' health in times of COVID-19: a scoping review","COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus), emerged in China in December 2019 and spread quickly throughout the world. In this scenario, the current study aimed to identify the impact or effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' health. This is a scoping literature review based on the following databases: Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SciELO, and PUBCOVID19. The study adopted the stages proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute for scoping reviews, and the question orienting the procedures consisted of the acronym PCC (population; concept; context). Eleven articles were included in the review. Clinically, adolescents present the same COVID-19 symptoms as adults. The pandemic and the health measures taken to control transmission were found to be associated with mental health problems in adolescents. Specifically, adolescents have a negative experience with social distancing measures and closing of schools. These measures can also favor situations of violence or aggressive behaviors in the home environment. Healthcare services that treat the adolescent population had to reorient their practices, adopting a virtual model to replace face-to-face care, and even research projects involving adolescence had to be rethought. This scoping review addressed an emerging theme in relation to a population that has received little attention in studies on COVID-19. The results suggest that the pandemic can be considered a determinant that affects different dimensions of adolescents' lives.","Oliveira, Silva, Andrade, Micheli, Carlos, Silva","https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00150020","20200902","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-03","",4355,""

"Impact of COVID-19 and other pandemics and epidemics on people with pre-existing mental disorders: a systematic review protocol and suggestions for clinical care","The current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in high rates of infection and death, as well as widespread social disruption and a reduction in access to healthcare services and support. There is growing concern over how the pandemic, as well as measures put in place to curb the pandemic, will impact people with mental disorders. We aim to study the effect of pandemics and epidemics on mental health outcomes for people with premorbid mental disorders. With our predefined search strategy, we will search five databases for studies reporting on mental health outcomes in people with pre-existing mental disorders during pandemic and epidemic settings. Search dates are planned as follows: 5 May 2020 and 23 July 2020. The following databases will be searched: MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, MedRxiv and EMBASE. Data will be screened and extracted in duplicate by two independent reviewers. Studies involving non-clinical populations or patients diagnosed with a mental disorder <i>during</i> a pandemic/epidemic will be excluded. We will include data collected from all pandemics and epidemics throughout history, including the present COVID-19 pandemic. If possible, study findings will be combined in meta-analyses, and subgroup analyses will be performed. We hope that this review will shed light on the impact of pandemics and epidemics on those with pre-existing mental disorders. Knowledge generated may inform future intervention studies as well as healthcare policies. Given the potential implications of the current pandemic measures (ie, disruption of healthcare services) on mental health, we will also compile a list of existing mental health resources.

Medical students played a wide variety of clinical and non-clinical roles including education and logistics, although medical assistance was the most commonly reported role. Challenges included a lack of preparedness and negative mental health impacts. 91.7% of included articles about willingness found medical students were more willing to be involved than not. This review shows medical students are capable and willing to be involved in global health emergencies. However, there should be clear protocols for the roles that they play, taking into account the appropriateness. As a rapid review, there were study limitations and more research is required regarding the impact of these roles on medical students and the system.","Martin, Blom, Whyatt, Shaunak, Viva, Banerjee","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.315","20200902","COVID-19; health emergencies; medical student; pandemic; rapid systematic review; role","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-03","",4362,""
"Mental health implications of COVID-19 pandemic and its response in India","Mental health concerns and treatment usually take a backseat when the limited resources are geared for pandemic containment. In this global humanitarian crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health issues have been reported from all over the world. In this study, we attempt to review the prevailing mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic through global experiences, and reactive strategies established in mental health care with special reference to the Indian context. By performing a rapid synthesis of available evidence, we aim to propose a conceptual and recommendation framework for mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. A search of the PubMed electronic database and google scholar were undertaken using the search terms 'novel coronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'nCoV', SARS-CoV-2, 'mental health', 'psychiatry', 'psychology', 'anxiety', 'depression' and 'stress' in various permutations and combinations. Published journals, magazines and newspaper articles, official webpages and independent websites of various institutions and non-government organizations, verified social media portals were compiled. The major mental health issues reported were stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, denial, anger and fear. Children and older people, frontline workers, people with existing mental health illnesses were among the vulnerable in this context. COVID-19 related suicides have also been increasingly common. Globally, measures have been taken to address mental health issues through the use of guidelines and intervention strategies. The role of social media has also been immense in this context. State-specific intervention strategies, telepsychiatry consultations, toll free number specific for psychological and behavioral issues have been issued by the Government of India. Keeping a positive approach, developing vulnerable-group-specific need-based interventions with proper risk communication strategies and keeping at par with the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 would be instrumental in guiding the planning and prioritization of mental health care resources to serve the most vulnerable.","Roy, Singh, Mishra, Chinnadurai, Mitra, Bakshi","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020950769","20200902","COVID-19; Mental health; anxiety; depression; pandemic; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-03","",4363,""
"Determinants of the Lifestyle Changes during COVID-19 Pandemic in the Residents of Northern Italy","The confinement recommended during COVID-19 pandemic could affect behavior and health. We conducted a self-reported survey in northern Italy to observe the lockdown effects on lifestyle changes and to assess their determinants. Prevalence Odds Ratio and Prevalence Risk Ratio were determined. 490 adults (84% female) completed the survey: 13% and 43% reported improved and unchanged sleep quality, respectively, while 43% had insomnia symptoms. Among the 272 active subjects in pre-lockdown, 14% continued habitual exercising, 18% increased it and 68% reduced it; 27% of sedentary subjects started physical exercise; 34% reported an improvement in diet quality; 42% increased food intake and 13% decreased it; and 38% of the smokers increased cigarette consumption. Age and the pre-lockdown habit of regular physical exercising were the mainly determinants of lifestyle changes whereas BMI, gender, and the presence of chronic diseases did not. Living with other people increased the likelihood of increasing the food intake (<i>p</i> = 0.002). More than a third of people were able to positively reorganize their lives during the forced home confinement. It is worth to disseminate information to preserve a healthy lifestyle even when confined at home.","Cancello, Soranna, Zambra, Zambon, Invitti","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176287","20200902","COVID-19; diet; food habits; health; lifestyle; lockdown; physical activity; sleep; smoking; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-03","",4364,""
"Characterization of Home Working Population during COVID-19 Emergency: A Cross-Sectional Analysis","Evidence about the characterization of home workers in terms of both work-related outcomes and health issues is lacking. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine the impact of home working on perceived job productivity and satisfaction, work-related stress, and musculoskeletal (MSK) issues. We included 51 mobile workers, collecting data about demographic characteristics, working experience, job productivity, and stress. Job satisfaction was assessed through the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), while MSK pain was investigated by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ). Moreover, a home workplace analysis had to be carried out according to current Italian regulations. Participants declared that they were less productive (39.2%) but less stressed (39.2%) and equally satisfied (51%) compared to the time of office working. Regarding MSK disorders, low back pain (LBP) was referred by 41.2% of home workers and neck pain by 23.5% of them. Neck pain worsened in 50% of home workers, while LBP did not exacerbate in 47.6% of cases. Home workers with MSK pain reported a lower job satisfaction. Depending on our data, the home environment seems to be not adequate in the mobile worker population, with an increased risk for mental health and MSK problems, particularly affecting the spine. Addressing these issues can significantly reduce risks for health, thus, improving job productivity and satisfaction and reducing cost.","Moretti, Menna, Aulicino, Paoletta, Liguori, Iolascon","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176284","20200902","COVID-19; home working; job satisfaction; low back pain; musculoskeletal pain; neck pain; occupational stress; smart working; work performance; workplace","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-03","",4365,""
"Health Behavior Changes During COVID-19 Pandemic and Subsequent &quot;Stay-at-Home&quot; Orders","The COVID-19 pandemic, and resultant &quot;Stay-at-Home&quot; orders, may have impacted adults' positive health behaviors (sleep, physical activity) and negative health behaviors (alcohol consumption, drug use, and tobacco use). The purpose of this study was to investigate how these health behaviors changed (increased/improved or decreased/worsened) at the early stages of the pandemic, what participant characteristics were associated with health behavior changes, and why these behavioral changes may have occurred. A convenience sample of 1809 adults residing in the United States completed a 15-min self-report questionnaire in April and May 2020. Multinomial logistic regressions and descriptive statistics were used to evaluate how, for whom, and why these health behaviors changed. Participants were primarily female (67.4%), aged 35-49 years (39.8%), college graduates (83.3%), non-tobacco users (74.7%), and had previously used marijuana (48.6%). Overall, participants primarily reported a decrease in physical activity, while sleep and all of the negative health behaviors remained the same. Changes in negative health behaviors were related (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) to sex, age, parental status, educational status, job status, BMI, and depression scores. Changes in positive health behaviors were related (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) to sex, parental status, job status, and depression scores. Having more time available during the pandemic was the most commonly cited reason for changing health behaviors (negative and positive). Public health efforts should address the potential for long-term health consequences due to behavior change during COVID-19.","Knell, Robertson, Dooley, Burford, Mendez","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176268","20200902","COVID-19; alcohol use; health behaviors; marijuana use; physical activity; sleep; tobacco use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-03","",4366,""

"Well-being of Parents and Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National Survey","As the coronavirus disease pandemic spread across the United States and protective measures to mitigate its impact were enacted, parents and children experienced widespread disruptions in daily life. Our objective with this national survey was to determine how the pandemic and mitigation efforts affected the physical and emotional well-being of parents and children in the United States through early June 2020. In June 2020, we conducted a national survey of parents with children age &lt;18 to measure changes in health status, insurance status, food security, use of public food assistance resources, child care, and use of health care services since the pandemic began. Since March 2020, 27% of parents reported worsening mental health for themselves, and 14% reported worsening behavioral health for their children. The proportion of families with moderate or severe food insecurity increased from 6% before March 2020 to 8% after, employer-sponsored insurance coverage of children decreased from 63% to 60%, and 24% of parents reported a loss of regular child care. Worsening mental health for parents occurred alongside worsening behavioral health for children in nearly 1 in 10 families, among whom 48% reported loss of regular child care, 16% reported change in insurance status, and 11% reported worsening food security. The coronavirus disease pandemic has had a substantial tandem impact on parents and children in the United States. As policy makers consider additional measures to mitigate the health and economic effects of the pandemic, they should consider the unique needs of families with children.","Patrick, Henkhaus, Zickafoose, Lovell, Halvorson, Loch, Letterie, Davis","https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-016824","20200902","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-03","",4369,""

"Hughes et al (2020) 'I feel cancer patients have been neglected'","Purpose This study aimed to explore the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic including Government-enforced restrictions, on women diagnosed with oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer in the UK using a mixed-methods approach. Methods Depression (PHQ-2), anxiety (GAD-7), optimism (LOT-R) and perceived risk of recurrence (IPQ-BCS) were measured pre-COVID-19 outbreak and perceived vulnerability, severity and impact of COVID-19 were measured during the UK lockdown period of 23rd March-13th May 2020. Free text responses provided qualitative data. Descriptive statistics regarding COVID-19-specific behaviours and correlations between pre-COVID-19 psychosocial factors and COVID-19 outcomes were conducted. Thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative responses. Quantitative and qualitative data are presented together. Results 253 responses were received during the UK lockdown period. Twenty-six percent of the sample were shielding and 15% felt at higher risk of contracting COVID-19. Higher pre-COVID-19 depression and anxiety and lower optimism were associated with higher perceived vulnerability to and severity of COVID-19 and lower confidence in protecting oneself. There were positive and negative effects of lockdown on exercise and relationships and 42% reported negative impacts on anxiety. Participants reported fear of COVID-19, difficulties with adapting to isolation and using technology, and anxiety about the impact of delayed cancer treatment on their cancer recovery and recurrence. Conclusions Negative effects of lockdown, particularly for delayed cancer treatment should be considered to manage ongoing anxiety. Screening of state depression and anxiety is suggested for intervention prioritisation, but more longitudinal research is needed to understand the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on breast cancer survivors.","Lyndsay Hughes et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615C-857-651","20200901","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; qualitative; covid-19; breast cancer; mixed-methods; anxiety; depression; isolation","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-03","",4372,""
"Deterioration of mental health despite successful control of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea","South Korea was able to successfully control the spread of COVID-19 without nationwide lockdowns or drastic social distancing efforts, but pandemic-related psychological outcome of the general population remains unknown. We aimed to document the mental health outcome in relation to social factors during the pandemic. Between March and June 2020, 400 South Korean residents participated in an online study of depression, anxiety, stress, psychosis-risk and loneliness, as well as indices of social network, physical health and demographics. Clinical levels of depression, anxiety or stress were reported by 45% of the respondents, and psychosis-risk was present in 12.8%; a drastic increase above the base rate prior to the pandemic. Subjective feelings of loneliness, but not the size of the social network accounted for poor mental health. Women were especially at increased risk for mental health problems. Thus, despite effective mitigation of the pandemic, there was a striking deterioration of mental health. As the psychological burden of the continuing pandemic accrues, the probability of an impending mental health crisis is increasing, especially in countries with greater infection and death rates than South Korea. Comprehensive efforts to address the psychological aftermath of the pandemic are urgently needed.","Hyeon-Seung Lee et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46091-F8D-4FA","20200830","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotic Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; loneliness; korea; stress; depression; anxiety; social isolation; psychosis; covid-19; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-03","",4373,""
"Escaping to nature in pandemic: a natural experiment of COVID-19 in Asian cities","Cities implemented social distancing measures to cope with COVID-19, which kept people away from nature. A steep drop in the greenspace use was observed in western cities. Surprisingly, news revealed a surging greenspace use in Asian cities. In this study, we used COVID-19 outbreak stages as natural experiments to investigate individual behavioural changes of greenspace use before and during the pandemic. Our case cities are Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul. We extracted panel data which consisted of longitudinal posts of 100, 232 users, being posted in 1,185 greenspaces in the four Asian cities. Our statistical models found a 5.3% increase in the odds of people using greenspaces for every 100 additional weekly new cases. The analyses also revealed peopleâ€™s preference in larger, nature parks that are close to city centres. Due to the established physical and mental health benefits of greenspaces, people have been escaping to nature to cope with the pandemic in Asian cities.","Yi Lu et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-C31-DFA","20200903","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-03","",4374,""
