"Exploring the impact of shielding advice on the health and wellbeing of individuals identified as extremely vulnerable and advised to shield in Southwest England amid the COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed-methods evaluation","Objective: Explore the impact and responses to public health advice on the health and wellbeing of individuals identified as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) and advised to shield (not leave home for 12 weeks at start of the pandemic) in Southwest England during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Design: Mixed-methods study; structured survey and follow-up semi-structured interviews. Setting: Communities served by Bristol, North Somerset & South Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group. Participants: 204 people (57% female, 54% >69 years, 94% White British, 64% retired) in Southwest England identified as CEV and were advised to shield completed the survey. Thirteen survey respondents participated in follow-up interviews (53% female, 40% >69years, 100% White British, 61% retired). Results: Receipt of official communication from NHS England or General Practitioner (GP) was considered by participants as the legitimate start of shielding. 80% of survey responders felt they received all relevant advice needed to shield, yet interviewees criticised the timing of advice and often sought supplementary information. Shielding behaviours were nuanced, adapted to suit personal circumstances, and waned over time. Few interviewees received community support, although food boxes and informal social support were obtained by some. Worrying about COVID-19 was common for survey responders (90%). Since shielding had begun, physical and mental health reportedly worsened for 35% and 42% of survey responders respectively. 21% of survey responders scored 10 or more on the PHQ-9 questionnaire indicating possible depression and 15% scored 10 or more on the GAD-7 questionnaire indicating possible anxiety. Conclusions: This research highlights the difficulties in providing generic messaging that is applicable and appropriate given the diversity of individuals identified as CEV and the importance of sharing tailored and timely advice to inform shielding decisions. Providing messages that reinforce self-determined action and assistance from support services could reduce the negative impact of shielding on mental health and feelings of social isolation.","Gemma Lasseter; Polly Compston; Charlotte Robin; Helen Lambert; Matthew Hickman; Sarah Denford; Rosy Reynolds; Juan Zhang; Shenghan Cai; Tingting Zhang; Louise E.

"Prevalence and factors associated with mental health problems in Saudi general population during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","This systematic review and meta-analysis generates evidence of the prevalence and associated factors of common mental disorders (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress) related to the pandemic among the Saudi general population. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was performed in the respective databases (e.g., PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science), from 22 July to 17 August 2021, and identified a total of 220 articles. Adhering to the inclusion criteria (i.e., original research concerning the prevalence and/or associated factors of depression and/or anxiety and/or stress disorders among the general Saudi population, published in English peer-reviewed journals), 15 studies were included in this review which consisted of a total of 262,656 participants. The overall prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22% to 38%, I<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 99.58%), 20% (95% CI: 16% to 24%, I<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 99.32%), and 29% (95% CI: 11% to 47%, I<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 99.76%), respectively. Risk factors of mental health problems were found to be female sex, younger age group, single/divorced marital status, lower education, lower income, non-Saudis, unemployment status, students, being in a small family and living with elderly of the sociodemographic factors. Smokers, less physical activities, lower resilience, reduced immune status, chronic health problems, and psychiatric illness history were associated with a higher degree of mental health problems. In addition, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related risk factors of mental illness included lack of knowledge, fear, worry and concern, family member or friends' infection or death, lockdown restrictions, quarantine, confirmed or suspected of COVID-19 infection, and even pandemic effects. In conclusion, appropriate mental health preventive approaches for the Saudi general people are highly needed, where this review can be worthy of help by providing in detailed information to the respective authorities.","Alzahrani, Alshahrani, Abu Sabah, Zarbah, Abu Sabah, Mamun","https://doi.org/10.1002/pchj.516","20220105","COVID-19; Saudi Arabia; anxiety; depression; mental disorders; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-06","",24581,""

"""One Degree of Separation"": A Mixed-Methods Evaluation of Canadian Mental Health Care User and Provider Experiences With Remote Care During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to a shift from in-person to remote mental health care. While remote care methods have long existed, their widespread use is unprecedented. There is little research about mental health care user and provider experiences with this transition, and no published studies to date have compared satisfaction between these groups. Canadian mental health care users (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°332) and providers (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°107) completed an online self-report survey from October 2020 to February 2021 hosted by the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression. Using a mixed-methods approach, participants were asked about their use of remote care, including satisfaction, barriers to use, helpful and unhelpful factors, and suggestions for improvement. Overall, 59% to 63% of health care users and 59% of health care providers were satisfied with remote care. Users reported the greatest satisfaction with the convenience of remote care, while providers were most satisfied with the speed of provision of care; all groups were least satisfied with therapeutic rapport. Health care providers were less satisfied with the user-friendliness of remote care (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) than users, while health care users were less satisfied than providers with continuity of care (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The use of a video-based platform was associated with remote care satisfaction among health care users (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02), and qualitative responses support the importance of visual cues in maintaining therapeutic rapport remotely. The majority of users (55%) and providers (87%) reported a likelihood of using remote care after the pandemic. Remote mental health care is generally accepted by both users and providers, and the majority would consider using remote care following the pandemic. Suggestions for improvement include greater use of video, increased attention to body language and eye contact, consistency with in-person care, as well as increased provider training and administrative support.","Ceniti, Abdelmoemin, Ho, Kang, Placenza, Laframboise, Bhat, Foster, Frey, Lam, Milev, Rotzinger, Soares, Uher, Kennedy","https://doi.org/10.1177/07067437211070656","20220105","COVID-19; mental health; remote care; telemental health; telepsychiatry; virtual care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-06","",24583,""
"Determinants of worse care for non-COVID-19 health or disability needs in Australia in the first month of COVID-19 restrictions: A national survey","We examined the effect of person-related factors on capacity to obtain needed healthcare for non-COVID-19 health conditions/disabilities under COVID-19 restrictions. This was an anonymous online survey of Australian residents Ã¢â€°Â¥18Ã‚Â years (3rd April to 2nd May 2020). We determined the ability to obtain care needed for non-COVID-19 health conditions/disabilities, experience of COVID-19, COVID-19 restrictions and sociodemographic characteristics using study-specific questions; and clinically significant depressive and anxiety symptoms using Patient Health Questionnaire 9 and Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale 7 respectively. We calculated the population attributable fraction (PAF) to determine the proportion of worse access to non-COVID-19 health/disability care attributable to independent risk factors. 13,829 (91.5%) participants had complete data. 6,712 (46.4%) identified a need for healthcare/disability services (&lt;45Ã‚Â years 42.1%, Ã¢â€°Â¥45Ã‚Â years 50.3%). 31.6% aged &lt;45Ã‚Â years and 24.3% aged Ã¢â€°Â¥45Ã‚Â years reported worse access to health/disability care than experienced prior to the pandemic. In those aged &lt;45Ã‚Â years the PAF was highest for depressive symptoms (21.4%; 95% CI 12.6%-29.3%) and anxiety (PAF 19.9%, 12.3%-26.9%). with a PAF of 49.6% (40.1%-57.6%) if any one of the following was being experienced: doing unpaid work; being a student; depressive symptoms; symptoms of anxiety; experiencing high adverse impact of COVID-19 restrictions. In those Ã¢â€°Â¥45Ã‚Â years, PAF was highest for having depressive symptoms (PAF 20.9%, 16.6-24.8) with a PAF of 44.1% (36.0%-51.2%) if any one of the following was being experienced: depressive symptoms; symptoms of anxiety; doing unpaid work; living alone; being in lowest socioeconomic quintile; main source of income from government benefits; any personal experience of COVID-19. The identified risk factors, which include many that characterise those with worse health outcomes generally, explained 44%-50% of worse access to necessary health/disability care. These data have the potential to inform targeted strategies aimed at reducing a post-pandemic escalation of poor health outcomes, especially in vulnerable populations.","Cicuttini, Tran, Hussain, Wluka, Fisher","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13699","20220105","COVID-19; healthcare use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-06","",24584,""
"Association Between Homeschooling and Adolescent Sleep Duration and Health During COVID-19 Pandemic High School Closures","Although negative associations of COVID-19 pandemic high school closures with adolescents' health have been demonstrated repeatedly, some research has reported a beneficial association of these closures with adolescents' sleep. The present study was, to our knowledge, the first to combine both perspectives. To investigate associations between adolescents' sleep and health-related characteristics during COVID-19 pandemic school closures in Switzerland. This survey study used cross-sectional online surveys circulated among the students of 21 public high schools in Zurich, Switzerland. The control sample completed the survey under regular, prepandemic conditions (May to July 2017) and the lockdown sample during school closures (May to June 2020). Survey respondents were included in the study if they provided their sex, age, and school. High school closures during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave in Switzerland (March 13 to June 6, 2020). Sleep-wake patterns, health-related quality of life (HRQoL, assessed by the KIDSCREEN-10 questionnaire), substance use (caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine), and depressive symptoms (lockdown sample only; assessed using the withdrawn/depressed scale from the Youth Self Report). Multilevel regression models were used to assess sample differences and associations of health-related characteristics with sleep duration and depressive symptoms. The total sample consisted of 8972 students, including 5308 (59.2%) in the control sample (3454 [65.1%] female) and 3664 (40.8%) in the lockdown sample (2429 [66.3%] female); the median age in both samples was 16 years (IQR, 15-17 years). During school closures, the sleep period on scheduled days was 75 minutes longer (semipartial R2 statistic [R2ÃŽÂ²*], 0.238; 95% CI, 0.222-0.254; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and the students had better HRQoL (R2ÃŽÂ²*, 0.007; 95% CI, 0.004-0.012; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and less consumption of caffeine (R2ÃŽÂ²*, 0.010; 95% CI, 0.006-0.015; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and alcohol (R2ÃŽÂ²*, 0.014; 95% CI, 0.008-0.022; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Longer sleep duration was associated with better HRQoL (R2ÃŽÂ²*, 0.027; 95% CI, 0.020-0.034; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and less caffeine consumption (R2ÃŽÂ²*, 0.013; 95% CI, 0.009-0.019; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). In the lockdown sample, an inverse association was found between depressive symptoms and HRQoL (R2ÃŽÂ²*, 0.285; 95% CI, 0.260-.0311; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and a positive association was found with caffeine consumption (R2ÃŽÂ²*, 0.003; 95% CI, 0.000-0.008; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). In this survey study, 2 opposing associations between school closures and adolescents' health were identified: a negative association with psychological distress and a beneficial association with increased sleep duration. These findings should be considered when evaluating and implementing school closures. Furthermore, the findings provide support for delaying school start times for adolescents.","Albrecht, Werner, Rieger, Widmer, Janisch, Huber, Jenni","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.42100","20220105","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-06","",24585,""
"Heroin and fentanyl overdose deaths among cases age 50+ in the National Poison Data System, 2015-2020","Illicit opioid use and heroin treatment admissions among individuals age 50+ have increased. Little research has, however, examined correlates of illicit opioid overdose deaths in this age group before or during the COVID-19 pandemic or the healthcare services used in these cases. The sample included illicit opioid (heroin, fentanyl, or other synthetic, nonpharmaceutical opioids) poisoning cases age 50+ (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5576) in the National Poison Data System (NPDS), 2015-2020. Using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models, we report changes in overdose death rates during the study period and associations of death with healthcare service use, naloxone administration, and clinical and demographic characteristics. The 6-year average overdose death rate from illicit opioids among those age 50+ was 2.9%, increasing from 1.4% in 2015 to 4.0% in 2019 and 3.6% in 2020. Logistic regression results showed that exposure year was not a significant factor in the odds of overdose death; however, odds were significantly higher among cases that were not managed at any healthcare facility (HCF) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.19-6.63) and lower among those who received naloxone therapy (AOR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.45-0.92). The odds of death were also higher among cases involving exposure at own or another's home and co-use of prescription opioids, alcohol, and other illicit drugs. Although the NPDS did not show increases in illicit opioid overdose death rates among cases age 50+ in 2020 compared to 2019, overdose deaths were greater among cases that were not managed at HCF and did not receive naloxone therapy. Many appear to have died before they received any intervention to prevent death. Improved access to healthcare services and social support and access to naloxone therapy for older adults with opioid use problems are needed.","Choi, Choi, DiNitto, Marti, Baker","https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2021.2016798","20220105","Older adults; fentanyl; healthcare services; heroin; naloxone; overdose death","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-06","",24586,""
"The Shadow Pandemic: A Qualitative Exploration of the Impacts of COVID-19 on Service Providers and Women Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence and Brain Injury","Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects up to 1 in 3 women over their lifetime and has intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although most injuries are to the head, face, and neck, the intersection of IPV and brain injury (BI) remains largely unrecognized. This article reports on unexplored COVID-19-related impacts on service providers and women survivors of IPV/BI. To explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on survivors and service providers. Purposeful sampling through the team's national Knowledge-to-Practice (K2P) network and snowball sampling were used to recruit 24 participants across 4 categories: survivors, executive directors/managers of organizations serving survivors, direct service providers, and employer/union representatives. This project used a qualitative, participatory approach using semistructured individual or group interviews. Interviews were conducted via videoconferencing, audio-recorded, and transcribed. Transcripts were thematically analyzed by the research team to identify themes. COVID-19 has increased rates and severity of IPV and barriers to services in terms of both provision and uptake. Three main themes emerged: (1) implications for women survivors of IPV/BI; (2) implications for service delivery and service providers supporting women survivors of IPV/BI; and (3) key priorities. Increased risk, complex challenges to mental health, and the impact on employment were discussed. Adaptability and flexibility of service delivery were identified as significant issues, and increased outreach and adaptation of technology-based services were noted as key priorities. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified IPV/BI, increased challenges for women survivors and service providers, and accentuated the continued lack of IPV/BI awareness. Recommendations for service delivery and uptake are discussed.","Haag, Toccalino, Estrella, Moore, Colantonio","https://doi.org/10.1097/HTR.0000000000000751","20220105","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-06","",24587,""

"One-Year Outcomes of Postintensive Care Syndrome in Critically Ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients: A Single Institutional Study","Postintensive care syndrome has a strong impact on coronavirus disease 2019 survivors. Assess the 1-year prevalence of postintensive care syndrome after coronavirus disease 2019. This was a single-center prospective cohort using questionnaires and telephone calls from 4 months to 1 year after ICU discharge. Patients who were treated for coronavirus disease 2019-related acute respiratory distress between March 19, 2020, and April 30, 2020, participated. Postintensive care syndrome was evaluated according to physical, mental, and cognitive domains. We surveyed the 8-item standardized Short Form questionnaire for assessing physical postintensive care syndrome; the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for assessing mental postintensive care syndrome; and Short-Memory Questionnaire for assessing cognitive postintensive care syndrome. The primary outcome was postintensive care syndrome occurrence of any domain at 1 year. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of the three postintensive care syndrome domains was assessed. Eighteen patients consented to the study and completed the survey. The median age was 57.5 years, and 78% of the patients were male. Median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II score was 18. During ICU stay, 78% received invasive mechanical ventilation, and 83% received systemic steroid administration. Early mobilization was implemented in 61%. Delirium occurred in 44%. The median days of ICU and hospital stay were 6 and 23.5, respectively. Overall postintensive care syndrome occurrence was 67%. Physical, mental, and cognitive postintensive care syndrome occurred in 56%, 50%, and 33% of patients, respectively. The co-occurrence of all three domains of postintensive care syndrome was 28%. Age and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II scores were higher, and systemic steroids were more commonly used in the postintensive care syndrome groups compared with the nonpostintensive care syndrome groups. Chronic symptoms were more common in the postintensive care syndrome groups than the nonpostintensive care syndrome groups.

"Prevalence of elevated anxiety symptoms among children in quarantine with COVID-19 infection in the State of Qatar: A cross-sectional study","Children are particularly vulnerable to the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The disruption in daily life has impacted children significantly. Moreover, the increased worrying associated with the probability of getting infected or becoming seriously unwell due to infection can potentially precipitate anxiety disorders among children. This study aimed to determine rates of elevated anxiety symptoms in children with COVID-19 infection. It also explored whether there were any differences in terms of age, gender, and residency status. A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study with 88 participants (children aged 7-13 years, 54.5% males, 45.5% females) from two institutional quarantine centers. The Spence Children's Anxiety Scale and its validated Arabic version (self-reported questionnaires) were used to measure anxiety symptoms. 36.3% children reported elevated anxiety symptoms. A lower rate of 32.8% was reported in younger children (7-11 years) compared to 45.8% in older children (12 and 13 years). 70.4% and 57.9% children reported physical injury fears and separation anxiety respectively. A higher prevalence of overall anxiety was reported in children from expatriate families (40.6%) compared to native children (25%). The difference in the mean scores between the expatriate and native group of children was found statistically significant for obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The prevalence of elevated anxiety symptoms among children in quarantine with COVID-19 infection can be much higher than that reported in the general population. Older children can have elevated anxiety symptoms more commonly than their younger counterparts can. Expatriate children are likely to be more vulnerable to the psychological impact of the pandemic compared to children from local families. Our results suggest the crucial need of focusing on the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on children. The prioritization and effective management of the mental health needs of children should be a vital component of the overall, global response to the pandemic.","Khan, Khan, Noureldin Ahmed, Hammoudeh, Salim, AbuKhattab, Al-Maslamani, Zainel, Salameh, Alabdulla","https://doi.org/10.21307/sjcapp-2021-021","20220105","Child and adolescent psychiatry; anxiety disorders; child behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-06","",24590,""
"Factors in Psychiatric Admissions: Before and During the Covid-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted community mental health, but the effect on psychiatric admissions is unknown. We investigated factors contributing to acute psychiatric admissions, and whether this changed during the first UK lockdown. A retrospective case-note review study with an exploratory mixed-methods design to examine factors for psychiatric admissions following the first UK 2020 lockdown compared to the same time periods in 2019 and 2018. Themes of psychopathology, risk, social stressors, community treatment issues, and physical health concerns were generated. The mean number of codes per case was 6.19 (s . d. = 2.43), with a mean number of categories per case of 3.73, (s. d. = 0.98). Changes in routines and isolation were common factors in the study year; accommodation and substance abuse were more prominent in the control year. Relationship stressors featured strongly in both groups.

"Mental Health Appointments in the Era of COVID-19: Experiences of Patients and Providers","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought an unprecedented shift in health care toward telepsychiatry. This worldwide phenomenon was necessary to meet community health needs while prioritizing patient and provider safety. This study explored the impact of changes in delivery of mental health care services during the pandemic on patient and provider satisfaction with care. <b>Methods:</b> Providers and patients at an academic outpatient psychiatric clinic completed an electronic, cross-sectional, anonymous survey. Items probed perceived convenience and comfort with in-person and telehealth visits, COVID-19-related depression and anxiety, and visit modality preferences. <b>Results:</b> The response rate was 80.0% for providers and 21.0% for patients. Providers found telehealth more convenient than in-person visits during the pandemic, <i>t</i>(11)=1.66, <i>P</i>=0.024. Patients reported no differences in convenience (<i>P</i>=0.497) or comfort (<i>P</i>=0.535) ratings. As the pandemic continues, 83.3% of providers and 50.0% of patients indicated they would prefer telehealth visits. Only 16.7% of providers and 25.0% of patients would prefer telehealth visits continue after the pandemic. Preferred appointment type during the pandemic was not significantly correlated with pandemic-related anxiety or depression. <b>Conclusion:</b> Providers showed a strong preference for telehealth visits during the pandemic, whereas patients felt equal convenience and comfort with care in both telehealth and in-person visits. Fewer participants preferred to use the telehealth modality after the pandemic ends. Higher COVID-19-related depression or anxiety did not impact preference toward visit type. These results suggest that telepsychiatry is an acceptable, although not always preferred, modality for psychiatric care during the global pandemic.","Hunsinger, Hammarlund, Crapanzano","https://doi.org/10.31486/toj.21.0039","20220105","COVID-19; mental health appointments; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-06","",24593,""

"Preventing the Growing Transmission of COVID Clusters: An Integration of the Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs in the Risk Chain","China's success in containing the coronavirus is an ongoing process of identifying loopholes and refining the management in the COVID-19 risk chain. This article discusses the role of personal needs in epidemic control and linked psychological needs with management measures to propose intervention advice on curbing viral transmission in a systematic way. Based on case studies, we showed the integration of the Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs in the COVID-19 risk chain. The analysis combined the micro-view from individual needs and macro influences from governmental measures. The proposed chain of vulnerabilities could help identify critical links of COVID-19 crisis management in case that cascading effects such as super-spread can be intercepted in time. The article mainly focused on curbing the viral transmission timely whenever cluster of cases resurge. Considering the triggered activities from personal needs may facilitate the spread, minimizing the impact scale while managing the crisis could start with protecting vulnerable population, well governing potential hotspots, and necessary restrictions on group activities. Besides, ""individual"" protections combined with ""institutional"" solutions are strongly advocated. The worst scenario would be the governance link slackened or made mistakes, together with delayed identification, plus unprotected way of living and gathering. In order to cut the transmission in time, besides virus-blocking strategies and vaccination approach, screening measures in combination with the satisfaction of personal needs would help identify confirmed cases earlier. Publicizing the model citizen of being responsible could show needs' satisfaction can live with the virus elimination. At the emergency response stage, it is also crucial to secure fewer loopholes in the health system and strengthen the self-protection barrier by all means. China's experience offers a reference for the balance between the resurgence of clustered cases and sustained recovery. As long as the global pandemic continues, its impact on personal activities will not stop, and vice versa. The chain of vulnerabilities integrating psychological needs into the COVID-19 risk management can provide clear clues for cutting further transmission in an efficient and more socially acceptable way.","Li, Xue, Xu, Wang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S336680","20220105","COVID-19; China; pandemic control experience; risk management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-06","",24595,""

"We must practice what we preach: a framework to promote well-being and sustainable performance in the public health workforce in the United States","The COVID-19 pandemic, along with efforts to address systemic racism and social injustice, has required the public health workforce to mobilize an unprecedented and extensive frontline response while simultaneously delivering core services and addressing natural disasters and other emergent threats. Research conducted among health care professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic indicates an increase in anxiety, depression, and burnout, but mental health effects of the pandemic on the public health workforce are less well understood. Left unaddressed, secondary traumatic stress resulting from exposure to the trauma of those we serve, as well as burnout stemming from work-related factors, may hinder our ability to fulfill our mission to serve the population at large.

"Health impact of work stressors and psychosocial perceptions among French hospital workers during the COVID-19 outbreak: a cross-sectional survey","To compare global health, mental health impact of work stressors and psychosocial perception of healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-HCWs in a hospital after the first peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in France. A validated version of the SATIN (SantÃƒÂ© Au Travail Inrs universitÃƒÂ© Nancy 2)questionnaire with adapted scoring was used to collect data on health and impact of work stressors. This questionnaire was sent to all workers at a hospital in July 2020 and was self-administered online. In a multinomial regression model, we included HCW status, age, gender and front-line worker status as covariates. Data from a total of 1405 participants were included. We found that being an HCW, male and front-line worker was a risk factor for negative perception of work demand (OR 7.35, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 4.2 to 11.47; OR 2.55, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.11 to 5.89; OR 1.78, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.04 to 3.06). Being an HCW was a predictive factor for stress (OR 1.47, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.04 to 2.08), poor global health (OR 1.71, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.14 to 2.55) and negative perception of work activity environment (OR 1.9, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.3 to 2.8). We have shown that all HCWs suffered from some health impact shortly after the first peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. We underline some stressors with high impact, including work demand, work abilities and organisational context, and emphasise the need for risk management.","Lucas, Brient, Eveillard, Gressier, LeGrand, Pougnet, Dewitte, LoddÃƒÂ©","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053638","20220105","mental health; occupational &amp; industrial medicine; preventive medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-06","",24598,""
"Research lessons during the COVID-19 pandemic: collecting longitudinal physical and mental health outcomes","Participant enrolment, assessment and/or delivery of intervention in many clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic were severely impacted by public health measures limiting physical contact. This report describes the lessons learned in completing a repeated measures cohort study involving suspected and confirmed COVID-19 survivors at three sites in Perth, Western Australia. An observational analysis of the conduct and data completeness results of the LATER-19 trial. People with COVID19 symptoms who were tested between February and November 2020 were recruited. In both those who tested positive and those who tested negative (control group) for COVID19, data on physical function and mental health were collected at two time points up to eight months after COVID19 testing. Recruitment of the controls was targeted from hospital records for comparison, it was balanced for age and sex and for the non-hospitalised group also comorbidities. A sample of 344 participants was recruited: 155 (45.1%) COVID-19 positive. Taking the research design and environmental adaptations into account, we recorded &gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°90% participant engagement during the trial. Of the 637 planned assessments, objective measures were completed on 602 (94.5%) occasions; 543 (90.2%) were on-site and 59 (9.8%) were remote. A total of 577 (90.6%) mental health/symptoms surveys, 569 (89.3%) 1-min sit-to-stand tests, and 520 (81.6%) handgrip strength tests were completed. The sample size and high completion rate of planned assessments during the LATER-19 trial potentially increases the contextual, groupwise generalisability of the results.

"Containment and therapeutic relationships in acute psychiatric care spaces: the symbolic dimensions of doors","There is an increasing trend of door locking practices in acute psychiatric care. The aim of the present study was to illuminate the symbolic dimensions of doors in Greek mental health nurses' experiences of open and locked working spaces. A sequential mixed-method designexplored the experiences of nurses working in both open and locked psychiatric acute care units. Participants experiences revealed four types of doors related to the quality of recovery-oriented care: (a) the open door, (b) the invisible door, (c) the restraining door, and (d) the revolving door. Open doors and permeable spacesgenerated trust and facilitated the diffusion of tension and the necessary perception of feeling safe in order to be involved in therapeutic engagement. When the locked unit was experienced as a caring environment, the locked doors appeared to be ""invisible"". The restraining doors symbolized loss of control, social distance and stigma echoing the consequences of restrictingpeople's crucial control over spaceduring the COVID-19 pandemicin relation toviolence within families, groups and communities. The revolving door (service users' abscondence/re-admission) symbolised the rejection of the offered therapeutic environment and was a source of indignation and compassion fatigue in both open and locked spaces attributed to internal structural acute care characteristics (limited staffing levels, support, resources and activities for service users) as well as 'locked doors' in the community (limited or no care continuity and stigma). The impact of COVID-19 restrictions on people's crucial control of space provides an impetus for erecting barriers masked by the veil of habit and reconsidering the impact of the simple act of leaving the door open/locked to allow both psychiatric acute care unit staff and service users to reach their potential.","Missouridou, Fradelos, Kritsiotakis, Mangoulia, Segredou, Papathanasiou","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03607-2","20220105","Acute psychiatric care; Door locking practice; Greece; Nurses; Open doors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-06","",24600,""

This study aimed to describe the perspectives of patients with COVID-19, their family, health professionals, and the general public on the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. A secondary thematic analysis was conducted using data from the COVID-19 COS project. We extracted data on the perceived causes and impact of COVID-19 on mental health from an international survey and seven online consensus workshops. We identified four themes (with subthemes in parenthesis): anxiety amidst uncertainty (always on high alert, ebb and flow of recovery); anguish of a threatened future (intense frustration of a changed normality, facing loss of livelihood, trauma of ventilation, a troubling prognosis, confronting death); bearing responsibility for transmission (fear of spreading COVID-19 in public; overwhelming guilt of infecting a loved one); and suffering in isolation (severe solitude of quarantine, sick and alone, separation exacerbating grief).

"Digital psychiatry: implications for patients and services","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increased burden on all medical services and healthcare professionals are applying new strategies to cope with the added demands. During the pandemic mental healthcare services in many parts of the world have been reorganised to incorporate modern technology and maintain efficient service delivery. Mental health professionals are playing a major role in alleviating the suffering resulting from this pandemic. A selective survey of the literature, including narrative reviews, was carried out to study the implications of digital psychiatry. Historically, epidemics have had a substantial effect on mental health and general health services. Telehealth appears to be the right solution to the present mental health crisis, but technology cannot substitute for human presence and proximity in mental health services, so the newer interventions have advantages and disadvantages. Remote methods of therapy are likely to continue to be used and proper assessment of these new ways of working in psychiatry is required. In the post-pandemic period, the challenge will be to combine digital and in-person therapies. Discussions about digital revolution in the field of psychiatry should be modified to digital evolution.","Pandarakalam","https://doi.org/10.12968/hmed.2021.0382","20220105","COVID-19; Ethics; Human closeness; Mental health; Telepsychiatry; Therapeutic alliance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-06","",24604,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of frontline and non-frontline healthcare workers in Sri Lanka","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of mental health problems during a pandemic. Being stationed at the frontline or not may have implications on their mental health. The aims of this study were to assess depression, anxiety and stress among HCWs, to explore differences between frontline and non-frontline workers, and to investigate associated factors. In this cross-sectional study, frontline and non-frontline HCWs were recruited from a COVID-19 screening hospital in Sri Lanka. Mental health impact was assessed using Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Sociodemographic data and perceptions of social and occupational circumstances were gathered. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi square and logistic regression. Odds ratios were calculated for the effect of different perceptions on psychological morbidity. A total of 467 HCWs participated, comprising 244 (52.2%) frontline and 223 (47.8%) non-frontline workers, with female preponderance (n=341, 77%). Prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among HCWs were 19.5%, 20.6%, 11.8%, respectively. Non-frontline group showed a higher prevalence of depression (27% vs. 11%, p&lt;0.001), anxiety (27% vs. 14%, p=0.001) and stress (15% vs. 8%, p=0.026). Being married, having children, living with family and higher income were associated with better psychological outcomes. Perceived lack of personal protective equipment, inadequate support from hospital authorities, greater discrimination, and lack of training to cope with the situation predicted poor mental health outcomes, and non-frontline HCWs were more likely to hold such perceptions. Addressing factors leading to negative psychological outcomes in HCWs should be a key concern during this pandemic.","Baminiwatta, De Silva, Hapangama, Basnayake, Abayaweera, Kulasinghe, Kaushalya, Williams","https://doi.org/10.4038/cmj.v66i1.9351","20220105","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-06","",24605,""
