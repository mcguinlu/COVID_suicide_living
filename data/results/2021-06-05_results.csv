"Formation of oxidized gases and secondary organic aerosol from a commercial oxidant-generating electronic air cleaner","Airborne virus transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic increased the demand for indoor air cleaners. While some commercial electronic air cleaners could be effective in reducing primary pollutants and inactivating bioaerosol, studies on the formation of secondary products from oxidation chemistry during their use are limited. Here, we measured oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) and the chemical composition of particles generated from a hydroxyl radical generator in an office. During operation, enhancements in OVOCs, especially low-molecular-weight organic and inorganic acids, were detected. Rapid increases in particle number and volume concentrations were observed, corresponding to the formation of highly-oxidized secondary organic aerosol (SOA) (O:C ~1.3). The organic mass spectra showed an enhanced signal at m/z 44 (CO2+) and the aerosol evolved with a slope of ~ -1 in the Van Krevelen diagram. These results suggest that organic acids generated during VOC oxidation contributed to particle nucleation and SOA formation. Nitrate, sulfate, and chloride also increased during the oxidation without a corresponding increase in ammonium, suggesting organic nitrate, organic sulfate, and organic chloride formation. As secondary species are reported to have detrimental health effects, further studies are needed to evaluate potential OVOCs and SOA formation from electronic air cleaners in different indoor environments.","Taekyu Joo; Jean C Rivera-Rios; Daniel Alvarado-Velez; Sabrina Westgate; Nga Lee Ng","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.01.21258186","20210604","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-05","",14338,""
"COVID-19 phobia in a boy with undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder: A case report","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is affecting mental health profoundly. Previous studies have reported pandemic-related anxiety. Anxiety disorder and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are common comorbidities. However, there has been no report of any patient with undiagnosed ASD who developed anxiety disorders caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case report, we describe an 8-year-old Japanese boy with undiagnosed ASD who developed COVID-19 phobia, resulting in avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). As COVID-19 was highly publicized in the mass media and the risk of droplet infection was emphasized upon, the patient began to fear viral contamination from food, culminating in a refusal to eat or even swallow his saliva. He was admitted to a pediatric medical center in Osaka with life-threatening dehydration and was then referred to our child psychiatry department. We diagnosed the patient with COVID-19 phobia resulting in ARFID. We identified ASD traits from his present social communication skills and developmental history. We provided psychoeducation of ASD for the parents and administered supportive psychotherapy. Shortly after our intervention to relieve his ASD-related anxiety, his dysphagia improved. Our findings suggest that children with undiagnosed ASD may develop COVID-19 phobia. In these cases, intervention for ASD may be more appropriate than starting treatment for anxiety disorders as the first-line option. COVID-19 is the biggest pandemic in the recent past, and more undiagnosed ASD patients who develop COVID-19 phobia may seek treatment. Clinicians should consider the underlying ASD in these patients and assess their developmental history and present social communication skills.","Sakamoto, Miyawaki, Goto, Harima, Tokuhara, Inoue","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000026233","20210604","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-05","",14339,""
"Creative activities, emotions, and resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal study from Argentina","We conducted a longitudinal study to analyze emotions that are related to the development of creative activities during isolation and social distancing that are associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was performed in two stages: beginning of isolation (April 2020) and 6 months later during the social distancing period (September 2020). A total of 305 people who resided in medium-sized cities (population: 50,000 to one million) in the province of CÃƒÂ³rdoba, Argentina, participated in the study. In the first stage, the participants answered an online questionnaire about creative activities in which they engaged during isolation. In the second stage, semistructured interviews were conducted that asked about changes in life, creative processes, and new endeavors during the social distancing period. In April 2020, positive emotions were associated with the development of creative activities. In September 2020, a predominance of negative emotions that were related to economic, family, and personal difficulties was observed. However, some positive emotions that are related to the development of new ventures and the consolidation of healthy and sustainable habits were also found. We highlight the value of creativity as a resilience factor in the development of new projects and postponed activities. Our findings may contribute to the design and development of policies and programs to promote mental health in times of COVID-19.","Elisondo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.04.017","20210604","Creativity; Emotions; Mental health; Pandemic; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-05","",14340,""
"Multiple forms of mass anxiety in coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic","Heightened public anxiety was observed at the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study enriches scholarly understanding of this mass response by investigating both generic and pandemic-specific anxiety that explain preventive health behavior. In our two-phase, mixed-methods study, pandemic-specific anxiety items elicited during the qualitative phase from March 2-8, 2020 were then tested in the quantitative phase from March 16-22, 2020. Eligible participants were U.S. or U.K. residents aged 18-65. Of the 1,400 participants, 52% met the criteria for moderate to severe anxiety. In addition to anxiety over possible personal COVID-19 infection, participants were also anxious about others' health, others' reactions (e.g., panic-buying, discrimination), societal problems (e.g., economic slowdown, healthcare system breakdown), and personal finances. The positive association between generic anxiety and hygiene practice frequency was explained by two interpersonal-oriented forms of pandemic-specific anxiety: anxiety over others' health (bÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0Ã¢â‚¬Â¢0040, 95% CI: 0Ã¢â‚¬Â¢0031-0Ã¢â‚¬Â¢0050) and others' reactions (0Ã¢â‚¬Â¢0031, 0Ã¢â‚¬Â¢0021-0Ã¢â‚¬Â¢0042). The study was conducted with participants from developed countries at an early stage of the pandemic, and the results were not necessarily generalizable to developing countries or other stages of the pandemic. Also, hygiene practices was the sole behavior of interest, and the findings may differ for other behaviors. The new findings indicate the importance of adopting a nuanced approach that unveils the multifaceted nature of anxiety using a mixed-methods design. Individuals from COVID-19-affected regions experience pandemic-specific anxiety due to concerns related to not only personal but also interpersonal-oriented issues.","Cheng, Wang, Chan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.05.034","20210604","Anxiety; COVID-19; Mental health; Panic; Preventive health behavior; Psychological well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-05","",14341,""
"Predictors of Change in Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Cross-sectional data suggest that depression, anxiety, and stress have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, longitudinal research is needed to test changes in mental health and determine factors that contribute to change. The purpose of this study was to compare anxiety, depression, and stress pre-pandemic to during the pandemic within the same sample and identify predictors of change (i.e., disease threat, changes to daily life, social isolation, financial worries). Three national samples of U.S. adults were recruited through an online platform (Amazon's Mechanical Turk). Participants completed online surveys pre-pandemic (September - December 2019) and during the pandemic(April - June 2020). Across the three samples, mini-meta analyses revealed significant increases in anxiety and stress (Cohen's dsÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.17, 0.16, respectively; ps &lt; 0.01). Financial concern and effects of COVID-19 on daily life predicted higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress during the pandemic across all three samples (dsÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.24, 0.40, and 0.40, respectively; ps &lt; 0.001). Response rates for follow-up surveys were relatively low, with some noted differences between those who did and did not complete both surveys. Significant increases in anxiety and stress were observed across three samples of U.S. adults from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial concern and effects of the pandemic on daily life emerged as the most consistent predictors of psychological distress across these samples.","Haliwa, Wilson, Lee, Shook","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.05.045","20210604","Anxiety; Coronavirus; Covid-19; Depression; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-05","",14342,""
"Suicide-related calls to a national crisis chat hotline service during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown","A COVID-19 pandemic-related rise in suicide rates has been predicted due to social isolation, fear, uncertainty, economic turndown and grief. Detecting an increase in suicide rates is difficult in the absence of real-time data. Alternative data sources for such trends in psychopathology and suicidal behavior must be sought. Data from a national chat-based crisis hotline for the first half of 2019 (pre-COVID-19), were compared to data from the first half of 2020 (during COVID-19). Chat sessions were classified by content and demographics and the data compared between the two time periods. Total chats (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6756) were 48% higher during COVID-19 (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .05). Suicide-related chat (SRC) number was also higher, although the proportion relative to all chats was slightly lower during COVID-19, compared to pre-COVID-19 (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .05). SRCs increased during the COVID-19 lockdown. The number of severe SRCs resulting in urgent police intervention, increased during the lockdown (April-May 2020) compared with the same period in 2019 (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .04). Issues of anxiety were higher in 2020 (19.4%) vs. 2019 (16.5%) (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .00001) while issues of depression were lower (22.4% vs 33%, respectively) (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .00001). The overall use of chats among adults aged &gt;50Ã‚Â yrs increased during COVID-19 and likewise, the rate of SRCs in this age-group increased 30-fold in this period when compared to pre-COVID-19 (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .00001). SRCs included more women than men (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .0001) in both pre-COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 period, when the proportion of women increased from 62% in 2019 to 73% during COVID-19 (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .0001). The rise in total chats, SRCs and SRCs resulting in police action, commenced during lockdown and was ameliorated by end of the lockdown, indicating that distress created by the lockdown was more impactful than mourning deaths of loved ones, fear and uncertainty, because all these factors persisted beyond the end of the lockdown. Older populations were probably more distressed due to greater risk and less adaptability to isolation, social media and staying home. More calls by women may reflect women's better help-seeking capacity. The increase in SRCs indicates the potential for more suicides and the need for bolstering mental health services and reach-out to older people during pandemic lock-downs.","Zalsman, Levy, Sommerfeld, Segal, Assa, Ben-Dayan, Valevski, Mann","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.05.060","20210604","COVID-19; Crisis hotline; Depression; Prevention; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-05","",14343,""

"Relapse after abrupt discontinuation of maintenance electroconvulsive therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic","Maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (M-ECT) is considered an effective relapse prevention strategy in severe mood and psychotic disorders. How long M-ECT should be continued, and what the outcome is after its discontinuation has not been adequately studied. In our tertiary psychiatric hospital, M-ECT treatments were suspended at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to determine the 6-month relapse rate and time to relapse after abrupt discontinuation of M-ECT and to assess the impact of patient and treatment characteristics on the risk of relapse. Eighty-one patients whose M-ECT was discontinued abruptly were followed up prospectively for 6 months, or until relapse (i.e., hospital admission, restart of ECT, change of pharmacotherapy or suicide (attempt)). We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to assess the impact of patient and treatment characteristics on the risk of relapse. Thirty-six patients (44.44%) relapsed within 6 months following abrupt discontinuation of M-ECT. A greater number of previous acute ECT courses, a diagnosis of psychotic disorder (compared to major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder) and a shorter interval between M-ECT treatments at the time of discontinuation were significantly associated with increased risk of relapse. Almost half of the patients relapsed, similar to the relapse rate after a successful acute course of ECT. Patients with a shorter interval between M-ECT treatments at the time of discontinuation seem to be at increased risk, as well as patients with a diagnosis of psychotic disorder, compared to patients with mood disorders.","Lambrichts, Vansteelandt, Crauwels, Obbels, Pilato, Denduyver, Ernes, Maebe, Migchels, Roosen, Buggenhout, Bouckaert, Schrijvers, Sienaert","https://doi.org/10.1111/acps.13334","20210604","COVID-19; Discontinuation; Maintenance Electroconvulsive Therapy; Relapse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-05","",14345,""
"Mitigating infodemics: The relationship between news exposure and trust and belief in COVID-19 fake news and social media spreading","Misinformation surrounding COVID-19 poses a global public health problem that adversely affects governments' abilities to mitigate the disease and causes accidental deaths and self-harm due to false beliefs about the virus, prevention measures, vaccines and cures. We aim to examine the relationship between exposure to and trust in COVID-19 news (from Television, social media, interpersonal communication) and information sources (healthcare experts, government, clerics) and belief in COVID-19 myths and false information, as well as critical verification practices before posting on social media. We use a cross-sectional researcher-administered phone survey of adults living in Lebanon between March 27 and April 23, 2020. The sample included 56.1% men and 43.9% women, 37.9% with a university degree, 63.0% older than 30, and 7% with media literacy training. Those who trust COVID-19 news from social media [95%CI:(1.05-1.52)] and interpersonal communication [95%CI:(1.25-1.82)], and those who trust information from clerics [95%CI:(1.25-1.82)] were more likely to believe in COVID-19 myths and false information. University graduates [95%CI:(0.25-0.51)] and those who trust information from government [95%CI:(0.65-0.89] were less likely to believe in myths and false information. Those who believe in COVID-19 myths and false information [95%CI:(0.25-0.70)] were less likely to engage in critical social media posting practices. Only those who underwent media literacy training [95%CI:(1.24-6.55)] were more likely to engage in critical social media posting practices. Higher education and trust in information from government contributed to decreasing belief in COVID-19 myths and false information. Trust in news from social media, interpersonal communication and clerics contributed to increasing belief in COVID-19 myths and false information, which in turn contributed to less critical social media posting practices, thereby exacerbated the infodemic. Media literacy training contributed to increasing critical social media posting practices, thereby played a role in mitigating the infodemic.","Melki, Tamim, Hadid, Makki, El Amine, Hitti","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252830","20210604","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-05","",14346,""
"Vicarious traumatization in healthcare providers in response to COVID-19 pandemic in Kelantan, Malaysia","In the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline healthcare providers who are engaged in the direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients face a high risk of infection yet receive inadequate protection from contamination and minimal support to cope with overwork, frustration, and exhaustion. These problems have created significant psychological and mental health concerns for frontline healthcare providers. This study aimed to compare the levels of vicarious traumatization between frontline and non-frontline healthcare providers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. All the subjects who met the inclusion criteria were recruited for this comparative cross-sectional study, which was conducted from May to July 2020 in two hospitals in Kelantan, Malaysia. A self-administered questionnaire, namely, the Malay-version Vicarious Traumatization Questionnaire and the Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey were utilized. A descriptive analysis, independent t-test, and analysis of covariance were performed using SPSS Statistics version 26. A total of 160 frontline and 146 non-frontline healthcare providers were recruited. Vicarious traumatization was significantly higher among the non-frontline healthcare providers (estimated marginal mean [95% CI]: 79.7 [75.12, 84.30]) compared to the frontline healthcare providers (estimated marginal mean [95% CI]: 74.3 [68.26, 80.37]) after adjusting for sex, duration of employment, and social support. The level of vicarious traumatization was higher among non-frontline compared to frontline healthcare providers. However, the level of severity may differ from person to person, depending on how they handle their physical, psychological, and mental health. Hence, support from various resources, such as colleagues, family, the general public, and the government, may play an essential role in the mental health of healthcare providers.","Norhayati, Che Yusof, Azman","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252603","20210604","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-05","",14347,""
"Assessment of depressive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 during the second wave of epidemic in Myanmar: A cross-sectional single-center study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a great impact on every aspect of society. All countries launched preventive measures such as quarantine, lockdown, and physical distancing to control the disease spread. These restrictions might effect on daily life and mental health. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of depressive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 at the Treatment Center. A cross-sectional telephone survey was carried out at Hmawbi COVID-19 Treatment Center, Myanmar from December 2020 to January 2021. A total of 142 patients with COVID-19 who met the criteria were invited to participate in the study. A pre-tested Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used as a tool for depressive symptoms assessment. Data were analyzed by using binary logistic regression to identify associated factors of depressive symptoms. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed to determine the level of significance with a p &lt; 0.05. The prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 was 38.7%, with the means (Ã‚Â± standard deviation, SD) subscale of somatic symptom, negative effect, and anhedonia were 4.64 (Ã‚Â±2.53), 2.51 (Ã‚Â± 2.12), and 5.01 (Ã‚Â± 3.26), respectively.

"A qualitative study on the elderly and mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown in Buenos Aires, Argentina - Part 1","On March 19, 2020, preventive and mandatory social isolation was decreed in Argentina in response to the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the disease it causes (COVID-19). This measure aimed to reduce the transmission of the virus and the resulting severe respira-tory condition that frequently besets older adults. However, this measure can also affect the support networks of these isolated people. To explore the emerging needs related to the mental health of isolated older adults in this period and to identify the main support networks they have and the emerging coping strategies in the face of the situation. We carried out an exploratory qualitative study, summoning participants over 60 years of age. Using snowball sampling, a group of researchers contacted them by phone to collect data. The analysis of the findings was triangulated among researchers with different academic backgrounds (medicine, psychology, and sociology). The concepts emerging from the interviews were linked in conceptual networks using an inductive methodology and were mapped into conceptual frameworks available to researchers. Atlas.ti 8 software was used for coding. Thirty-nine participants belonging to the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area were interviewed between April and July 2020. For greater clarity, the main themes were described in five cross-sectional axes: network configurations, resources and coping strategies, affective states and emo-tions, perceptions and reflections on the future, and actions emerging from the participatory approach. Participants reported distress, anxiety, anger, uncertainty, exhaustion, and expressed fear of contagion from themselves and their loved ones. We identify greater vulnerability in people living alone, in small and closed environments, with weak linkages and networks, or limited access to technologies. We also found vari-ous coping strategies and technology was a fundamental factor in maintaining the bonds. The findings of this research have implications for decision-making at the individual level, health systems, professional care, and policy devel-opment. Future research may elucidate the regional, temporal, and socioeconomic variations of the phenomena explored in our research. El 19 marzo de 2020 se decretÃƒÂ³ el aislamiento social preventivo y obligatorio en Argentina como respuesta a la pandemia por el virus SARS-CoV-2 y la enfermedad que causa (COVID-19).

Los participantes del estudio relataron angustia, ansiedad, enojo, incertidumbre, hartazgo y expresaron el temor al contagio de sÃƒÂ­ mismos y de sus seres queridos. Se identificaron personas en situaciÃƒÂ³n de mayor vulnerabilidad al vivir solas, en ambientes pequeÃƒÂ±os y cerrados, con redes vinculares frÃƒÂ¡giles o con limitado manejo de las tecnologÃƒÂ­as.

"Telehealth During COVID-19: Suicide Prevention and American Indian Communities in Montana","<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> Public health measures that prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as social distancing, may increase the risk for suicide among American Indians due to decreased social connectedness that is crucial to wellbeing. Telehealth represents a potential solution, but barriers to effective suicide prevention may exist. <b> <i>Materials and Methods:</i> </b> In collaboration with Tribal and Urban Indian Health Center providers, this study measured suicide prevention practices during COVID-19. A 44-item Likert-type, web-based survey was distributed to Montana-based professionals who directly provide suicide prevention services to American Indians at risk for suicide. Descriptive statistics were calculated for survey items, and Mann<i>-</i>Whitney <i>U</i> tests examined the differences in telehealth use, training, skills among Montana geographic areas, and barriers between providers and their clients/patients. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> Among the 80 respondents, two-thirds agreed or strongly agreed that American Indians experienced greater social disconnection since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Almost 98% agreed that telehealth was needed, and 93% were willing to use telehealth for suicide prevention services. Among current users, 75% agreed telehealth was effective for suicide prevention. Over one-third of respondents reported using telehealth for the first time during COVID-19 pandemic, and 30% use telehealth at least &quot;usually&quot; since the COVID-19 pandemic began, up from 6.3%. Compared with their own experiences, providers perceive their American Indian client/patients as experiencing greater barriers to telehealth. <b> <i>Discussion:</i> </b> Telehealth was increasingly utilized for suicide prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Opportunities to improve telehealth access should be explored, including investments in telehealth technologies for American Indians at risk for suicide.","Pruitt, Chapin, Eakin, Glover","https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0104","20210604","suicide prevention; telehealth; telemedicine; vulnerable populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-05","",14351,""

"Flecainide toxicity associated with the use of goji berries: a case report","Goji berries (GB), usually marketed as a 'superfruit', are a widely used herbal supplement. As with other herbal remedies, the use of GB might be associated with herb-drug interactions, increasing plasma levels of other drugs and causing adverse events. Here, we present the case of a patient that developed flecainide toxicity secondary to an herb-drug interaction, associated with the use of GB to prevent COVID-19. A 75-year-old female presented to the emergency department with fainting. She was taking flecainide for the treatment of atrial extrasystoles diagnosed 2 years previously, and she was using a tea of GB for the prevention of COVID-19. The admission electrocardiogram showed a wide complex polymorphic tachycardia that was considered and treated as flecainide toxicity. The patient had a favourable evolution and was discharged 48Ã¢â‚¬â€°h after admission. Flecainide toxicity is uncommon and needs timely recognition and treatment; it is usually secondary to overdose and renal or hepatic failure. In our case, toxicity was associated with GB use, probably by inhibition of CYP2D6 which is the main enzyme associated with the metabolism of flecainide. Clinicians need to be aware of the possible interactions between herbal remedies (in this case used for the prevention of COVID-19) and cardiovascular drugs that are used to treat chronic cardiovascular diseases.","GuzmÃƒÂ¡n, GuzmÃƒÂ¡n-Moreno, Assad-Morell, Carrizales-SepÃƒÂºlveda","https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytab204","20210604","COVID-19; Case report; Flecainide toxicity; Goji berries; HerbÃ¢â‚¬â€œdrug interaction; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-05","",14353,""
"Awareness and experience of health-care workers during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","During the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of July 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) infection spreading in the community. Now more than 15 lakhs peoples have been infected in India, out of the 26816 patients were deceased. COVID 19 outbreaks become an additional hazard to the health-care workers (HCWs), leading to fatigue, anxiety, depression and fear of death. The objective of this questionnaire-based study is to know about the knowledge of HCWs about COVID 19, their experiences while dealing with the disease, and the protective measures taken to prevent the infection. A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted for 1 month starting from the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of June 2020 after getting institutional ethical clearance. This study included 240 HCWs posted in the medical and surgical Departments of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, Rajasthan. This questionnaire was prepared in online Google forms and required 2 min to complete. Mean, median, range, and standard deviation were used to describe the continuous variables, and percentages were used to describe the categorical data. Among 240 HCWs, 79.16% (<i>n</i> = 190) participants have good knowledge and adapted good precautions (score 15-23) for COVID 19 infection. Rest 20% (<i>n</i> = 48) and 0.8% (<i>n</i> = 2) participants has average (score 8-14) or poor knowledge (score &lt;8) with adaptation of average or poor precautionary measures against COVID 19, respectively. This study concluded that we have the requirement of more educational training programs for awareness of HCWs and precautionary measures against COVID 19. Thereby, HCWs can improve their knowledge and participate in this fight against COVID 19 with more efficiency and confidence.","Meena, Jhirwal, Puranik, Sharma, Rodha, Lodha, Badkur","https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_874_20","20210604","Awareness; coronavirus disease 2019; health care worker; knowledge; precautions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-05","",14354,""

"Effects of Covid-19 confinement on the mental health of children and adolescents in Spain","In Spain, in order to control COVID-19 transmission, one of the strictest confinement measures in the world for children and teenagers has been implemented. From 14 March to 26 April 2020 underage Spaniards were not allowed to leave their homes, except for reasons of force majeure. This could have consequences on their mental health in both the short and the long term. Thus, the aim of the present study was to explore the consequences of confinement on the mental health of Spanish children and teenagers, at the time when minors had been locked down in their homes between 8 and 10Ã‚Â days. The sample was composed of 590 confined Spanish children and teenagers between 8 and 18Ã‚Â years old. The scales of Depression, Self-esteem, Anxiety, Problems with Emotional Regulation, Rage Control Problems, Integration and Social Competence, Somatic Complaints, Rebellious Behaviour, as well as Awareness of the Problems of the Assessment System for Children and Adolescents (SENA) were used. The results revealed that, during confinement, children and adolescents showed emotional and behavioural alterations.

"Ensemble machine learning of factors influencing COVID-19 across US counties","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the causal agent for COVID-19, is a communicable disease spread through close contact. It is known to disproportionately impact certain communities due to both biological susceptibility and inequitable exposure. In this study, we investigate the most important health, social, and environmental factors impacting the early phases (before July, 2020) of per capita COVID-19 transmission and per capita all-cause mortality in US counties. We aggregate county-level physical and mental health, environmental pollution, access to health care, demographic characteristics, vulnerable population scores, and other epidemiological data to create a large feature set to analyze per capita COVID-19 outcomes. Because of the high-dimensionality, multicollinearity, and unknown interactions of the data, we use ensemble machine learning and marginal prediction methods to identify the most salient factors associated with several COVID-19 outbreak measure. Our variable importance results show that measures of ethnicity, public transportation and preventable diseases are the strongest predictors for both per capita COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Specifically, the CDC measures for minority populations, CDC measures for limited English, and proportion of Black- and/or African-American individuals in a county were the most important features for per capita COVID-19 cases within a month after the pandemic started in a county and also at the latest date examined. For per capita all-cause mortality at day 100 and total to date, we find that public transportation use and proportion of Black- and/or African-American individuals in a county are the strongest predictors. The methods predict that, keeping all other factors fixed, a 10% increase in public transportation use, all other factors remaining fixed at the observed values, is associated with increases mortality at day 100 of 2012 individuals (95% CI [1972, 2356]) and likewise a 10% increase in the proportion of Black- and/or African-American individuals in a county is associated with increases total deaths at end of study of 2067 (95% CI [1189, 2654]). Using data until the end of study, the same metric suggests ethnicity has double the association as the next most important factors, which are location, disease prevalence, and transit factors. Our findings shed light on societal patterns that have been reported and experienced in the U.S. by using robust methods to understand the features most responsible for transmission and sectors of society most vulnerable to infection and mortality. In particular, our results provide evidence of the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on minority populations. Our results suggest that mitigation measures, including how vaccines are distributed, could have the greatest impact if they are given with priority to the highest risk communities.","McCoy, Mgbara, Horvitz, Getz, Hubbard","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90827-x","20210604","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-05","",14357,""
"Trends of injury mortality during the COVID-19 period in Guangdong, China: a population-based retrospective analysis","We aimed to ascertain the trends of injury mortality during the COVID-19 period in southern China. We conducted a population-based retrospective analysis to compare the mortality changes of all-cause injury and transport injuries, poisoning, falls, fire/heat/hot substances, drowning, self-harm and interpersonal violence, which were further stratified by sex and age. Comparisons were made between the COVID-19 period (between January 2020 and June 2020) and control period (between January 2019 and June 2019) in Guangdong province. We used the negative binomial models to explore the associations of deaths during the COVID-19 period, according to the different sex and age strata. The all-cause injury mortality in Guangdong province decreased significantly from 28.65 per 100 000 population during the control period to 23.24 per 100 000 population during COVID-19 pandemic period. Similar results were found in specific injury categories. Mortality of self-harm increased by 139.26% in the 10-14 year group during the COVID-19 period as compared with the control period. Although mortality changes in some groups were not statistically significant, some increases were noteworthy during the COVID-19 period (ie, self-harm, transport injury and falls) in the 70-79 year group. The corresponding increase in mortality rate was 16.83%, 3.32% and 4.92%, respectively. The mortality of all-cause injury, transport injury and drowning during the COVID-19 pandemic was consistently decreased. However, the increase in mortality associated with falls, fire/heat/hot substance injury and self-harm in specific age populations warrant the targeted control and prevention measures for the population at risk.","Zheng, Tang, Ma, Guan, Xu, Xu, Xu, Xu, Lin","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045317","20210604","epidemiology; public health; suicide &amp; self-harm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-05","",14358,""
"Facilitators for coping with the COVID-19 pandemic: Online qualitative interviews comparing youth with and without disabilities","The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly impacted people's mental health. Youth with disabilities are at particular risk for the psychological implications of the pandemic. Although much attention has been given to pandemic-related mental health challenges that youth have encountered, little is known about the facilitators for coping with the stresses of the pandemic and how this varies for youth with and without disabilities. The purpose of this study was to understand facilitators for helping youth and young adults with and without disabilities to cope and maintain mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with 34 youth and young adults (17 with a disability; 17 without), aged 16-29 (mean age 23.2). A narrative, thematic analysis of the transcripts was performed. Our findings revealed several similarities and some differences between youth and young adults with and without disabilities regarding facilitators for maintaining mental health during the pandemic. Enablers of coping included: (1) social support; (2) financial support, (3) keeping busy (i.e., having a daily routine, working to keep the mind occupied, volunteering to boost mental health, focusing on school work), and (4) work-life balance (i.e., reduced commute, more time for exercising, going outdoors, cooking, sleeping better, and reflection on life's purpose). Our findings highlight how having coping strategies could help to youth and young adults deal with pandemic-related stress. Youth with disabilities may need some additional support in accessing resources, exercising and going outdoors to help enhance their coping strategies.","Lindsay, Ahmed, Apostolopoulos","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101113","20210604","Coping; Mental health; Pandemic; Resilience; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-05","",14359,""

Primary care nurses were more comfortable to triage (78.3%) than to manage persons with COVID-19 (42.2%), indicating that they may not be functioning to the full capacity of their education and training. Adequate infrastructure was reported by less than a third of the participants (30.1%) and 59.1% reported that personal protective equipment (PPE) was always available. Primary care nurses needed support in coping with stress (57.8%) although few (14.5%) reported access to mental health services. Primary care nurses were not prepared optimally for the COVID-19 pandemic. Challenges included adequate training, infrastructure, the availability of personal protective equipment, COVID-19 testing of health care workers and management support.

"Special Report from the CDC: Strengthening social connections to prevent suicide and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs): Actions and opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: During this time ofintensified hardship and disruption due to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, communities, practitioners, and state and local governments have had to rapidly implement and adapt strategies that support mental health and wellbeing during a global pandemic. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, and at least half of the top 10 leading causes of death have been associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). A number of established risk factors for suicide and ACEs may have been exacerbated by the pandemic, including loneliness and the lack of connectedness. Method: This article briefly considers the effects of COVID-19 on social connection and outlines the importance of adapting and developing programming and resources that address suicide and ACEs prevention during a time of infrastructure disruption. Practical Applications: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the ways that many individuals are able to safely interact and socially connect due to public health prevention strategies implemented to slow the spread of COVID-19.
