"General anxiety and depression are associated with the physical activity and social interaction levels: Study in Argentinean university students during the COVID-19 outbreak","Background Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the planet is going through a historical time of exceptional concern and uncertainty, which impacts people mental health. Here, we explored the levels of depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and their relation with the degree of physical activity and social interaction during the pandemic. Methods We performed a structured survey containing the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 tests to evaluate depressive symptoms and GAD levels. We also asked about weekly physical activity and the level of social interaction. We surveyed two groups of University students in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area: an internal group from the Instituto Tecnologico de Buenos Aires (ITBA), and an external group of students from multiple universities. The survey was conducted in late October/early-November 2020, after a peak of contagions. Some of the participants were surveyed again in January 2021, during academic holidays and after a valley of contagion, for longitudinal analysis Results Our data show that men and women of both groups exhibited a significant positive linear correlation between depression and GAD levels. Moreover, low levels of depression and anxiety were associated with performing physical activity for more than two days a week and to longer periods of social interaction. Finally, the second survey revealed a decrease of the symptoms. Conclusions Our results suggest that performing regular physical activity and avoiding long periods of social isolation gave benefits to mental health. We suggest that public policies could consider protecting these behaviors under health and safety standards.","Alejo Barbuzza; Pedro Benedetti; Celina Goyeneche; Victoria Reppucci; Franco Moscato; Daniela Ramirez Butavand; Cynthia Katche; Jorge Horacio Medina; Diego Moncada; Haydee Viola; Fabricio Ballarini","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.01.07.22268803","20220111","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25166,""
"The Psychosocial Benefits of Sport Participation During COVID-19 Are Only Partially Explained by Increased Physical Activity","The purpose of this study was to determine whether physical activity (PA) increases were responsible for the improvements in mental health and quality of life (QOL) seen among adolescents who returned to sport during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescent athletes were asked to complete a survey in October 2020 regarding demographic information, whether they had returned to sport participation (no [DNP], yes [PLY]), school instruction type (virtual, in-person, hybrid), anxiety, depression, QOL, and PA. Anxiety, depression, QOL and PA were compared between PLY and DNP using least squares means from linear models adjusted for age, gender, and instruction type. Mediation analysis assessed whether the relationship between sport status and anxiety, depression, and QOL was mediated by PA. 171 athletes had returned to play, while 388 had not. PLY athletes had significantly lower anxiety (3.6 +/- 0.4 v 8.2 +/- 0.6, p < 0.001) and depression (4.2 +/- 0.4 v 7.3 +/- 0.6, p < 0.001), and significantly higher QOL (88.1 +/- 1.0 v 80.2 +/- 1.4, p < 0.001) and PA (24.0 +/- 0.5 v 16.3 +/- 0.7, p < 0.001). PA explained a significant, but relatively small portion of the difference in depression (22.1%, p = 0.02) and QOL (16.0%, p = 0.048) between PLY and DNP athletes, but did not explain the difference in anxiety (6.6%, p = 0.20). Increased PA is only responsible for a small portion of the improvements in depression and QOL among athletes who returned to sports and unrelated to improvements in anxiety. This suggests that the majority of the mental health benefits of sport participation for adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic are independent of, and in addition to, the benefits of increased PA.","Andrew M Watson; Kevin Biese; Claudia Reardon; Allison Schwarz; Kristin Haraldsdottir; Margaret Alison Brooks; David R Bell; Timothy McGuine","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.01.11.22269077","20220111","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25167,""
"Climate Surveys of Biomedical PhD Students and Training Faculty Members in the Time of Covid","In July 2020, four months into the disruption of normal life caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, we assessed the institutional climate within the School of Medicine. Voluntary surveys were completed by 135 graduate students in 11 PhD-granting programs and by 83 members of the graduate training faculty. Several themes emerged. PhD students work hard, but the number of hours spent on research-related activities has declined during the pandemic. The students are worried about the pandemics impact on their research productivity, consequent delays in their graduation, and diminished future job prospects. Many late stage PhD students feel they do not have adequate time or resources to plan for their future careers. Symptoms of anxiety and/or depression are prevalent in 51% of the students, based on answers to standardized questions. Most students report they have strong mentoring relationships with their faculty advisors and like their programs, but they identify to a lesser extent with the medical school as a whole. Faculty think highly of their graduate students and are also worried about the pandemics impact upon productivity and the welfare of students. Students are interested in access to an Ombuds office, which is currently being organized by the medical school. Moving forward, the school needs to address issues of bias, faculty diversity, support for mentor training, professional development, and the imposter syndrome. We must also work to create a climate in which many more graduate students feel that they are valued members of the academic medicine community.","Deepti Ramadoss; Meghan Campbell McCord; Johm P Horn","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.01.06.475246","20220107","","bioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25168,""
"More Than Healthcare: Mental Health for All and Its Policy Implications","Grounded in the two principles of ""no health without mental health"" and ""mental health as a human right"" and drawing on an analysis of all relevant documents, this paper identifies the trajectory in which the WHO's Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan has developed. The Action Plan has emerged from an academic social movement for global mental health since the 1990s and experienced the debate over conceptualising mental health regarding its ""heterogeneity in one"" and ""unity in diversity"". Mental health was once overlooked by the Millennium Development Goals agenda and yet has come to occupy an important space on the one for Sustainable Development Goals, which resulted in extending the Action Plan from 2020 to 2030. The COVID-19 pandemic has further invited international attention to the negative impact of public health emergencies on mental health. With that said, the reality is that, similarly in Taiwan, not only do most states lack political and financial commitment, but most of the resources also focus on the prevention and control of mental disorders and disabilities. Therefore, through introducing such a global policy, this paper aims to provoke more discussion on the right to mental health in Taiwan.","Lee, Po-Han","https://doi.org/10.53106/241553062021110061004","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Angle Health Law Review; - (61):44-63, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25169,""

"Adapting RISE: Meeting the needs of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has placed extraordinary stresses on healthcare workers. Combined with disruptions to daily life outside of work, health care professionals experience a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, acute stress reaction, burnout, and PTSD. Top leaders at Johns Hopkins Medicine appreciated the mission-critical importance of maintaining the well-being and resilience of its essential workers. In March 2020 they asked the Johns Hopkins RISE (Resilience in Stressful Events) peer support program to help organize support for all staff. RISE made several adjustments, including adding virtual encounters to the usual in-person support, training additional peer responders, and rounding proactively on active units. Communication was broadened to reach less visible and lower wage workers. RISE collaborated actively with hospital epidemiology and infection control and began reporting regularly at incident command centre briefings. RISE also began to coordinate efforts with the other helping programs within the institution including the Office of Well-being, Employee Assistance, Spiritual Care, and Psychiatry. The number of calls and staff supported rose sharply. RISE supported over 4226 workers in the first 9 months of the pandemic. The adoption of RISE programs was accelerated at affiliated hospitals, as well as at other hospitals across the country in partnership with the Maryland Patient Safety Center. Experience with large scale disasters predicted correctly that worker distress would increase and persist beyond the initial wave of the pandemic. With subsequent surges of COVID-19, exhaustion and moral distress became nearly universal among workers. It is urgent for institutions to provide mechanisms to help their workers cope with the ongoing crisis and other crises that will inevitably occur in the future.

"Lessons for psychiatrists from the COVID pandemic: the need for expanded roles and additional competencies","The disaster of the COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the norms of psychiatric practice: from its methods of care delivery to its methods of practice. Traditional methods of care delivery using in-person visits became impractical or unsafe. Meanwhile, the pandemic has resulted in an increased demand for services. The resulting pivot to telepsychiatry required a skillset that was not a part of traditional psychiatry training. To meet the demand for services, many providers needed to join collaborative models of care to help scale their expertise. Although many innovative collaborative models of care exist, providers remain in their traditional consultative roles within many of those models. In a disaster, when there is an expanding mental health care need in the population, psychiatrists need to adapt their practice to meet expanded roles that naturally build on their usual ones. We explore the expanded roles that psychiatrists will need to fill based on what is known about the field of disaster mental health and principles from Psychological First Aid (PFA). In preparation for a new normal, in what George Everly describes as a â€˜disaster of uncertainty,â€™ we propose evolutions in the way psychiatrists are trained. Specific training on telepsychiatry best practices will prepare psychiatrists to use this method most effectively and appropriately. Additional training should focus on the core competencies of disaster psychiatry: effective crisis leadership and strategic planning, disaster surveillance, knowledge of benign vs. concerning symptoms, psychological triage, implementation of crisis interventions, resource facilitation, crisis communication, and self and peer care. Developing and integrating these competencies into psychiatry training programs will best prepare psychiatrists for the expanding mental health care needs of the community in this ongoing disaster and future ones.

"Perceived stress, hardship, and self-reported health status of persons living with diabetes mellitus during Coronavirus Disease-19 pandemic and lockdown: A descriptive study","Introduction: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic and subsequent complete lockdown have resulted in a lot of difficulties in availing essential services including medical care, especially among the persons living with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The situation was complicated by stress and fear due to unknown nature of the pandemic during initial phases. This study aimed at measuring the perceived stress and hardship faced by persons living with DM and assessing their health status during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in a tertiary care hospital in West Bengal. Materials and Methods: An institution-based, cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted among diagnosed cases of Type 2 DM attending diabetic clinic outpatient department using an interview technique with the help of a predesigned pretested questionnaire that consisted of variables such as perpetual and experiential stress, hardship, and selected self-reported health parameters. Results: Out of a total of 304 study participants, majority responded positively regarding the items of perpetual and experiential stress. However, 80.8% of participants reported the reduction of income, and about 75% of them faced hardship of various extent to manage medicine and diet with low income. Only 9.1% of participants used teleconsultation as a sole method for health checkups. About one-third of participants considered their mental health status as poor or very poor, whereas two-third considered their physical health as good or excellent. Conclusion: Although our study participants did not have much stress or deterioration of health during lockdown, their income and regular care were affected to a certain extent. This emphasizes the need for context-specific measures.","Masuma, Yasmin, Bhattacharyya, Gargi, Ghosh, Sujoy, Bandyopadhyay, Kajari, Mukhopadhyay, Dipta, Biswas, Asit","https://doi.org/10.4103/amit.amit_111_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Acta Medica International; 8(2):111-116, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25173,""
"Adolescent loneliness, stress and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: The protective role of friends","The current study examines if perceived negative changes due to COVID-19 are related to adolescent loneliness, stress and depressive symptoms and whether friendship factors (online friend communication, friend support) serve a protective role in these associations. In total, 993 adolescents (MageÂ =Â 16.09, SDÂ =Â 1.24) from ethnically diverse backgrounds (49% White, 18% Asian/Asian-American, 14% Latinx, 9% Black/African-American, 10% Other) in the United States completed an online survey. Adolescents who perceived more negative changes due to COVID-19 reported more loneliness, stress and depressive symptoms. For loneliness and stress, these associations were qualified by interactions with the friendship factors. Among adolescents with low online friend communication, as perceived negative changes increased, loneliness also increased. At high levels of friend communication, there was no link between negative COVID-19 changes and loneliness. Friend communication and support may protect adolescents from well-being problems stemming from the negative changes in their life due to COVID-19.

"Status quo and influencing factors of post-traumatic stress disorder among front-line anti-epidemic medical staff","[Background] Front-line medical staff are an important group in fighting against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and their mental health should not be ignored. [Objective] This study investigates the current situation and influencing factors of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among front-line anti-epidemic medical staff during COVID-19 epidemic. [Methods] Medical staff who had participated in fighting against the COVID-19 epidemic wereselected from three grade III Class A hospitals and four grade II Class A hospitals in a city of Hubei Province by convenient sampling method in May 2020. The survey was conducted online using the Post-traumatic Stress Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) as the main survey tool to investigate current situation and characteristics of PTSD among these participants. A total of 1120 questionnaires were collected, of which 1071 were valid, and the effective rate was 95.6%. [Results] Of the 1071 participants, the average age was (32.59Â±5.21) years;the ratio of male to female was 1: 5.02;the ratio of doctor to nurse was 1:5.8;nearly 70% participants came from grade III Class A hospitals;married participants accounted for 75.4%;most of them held a bachelor degree or above (86.5%);members of the Communist Party of China (CPC) accounted for 22.9%;50.9% had junior titles;the working years were mainly 5-10 years (42.8%);more than 80.0% participants volunteered to join the front-line fight;95.1% participants received family support;43.0% participated in rescue missions;78.1% participants fought the epidemic in their own hospitals;more than 60% participants considered the workload was greater than before;34.4% participants fought in the front-line for 2-4 weeks, and 23.5% participants did for more than 6 weeks. There were 111 cases of positive PTSD syndromes (PCL-C total score =38) with an overall positive rate of 10.4%, and the scores of reexperience [1.40 (1.00, 1.80)] and hypervigilance [1.40 (1.00, 2.00)] were higher than the score of avoidance [1.14 (1.00, 2.57)]. The results of univariate analysis revealed that PTSD occurred differently among participants grouped by age, political affiliation, working years, anti-epidemic activities location, accumulated working hours in fighting against COVID-19, having child parenting duty, voluntariness, family support, whether family members participated in front-line activities, and rescue mission assignment (P&lt;0.05). The results of logistic regression analysis showed that the incidence rates of reporting PTSD syndromes in medical personnel aged 31-40 years (OR=0.346, 95%CI: 0.164-0.730) and aged 41 years and above (OR=0.513, 95%CI: 0.319-0.823) were lower than that in those aged 20-30 years;the incidence rates of reporting PTSD syndromes in medical staff who were CPC members (OR=0.499, 95%CI: 0.274-0.909), volunteered to participate (OR=0.584, 95%CI: 0.360-0.945), and received family support (OR=0.453, 95%CI: 0.222-0.921) were lower than those did not (P&lt;0.05);the incidence rates of reporting PTSD syndromes among medical workers who had child parenting duty (OR=2.372, 95%CI: 1.392-4.042), whose family members participated in front-line activities (OR=1.709, 95%CI: 1.135-2.575), and who participated in rescue missions (OR=1.705, 95%CI: 1.133-2.565) were higher than those who did not (P&lt;0.05). [Conclusion] The positive PTSD syndrome rate is 10.4% in the front-line anti-epidemic medical staff. Age, political affiliation, voluntariness, family support, having child parenting duty, with a family members participating in the fight, and rescue mission assignment are the influencing factors of PTSD.","Chen, Xiaoyan, Li, Liangjun, Du, Ting, Li, Longti, Song, Shuqin, Cheng, Li","https://doi.org/10.13213/j.cnki.jeom.2021.21112","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Huanjing yu Zhiye Yixue = Journal of Environmental & Occupational Medicine; 38(11):1244, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25175,""

"A Student-Led Community Outreach Telehealth Program for COVID Education and Health Promotion (COACH)","While public health measures of quarantining, socially isolating, and physical distancing are important to minimize the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), these actions may also compromise the ability to manage oneâ€™s own health, thereby increasing the risk of adverse health events. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a student-delivered Community Outreach teleheAlth program for Covid education and Health promotion (COACH) to community-living adults (age =65 years). We hypothesized that COACH would improve health promoting behaviour as measured by the Health Directed Behaviour subscale of the Health Education Impact Questionnaire. We also anticipated COACH would improve secondary outcomes of perceived stress, depressive and anxiety (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21), social support (Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey), health-related quality of life (Short Form-36), and health promotion self-efficacy (Self-Rated Abilities for Health Practices Scale). In this single-group pre-post study, we recruited 75 community-living adults with access to telephone/video-conferencing technology to participate in six 30-45 minute sessions with trained medical students over a two-month period. The mean age of participants was 72.4 years (58.7% female), with 80% reporting two or more chronic conditions. No participants were diagnosed with COVID-19 during participation. Paired sample t-tests showed significant improvement in health directed behaviour (p &lt; .001, d = 0.45) and self-efficacy (p &lt;.001, d = 0.44), but significant decrease in mental health-related quality of life (p &lt; .001, d = -1.69).

Amentoflavone has been extensively recorded as a molecule which displays multifunctional biological activities. Especially, amentoflavone involves in anti-cancer activity by mediating various signaling pathways such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-<U+03BA>B) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), and emerges anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect via binding towards the main protease (Mpro/3CLpro), spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, amentoflavone is considered to be a promising therapeutic agent for clinical research. Considering the multifunction of amentoflavone, the current review comprehensively discuss the chemistry, the progress in its diverse biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation, anti-microorganism, metabolism regulation, neuroprotection, radioprotection, musculoskeletal protection and antidepressant, specially the fascinating role against various types of cancers. In addition, the bioavailability and drug delivery of amentoflavone, the molecular mechanisms underlying the activities of amentoflavone, the molecular docking simulation of amentoflavone through in silico approach and anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of amentoflavone are discussed.","Xiong, Xifeng, Tang, Nan, Lai, Xudong, Zhang, Jinli, Wen, Weilun, Li, Xiaojian, Li, Aiguo, Wu, Yanhua, Liu, Zhihe","https://www.google.com/search?q=Insights+Into+Amentoflavone:+A+Natural+Multifunctional+Biflavonoid","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Frontiers in pharmacology; 12, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25179,""
"Shareholder Voting and COVID-19: The China Experience","Using state-of-the-art data-mining techniques, this research constructs a unique dataset comprising the votes cast by Chinese shareholders on 15,553 resolutions laid before 2,888 general meetings of Shanghai Stock Exchange-listed companies in the six-year period between 2015 and 2020. This research empirically depicts, for the first time, the manner in which minority shareholders exercise their rights to vote in China, presenting a counter-thesis to the conventional wisdom of shareholder passivity. In particular, this research offers a unique perspective on how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced Chinese shareholdersâ€™ voting behaviour by focusing its empirical investigation on the 76-day time window from 23 January to 7 April 2020, during which period Wuhan, the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, came under a mandatory lockdown order. Our findings offer strong empirical evidence that Chinese shareholders cast their votes in a characteristically more informed manner in the 2020 sample period than they did during the sample periods in the previous five years. The research highlights the potential of shareholder activism in economies where share ownership is concentrated. It also has implications for the ongoing discourse on virtual shareholder meetings and the shareholder franchise.","Xi, Chao","https://www.google.com/search?q=Shareholder+Voting+and+COVID-19:+The+China+Experience","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: The Chinese Journal of Comparative Law;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25180,""
"THE BI-DIRECTIONAL ASSOCIATION BETWEEN LONELINESS AND DEPRESSION, BEFORE AND DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Background During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults in Ireland experienced a threefold increase in the prevalence of loneliness while the percentage experiencing clinically significant depressive more than doubled. While loneliness and depression are related, the nature and directionality of this association is still unclear. This study describes changes in both depression and loneliness from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic and adds to the limited literature on the potential bi-directional nature of the association between loneliness and depression. Methods Data are from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), a prospective nationally representative study of community-dwelling adults recruited from community-dwelling adults aged 50+. Data from three waves of TILDA, including a COVID-19 specific sub-study (n = 3,964), were included in the analyses. An auto-regressive cross-lagged panel modelling approach was used to estimate the effect of depression on loneliness and vice versa. Results Neither loneliness nor depression increased between the two time points prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased significantly during the pandemic. There was a bi-directional association between loneliness and depression across time while the strength of the correlation between the two was stronger during the pandemic than had previously been the case. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant increases in both loneliness and depression among older adults. Furthermore, the bi-directional nature of the association between the two suggests that loneliness can both be considered a symptom of depression and that depression may foment a negative evaluation of an individual's social interactions resulting in greater loneliness.","Ward, M.; Kenny, R.

"Transdiagnostic Mechanisms of Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Adults and Families in Germany: Study Protocol of a Cross-Sectional and 1-Year Longitudinal Study","Background: Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, psychological distress is increased. Transdiagnostic mechanisms, including trauma, personality functioning, mentalizing and emotion regulation are considered relevant to the development and maintenance of mental health problems and therefore may play a role in individualsâ€™ reactions to the pandemic. Aim: To identify moderating and mediating factors associated with pandemic-related distress and mental health problems in adults and families, we aim to investigate the interactions of interpersonal trauma (childhood trauma and domestic violence), psychological capacities (personality functioning, mentalizing and emotion regulation) and pandemic-related adversity on psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we aim to investigate behavioral and cognitive consequences of the pandemic (e.g., media consumption, vaccination status, conspiracy beliefs). Methods: Using an online-based cross-sectional and longitudinal design, we will investigate a sample of adult participants recruited via online platforms in German-speaking countries over the course of 1 year with four measurements points via self-report instruments (personality functioning: PID5BF +;mentalizing: MentS, PRFQ;emotion regulation: DERS-SF;mental health problems: PHQ-9, GAD-7;a composite pandemic-related stress score). Structural equation and multi-level modeling will be performed for data analyses. Implications: This study will provide data on the moderating and mediating effects of trauma, personality functioning and mentalizing during the pandemic in a large community sample, particularly on vulnerable groups like families. Identifying transdiagnostic mechanisms of psychopathology in the course of a pandemic crisis may provide valuable insight for the development of pre- and intervention measures for potential psychological distress during and post the pandemic.","Volkert, Jana, Taubner, Svenja, Berning, Anna, Kling, Laura, WieÃŸner, Hannah, Georg, Anna K.; Holl, Julia","https://www.google.com/search?q=Transdiagnostic+Mechanisms+of+Mental+Health+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+on+Adults+and+Families+in+Germany:+Study+Protocol+of+a+Cross-Sectional+and+1-Year+Longitudinal+Study","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Frontiers in psychology; 12, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25182,""
"Promoting Student Wellness and Self-Care During COVID 19: The Role of Institutional Wellness","Stress and burnout are serious and growing threats to the mental health of medical trainees. Recent estimates of burnout in medical students and residents are quite high, with more than half displaying signs of stress, anxiety and depression. The COVID-19 pandemic has only heightened the state of poor mental health in these student populations. It is the position of LSU Health Shreveport Office of Institutional Wellness that a critical need exists for academic institutions to evaluate challenges to self-care and wellbeing in medical trainees.

However, most research on this field has focused on self-reported resilience, and other patterns of response when facing adversity, in cross-sectional designs. Objective: Alternatively, we aimed to study changing patterns of psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population, based on patterns of symptoms, and factors contributing to those patterns. Method: A national representative sample of Spain (NÂ =Â 1,628) responded to an internet-based survey at two assessment points, separated by 1 month (April and May 2020), during the official national confinement stage. Based upon whether participants exhibited absence/presence of distress (i.e., significant trauma-related, depression, or anxiety symptoms) at one or two of the assessment times, patterns of psychological responses were defined by categorizing individuals into one of the four categories: Resilience, Delayed distress, Recovered, and Sustained distress. Results: Analyses of the levels of disturbance associated with the symptoms provided support to that four-fold distinction of patterns of responses. Furthermore, resilience responses were the most common psychological response to the pandemic. Multinomial regression analyses revealed that the main variables increasing the probability of resilience to COVID-19 were being male, older, having no history of mental health difficulties, higher levels of psychological well-being and high identification with all humanity. Also, having low scores in several variables (i.e., anxiety and economic threat due to COVID-19, substance use during the confinement, intolerance to uncertainty, death anxiety, loneliness, and suspiciousness) was a significant predictor of a resilient response to COVID-19. Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with previous literature that conceptualizes resilience as a dynamic process. The clinical implications of significant predictors of the resilience and the rest of psychological patterns of response are discussed. HIGHLIGHTS: â€¢ National representative survey (N=1700) assessed twice during compulsory confinement. â€¢ Four patterns of response were identified and validated: resilience, sustained distress, delayed distress and recovered.â€¢ Resilience was the most common pattern (55.3% of the sample).","Valiente, Carmen, VÃ¡zquez, Carmelo, Contreras, Alba, Peinado, Vanesa, Trucharte, Almudena","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+symptom-based+definition+of+resilience+in+times+of+pandemics:+patterns+of+psychological+responses+over+time+and+their+predictors+A+symptom-based+definition+of+resilience+in+times+of+pandemics:+patterns+of+psychological+responses+over+time+and+their+predictors+<U+75AB><U+60C5><U+671F><U+95F4><U+5BF9><U+4E8E><U+5FC3><U+7406><U+97E7><U+6027><U+57FA><U+4E8E><U+75C7><U+72B6><U+7684><U+5B9A><U+4E49>:<U+968F><U+65F6><U+95F4><U+63A8><U+79FB><U+7684><U+5FC3><U+7406><U+53CD><U+5E94><U+6A21><U+5F0F><U+53CA><U+5176><U+9884><U+6D4B><U+56E0><U+7D20>","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: European Journal of Psychotraumatology; 12(1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25185,""

"Caregiving, Loneliness, and Stress: The Role of COVID-19","According to many prior studies, informal caregivers are at risk for heightened loneliness and distress. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges that may be accentuated among caregivers. This study examined caregiving frequency and its relation to loneliness, perceived stress, and negative affect during the COVID-19 pandemic. We then investigated the moderating roles of COVID-19 concerns and impacts, anticipating magnified effects among caregivers. Participants included respondents from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) COVID-19 project sample (n=2108, mean age=69) who reported their caregiving frequency, general concern about COVID-19, related concerns about family membersâ€™ health, and social disruptions caused by the pandemic. Controlling for age, gender, and health status, daily caregivers reported significantly greater distress during COVID-19 compared to non-caregivers (p=.036). Higher levels of concern about family membersâ€™ health during COVID-19 was significantly associated with greater loneliness among daily caregivers (p = .009), but not among non-caregivers, such that daily caregivers with greater concerns had the highest levels of loneliness. On the other hand, unexpectedly, daily caregivers who experienced fewer social disruptions due to the pandemic reported higher levels of loneliness (p = .002);however, the association was null for non-caregivers. Findings suggest that daily caregivers may be particularly vulnerable to greater loneliness and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. These experiences may exacerbate existing mental health disparities for those providing daily care.","Syed, Sumaiyah, Yang, Iris, Wilson, Stephanie","https://www.google.com/search?q=Caregiving,+Loneliness,+and+Stress:+The+Role+of+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1036-1036, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25189,""
"Social and Demographic Factors Contributing to COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in Patients with Hematologic Malignancies","Background Vaccine hesitancy, defined as the delay in acceptance or refusal of safe vaccines, remains a challenge in the general population. Given that patients with hematologic malignancies frequently encounter healthcare professionals and are at high risk of severe COVID-19 infection, their attitudes towards vaccines may differ from other patient groups. We therefore performed a survey-based study to investigate vaccine hesitancy within an ethnically diverse group of patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies. Methods We administered a 122-item questionnaire from December 2020 to January 2021 (prior to commercial availability of the COVID-19 vaccines) to 60 patients with hematologic malignancies. Questions were separated into the following categories: demographic and socioeconomic data;personal impact of COVID-19 infection;COVID-19 pandemic experience;COVID-19 infection perceptions;COVID-19 vaccine perceptions;and baseline COVID-19 vaccine knowledge. Results The majority of patients were Black (n=33, 55%) or Hispanic (n=11, 18.3%) and were undergoing active treatment (n=43, 71.7%) or had received prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (n=9, 15%). Eight (13.3%) patients had prior COVID-19 infection. Sixteen (26.7%) patients reported infection in an immediate family member while 15 (25%) reported infection in a friend. 20 of these cases were moderate in severity requiring healthcare interaction, and 17 of these cases were reported to result in severe infection (n=7, 9.6%) or death (n=10, 13.7%). Only 16 (29.6%) patients perceived themselves to be at high or very high risk of COVID-19 infection. The COVID-19 pandemic was reported to moderately or severely affect employment/income in 10 (22.8%) patients and led to worse mental health in 10 (22.3%) patients. However, the majority of patients reported no negative impact on their cancer treatment (n=37, 88.1%) or prognosis (n=45, 93.8%). Of the 60 patients, 22 (40.7%) reported that if a COVID-19 vaccine was made publicly available in the next 30 days, they would not vaccinate themselves, either due to safety concerns (n=4, 20%) or indifference (n=6, 30%). Despite this, 43 (78.2%) patients stated that vaccination was an important tool in ending the pandemic. More patients agreed to accept the vaccine if it was made available in 6 months from the time of survey (n=40, 76.9%). Only 32 (59.3%) patients were extremely or very likely to accept a yearly vaccine. In terms of perception on cancer outcomes, 31 (62%) patients were uncertain if the vaccine would interact negatively with their current chemotherapy treatment, while 27 (52.9%) believed the vaccine would make their cancer worse. The biggest fear patients had about COVID-19 vaccines were side effects or death (n=15, 38.5%) and complications to cancer/cancer therapy (n=5, 12.8%). Only 6 (15.4%) patients stated they had no fears related to COVID-19 vaccination. In fact, only 21 (39.6%) patients agreed or strongly agreed that the side effects of most vaccines outweigh the benefits. In a modified (age- and sex-adjusted) Poisson regression model (Table 1) that included baseline demographics and answers to select survey questions, older age was associated with a stronger likelihood of vaccine acceptance (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.11-2.71;p=0.016), while female gender was associated with less likelihood to accept the vaccine (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.90;p=0.016). Patients reported as â€œotherâ€ race (e.g., Asian) were more inclined to accept the vaccine (RR. 2.21, 95% CI 1.16-4.20;p=0.016) compared to White patients. Finally, when compared to patients who receive information primarily from medical professionals, those patients who received their information from social media or friends were far less likely to accept the vaccine (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.04;p&lt;0.001).

"The impact of COVID-19 on clinical care, self-management, and mental health of patients with inflammatory arthritis","Objectives The COVID-19 lockdown and ongoing restrictions in the UK affected access to clinical care, self-management, and mental health for many patients with Inflammatory Arthritis (IA). This study aimed to determine the impact of lockdown on IA clinical care, self-management, disease outcomes, and mental health. Methods In total, 338 people with IA participated in a prospective study completing a series of online questionnaires. The questionnaires assessed demographics, IA condition and management, clinical care, quality of life, and mental health. Visual analogue scales (VAS) were completed at each assessment. Linear regression, controlling for confounders, was conducted to determine factors associated with physical and mental health outcomes. Results Over half of participants reported worsening VAS by more than 10 points for Patient Global Assessment (PGA), pain, fatigue, and emotional distress during the initial lockdown. Changes in clinical care were associated with worse PGA (b = 8.95, p = 0.01), pain (b = 7.13, p = 0.05), fatigue (b = 17.01, p &lt; 0.01) and emotional distress (b = 12.78, p &lt; 0.01). Emotional distress and depression were also associated with worse outcomes in PGA, pain, and fatigue, while loneliness was not. In contrast, physical activity seemed to mitigate these effects. Loneliness did not show any associations with outcomes. Over time, these effects decreased or disappeared. Conclusions Changes to clinical care due to lockdown were associated with worse disease outcomes in patients with IA. There has been a clear impact on mental health as well, with possibly complex relationships between mental health and psychosocial factors.

"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, social connectedness and cognitive performance of older adults","The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted older adult's health and well-being worldwide. We explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily activities and mental health and its relationship with cognitive performance in older adults. Methods One-hundred individuals 60 years and older, without cognitive impairment and enrolled in the Brazilian Memory Study (BRAMS), a longitudinal study, were applied the UCLA Loneliness Scale, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Participants were asked whether they had changes in daily routine and social connectedness during the pandemic. Results Almost half of the participants (48.4%) reported that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected their lives, 38.9% lost a relative or friend because of COVID-19, and 60% had daily routine changes. Relationships (40.5%) and emotion (22%) were reported as the most impacted area. Stopping physical activities and stay at home represented the main routine changed for 78% of participants. The use of voice messages through mobile phones to maintain social connectedness increased from 24.2% to 42.1%. For 38% of participants, their autonomy to daily decisions decreased, and 40% complained that memory got worse during the pandemic. More than 30% felt more stress, loneliness, or depression than in the pre-pandemic period.

"Serving kinship families During COVID: Pivotal moments","Kinship caregivers, who are relatives or non-family members providing care to children when biological parents are unable to do so, comprise over 2.5 million adults in the United States. The vast majority are grandparent caregivers. The 7.8 million children in their care make up approximately 10.5 percent of all children in the United States under the age of 18 (Generations United, 2017: State of Grandfamilies). Navigating daily life is often challenging. Kinship caregivers routinely face difficulties in multiple aspects of their lives, including finances, physical health, mental health, education, employment, parenting, and family relationships. The COVID pandemic heightened existing challenges and stimulated new issues for many kinship providers and the children in their care. This poster will highlight actions taken by one Family Service agency, annually serving approximately 225 kinship families, to meet the unprecedented needs of family members and kinship program staff during COVID. A timeline of decision-related rationales, specific actions taken and results related to these actions will be presented. Data summarizing results for kinship families (n =32) related to COVID-impacted programmatic responses and changes, including level of involvement with group services, recidivism, perceived isolation, and efficacy related to their caregiving roles will be presented. Results summarizing the impact of the agency's COVID-related responses on kinship staff (n = 6) will also be presented, including data on staff members' level of stress, perceived support, perceptions of programmatic effectiveness, and prioritized importance of changes will also be shared.","Smith, Andrea, Mongeluzzo, Michelle, Drente, Tawyna","https://www.google.com/search?q=Serving+kinship+families+During+COVID:+Pivotal+moments","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):835-835, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25193,""
"Virtual CARE for Caregivers of PWD: Adapting to the New Normal","Caregivers of persons with dementia (PWD) often experience increases in depression, anxiety, and burden as the disease progresses. In fact, as the PWDâ€™s neuropsychiatric symptoms increase and independence in ADLS decrease, caregivers psychological and physical health outcomes worsen. The literature suggests that caregiver interventions that teach specific skills are more beneficial than psychoeducational interventions, particularly regarding the amelioration of the psychological impacts of informal caregiving. However, because of caregiving demands, caregiverâ€™s own physical limitations, and competing obligations, it can be difficult to attend caregiver support or education programs outside the home. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, arranging such interventions became more complex, Therefore, we report on preliminary qualitative outcomes of a study investigating the feasibility and acceptability of converting an in-person, group dementia caregiver education intervention, CARE, to a telehealth platform. We report the findings of two objectives: 1) lessons learned when attempting to convert an in-person group intervention to telehealth and 2) experience and perceived benefit of attending a virtual group from the perspective of the participants of our first two groups. Briefly, our findings demonstrate the strong need for technological support. Participants report positive experience regarding the convenience of attending the group from their home, the benefits of the assigned exercises, and the support they found from other group members. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many to embrace the virtual option as they adapt to a new normal. There are undoubtedly hurdles to overcome, but there are also advantages to be leveraged.","Shirk, Steven, O'Connor, Maureen, McLaren, Jaye, Pugh, Kendra, Nguyen, Andrew, Boucher, Sarah, Moo, Lauren","https://www.google.com/search?q=Virtual+CARE+for+Caregivers+of+PWD:+Adapting+to+the+New+Normal","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1028-1029, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25194,""

"Machine learning empowered COVID-19 patient monitoring using non-contact sensing: An extensive review","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the COVID-19 pandemic, has affected more than 250 million people worldwide. With the recent rise of a new Delta variant, the efficacy of the vaccines has become an important question. The goal of various studies has been to limit the spread of the virus by utilizing wireless sensing technologies to prevent human-to-human interactions, particularly for healthcare workers. In this review paper, we discuss the current literature on invasive/contact and non-invasive/non-contact technologies (including Wi-Fi, RADAR, and software-defined radio) that have been effectively used to detect, diagnose, and monitor human activities and COVID-19 related symptoms, such as irregular respiration. In addition, we focused on cutting-edge machine learning algorithms (such as generative adversarial networks, random forest, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, extremely randomized trees, and k-nearest neighbors) and their essential role in intelligent healthcare systems. Furthermore, this study highlights the limitations related to non-invasive techniques and prospective research directions.

"Psychosocial Predictors of Psychological Well-Being During the COVID-19 Pandemic","People worldwide have been largely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition to worries about physical health, it also causes concerns about psychological and mental health. This research aims to explore predictors affecting psychological well-being during the pandemic using the 2018 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) RAND longitudinal data (N = 42,233) and the 2020 HRS COVID-19 module (N = 3,266). Demographics (i.e., gender, age, and education), psychosocial (i.e., personality traits), and health (i.e., comorbidity) variables were included in multivariate logistic and ordinary least square regression analyses predicting feeling â€œoverwhelmed,â€ â€œstressed,â€ and â€œlonelyâ€ during the pandemic. Our results indicated that neuroticism was positively associated with all outcomes. Women were more likely to feel overwhelmed, stressed, and lonely compared to men. Age negatively predicted the overwhelmed and stressed feelings. Furthermore, the effect of depressive symptoms in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 on psychological well-being was assessed by conducting a latent growth curve model. Findings indicate that initial level and increasing change of depressive symptoms over four-time points (waves 11-14) were positively related to psychological feelings. A higher level of depressive symptoms at the initial level of 2012 and increasing reports of depression symptoms predicted higher rates of being stressed, feeling overwhelmed, and lonely during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results have implications for future research and interventions that should target the emotional antecedents and consequences of pandemics.","Ryou, Yeon Ji, Lee, Gina, Arieli, Rotem, Martin, Peter, Choi, Shinae, Cho, Jinmyoung, Heinz, Melinda","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychosocial+Predictors+of+Psychological+Well-Being+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1052-1052, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25197,""

The Global Psychotrauma Screen (GPS) is a brief instrument designed to assess a broad range of trauma-related symptoms with no available validation in the Italian population. Aims: This study aimed to examine the factor structure of the Italian version of the GPS in a general population sample exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate trauma-related symptoms in the context of COVID-19 related risk factors associated with lockdown measures. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional web-based observational study as part of a long-term monitoring programme of mental health outcomes in the general population. Eighteen thousand one hundred forty-seven participants completed a self-report online questionnaire to collect key demographic data and evaluate trauma-related symptoms using the GPS, PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and PSS. Validation analyses included both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and correlation analyses. The relation with putative COVID-19 related risk factors was explored by multivariate regression analysis. Results: Exploratory factor analyses supported a two-factor model. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the best fitting model was a three-factor solution, with core Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) (re-experiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal), Negative Affect (symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, irritability), and Dissociative symptoms. GPS Risk factors and specific COVID-19 related stressful events were associated with GPS total and the three factor scores. Conclusions: Our data suggest that a wide range of trauma-spectrum symptoms were reported by a large Italian sample during the COVID-19 pandemic. The GPS symptoms clustered best in three factors: Negative Affect symptoms, Core PTSS, and Dissociative symptoms. In particular, high rates of core PTSS and negative affect symptoms were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and should be routinely assessed in clinical practice. HIGHLIGHTS â€¢ This study examines the factor structure of the Global Psychotrauma Screen. â€¢ Data were collected during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Italy. â€¢ A three-factor model was the best solution. â€¢ Core Post-Traumatic and Negative Affect symptoms were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rossi, Rodolfo, Socci, Valentina, Talevi, Dalila, Niolu, Cinzia, Pacitti, Francesca, Di Marco, Antinisca, Rossi, Alessandro, Siracusano, Alberto, Di Lorenzo, Giorgio, Olff, Miranda","https://www.google.com/search?q=Trauma-spectrum+symptoms+among+the+Italian+general+population+in+the+time+of+the+COVID-19+outbreak+SÃ­ntomas+del+espectro+traumÃ¡tico+en+la+poblaciÃ³n+general+italiana+en+el+tiempo+del+brote+de+COVID-19+COVID-19<U+7206><U+53D1><U+65F6><U+610F><U+5927><U+5229><U+4E00><U+822C><U+4EBA><U+7FA4><U+4E2D><U+7684><U+521B><U+4F24><U+8C31><U+7CFB><U+75C7><U+72B6>","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: European Journal of Psychotraumatology; 12(1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25198,""
"ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AMONG OLDER PEOPLE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: PREVALENCE AND ASSOCIATED FACTORS","Background There are concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to a rise in mental health problems including anxiety amongst older people, especially those shielding alone during the pandemic. The aim of this study therefore is to examine the prevalence of anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic amongst older people and clarify factors associated with higher burden of symptoms. Methods We analysed data from the COVID-19 study of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, conducted on over 3,100 community dwelling people aged =60Â years from Julyâ€“November 2020. Anxiety symptoms were measured with the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 Questionnaire with a score = 10 indicating moderateâ€“severe anxiety. Linear regression models were used to assess the association of variables of interest with anxiety symptoms. Results Almost 9% of participants (n = 3,128;mean age 71Â years) had moderateâ€“severe symptoms of anxiety. Factors independently associated with a higher burden of anxiety symptoms included female sex (ÃŸÂ = 0.60 (0.33â€“0.87));living alone (ÃŸÂ = 0.72 (0.41â€“1.02));=2 chronic diseases (ÃŸÂ = 0.85 (0.41â€“1.30);heart disease (ÃŸÂ = 0.95 (0.45â€“1.46)) and reporting frequent loneliness (ÃŸÂ = 6.59 (6.03â€“7.16)). Age = 80Â years (ÃŸÂ = -0.77 (-1.16â€”0.37)) and tertiary level education (ÃŸÂ = -0.48 (-0.86â€”-0.10)) were associated with lower anxiety symptom burden. Conclusion Almost 1 in 10 of this population-representative sample of older people had moderate to severe anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Frontline Responders and Students in Training","Medical personnel have been in the frontlines of the pandemic leading to increased levels of stress and an impact on mental health. Risks may include, but are not limited to, pronounced burnout (Shechter et al., 2020), vicarious trauma, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The goal of this investigation was to gain insight on the psychological effects that the pandemic had on both frontline responders (EMTs and emergency room staff) and students in clinical training. Emerging adults and adult participants (N=150;ages 18-46;70.4% ages 18-24) were recruited through the introductory psychology subject pool, community healthcare, and social media. Linear regression and means testing were employed to assess differences between current frontline workers and future workers on the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21;Lovibond, 1995) on irritability, sleep, covid-19 positive presence, concentration, and other mental health factors. Hierarchical linear regression, controlling for age, indicated higher anxiety subscale scores (b=2.49, p=.008) and higher stress subscale scores (b=2.25, p=.035) were present on the DASS-21 for women. Dichotomous means testing indicated higher anxiety, stress, and depression levels for those who also reported a significant change in sleep habits (p &lt;.001) and for those who reported being more irritable on their days off (p &lt;.001) during the pandemic. Students in training (37.7%) indicated interest in considering a different career path (r = .302, p = .02). Future studies should examine these dynamic relationships among mental health factors among healthcare professionals and the implications for training the next generation.","Revell, Andrew, Gauvin, Mitchell","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+Impact+of+COVID-19+Pandemic+on+Frontline+Responders+and+Students+in+Training","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1052-1052, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25200,""
"Perceptions of Partner Cognitive Ability During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Media reports provide anecdotal evidence of increased forgetfulness during the COVID-19 pandemic (Cushing, 2021;Purtill, 2020). Scientific evidence suggests social isolation can impact on cognition (Evans et al., 2018), but the question remains whether those living with a partner experience similar deficits. The present study examined whether middle-aged and older adultsâ€™ perceptions of their own and their partnerâ€™s memory abilities were related to self-reported impact of the pandemic on daily life (e.g., limited social interactions, delayed health care, and disruption to routine). In a sample of 80 married individuals (49% female;age range 40-86 years), we found that participantsâ€™ beliefs about the impact of the pandemic on daily life and their depression ratings significantly predicted (p&lt;0.05) their perceptions of their partnerâ€™s prospective memory abilities. Specifically, pandemic impact on daily life predicted 9.3% of the variance in participantsâ€™ reported perceptions of their partnersâ€™ prospective memory abilities, and participant depression ratings predicted an additional 5.1% of the variance. Surprisingly, these variables did not predict perceptions of participantsâ€™ own cognition or perceptions of partnersâ€™ retrospective memory abilities. In sum, people who reported greater impact of the pandemic on their lives were more likely to believe that their partner frequently forgot to carryout prospective memory intentions (e.g., failed to pass along a message or take medication), and depression further clouded their perception of their partnerâ€™s cognition. These findings should be extended to consider relationship quality and whether individuals consider their partners a reliable source of external memory support during times of life disruption.","Reese-Melancon, Celinda, Margrett, Jennifer, Russell, Dan, Turner, Rachael, Harrington, Erin, Stratton, Lauren, Savla, Jyoti","https://www.google.com/search?q=Perceptions+of+Partner+Cognitive+Ability+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1050-1050, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25201,""

"QOLP-37 MOOD DISTURBANCE IN PATIENTS WITH CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) TUMORS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","BACKGROUND Primary CNS tumors are associated with uncertainty likely contributing to mood disturbance that is common throughout the disease trajectory. The intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic with a CNS tumor diagnosis may further impact the anxiety/depression experienced in this population. This study assessed key anxiety/depression symptoms in patients with CNS tumors prior to and during the COVID year. METHODS Patient reported outcomes (PROs), including the PROMIS Anxiety and Depression Short Forms and EQ-5D-3L, were collected at the time of clinical or telehealth evaluation from the COVID year (March 2020-February 2021) and were compared to assessments through February 2020 (a NOB-normative sample), reflecting what we would typically see in our regular clinic evaluations. RESULTS The COVID sample (N = 178) was primarily White (82%), male (55%), median age of 45 (range 18â€“79), and KPS Â³ 90 (50%). The majority had high grade (70%) brain (83%) tumors with Â³ 1 prior recurrence (60%) and 25% were on active treatment. Visits were primarily conducted via telehealth (64%) and 20% had progression at assessment. Compared to the NOB-normative sample, patients reported significantly higher depression scores (moderate-severe, 17% vs. 12%, p &lt; 0.05), but not anxiety (18% vs. 16%). Eleven percent reported both moderate-severe anxiety and depressive symptoms (8% pre-COVID). Overall health assessed by the EQ-5D-3L was similar to the normative sample in all dimensions, apart from impact of moderate/extreme mood disturbance, which was more prevalent in the COVID year (53% vs. 43%, p &lt; 0.05%). CONCLUSION Patients with CNS tumors are at risk for significant symptoms of depression and anxiety;this risk was heightened during the COVID year. Further evaluation of clinical factors associated with risk are underway. These findings highlight the need for assessments and interventions that can be administered via telehealth to address the mental health needs of this vulnerable population.

Emerging studies have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased these factors due to reported increases in caregiver workload and cognitive and behavioral symptoms of the PWD. We interviewed 10 spousal caregivers of PWD from the NYU Langone Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and Related Dementias Family Support Program in Summer 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to gain feedback about their experiences during the pandemic and the transition from in-person to videoconferencing that could be used to improve services and support. Caregivers discussed the challenges faced during the pandemic but also the unique opportunities the situation presented. We report here on those positive aspects of COVID-19 from the perspective of the caregivers we interviewed. Methods Interviews of caregivers residing with their spouses in the New York City area were conducted via videoconferencing, transcribed, deidentified, and analyzed using framework analysis methods. Results We found that caregivers reported some positive reaction to videoconferencing that included increased support group cohesion, increased convenience, feeling less obligated to participate in events, and new opportunities for social contact. Participants also discussed positive inter-couple relationship changes such as increased quality time spent together. Our findings resonate with a body of literature focused on understanding the positive aspects of caregiving. Understanding the full presentation of the caregiver experience, including both positive and negative aspects, is important for developing interventions and resources for this unique group.","Nguyen, Andrew, Stevenson, Elizabeth, Mittelman, Mary, Nicholson, Roscoe, Donley, Tiffany, Salant, Rebecca, Shirk, Steven, O'Connor, Maureen","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+Silver+Linings+-+Experience+of+Spousal+Caregivers+of+Persons+with+Dementia+Engaged+in+Support+Program","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1037-1038, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25208,""
"NIA Coordinated Analysis of Dynamic Socioemotional Experiences and Well-Being during the Pandemic","We conducted a coordinated analysis of eight longitudinal studies with data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our overarching aim was to examine within-person fluctuations in health and well-being during the pandemic that may differ across the adult lifespan. The studies are from different regions of the U.S. with data collected during different periods of the pandemic. These studies sampled heterogenous age groups, used diverse methods, and were harmonized on constructs. Four longitudinal studies (Notre Dame Study of Health & Well-being, Within-Family Differences Study, Social Relations Study, and the Einstein Aging Study [EAS] Covid Telephone Interviews) and four intensive, microlongitudinal studies (Daily Experience and Well-being Study, Daily COVID-19 Spring, Daily COVID-19 Fall, EAS), with data collected between March 2020 and August 2021 were analyzed. In three studies, older adults were consistently less variable (i.e., lower within-person standard deviation) in negative emotional well-being such as negative affect and depressive symptoms compared to younger adults. In four studies older adults were also less variable in stress. Evidence of better outcomes associated with social interactions was found in three studies, where within-person variability in social interactions was positively correlated with variability in positive affect across age. These findings point toward the complexities of dynamic socioemotional experiences that unfold across historical periods and across the lifespan. These within-person fluctuations could be used as a benchmark to examine long-term trajectories of well-being.","Neupert, Shevaun, Ali, Sumbleen, Bouklas, Isabella, Hu, Rita, Kincaid, Reilly, Nelson, Niccole, Zhang, Shiyang, Scott, Stacey","https://www.google.com/search?q=NIA+Coordinated+Analysis+of+Dynamic+Socioemotional+Experiences+and+Well-Being+during+the+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):983-983, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25209,""

"Examining the Impact of COVID-19 on Loneliness and Social Isolation Among Affordable Housing Residents","Loneliness and social isolation are serious public health concerns associated with higher risks of clinical depression, suicidal ideation, coronary artery disease, stroke, functional decline, an increased risk of developing dementia and cancer mortality. Recent reports indicate the prevalence and dangers of loneliness and social isolation have increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among older populations. In order to address these concerns among residents living at Northgate II (NGII), a 302-unit affordable housing development in Camden, NJ, Fair Share Support Services, Inc. (FSSS), the non-profit arm of Fair Share Housing Development, collaborated with the New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging (NJISA) and the DHHS-funded Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) to develop a loneliness/social isolation survey using two evidenced-based tools, the UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Steptoe Social Isolation Index. FSSS piloted the loneliness and social isolation survey with 192 low-income minority older adults residing at NGII. Results indicate that 49% of the NGII residents surveyed fall into 5 ""at-risk"" categories: 1) lonely and isolated (9%), 2) lonely/somewhat isolated (8%), 3 ) lonely/not isolated (9%), 4) isolated/somewhat lonely (9%), and 5) isolated/not lonely (14%). FSSS, will utilize survey results and follow-up interviews to tailor social service/other interventions to meet the needs and preferences of residents with the goal of preventing serious health problems associated with loneliness and social isolation, allowing residents to age in place.","Mock, Marilyn, Goebelbecker, Roisin, Pomerantz, Sherry, DeGennaro, Jennifer, Perweiler, Elyse","https://www.google.com/search?q=Examining+the+Impact+of+COVID-19+on+Loneliness+and+Social+Isolation+Among+Affordable+Housing+Residents","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1011-1011, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25211,""
"Development and Implementation of a Biometrics Device Design Project in an Introductory BME Course to Support Student Wellness","Mental health challenges have been rising across college campuses. To destigmatize wellness practices and promote student mental health, we present a novel technical project in an introductory bioengineering course that explores stress management techniques through physiology, biosensors, and design. We hypothesize that if students measure objective, physiologic impacts of stress management techniques on themselves, they may be more likely to realize the benefits and use those techniques when needed. Additionally, through this data-driven project, we aim to appeal to engineersâ€™ critical thinking nature. To support students in selecting stress management techniques for themselves, mindfulness is introduced and practiced in the course. Initial student feedback on the introduction of mindfulness into the classroom is positive. The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need to focus on student wellbeing in addition to physical health. Integration of wellness into the core curriculum can normalize the use of these resources within engineering departments and colleges and equip students with stress management tools for their careers. Ultimately, this curricular development lays the groundwork for institutional enhancement of undergraduate STEM education by supporting student wellness through the engineering curriculum.

"Compassion Protects Mental Health and Social Safeness During the COVID-19 Pandemic Across 21 Countries","Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic is having an unprecedented detrimental impact on mental health in people around the world. It is important therefore to explore factors that may buffer or accentuate the risk of mental health problems in this context. Given that compassion has numerous benefits for mental health, emotion regulation, and social relationships, this study examines the buffering effects of different flows of compassion (for self, for others, from others) against the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety, and stress, and social safeness. Methods The study was conducted in a sample of 4057 adult participants from the general community population, collected across 21 countries from Europe, Middle East, North America, South America, Asia, and Oceania. Participants completed self-report measures of perceived threat of COVID-19, compassion (for self, for others, from others), depression, anxiety, stress, and social safeness. Results Perceived threat of COVID-19 was associated with higher scores in depression, anxiety, and stress, and lower scores in social safeness. Self-compassion and compassion from others were associated with lower psychological distress and higher social safeness. Compassion for others was associated with lower depressive symptoms. Self-compassion moderated the relationship between perceived threat of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety, and stress, whereas compassion from others moderated the effects of fears of contracting COVID-19 on social safeness. These effects were consistent across all countries. Conclusions Our findings highlight the universal protective role of compassion, in particular self-compassion and compassion from others, in promoting resilience by buffering against the harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and social safeness.

"Strengthening Communities: A Qualitative Assessment of Opportunities for the Prevention of Adverse Childhood Experiences in the Wake of the Opioid Crisis","The opioid crisis is a significant challenge for health and human service systems that serve children, youth, and families across the United States. Between 2000 and 2017, the number of foster care entries, a type of adverse childhood experience (ACE), attributable to parental drug use increased by 147%. Nevertheless, there is variation in the burden of opioid overdose and foster care rates across the U.S., suggesting community supports and systems to support families affected by substance use also vary. This qualitative study sampled communities experiencing high and low rates of overdose mortality and foster care entries (i.e., a qualitative comparison group) to better understand what might protect some counties from high overdose mortality and foster care entries. The sample included six counties from three states that were selected based on their rates of opioid overdose mortality and foster care entries. Using purposive sampling within counties, interview and discussion group participants included multi-sector community partners, parents whose children had been removed due to parental substance use, and caregivers caring for children who had been removed from their homes. Across all counties, prevention was not front-of-mind. Yet, participants from communities experiencing high rates of overdose mortality and foster care entries identified several factors that might help lessen exposure to substance use and ACEs including more community-based prevention services for children and youth. Both parents and caregivers across all communities also described the need for additional supports and services. Participants also described the impact of COVID-19 on services, including greater utilization of mental health and substance use treatment services and the challenges with engaging children and youth on virtual platforms. The implications for prevention are discussed, including the need to encourage primary prevention programs in communities. This study aimed to identify possible supports to prevent parental opioid misuse and adverse childhood experiences. Communities experiencing high and low rates of overdose mortality and foster care entries were sampled to understand multi-level risk and protective factors. Findings support the importance of prevention such as following opioid prescription guidelines and community youth programs. Parents discussed the importance of peer mentors and family-friendly substance use treatment as critical supports in their recovery. Additional research is needed on the support that caregivers need to effectively care for themselves and their children.","Matjasko, Jennifer L.; Chovnick, Gary, Bradford, Joivita, Treves-Kagan, Sarah, Usher, Kristen, Vaughn, Elizabeth, Ingoldsby, Erin","https://www.google.com/search?q=Strengthening+Communities:+A+Qualitative+Assessment+of+Opportunities+for+the+Prevention+of+Adverse+Childhood+Experiences+in+the+Wake+of+the+Opioid+Crisis","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Journal of child and family studies;: 1-13, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25215,""
"Dyadic Perceptions of COVID-19 Pandemic Impact on Everyday Life","It is important to understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic not only on individualsâ€™ daily lives, but also their close partners. Current literature suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted older adultsâ€™ lives in several ways, including the frequency of social interactions and change in various life habits (Lesbrasseur et al., 2021). Data from 42 middle-aged and older, long-term married or cohabitating dyads were collected as part of an ongoing study of everyday cognition and functioning among couples. Participant age ranged from 40-85+, and couples were partnered for 9-60+ years. During this study, COVID-19 pandemic impact was assessed using six items (1 = No change to 4 = Severe change) examining daily routines, medical and mental health access, social contacts, and pandemic and family-related stress;reports ranged from six to 19. On average, women reported significantly higher COVID-19 pandemic impact compared to men. For both partners, the greatest disruptions reported related to routines and social contacts. Further analysis examined COVID-19 pandemic impact in dyads. For eight dyads, both partners reported relatively lower COVID-19 impact (6-11), whereas for six dyads, both partners reported higher impact scores (14-19). Discussion focuses on within-dyad and between-dyad differences related to perceptions of the pandemicâ€™s impact.","Margrett, Jennifer, Reese-Melancon, Celinda, Russell, Dan, Stratton, Lauren, Harrington, Erin, Savla, Jyoti","https://www.google.com/search?q=Dyadic+Perceptions+of+COVID-19+Pandemic+Impact+on+Everyday+Life","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1040-1040, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25216,""
"Loneliness and Isolation as Barriers to Mental Health Services in a Rural Community","As America grapples with COVID-19, issues regarding mental health have been of rising concern, particularly among those who are isolated. According to the May 2021 American Perspectives Survey, â€œAmericans report having fewer close friendships than they once did, talking to their friends less often, and relying less on their friends for personal support1.â€ Additionally, 49% have three or fewer close friends in 2021, compared to 27% in 1990. 17% have no friends in their core social network. Loneliness has been associated with physical and mental health risks. We sought to explore whether loneliness was also a barrier to seeking mental health services. 90 surveys were collected from rural New York. Respondents were aged 51 to 90, Caucasian (96.6%), and female (73.3% vs, 26.7%). Overall, 34.8% said they lived alone. 29.2% would seek mental health services for feelings of loneliness, while 75.4% would do so if isolated from family. Those who felt detached or isolated from others were significantly less likely to seek help from a counselor (r = - 0.25) or MD (r = - 0.37). Isolation also negatively related to measures on the resiliency scale. Purpose: - 0.22, Perseverance: - 0.33, being ok alone: - 0.32), and positively related to depression (r = .65). Those scoring higher on the â€œokay with being aloneâ€ scale had an increased likelihood of seeking counseling (r = 0.22). Thus, isolation and loneliness are complex topics. Intervention ought to be based on perceptions of being alone. Further research is needed.","Maiden, Robert, Gagne, Danielle, Hayslip, Bert","https://www.google.com/search?q=Loneliness+and+Isolation+as+Barriers+to+Mental+Health+Services+in+a+Rural+Community","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1046-1046, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25217,""
"The Growing Burden of Informal Caregivers During COVID-19","Caregiver burden has negative effects on health outcomes and quality of life. Meanwhile, safety protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic created immediate impacts on informal caregiving with increasing burden on family caregivers. Our primary purpose was to describe the impacts of the pandemic on caregiver burden among informal caregivers, and their sudden shift in roles as a result. This review describes emerging effects on various aspects of health and explores future directions to support informal caregivers. A streamlined search was conducted to fit the scope of this review, with key terms determined to identify relevant publications. Common research databases and mainstream resources were utilized. We focused on research published since March 2020 to align with the timing of the pandemic in the US. Early research suggests that the pandemic has worsened caregiver burden among informal family caregivers. Reported health impacts include greater stress, pain, depression, sleep problems, and irritability, decreased social connectedness and quality of life. Informal family caregivers face negative health outcomes and distress as a result of greater caregiver burden and intensity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Immediate solutions are needed to alleviate this growing burden and provide ongoing support.

Therefore, it is worth understanding changes in daily life conditions among older adults after COVID-19 outbreak. This study was aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on daily life conditions among Korean older adults. To achieve this aim, an online survey was conducted during April, 2021 to include 184 Korean adults aged 60 years or older nationwide. The results are as follows. First, about 54.9% older Koreans reported that their daily life has stopped since COVID-19. Second, the top 3 increased daily life conditions were spending time at home (77.2%), using internet (60.3%), and shopping online (51.6%). Third, the top 3 decreased daily life conditions were traveling (90.2%), meeting with friends (90.2%), and meeting with family members (80.4%). Fourth, the top 3 daily life conditions with no change were sleeping time (72.3%), eating instant food (58.2%), and household income (53.8%).

"Health equity implications of COVID-19 on dementia care in community for people of African descent","This presentation shares results from an analysis of interviews conducted to understand the health equity implications of COVID-19 responses on dementia care in the community for people of African descent in Nova Scotia, Canada. Interviews were embedded within a larger multi-method rapid research project that aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on dementia care for geographically and socially marginalized groups in the province. Data from the interviews was analyzed using a constructivist thematic analysis method, guided by an intersectional theoretical scaffold. Three themes were identified related to systemic barriers, mental health, system navigation and self-care, and collected under the overarching theme of â€˜facing the unknown with dementiaâ€™. Results emphasized the value and notable absence of community driven, culturally specific dementia programs, resources and navigators for people living with dementia, family caregivers and care workers of African descent. Participants identified lack of health system and care provider knowledge and understanding of the cultures and histories of people of African descent as a barrier to quality care and to addressing dementia-related stigma. Conversations focused on the need for practical and accessible tools, strategies and perspectives responsive to the actually lived realities and needs of people in community, and for research that actually contributes to individual and collective life in tangible, timely and culturally meaningful ways. Recommendations focus on the importance of centering community in dementia care programs, policy, practice and research to improve services and supports for people of African descent.","Lukindo, Mary, Hamilton-Hinch, Barbara, Dryden, OmiSoore, Aubrecht, Katie","https://www.google.com/search?q=Health+equity+implications+of+COVID-19+on+dementia+care+in+community+for+people+of+African+descent","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1015-1016, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25220,""

Such a complex array of stressors potentially lead to symptoms of adjustment disorder. Objective This cross-sectional exploratory study examined relationships between risk and protective factors, stressors, and symptoms of adjustment disorder during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Data from the first wave of the European Society of Traumatic Stress Studies (ESTSS) longitudinal ADJUST Study were used. N =Â 15,563 participants aged 18Â years and above were recruited in eleven countries (Austria, Croatia, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Sweden) from June to November 2020. Associations between risk and protective factors (e.g. gender, diagnosis of a mental health disorder), stressors (e.g. fear of infection, restricted face-to-face contact), and symptoms of adjustment disorder (ADNM-8) were examined using multivariate linear regression. Results The prevalence of self-reported probable adjustment disorder was 18.2%. Risk factors associated with higher levels of symptoms of adjustment disorder were female gender, older age, being at risk for severe COVID-19 illness, poorer general health status, current or previous trauma exposure, a current or previous mental health disorder, and longer exposure to COVID-19 news. Protective factors related to lower levels of symptoms of adjustment disorder were higher income, being retired, and having more face-to-face contact with loved ones or friends. Pandemic-related stressors associated with higher levels of symptoms of adjustment disorder included fear of infection, governmental crisis management, restricted social contact, work-related problems, restricted activity, and difficult housing conditions.

"QOLP-19 FINANCIAL TOXICITY AND DISTRESS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN PEOPLE LIVING WITH PRIMARY BRAIN TUMORS","Primary brain tumor (PBT) patients experience high symptom burden and functional limitations, which may be impacted by the economic strain and mood disturbance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed financial toxicity and associated patient reported outcomes (PROs) after one year of lockdown in a cohort of PBT patients. Patient and disease characteristics and PROs including FACIT-COST, MDASI-Brain Tumor, PROMIS-Anxiety/Depression short forms, and EQ-5D-3L were collected from 7/2020 to 5/2021 from participants in our Natural History Study. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, and independent samples t-tests evaluated PRO relationships. The cohort included 112 PBT patients: 57% male, 87% white, mean age = 47 (range 25 â€“ 80). Majority were married (65%), completed = 4-year college degree (73%), earned annual family income = $50,000 (68%) and living with a high-grade glioma (72%) complicated by recurrence (51%). Using FACIT-COST, 56% reported some financial hardship due to illness with a mean FACIT-COST of 28.3 (SD = 11.3, range: 0 - 44). Half of patients reported feeling moderately to extremely anxious or depressed. Non-Whites and Hispanics as well as those not currently working reported worse financial toxicity compared to White non-Hispanics and individuals currently working (21.4 vs 29.8 and 25.7 vs 30.4, respectively). Worse financial toxicity scores strongly correlated with worse overall symptom burden (r = -0.55) and interference (r = -0.42), worse anxiety (r = -0.39) and depression scores (r = -0.44), and worse overall HRQOL scores (r = â€“0.33)[all p&lt; .01]. This is the first report of FACIT-COST in PBT patients to our knowledge and demonstrates that non-White individuals living with high grade glioma who are not currently working due to their tumor reported worse financial toxicity which was strongly correlated with higher symptom burden and interference with lower HRQOL. Future studies to assess financial toxicity longitudinally and post-pandemic using the FACIT-COST are needed.","Leeper, Heather, Vera, Elizabeth, Acquaye, Alvina, Briceno, Nicole, Choi, Anna, Christ, Alexa, Grajkowska, Ewa, Jammula, Varna, Levine, Jason, Lindsley, Matthew, Reyes, Jennifer, Roche, Kayla, Rogers, James, Timmer, Michael, Boris, Lisa, Burton, Eric, Lollo, Nicole, Panzer, Marissa, Penas-Prado, Marta, Pillai, Valentina, Polskin, Lily, Theeler, Brett, Wu, Jing, Gilbert, Mark, Armstrong, Terri","https://www.google.com/search?q=QOLP-19.+FINANCIAL+TOXICITY+AND+DISTRESS+DURING+THE+COVID-19+PANDEMIC+IN+PEOPLE+LIVING+WITH+PRIMARY+BRAIN+TUMORS","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Neuro-oncology; 23(Suppl 6):vi187-vi187, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25223,""
"Social Determinants of Health among Older Korean Immigrants in the United States: A Systematic Review","The visible impact of the SDoHs on health and behavioral health as well as health disparities among minority populations is heightened due to COVID-19. One group about which little is known in relation to SDoHs is the older Korean immigrant population in the U.S. To examine the impact of SDoHs on the health, mental health, and health care utilization, a systematic review of studies focused on SDoHs for this population was conducted. Using multiple indexing terms, databases were searched for articles published in English between January 1, 2011 and December 2020. Articles were included in the search if they examined social determinants of health of older Korean immigrants defined as foreign-born Koreans aged 60 or older who live in the United States regardless of citizenship or legal immigration status. A total of 1090 articles were identified in the search. A review of s for inclusion criteria resulted in 118 articles for review. Seventy-one articles were excluded during the review process. A total of 47 articles met inclusion criteria and were evaluated. The review revealed that SDoHs, including education level, financial resources, access to health insurance, level of acculturation and level of social support, influenced cognitive status, depressive symptoms, health status and quality of life. These findings validate the need for interventions to address the social care needs of older Korean immigrants and can be used to identify the role of social workers in addressing the SDoHs that result in health disparities for older Korean immigrants.","Lee, Sojeong, Rizzo, Victoria","https://www.google.com/search?q=Social+Determinants+of+Health+among+Older+Korean+Immigrants+in+the+United+States:+A+Systematic+Review","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):961-961, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25224,""
"Two Waves of COVID-19 in University Setting: Mental Health and Underlying Risk Factors","The aim of the paper was to assess the differences in the mental distress of university students in the first and second waves of COVID-19, to compare these levels with that of the general population as well as to identify the risk factors associated with the changes in mental health. A total of 2,025 university students in core psychology courses in all years of study at the Faculty of Education at PalackÃ½ University Olomouc were approached via e-mail. Of this number of students, 800 students took part in the study, divided into two groups from the spring (N = 438) and autumn (N = 362) pandemic waves. The data were collected online via Google Forms using a battery of questionnaires and analyzed using the Wilcoxonâ€“Mannâ€“Whitney test, One-Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and binary logistic regression. The results showed a high prevalence of depressive symptoms (38.4 and 51.4%), significant anxiety (43.8 and 37%), and high stress (19.9 and 22.9%) among students in both waves of the pandemic. Depression and stress also increased significantly during the second wave compared with the first one (r = 0.18 [0.12, 0.25] and r = 0.08 [0.01, 0.14]). Finally, university students showed significantly higher levels of mental distress than the general population in all of the variables and in both waves (r = 0.42â€“0.86). A variety of factors influenced different aspects of mental distress in the spring and autumn pandemic waves. Emotion regulation emerged as the most significant and pervasive factor, both influencing all of the three indicators of mental distress and being a significant predictor in both waves.","KremÃ©nkovÃ¡, Lucie, NovotnÃ½, Jan Sebastian, KvintovÃ¡, Jana","https://www.google.com/search?q=Two+Waves+of+COVID-19+in+University+Setting:+Mental+Health+and+Underlying+Risk+Factors","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Frontiers in psychology; 12, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25225,""

"Technology and Social Isolation, Loneliness, and Health Inequities Among Older Adults","Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults have been advised to stay-at-home to reduce the risk of infection. Social distancing and quarantine measures increase their vulnerability to adverse health outcomes like depression and cardiovascular disease. Technology is an effective tool to promote social connectedness among older adults affected by the pandemic;however, its role in reducing loneliness and health inequities is not well understood. The goal of this project was to construct a model for how technologies may be deployed to mitigate the impact of a pandemic on social isolation, loneliness, and health inequities for older adults. PubMed, SCOPUS, and PsychINFO were searched for the following keywords: â€œsocial isolation,â€ â€œloneliness,â€ â€œsocial support,â€ â€œresilience,â€ â€œtechnology,â€ â€œpandemic,â€ and â€œhealth inequities.â€ Articles selected for full analysis attempted to understand or observe how technology alleviates social isolation and/or loneliness among older adults. Research evidence indicates that using technology reduces loneliness directly and indirectly (by reducing social isolation) and can strengthen social support, which in turn promotes resilience among older adults. Video-based technologies encourage care-seeking behaviors in this population. There is insufficient evidence to determine technologyâ€™s relationship to health inequities experienced by older adults. The model we have proposed should help advance research on the relationship between technology and health inequities among older adults that may be aggravated by pandemic-like situations. We hypothesize that technology interventions for social support and functional competence should be sequenced in order to have the best effects on reducing health disparities.","Jutai, Jeffrey, Tuazon, Joshua","https://www.google.com/search?q=Technology+and+Social+Isolation,+Loneliness,+and+Health+Inequities+Among+Older+Adults","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):931-932, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25227,""

The psychological distress can linger after the initial recovery from the infection. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of provisional post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with cured COVID-2019. Methods: The baseline survey was conducted from 10 to 25 February 2020 in patients with COVID-19 in a designated hospital. Demographic and clinical characteristics were acquired, and depression and anxiety levels were assessed, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, respectively. A follow-up survey was conducted 1Â month post-discharge. PTSD symptoms were measured by the Impact of Event Scale-6 (IES-6) and patientsâ€™ perception of supportive care during hospitalization was investigated using a self-developed questionnaire. Results: In total, 114 patients completed both the baseline and follow-up surveys. Of these, 41 (36.0%) met the cut-off score for provisional PTSD diagnosis according to the IES-6. Female gender [odds ratio (OR)Â =Â 4.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54â€“14.37], educational level of high school or below (ORÂ =Â 15.49, 95% CI 1.13â€“212.71), higher anxiety levels (ORÂ =Â 1.34, 95% CI 1.12â€“1.61) and lower perceptions of emotional support during hospitalization (ORÂ =Â 0.41, 95% CI 0.17â€“0.96) predicted a higher risk for provisional PTSD. Conclusions: PTSD is commonly seen in patients with COVID-19 1Â month post-discharge. Female patients, and patients with lower educational levels, higher anxiety levels and lower perceptions of emotional support during hospitalization may be more likely to develop PTSD in the near future. Enhancing emotional support during hospitalization could help to prevent PTSD in patients with COVID-19.

"The Impact of Maternal Anxiety on Early Child Development During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Maternal prenatal anxiety is among important public health issues as it may affect child development. However, there are not enough studies to examine the impact of a mother's anxiety on the child's early development, especially up to 1 year. Objective: The present prospective cohort study aimed to examine whether maternal trait anxiety, perceived social support, and COVID-19 related fear impacted speech-language, sensory-motor, and socio-emotional development in 12 months old Serbian infants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This follow-up study included 142 pregnant women (Time 1) and their children at 12 months (Time 2). Antenatal maternal anxiety and children's development were examined. Maternal anxiety was assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Child speech-language, sensory-motor, and socio-emotional development were assessed using the developmental scale in the form of an online questionnaire that examined the early psychophysiological child development. Information on socioeconomic factors, child and maternal demographics, clinical factors, and perceived fear of COVID-19 viral infection were collected. Multivariable General Linear Model analysis was conducted, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and coronavirus prenatal experiences, maternal prenatal anxiety levels, perceived social support, speech-language, motor skills, and cognitive and socio-emotional development at the infants' age of 12 months. Results: The study revealed the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal trait anxiety. The association between selected independent factors and infants' development was found in a demographically unified sample except for employment and the number of children. There was a correlation between all observed developmental functions. Univariate General Linear model statistical analysis indicated that linear models with selected independent factors and covariates could account for 30.9% (Cognition) up to 40.6% (Speech-language) of variability in developmental functions. It turned out that two-way and three-way interactions had a dominant role on models, and STAI-T Level and COVID-19 related fear were present in all interaction terms. Conclusion: Our findings reveal important determinants of child developmental outcomes and underline the impact of maternal anxiety on early child development. These findings lay the groundwork for the following interdisciplinary research on pregnancy and child development to facilitate and achieve positive developmental outcomes and maternal mental health.","Jelicic, Ljiljana, Sovilj, Mirjana, Bogavac, Ivana, Drobnjak, AndÂ¯ela, Gouni, Olga, Kazmierczak, Maria, Subotic, MiÅ¡ko","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Impact+of+Maternal+Anxiety+on+Early+Child+Development+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Frontiers in psychology; 12, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25229,""
"Does cognitive flexibility change the nature of the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey?","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the mental health of the general population worldwide. The study aimed to determine the associations of the intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and cognitive flexibility (CF) with a variety of psychological symptoms and to examine the impact of IU on psychological symptoms through the moderating role of CF. The Brief Symptom Inventory, Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12, and Cognitive Control and Flexibility Questionnaire were applied to a sample of 3004 adults living in Turkey. The results of the analysis indicated that CF moderated the effect of IU on psychology symptoms. The slope analysis revealed a weakening association between IU and psychological symptoms with the introduction of a high CF level introduced to the model. The findings highlighted the importance of IU as a potential risk factor for developing psychological symptoms while CF appears as a potential protective factor during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Inozu, Mujgan, GÃ¶k, B.

"Myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine: is that so simple?","SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is associated with potential side effects, particularly following second vaccine dose. Recent case series have reported a potential association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and acute myocarditis, predominantly in young males. We hereby describe a previously healthy 17-year-old man, with no past cardiac history, who presented to the emergency department with persistent chest pain and fever (up to 38 Â°C). The patient had received the first dose of Cominarty (BioNTech/Pfizer) vaccine 10 days before symptom onset and reported flu-like symptoms and conjunctivitis involving both eyes one week before administration of the first vaccine dose. On that occasion, no COVID test was performed and the patient was treated with anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotic eye drops. On admission, laboratory tests were performed (Troponin-I <U+0394> 19Â 500â€“23Â 270 ng/l. CRP 23 mg/dl, ESR 43 s, WBC 17Â 570 cell/mm3) as well as COVID-19 PCR, Serological tests and Autoimmune disorders panel all resulting negative. CT coronary angiogram did not reveal any spontaneous coronary artery dissection or anomalous origin of coronary arteries and Calcium Score was 0. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a depressed LVEF (36%) with concomitant posterior and inferior wall as well as posterior and anterior basal interventricular septum hypokinesia. Endomyocardial biopsy revealed multifocal lymphocytic myocarditis with sub-endomyocardial and interstitial fibrosis. CMR was also performed (1-week after presentation) demonstrating mildly depressed systolic function (LVEF 47%), with hypokinesia of the posterior and inferior wall, increased signal intensity on T2 maps (58 ms, n.v. &lt;55 ms), prolonged native T1 values (1083 ms, n.v. &lt;1030 ms) as well as subepicardial and intramyocardial LGE enhancement of infero-lateral segments reflecting intercellular fibrosis. Thereafter, the patient was discharged with medical therapy including ACE-inhibitor, colchicine, and ibuprofen. Given the close proximity between SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration and the absence of other predisposing conditions, the aetiology of myocarditis was attributed to the vaccine. In addition, as the patient suffered from flu-like symptoms and conjunctivitis 1 week before the vaccine, a previous paucisymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was suspected and anti-SARS-Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein antibody test revealed high antibody levels with low IgG avidity. Given that myocarditic symptoms evolved after complete Sars-Cov2 symptom resolution, our first hypothesis is that the infection is unlikely to be the cause of acute myocarditis in this patient. Indeed, current literature on COVID-related myocarditis reports close temporal association between respiratory symptoms and myocarditis onset. In support to our hypothesis, recent trials have reported that myocarditis more frequently occurs following administration of mRNA vaccines especially in male adolescents and young adults like our patient. However, cardiac side effects typically occur after full vaccination and symptoms appear within three days following the second dose, which does not fully apply to this case. Notwithstanding this, more recent studies have reported myocarditis even after first vaccination dose in patients with previous COVID-19 infection, analogously to the case described. This case suggests a complex interaction between immunological factors and covid infection/vaccination with potential significant implications on the cardiovascular system. From current literature, much uncertainty remains regarding time interval criteria for reliable post-vaccination myocarditis diagnosis, hence large-scale clinical trials are needed to address this issue.","Impellizzeri, Andrea, Suma, Nicole, Palermo, Francesco, Sansonetti, Angelo, Armillotta, Matteo, Stefanizzi, Andrea, Amicone, Sara, Angeli, Francesco, Fabrizio, Michele, Bergamaschi, Luca, Paolisso, Pasquale, Rinaldi, Andrea, FoÃ , Alberto, Fedele, Damiano, Catalano, Costantina, Bertelli, Michele, GaliÃ¨, Nazzareno, Pizzi, Carmine","https://www.google.com/search?q=Myocarditis+after+SARS-CoV-2+vaccine:+is+that+so+simple?","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology; 23(Suppl G), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25231,""

Such populations include ethnic groups who face discrimination and experience barriers to accessing comprehensive health care. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed these health disparities, and disruptions of essential health services have further widened the gaps in access to health care. Noncommunicable diseases are more prevalent among groups most impacted by poor social determinants of health and have been associated with an increased likelihood of severe COVID-19 disease and higher mortality. Disruptions in the provision of essential health services for noncommunicable diseases, mental health, communicable diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, and maternal and child health services (including sexual and reproductive health), are projected to also increase poor health outcomes. Other challenges have been an increased frequency of interpersonal violence and food insecurity. Countries in the Americas have responded to the disruptions caused by the pandemic by means of health service delivery through telemedicine and other digital solutions and stepping up social service support interventions. As vaccinations for COVID-19 create the opportunity to overcome the pandemic, countries must strengthen primary health care and essential health services with a view to ensuring equity, if the region is to achieve universal health coverage in fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals.","Hennis, Anselm J.

"Age and Gender Differences in Long-Term Exercise Behavior for Older Adults with Heart Disease","Exercise decreases mortality and hospital admissions. Exercise adherence is challenging, and little is known about exercise adherence especially in older adults with heart disease. To gain an understanding of long-term exercise behaviors in older adults we conducted a cross-sectional study of individuals diagnosed between 2016-2020 with myocardial infarction (MI)/angina. Emails were sent in 2020 to recruit participants. Exercise adherence was measured using the Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS), Godinâ€™s Leisure-Time Activity Scale (GLTEQ) for exercise intensity, and self-report for impact of COVID-19. Descriptive statistics and t-tests were used to analyze data. Eight-hundred and seven individuals (x Â® age 67.3) responded to the on-line survey. The majority were males (68.8%), married, (68.9%), and retired (59.3%). Co-morbidities included hypertension (32%), hyperlipidemia (21%), diabetes (12%), and depression (6.2%). Long-term exercise behaviors were independently observed in participants =65yr (n=526) and &lt;65yr (n=281). Females =65yo demonstrated higher exercise adherence scores compared with males =65yo (1.66 Â± 1.1 vs. 1.30 Â± 21.7;t = -2.59, p=.010). Conversely, males scored higher in exercise intensity (34.4 Â± 24.7 vs. 22.6 Â± 21.7;t = 3.84, p=.000). Gender related exercise adherence and exercise intensity did not differ significantly in &lt;65yo (p=.278 & p=.282, respectively). Exercise frequency decreased in both age groups after COVID-19 Pandemic started, however the decrease was significant only in older adults (p=.014) indicating they were at greater risk for exercise problems when faced with environmental barriers. Additional research is recommended as to the impact of environmental factors on exercise adherence in older adults and potential interventions.","Graham, Helen, Asakura, Yuki, Prue-Owens, Kathy","https://www.google.com/search?q=Age+and+Gender+Differences+in+Long-Term+Exercise+Behavior+for+Older+Adults+with+Heart+Disease","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):899-899, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25233,""
"Descriptive Evidence of COVID-19â€™s Impact on Black LGBTQ Adults Amidst Ongoing Health Inequities","Black LGBTQ people significant challenges and discrimination as they face the barriers of living at the intersection of multiply marginalized identities, which have worsened during the coronavirus pandemic. At a baseline, LGBTQ people exhibit elevated risk of being negatively impacted by the pandemic across health, economic and other social outcomes (Cahill et al., 2020;Heslin & Hall, 2021;Human Rights Campaign, 2020). Black LGBTQ people have also suffered significant economic losses (Human Rights Campaign Foundation, 2020) . Methods The Human Rights Campaign Foundation and AARP supported and partnered with Community Marketing & Insights to conduct a survey of 1,815 Black LGBTQ adults in the United States. The online survey was fielded between September 21 and October 30, 2020. Many Black LGBTQ adult participants report healthcare discrimination in the last three years, with 19% reporting racial discrimination and 11% reporting sexual orientation-based discrimination. Furthermore, 31% of Black transgender adults report healthcare discrimination in the last three years. Preventing or treating COVID-19 is an important health concern to 67% of Black LGBTQ adults aged fifty-five and older, 63% of Black LGBTQ adults aged thirty-five to fifty-four and 53% aged eighteen to thirty-four. Overall, Black LGBTQ adults report being significantly impacted by the pandemic, including negative impacts on their social health (60%), mental health (44%), the physical health of their close friends and family (33%), their finances (30%), and their employment status (22%).

"Acute peri-myocarditis following COVID-19 Pfizer-Biontech vaccine second dose delivery in a male teenager: the good prognosis and unusual ECG","Aims Myocarditis due to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is an uncommon side effect and the cases seem to have occurred predominantly in young adults under 30 years old. The estimated incidence is 12.6 cases per one million second dose m-RNA vaccine delivery. Methods and results A 17-years-old male was admitted at our department after 18 days COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine second dose delivery with persistent chest pain without respiratory symptoms and, ST-elevation and PR-depression in V3â€“V6 at the ECG on 3 August 2021. He had no history of heart disease. Physical examination didnâ€™t show anything relevant except for mildly tachycardic heart sounds. In addition blood test showed increase in C-reactive protein, cardiac troponin and N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. An echocardiography showed widespread hypokinesia with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and highly echogenic pericardium. During the first day cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed, which showed mild diffuse myocardial oedema on T2-weighted images and T2 mapping and two thin areas of delayed enhancement with non-ischaemic pattern in the lateral wall with involvement of the pericardial sheets confirming peri-myocarditis diagnosis. After 24 h, the ECG showed spread and deep T-waves with QTc prolongation. We performed multiple ECG during the days after to assess morphology changes and QTc. The patient has been asymptomatic for all the hospitalization and on day 7 was performed an echocardiography which describe a full recovery in terms of kinesia and left ventricular ejection fraction. He was discharged asymptomatic with â€˜betterâ€™ but still negative T-waves and QTc normalization. Two months after discharge CMR was repeated and showed normal left ventricular function without myocardial oedema and pericardial involvement, but with persistent the areas of delayed enhancement with non-ischaemic pattern in the lateral wall. Conclusions In this case report we describe an uncommon COVID-19 m-RNA Vaccine side effect. The first issue is the timing of presentation. On 19 July 2021, AIFA stated that myocarditis is a very uncommon side effect and it usually presents within 14 days after 2nd dose delivery. Our patient was admitted at our department after that time period, probably because we reported the ending part of the myocarditis presented with symptoms of pericarditis;indeed we didnâ€™t report the cardiac troponin plateau but only the descending cardiac troponin wave and we attend a very quick recovery. The second issue in the unique ECG with a very quick evolution (Tako-Tsubo morphology like) which could be characteristic of this kind of Myocarditis. Third, the good progress of the inflammation and quick recovery. Surely is a serious side effect but itâ€™s still less frequent and with better prognosis than COVID-19 Myocarditis. European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently stated authorized COVID-19 vaccines advantages are still above risks in all age groups beyond 12 y/o. Why is myocarditis a side effect, Why are adolescent males affected the most and Why is the onset after second dose of m-RNA vaccine are questions still unanswered.","Fazzini, Luca, Caggiari, Ludovica, Santus, Sara, Marchetti, Maria Francesca, Mandas, Martina, Perra, Ferdinando, Utzeri, Elena, Raffo, Alessandro, Meloni, Luigi, Montisci, Roberta","https://www.google.com/search?q=Acute+peri-myocarditis+following+COVID-19+Pfizer-Biontech+vaccine+second+dose+delivery+in+a+male+teenager:+the+good+prognosis+and+unusual+ECG","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology; 23(Suppl G), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25235,""

Preliminary research has demonstrated that general public are experiencing a range of psychological problems, including stress-related disturbances. However, to date, there is not much research on the prevalence of adjustment disorder during the current pandemic. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the prevalence and severity of symptoms of adjustment disorder compared to posttraumatic symptoms, depression and generalized anxiety in a large sample of adult Poles, in the first phase of the current pandemic. Method: Self-report data from a web-based sample (NÂ =Â 1,742) was collected between March 25 and April 27, just after the introduction of nationwide quarantine measures in Poland. Results: The current COVID-19 pandemic was a highly stressful event for 75% of participants and the strongest predictor of adjustment disorder. Increased symptoms of adjustment disorder were reported by 49%, and they were associated with female gender and not having a full-time job. However, after exclusion of co-occurring symptomatology, 14% of the sample were finally qualified as meeting diagnostic criteria of adjustment disorder. A substantial proportion of the sample screened also positive for generalized anxiety (44%) and depression (26%);the rate for presumptive PTSD diagnosis was 2.4%. Conclusions: High rates of negative mental health outcomes were found in the Polish population in the first weeks into the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures. They indicate the intense current stress-related symptoms in the early phase of the pandemic and warrant further monitoring on populationâ€™s mental health.

"IDENTIFYING THE TOP 10 RESEARCH PRIORITIES FOR FAMILY CARERS: THE INTERFACE PROJECT","Background In assessing the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on society, it is important to understand the communities most affected and develop methods of support. Family carers provide a vital, yet often invisible role in our society and healthcare system. Identifying research priorities for carers helps establish overall gaps in the research agenda and increases awareness of the role of carers in the community. Methods A priority setting partnership methodology was engaged and through collaboration with carers, healthcare professionals and researchers, a participatory process was conducted to identify gaps in the current literature and prioritise research questions and uncertainties. Focus group discussions followed, the first consisted of family carers (n = 5). The second (n = 3) interviewed stakeholders namely healthcare professionals, researchers and policy makers. After collating the data, researchable questions were developed through an iterative process with a Multi Stakeholder Advisory Committee to identify the top 10 research priorities for Family Carers Ireland. Results The top 10 researchable questions were distilled from a list of 16 and fit into 7 broad categories. 1) economic impact and financial strain 2) Systemic issues, education, resources and policy 3) technology 4) support services and infrastructure 5) mental health and wellbeing of the carer 6) carers in society 7) Recognition and acknowledgment of the family carer. Conclusion The partnership focus of this project allowed the â€˜ground-upâ€™ development of research priorities for carers by carers. The COVID-19 pandemic served to magnify systemic issues already present in society, as well as highlight new burdens. As a result, the subsequent development of 10 researchable questions will guide further investigation to improve the support and wellbeing of family carers.","Donegan, O.; Hartigan, I.; Cowan, K.; Dunne, N.; Hally, R.; O'Connor, C.

"Associations between PACS symptoms and risk factors among Long Haulers in the Rutgers Post-COVID Recovery Program","At least 2/3 of people with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection will experience long-haul COVID symptoms that persist for weeks or months, however, risk factors that modify the likelihood that one develops these symptoms are unknown. Patients referred to the Post-COVID Recovery Program at Rutgers in New Brunswick (n= 108) through primary care referral or self-submitted online request and experiencing a wide variety of Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS) symptoms were stratified by those without self-reported cognitive complaints (n=54), those with self-reported cognitive complaints who scored well on cognitive testing (n=29), and those with self-reported cognitive complaints who scored poorly on cognitive testing (n=25). Comparisons between groups were made using ANOVAs and Chi Squared: for COVID-19 disease severity, COVID-19 disease treatment, comorbid COVID-19 symptoms during infection, comorbid PACS symptoms post-infection, pre-existing health conditions, levels of depression and anxiety, level of fatigue, and social determinants of health (access to healthcare, economic stability, housing stability). Preliminary analyses indicated that whereas people without complaints were normally distributed according to age (p&gt;0.200 for Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test), people with complaints and deficits were skewed towards the older age group (p&lt;0.001 for K-S test) suggesting age to be a risk factor for cognitive impairment in PACS. Participants that reported cognitive complaints also reported increased symptoms of depression, anxiety, and fatigue, compared to participants without cognitive complaints. These data provide insight into associations between PACS symptoms and risk factors relevant in understanding this novel disease.","Dawson, Alice, Hu, William","https://www.google.com/search?q=Associations+between+PACS+symptoms+and+risk+factors+among+Long+Haulers+in+the+Rutgers+Post-COVID+Recovery+Program","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1034-1034, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25238,""
"The 4Ms in a Pandemic: A Survey of Training Needs Among Healthcare Professionals, Older Adults, and Community Members","The University of New England, in collaboration with the University of Maine, received a five-year grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to improve the health and well-being of Maineâ€™s older adults through enhanced training under HRSAâ€™s Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP). As part of these efforts, stakeholder training needs assessment data were collected via a statewide electronic survey that was distributed to community members and providers throughout Maine. The survey, which focused on the 4Mâ€™s of Age-Friendly Healthcare, received 68 responses from older adults/community members (N = 26), program administrators (N = 12), along with community leaders, and those working in the public and non-profit sector (N = 13). A significant emphasis on social isolation, mental health, and grief and loss issues was noted and dominating themes centering on two dimensions of the 4M framework: â€œWhat Mattersâ€ and â€œMentation.â€ Findings reflect an overriding priority by providers and consumers to keep older adults socially connected (28%, N = 34) and maintaining mental health and well-being during the pandemic (21%, N = 14). Qualitative response analysis identified additional COVID-19-related training topics such as: what to do if you or a loved one contracts coronavirus, how to handle grief and loss related to COVID-19, strategies for supporting loved ones during COVID-19, and socially distanced bereavement support.

"Ultra-processed and fresh food consumption and symptoms of anxiety and depression during the COVID â€“ 19 pandemic: COVID INCONFIDENTES","Background & Aim Psychological disorders are an important health problem worldwide. A healthy diet is recommended as one of the measures to prevent and control mental disorders. Epidemiological studies have shown important associations between the consumption of diets rich in nutrients and a lower risk of developing anxiety and depression. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms and food consumption, according to degree of processing, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An epidemiological household survey was conducted in two cities in Brazil. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using validated scales (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item/Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and food consumption was assessed using a qualitative food frequency questionnaire referring to consumption within the last 3 months. The foods were categorized according to the NOVA classification for fresh/minimally processed food and ultra-processed food, using the average weekly consumption as the cutoff. For data analysis, adjusted Poisson regression with robust variance was utilized to estimate the prevalence ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: The consumption of fresh/minimally processed foods above the weekly average frequency was associated with a lower prevalence of symptoms of depression (PR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3;0.7). Consumption above the weekly average of ultra-processed foods was associated with a higher prevalence of anxiety (PR: 1.5 and 95% CI: 1,03;2,3) and depression symptoms (PR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.0;2.1, p = 0.034). Conclusion Increased consumption of ultra-processed foods is associated with a higher occurrence of depression symptoms;therefore, we recommend an increase in the consumption of fresh/minimally processed foods, as endorsed by the Food Guide for the Brazilian Population.","Coletro, Hillary Nascimento, de Deus MendonÃ§a, Raquel, Meireles, Adriana LÃºcia, Lins Machado Coelho, George Luiz, Carvalho de Menezes, Mariana","https://www.google.com/search?q=Ultra-processed+and+fresh+food+consumption+and+symptoms+of+anxiety+and+depression+during+the+COVID+â€“+19+pandemic:+COVID+INCONFIDENTES","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Clinical nutrition ESPEN;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25240,""
"Examining Different Types of Sleep Among Custodial Grandparents During COVID-19","Sleep is associated with healthy living. With increased age, sleep is harder to initiate and maintain. Currently, over two million grandparents have become primary caregivers to their grandchildren and are at risk for poor sleep outcomes. Research shows that grandparent caregivers are at risk for depression due to poor sleep quality. Thus, this study aimed to identify the sleep quality of custodial grandparents to gain a better understanding of sleep patterns during COVID-19 in 2020. Thirty-four custodial grandparents were recruited from the Georgia Division of Aging Kinship Care Support Groups from September through October 2020. Participants were between 42 to 78 years old with a mean age of 57. Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Stata statistical software was used to analyze the relationship between the sleep quality subscales. Results showed a significant positive relationship for custodial grandparents between sleep quality and daytime dysfunction (<U+03C7>2=25.993, p=0.002;G=0.495, p=0.039) as well as sleep quality and sleep disturbance (<U+03C7>2=11.129, p=0.084;G=0.751, p&lt;0.001). There is a significant positive relationship between daytime dysfunction and sleep duration (<U+03C7>2=14.984, p=0.091;G=0.681, p&lt;.001), where grandparents with daytime dysfunction have longer sleep duration. Findings suggest grandparents with poor sleep quality are more likely to experience daytime dysfunction and have more sleep disturbances in the COVID-19 environment. Our study will benefit researchers and practitioners caring for custodial grandparents and contribute to future research focused on custodial grandparents and sleep quality.","Clark, Karen, Mayfield, Kellie, Anderson, Raeda","https://www.google.com/search?q=Examining+Different+Types+of+Sleep+Among+Custodial+Grandparents+During+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1041-1041, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25241,""
"Older Black Americans and Depressive Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Black Americans have experienced multiple health threats during the COVID-19 pandemic, including greater risk of infection compared to Whites. In addition, older adults are more susceptible to worse disease consequences including hospitalization and mortality compared to those who are younger. Racism and economic costs are additional public health crises during this time that have disproportionately impacted Black Americans. Using data from the Uncovering COVID-19 Experiences and Realities (UnCOVER) Study, we examined depressive symptoms in relation to: (1) worry/fear of COVID-19;(2) work loss among household members (being laid off, reduced work hours);and (3) vicarious racism, a particularly salient source of psychosocial stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, including hearing about or seeing acts of racism committed against other race group members. Participants were Black Americans aged 50 years or older (n=300) from five cities (Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, and New York) from May-July 2020. Depression was assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Short Form. In multivariable linear regression models, all three public health threats were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. When in the model simultaneously, worry/fear of COVID-19 (b=0.30, SE=0.12, p&lt;0.01) and vicarious racism (b=0.62, SE=0.15, p&lt;0.001) showed positive associations;work loss was no longer statistically significant (b=0.62, SE=0.43, p=0.15). When added, the corresponding three-way interaction term was significant (b=0.12, SE=0.04, p&lt;0.01). Synergistic epidemics (â€œsyndemicsâ€) among older Black Americans amplify mental health tolls.

"Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and classification of the neurological symptoms of post-COVID-19 syndrome EpidemiologÃ­a, fisiopatologÃ­a y clasificaciÃ³n de los sÃ­ntomas neurolÃ³gicos post-COVID","Introduction Post-COVID-19 syndrome is a series of chronic signs and symptoms that may appear after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including fatigue, dyspnoea, chest pain, palpitations, anxiety, depression, and joint and muscle pain. The purpose of this study was to review the controversies on post-COVID-19 syndrome, the frequency of neurological symptoms, and the potential pathophysiological mechanisms. Methods We present a narrative review of studies published in PubMed since the beginning of the pandemic (January 2020â€“July 2021). Results Patients with history of COVID-19 have been found to present persistent neurological symptoms, including cognitive complaints, memory and concentration problems, headache, anosmia, ageusia, vertigo, and insomnia. Post-COVID-19 syndrome is a heterogeneous disease that lacks a universally accepted definition, which may explain the great variability in the estimated prevalence (2.3%â€“85%) and symptom duration. The criteria differentiating post-COVID-19 syndrome from chronic fatigue syndrome or critical illness syndrome are ambiguous. Risk factors include older age, female sex, certain comorbidities, and greater number of symptoms in the acute phase. The pathophysiology of the syndrome is largely unknown, although it is probably multifactorial, including immunological mechanisms, neural network dysfunction, neurotransmitter alterations, persistent viral damage, and functional impairment. Conclusions Post-COVID-19 syndrome may present after mild or even asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, causing limitations in activities of daily living and in quality of life. Further research will clarify the origin and most appropriate management of these neurological alterations.","Carod-Artal, F. J.; GarcÃ­a-MoncÃ³, J.

"Nutrition Program Improves Health-Related Outcomes of Non-Diabetic Elderly at Nutritional Risk","Malnutrition or its risk affects up to 1 in 3 older adults receiving outpatient care post a hospitalization or for chronic disease management. Although malnutrition poses a negative burden on someoneâ€™s recovery and health preservation, it can be effectively addressed through cost-effective nutrition interventions delivered as comprehensive quality improvement programs (QIPs) aiding to advance healthcare professionalâ€™s nutrition education/training and improve quality of care for at-risk/malnourished individuals. Although evidence from US and Europe demonstrates nutrition-focused QIPs are effective in delivering high-quality nutrition care and improve health outcomes of outpatients at-risk/malnourished, to date, no evidence has been reported from Latin American countries. We assessed effectiveness of a comprehensive, nutrition-focused QIP in a Colombian outpatient clinic. Between 09/2019-03/2020, 504 (of total 618) QIP participants were classified at-risk/malnourished and non-diabetics. Participants were followed for 90-days either in-person or via telehealth mechanisms (during COVID-19-imposed lockdown period). QIP interventions included healthcare professional nutrition education;QIP participant continuous nutrition and exercise counselling and 60-day supply of oral nutrition supplement (EnsureÂ®, Abbott). QIP participants were 69% female, with &gt;2 comorbidities, and mean age of 73. Improvement or maintenance of good mental health/well-being, frailty status, cognition and quality of life was reported for 90.7% (456/503), 87.3% (407/466), 86.7% (405/467) and 47% (237/504) participants, respectively (p-values&lt;0.05). Results support QIP effectiveness in driving improved health-related outcomes for non-diabetic, at-nutritional-risk participants. These findings highlight the importance of nutrition-focused QIPs with ONS for older adults during their recovery phase post a recent hospitalization and/or for chronic disease management.","Cano-Gutierrez, Carlos, Venegas-Sanabria, Luis Carlos, Gomez, Gabriel, Misas, Juan Diego, Brunton, Cory, Sulo, Suela","https://www.google.com/search?q=Nutrition+Program+Improves+Health-Related+Outcomes+of+Non-Diabetic+Elderly+at+Nutritional+Risk","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1048-1048, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25244,""
"Piloting the â€œAnti-Oppressive Practice & Research with Diverse Older Adultsâ€ Training Program during COVID-19","There is a critical need to develop our gerontological-sensitive workforce. Social workers (SW) frequently provide services to older adults yet there are few opportunities for them to train as gerontological clinicians and/or researchers. To provide an opportunity for SW students to gain gerontological knowledge, clinical practice, and research skills, we developed, and pilot tested the â€œAnti-Oppressive Practice and Research with Diverse Older Adultsâ€ virtual training program at a major medical facility in Manhattan, NY. We explored the feasibility, implementation, and impact of this novel program. The 21-hour weekly MSW field placement program followed an anti-oppressive framework and included: 1) supervision and training sessions;and 2) direct clinical and research practice (e.g., theory, funding, assessment, data collection etc.) and aging topical seminars (e.g., depression, loneliness, pain etc.). Racially diverse supervisors and graduate SW students engaged in reflective writing exercises, iterative discussions (recorded & transcribed) and a thematic analysis of data. All interns successfully completed the program and reported enhanced skills related to SW core competencies and research (e.g., standardized assessments), research and practice gap awareness (e.g., minority aging) and plans to pursue advanced research training and/or gerontological clinical work. Intern challenges included: 1) disconnect between MSW curricula and research placements;and 2) managing minority and contextual stressors (e.g., imposter syndrome, covid-19, civil unrest). Supervisory challenges included: 1) humanizing sensitive discussions via virtual communication and 2) resource constraints. Future research should systematically assess program effects (e.g., SW core competencies) and how to facilitate interprofessional collaborations to develop diverse gerontological SWs and researchers.","Camacho, David, Pacheco, Kelly, Feldman, Sabrina, Kaul, Usha, Kim, Patricia, Reid, M.

"Coping with the Subjective Impact of COVID-19 among Older Adults in Puerto Rico","The COVID-19 pandemic poses serious physical and mental health risks for older adults worldwide. To develop culturally and contextually congruent services to mitigate these risks requires understanding their stress and coping processes, which remain understudied in Latin America. This study examines qualitative data from 51 adults aged 60 and over who participated in an ongoing study of older Puerto Ricansâ€™ knowledge, attitudes, and practices about COVID-19. Trained interviewers collected the data by telephone from January to August, 2021. Two-thirds of participants were female, 60% had less than high school education and 90% had poverty-level incomes. Drawing on Lazarus and Folkmanâ€™s Stress and Coping Theory, we conducted a thematic analysis of responses to open-ended questions about the nature and extent of COVID-related stressors, stress management, and meanings and guidance they had gleaned from their experience. Participants perceived the pandemic as an added threat to ongoing chronic stressors (e.g., Hurricane Maria, poverty, political instability);disruptions in daily routines, family cohesion, and grief and loss processes;and increased isolation and loneliness. They reported using cognitive, behavioral, socioemotional and spiritual coping, including positive thinking, keeping occupied, relaxation, religious practices and, in a few cases, social media. Participants highlighted a revitalized appreciation for emotional qualities of relationships, freedom and life in general. Consistent with our guiding theory, cultural, contextual, religious, and socio-political factors shaped their appraisals of stress and their coping strategies. Future research should examine how these practices relate to health outcomes and quality of life and how they can inform effective, appropriate interventions.","Camacho, David, Marti, Yamile, Cho, Sunghwan, Buckley, Thomas, Vazquez, Julia, Burnette, Denise, Fabelo, Humberto","https://www.google.com/search?q=Coping+with+the+Subjective+Impact+of+COVID-19+among+Older+Adults+in+Puerto+Rico","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1037-1037, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25246,""
"Adherence and Psychosocial Well-Being During Pandemic-Associated Pre-deployment Quarantine","Background: With the purpose of preventing SARS-Cov-2 traveling with the troops, pre-deployment and post-deployment quarantine are mandatory for the German military. This study investigates which factors could be addressed in order to facilitate adherence and mental health during isolation. Method: Six hundred three soldiers completed questionnaires at the beginning and at the end of pre-deployment quarantine: Mini-SCL (BSI), Perceived Social Support (FSozU-K22), Unit Cohesion, Military Quarantine Adherence Questionnaire (MQAQ), and quarantine-associated factors including informedness about Covid-19, perceived individual risk, benefit of quarantine, clarity of quarantine protocol, need of intimacy, social norms, stigma, practicality of the quarantine, financial disadvantages, boredom, and health promoting leadership. Results: Using stepwise regression analyses, up to 57% of the quarantine adherence was explained by social norms, boredom, perceived benefit/effectiveness of the quarantine, clear communication of the quarantine protocol and perceived risk of an infection, with social norms explaining 43%. In respect to mental health (Mini-SCL) at the beginning of quarantine, only 15% is explained by being in a partnership, (un)fulfilled need for bonding/intimacy, perceived unit cohesion, and perceived social support. Up to 20 % of the variance in mental health at the end of quarantine is explained by accumulated days of isolation before pre-deployment quarantine, age, clear communication of the quarantine protocol, perceived social support, fulfilled need for bonding/intimacy and perceived stigma. Mental health and quarantine adherence did correlate significantly, but to a slight extent. No differences between the beginning and the end of pre-deployment quarantine were found for the overall group in respect to mental health, quarantine adherence, perceived social support and perceived unit cohesion, while their trajectories differed for different subgroups including age, gender, rank, and accumulated days of quarantine: With increasing accumulated days of isolation prior to pre-deployment quarantine, mental health declined over the course of quarantine, though to a small degree. Conclusion: Findings suggest that addressing the norms of fellow soldiers and dependents alike could contribute to quarantine adherence in pre-deployment quarantine. Ongoing research should examine long-term effects on mental health, including these of accumulated days of quarantine, also taking into account post-deployment quarantine.","BÃ¼hler, Antje, Willmund, Gerd-Dieter","https://www.google.com/search?q=Adherence+and+Psychosocial+Well-Being+During+Pandemic-Associated+Pre-deployment+Quarantine","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Frontiers in public health; 9, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25247,""
"Perimyocarditis related Corona Virus Disease: A Case Report","Background One of the ongoing outbreaks is the SARS-COV2 with clinical manifestations are dominated by pulmonary symptoms. However, some patients have reported mild to severe cardiovascular damage1. Case Summary We report a 26-year-old male with confirmed Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), who has manifestation of perimyocarditis. Diagnosis was built through clinical symptoms of fever, dyspnea, with ST elevation and PR depression on ECG, and an increase of hs-Troponin I and NT-Pro-BNP. There appeared to be a pericardial effusion on echocardiography, and an increase number of cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) during the infection. All of the perimyocarditis parameters improved when symptoms are decrease meanwhile laboratory showing improvement of inflammatory parameters (CRP, D-Dimer). Discussion Acute perimyocarditis is a reported cardiac complication of COVID-191. COVID-19 perimyocarditis associated with pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade2. Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities commonly seen with pericarditis, such as ST elevation and PR depression, may be observed in myocarditis3. Many COVID-19 patients were reported to have a detectable level of cardiac-Troponin-I as a result of oxygen supplyâ€“demand mismatch, which could precipitate ischemia that results in type 2 myocardial infarction. NT-pro-BNP level also could increase secondary to myocardial stress, a possible knock-on effect from severe respiratory illness4.","Budi, D. S.; Anggrahini, D. W.; Hartopo, A.

"Child Maltreatment and The Psychological Consequences of COVID-19 for Older Adults","Traumatic experiences in early life impact adultsâ€™ well-being and their abilities to respond to adversities over the life course. Child maltreatment is a particularly salient stressor in childhood and scholars have noted the psychological implications of such experiences that extend into late life. People who experienced maltreatment in childhood have more difficulty maintaining and developing high quality relationships, regulating their emotions, and they engage in poorer coping behaviors amidst major stressors. Our study focuses on how child maltreatment (i.e., emotional abuse;physical abuse;sexual abuse;emotional neglect) shaped older adultsâ€™ changes in depression during the early stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Using a dataset released in 2021, based on a community sample of older adults collected in September 2018 and June 2020, we found that exposures to emotional neglect (1.630;p &lt; 0.001) and emotional abuse (0.670;p &lt; 0.05) in childhood were both associated with increases in depression scores in association with the pandemic, relative to those without such exposures. In addition, the more forms of maltreatment that individuals were exposed to in childhood, the more they experienced negative psychological health consequences in association with the pandemic. Our results suggest that early life traumas play a role in how older adults respond to stressful situations. Clinical treatments for depression may be more effective if they take into consideration how these early life experiences influence exposures to new stressors in later life.","Bruefach, Tyler, Carr, Dawn, Sachs-Ericsson, Natalie","https://www.google.com/search?q=Child+Maltreatment+and+The+Psychological+Consequences+of+COVID-19+for+Older+Adults","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1004-1004, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25249,""
"Longitudinal Associations of Physical Touch with Loneliness among Older Adults","Older adults in the US face heightened risks for social disconnection, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this crisis. Physical touch is a key dimension of social connection that uniquely predicts physical and mental health benefits. However, most studies have been limited by cross-sectional designs, and no prior work has examined the long-term effects of physical touch on loneliness. To investigate the prospective association between physical touch and loneliness among older adults, this study utilized data from 1626 older adults (Mean age = 68, range = 57-85) who participated in Waves 1 and 2 of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). Participants reported on their loneliness and physical contact with family and friends, as well as with pets, at both waves. Results revealed that more frequent physical contact with family and friends predicted larger decreases in loneliness over the subsequent five years (p&lt;.0001), controlling for age, race, gender, health conditions, marital status, frequency of social interaction, and baseline levels of loneliness. Physical contact with pets had no unique effect (p=.136). To further assess directionality, models tested whether lonelier people experienced decreased touch over time, and the effects were null (p&gt;.250). Taken together, this longitudinal study is the first to identify the unique contribution of human physical touch to prospective changes in loneliness, beyond the well-established effects of covariates, including social interaction frequency. Touch represents a compelling mechanism by which social isolation may lead to loneliness, which in turn raises risks for poor health and premature mortality.","Brown, Taylor, Giddens, Reese, Wilson, Stephanie","https://www.google.com/search?q=Longitudinal+Associations+of+Physical+Touch+with+Loneliness+among+Older+Adults","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1046-1047, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25250,""
"THE â€˜WISH TO DIEâ€™ AMONGST OLDER PEOPLE IN IRELAND IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DYING WITH DIGNITY BILL","Background â€˜Wish to Dieâ€™ (WTD) involves thoughts of or wishes for oneâ€™s own death or that one would be better off dead. Assisted dying is the act of deliberately providing medical assistance to another person who wishes to end their own life. Currently, in Ireland, it is illegal to provide such assistance to people with WTD or suicidal ideation. However, a new bill that would legalise assisted dying for those with terminal illnesses, the Dying with Dignity Bill 2020, is due to be considered by lawmakers in Ireland in the coming months. In order to inform discussion around this complex issue, we examine the prevalence and longitudinal course of WTD in a large population-representative sample of older people. Methods To define WTD, participants were asked: â€˜In the last month, have you felt that you would rather be dead?â€™ Depressive symptoms were measured using the CES-D. Mortality data were compiled by linking administrative death records to individual-level survey data from the study. Results At Wave 1, 3.5% of participants (279/8,174) reported WTD. Both persistent loneliness (OR 5.73 (95% CI 3.41â€“9.64)) and depressive symptoms (OR 6.12 (95% CI 4.33â€“8.67)) were independently associated with WTD. Of participants who first reported WTD at Wave 1 or 2, 72% did not report WTD when reassessed after 2Â years, and the prevalence of depressive symptoms (-44%) and loneliness (-19%) was more likely to decline in this group at follow-up. Fifteen per cent of participants expressing WTD at Wave 1 died during a 6-year follow-up. Conclusion WTD amongst community-dwelling older people is frequently transient and is strongly linked with the course of depressive symptoms and loneliness. An enhanced focus on improving access to mental health care and addressing social isolation in older people should therefore be a public health priority, particularly in the current context of the Covid-19 pandemic.","Briggs, R.; Ward, M.; Kenny, R.

"Six-Month Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19: High Self-Reported Morbidity among Women and Younger Adults","Background Long term sequelae across multiple medical domains, including the respiratory, psychiatric, and neurocognitive have been reported after COVID-19. Studies evaluating the impact of this symptom burden, however, are lacking. We aimed to describe the self-reported occurrence of symptoms and their effect on patient functioning six months after their acute hospitalization for COVID-19. Methods From a historical cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 8, and June 14, 2020, we identified patients discharged home. The purpose of the study was explained, and they were asked to consent to a telephone questionnaire. We used a modified version of a previously validated general symptom questionnaire (GSQ-30) to assess multi-system symptom burden. The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) was used to screen for major depression. Results Of the original 565 patients, 258 patients were discharged home (45%). Of these, 57 (22%) patients were able to be contacted and agreed to participate in the survey. The mean (SD) age of the respondents was 55.1 (14.8) years, and 37 (64.9%) were female. The most common symptoms at follow-up were fatigue (60.0%), dyspnea (57.1%), feeling irritable, sad or decreased pleasure (56.4%), and memory difficulty (56.4%). Females had a significantly higher GSQ score (0.02) than males. Patients ages &lt; 60 years tended to experience similar, if not greater, impaired functioning (p=0.07) compared with those ages = 60 years (Table 1). Females were more likely to be irritable or sad (p=0.007), not feel rested on awakening (p=0.04), have shooting, stabbing and burning pain (p=0.02), have discomfort with normal light and sound (p=0.04), and have memory difficulty (p=0.04) than males (Table 2).

"A case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy due toâ€¦ fear of COVID","Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), also known as â€˜stress cardiomyopathyâ€™ or â€˜broken heart syndromeâ€™, is a frequent cause of transient ST-segment elevation, characterized by typically reversible abnormalities of segmental kinetics of the left ventricle, triggered by emotional or physical stress, with not critical stenosis at coronarography. This cardiomyopathy mainly affects women (about 90% of cases), especially in the post-menopausal age, and owes its names to the typical shape of the left ventricle in telesystole to ventriculography (â€˜takotsuboâ€™ is a Japanese term for a vessel used as an octopus trap, with a thin neck and rounded tip). The incidence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy showed a marked increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, a marked worsening of anxiety and depressive symptoms in the general population was recorded during the lockdown. In April 2020, an 86-year-old woman was admitted to the Coronary Intensive Care Unit of our hospital. Her remote medical history shows: arterial hypertension, previous breast cancer, operated and treated with adjuvant radiotherapy and hormone therapy, and cervical cancer, subjected to radical hysterectomy and subsequent pelvic radiotherapy. Upon entering the ward, the patient was in a state of shock (BP 75/50 mmHg, HR 105/m') and there was marked hypothermia (34 Â°C). The relatives reported that the patient did not leave home since the beginning of the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic due to the high fear of contracting the infection and in the day before admission she had a feverish rise (39 Â°C), which regressed spontaneously. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with ST-segment elevation V2â€“V6, in I and aVL and under level in III and aVR (Figure 1) with elongated QT interval. Echocardiogram revealed akinesia of the mid-apical segments, with kinetics preserved in the basal segments, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction: 25%), moderate dual-jet mitral insufficiency due to symmetrical tethering of the flaps and a mild infero-lateral pericardial effusion. The indices of myocardionecrosis and inflammation were high. The patient was asymptomatic for chest pain and equivalents and expressed an excessive fear of having contracted COVID-19. Nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was performed, which was negative. The interTAK score was 68 (Takotsubo probability: 82.4%). Emergency coronary angiography was performed, which showed no critical coronary stenosis. Ventriculography revealed apical dyskinesia with hyperkinesis of the basal segments (Figure 2). At the end of the procedure due to hemodynamic instability an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed and inotropic and vasopressor therapy was undertaken. Over the next 48 h there were numerous episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and amiodarone was applied for the onset of atrial fibrillation, with prompt restoration of the sinus rhythm. The patient was progressively weaned from the mechanical and pharmacological support of the circulation and she was discharged in optimal medical therapy, with indication for echocardiographic follow-up, still in progress.","Bava, Annita, Postorino, Stefano, Lanteri, Sebastiano, Ciancia, Francesco, Benedetto, Francesco Antonio","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+case+of+takotsubo+cardiomyopathy+due+toâ€¦+fear+of+COVID","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology; 23(Suppl G), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25253,""
"A case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in SARS-CoV-2 infection","Cardiovascular complications are a frequent occurrence in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also known as stress cardiomyopathy) is a possible cause of transient ST segment elevation (1â€“3% of total cases) and is characterized by a reversible left ventricular dysfunction with coronary arteries free from critical stenosis. The predominant echocardiographic pattern of this cardiomyopathy is an akinesia of the mid-apical myocardial segments (â€˜apical ballooningâ€™), with preserved kinetics of the basal segments. The incidence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy showed a marked increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data showed that three factors mainly contribute to the onset of cardiomyopathy in patients with COVID-19: cytokine storm, adrenergic hyperactivation and microvascular dysfunction. A 79-year-old woman was hospitalized in the Pneumology department of our hospital for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to bilateral interstitial pneumonia SARS-CoV-2 related. In remote medical history: in 2010 diagnosis of breast cancer, treated with quadrantectomy, adjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy, with negative follow-up for disease recovery, systemic arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and from 2016 syndrome of reduced mobility as a result of a previous ischaemic stroke. Non-invasive mechanical ventilation with c-PAP was started in the ward and, for the detection of anterolateral electrocardiographic anomalies (diffuse symmetrical negative T waves. Figure) and an increase in myocardionecrosis markers (troponin I peak: 5.4 ng/ml), in the absence of chest pain or equivalent, echocardiographic evaluation was performed, which revealed an akinesia of the mid-apical segments of the left ventricle with preserved kinetics of the basal segments and severely depressed global systolic function (ejection fraction: 30%). BNP (18.100 pg/ml), interleukin-6 (339 pg/ml), and CRP (136 mg/l) were elevated on blood chemistry tests. In the suspicion of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (InterTAK Score: 67, probability: 79.8%), cardioprotective therapy with ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, diuretics, low molecular weight heparin, double antiaggregation, and statin was started, deferring coronary angiography to improve clinical conditions. In the following days, due to the respiratory and haemodynamic worsening, the patient was transferred to an intensive setting, where she was intubated and treated with levosimendan and noradrenaline. In the intensive care unit, serial echocardiograms (over 30 days) showed a progressive improvement, up to normalization, of the global systolic function (ejection fraction at the last checkup: 55%), with complete regression of the kinetic anomalies, confirming the diagnostic hypothesis of stress cardiomyopathy. For a pulmonary mycotic superinfection (positive bronchoaspirate for Candida albicans and Candida krusei), complicated by iatrogenic pneumothorax, in the following days the patient died.","Bava, Annita, DaffinÃ , Maria Grazia, Cama, Giuseppe, Dieni, Dario, Barreca, Filippo, Calipari, Nicola, Sculli, Mariangela, Dattola, Vincenzo, Luppino, Alessio, Ripepi, Maria, Battaglia, Carmelo","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+case+of+Takotsubo+cardiomyopathy+in+SARS-CoV-2+infection","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: European heart journal supplements : journal of the European Society of Cardiology; 23(Suppl G), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25254,""
"Cumulative Effect of Loneliness and Social Isolation on Health Outcomes among Older Adults","Loneliness and social isolation are described similarly yet are distinct constructs. Numerous studies examine each construct separately;however, less research has been dedicated to exploring their impacts together. Using survey and claims data among adults age 65+ (N=6,994), the cumulative effects of loneliness and social isolation on late-life health outcomes were examined using Chi-square and multivariate regression models. Loneliness and social isolation were measured using the UCLA-3 Loneliness Scale and the Social Network Index. Participants were grouped into four categories of loneliness and social isolation based on overlap, including: lonely only (L), socially isolated only (SI), both lonely and socially isolated (LSI), or neither (N). Outcomes included quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs. Among participants, 9.8% were considered L, 20.6% SI, 9.1% LSI, and 60.5% N. Respondents were primarily female (55.0%) and 70-74 years of age (27.1%). Those considered LSI were more likely to be older, female, less healthy, depressed, with lower quality of life and greater healthcare utilization patterns. Participants who were L or LSI had higher rates of emergency room visits compared to the N group;LSI had the highest medical costs. Results demonstrate the cumulative effects of loneliness and social isolation among older adults. Findings not only fill a gap in research exploring the impacts of these constructs later in life, but also confirm the need for approaches targeting older adults who are both lonely and socially isolated. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, this priority will continue to be urgent for older adults.","Barnes, Timothy, MacLeod, Stephanie, Tkatch, Rifky, Ahuja, Manik, Albright, Laurie, Schaeffer, James, Yeh, Charlotte","https://www.google.com/search?q=Cumulative+Effect+of+Loneliness+and+Social+Isolation+on+Health+Outcomes+among+Older+Adults","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):920-920, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25255,""

Participants 387 healthcare professionals were randomly selected. Outcome measures Prevalence and determinant factors of depression, anxiety and stress was assessed. Result Depression, anxiety and stress prevalence were shown to be 50.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 45.0% to 55.0%), 55.0% (95% CI 51.1% to 59.9%) and 38.5% (95% CI 33.6% to 43.2%), respectively. Being female (adjusted odd ratio (AOR) 3.71, 95% CI 2.31 to 5.97), married (AOR 2.28, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.86), living alone (AOR 1.87, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.20), nurses (AOR 2.94, 95% CI 1.44 to 5.99) and working in inpatients (AOR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.93) were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Moreover, older age groups (AOR 3.15, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.56), females (AOR 3.25, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.25), married (AOR 1.69, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.87) and nurses (AOR 3.32, 95% CI 1.63 to 6.78) were significantly associated with symptoms of anxiety. Stress symptoms were significantly high among females (AOR 2.47, 95% CI 1.53 to 3.97), married (AOR 2.77, 95% CI 1.60 to 4.78), living alone (AOR 2.01, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.52), nurses (AOR 2.34, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.92) and working in units other than emergency (inpatient (AOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.57) and other units (AOR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95)). Conclusion The current study found that healthcare professionals have high levels of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. Sex, age, marital status, type of profession, living status and working environment were significant factors for mental health problems in healthcare professionals during the pandemic. Healthcare professionals require mental health support at which monitoring and control can be performed during and after the pandemic.","Ayalew, Mohammed, Deribe, Bedilu, Abraham, Yacob, Reta, Yared, Tadesse, Fikru, Defar, Semira, Hoyiso, Dawit, Ashegu, Tebeje","https://www.google.com/search?q=Prevalence+and+determinant+factors+of+mental+health+problems+among+healthcare+professionals+during+COVID-19+pandemic+in+southern+Ethiopia:+multicentre+cross-sectional+study","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: BMJ open; 11(12), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25256,""
"Associations between adolescentsâ€™ prosocial experiences and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Natural disasters and times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, are extremely stressful events, with severe mental health consequences. However, such events also provide opportunities for prosocial support between citizens, which may be related to mental health symptoms and interpersonal needs. We examined adolescentsâ€™ prosocial experiences as both actors and recipients during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed whether these experiences were associated with indicators of mental health. Adolescents (N = 426;78% female) aged 13 to 20Â years (Mage = 16.43, SD = 1.10;63.6% White, 12.9% Hispanic/Latinx, 8.5% Asian, 4.2% Black, 2.8% Native American) were recruited across the US in early April of 2020. Participants reported on their COVID-19 prosocial experiences (helping others, receiving help) and mental health (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, burdensomeness, belongingness). Multiple regression models indicated greater engagement in COVID-19 prosocial behavior was associated with greater anxiety symptoms and greater burdensomeness. Receiving more COVID-19 help was associated with lower depressive symptoms and higher belongingness. Findings highlight the importance of furthering our understanding of the nuanced connections between prosocial experiences and adolescentsâ€™ mental health to help inform post-pandemic recovery and relief efforts.

"Increased psychological distress after the lifting of COVID-19 lockdown in the Saudi population: a cross-sectional study","Background Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its global health and socioeconomic aftereffects, the enduring state of crisis is increasingly impacting the coping capacity of the populations. In this study, we aimed to characterize the levels of psychological distress after the lifting of COVID-19 lockdown. Results The Impact of Event Scale (IES-R) and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21 items (DASS-21) were used to screen for post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and stress. The prevalence of PTSD was 41.6% and was associated with severe or extremely severe stress (27.8%), anxiety (31.4%), and depression (39.0%). All disorders were strongly correlated with one another. The risk of developing PTSD was independently associated with residence in high COVID-19 prevalence region (OR = 2.25, p = 0.004), poor (OR = 3.98, p = 0.002), or moderate (OR = 1.63, p = 0.048) self-assessed overall physical health, psychiatric comorbidity (OR = 1.87, p = 0.036), number of COVID-19-like symptoms (OR = 1.94, p = 0.039), and severe COVID-19 morbidity in the acquaintances (OR = 1.54, p = 0.026). Four theories were proposed to explain these high figures, with a discussion of their practical implications. Conclusions The lifting of lockdown measures was associated with a substantial increase in psychological distress among the Saudi population, referring to figures reported during the lockdown. This may indicate a decline in the overall populationâ€™s coping capacity with the enduring crisis.

"Vulnerability and Resilience Among Older Adults During the COVID Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is particularly challenging for many older adults. They are strongly encouraged to practice social distancing and sheltering in place to decrease morbidity and mortality risks. However, social isolation and loneliness increase the risk of mental and physical health problems. Nonetheless, there are indications that older adults may be more resilient than originally thought. Park et al. present longitudinal findings that younger adults fared worse than middle-aged or older ones, reporting greater distress and less social support, mindfulness, and emotion regulation skills. For older participants, acceptance of negative emotions and social support predicted lower distress. Choun et al. also present longitudinal data, showing that depressive symptoms decreased among older adults during the lockdown phase of the pandemic, but reflected changes in loneliness and physical health symptoms. Stellman et al. found that moderate levels of combat experience were helpful for some older Vietnam veterans coping with the pandemic, although a few found that it made coping more difficult. Turner et al. found that positive, non-familial intergenerational contacts were associated with a higher number of positive pandemic-related changes, such as finding new hobbies and meaning in work. Finally, Aldwin et al. present a social ecological approach to vulnerability and resilience. Using qualitative data, they found that stressors and resources were reported at personal, interpersonal and societal levels. Further, older adults both took comfort from and contributed to community resources during this pandemic. In summary, this symposium identified factors that contribute to older adultsâ€™ resilience during this pandemic.","Aldwin, Carolyn","https://www.google.com/search?q=Vulnerability+and+Resilience+Among+Older+Adults+During+the+COVID+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):130-130, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25259,""
"Children's Loss of Parents and Caregivers to COVID-19: 'A Hidden Pandemic'","The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating impacts on individuals, communities, countries, and the globe. Children are among those who have been affected. Although less likely than adults to become ill or die from COVID-19, children have suffered in the areas of financial security, education, and mental health. Additionally, recent estimates point to the startling numbers of children who have suffered the loss of a parent or primary caregiver as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Moving Crisis to Opportunities: A Corporate Perspective on the Impact of Compassionate Empathic Behaviour on the Well-Being of Employees","The recent raging pandemic has disrupted the world economy in a humongous way causing socio-psychological stressors affecting the mental well-being of employees. The fear of losing jobs due to economic shutdowns, or facing challenges of digitisation of the workplace, or fear of contaminating illness generated a feeling of despair and panic to more serious paranoia behaviour amongst the employees. The present study aims at investigating how did the leadership use prosocial empathic skills during this pandemic to manage the mental well-being of their respective employees, so that they are motivated and engaged for meaningful performance. The major themes that emerged from the structured interviews of the apex leadership were (1) compassionate empathic behaviour impacts the employee motivation and performance;(2) open, honest and timely vertical communication promotes trust and bonding;(3) support for employee autonomy impacts their well-being;(4) encouraging competence and self-efficacy in employees;(5) promoting positive and healthy relationships by displaying compassionate empathy positively impacts mental health and thereby employee performance during crisis. Right from providing unified Communication platform, to displaying empathic leadership, the apex leadership unanimously believes that people are their best assets and if managed well in the crisis can help them stem the storm successfully.

"Family Caregiver Health in a Pandemic","Each year family caregivers provide care and services worth billions of dollars to support the needs of older Americans. Their support is invaluable to keep individuals in the community for as long as possible and to allow individuals to attain and maintain their highest practicable level of well-being. But what impact does caregiving have on oneâ€™s health? Does caregiver health decline with the assumption of caregiving duties? Did caregiver health change during the pandemic? If so, how and what factors are associated with declines in caregiver health? To answer these questions, an exploratory survey was conducted among a convenience sample of 195 family caregiver. Almost a third of those sampled reported excellent or very good health, while 44% reported good health, and almost a quarter reported poor or fair health. Forty-eight percent reported their health had declined since they assumed caregiving duties and 29% reported their health had declined during the pandemic. Employed caregivers and those experiencing less depression/anxiety reported better health. Those experiencing a decline in health with caregiving were more likely to be female, not employed, experienced more stress and more depression/anxiety. Those experiencing a decline in health during the pandemic reported less spirituality, greater attachment related avoidance, and greater depression/anxiety. Findings from this research can be used to inform future research on the effect of the pandemic on family caregiving and to plan interventions to protect caregiver health as they provide vital services to maintain individuals in the community for as long as possible.","Cassie, Kimberly","https://www.google.com/search?q=Family+Caregiver+Health+in+a+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Innovation in aging; 5(Suppl 1):1013-1013, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25268,""
"P0029 Age and sex differences in the use of anxiolytics and antidepressant drugs during COVID-19 lockdown in The Netherlands","Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) poses great demands on medical care and resulted in delayed prescribing. Objective: To evaluate the number of newly dispensed antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs among the Dutch population, before and during COVID-19. Methods: Pharmacy dispensing data was obtained from Stichting Farmaceutische Kentallen on newly dispended antidepressants and anxiolytics, covering 96% of the Dutch population. The number and week of first-time dispensed drugs were determined for the period January â€“ June 2019 and 2020, and age and sex of patients was recorded. Using independent t-tests, data was compared between men and women, age groups, and between 2019 and 2020. Age groups considered were children (0-9 years old), adolescents (10-19 years old), adults (20-64 years old), and elderly (65 year and older). Three time periods were considered: week 1-11 (in 2020 corresponding to the pre-COVID-19 lockdown period), week 12-19 (in 2020 corresponding to the COVID-19 lockdown), and week 20-26 (in 2020 corresponding to the post-COVID-19 lockdown). Results: An overall reduction was observed in 2020 for the number of newly dispensed antidepressants (139.186 in 2019 and 126.487 in 2020, respectively) and anxiolytics (200.661 in 2019 and 189.559 in 2020, respectively). In both 2019 and 2020, the drugs were significantly more often dispensed to women than men, and most were prescribed to adults followed by the elderly. For antidepressants, in both male and female adolescents, adults and elderly, for week 1-11 no significant differences were found between 2019 and 2020. Compared to 2019, a significant reduction in the number of dispensed antidepressants was seen in during 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in these groups (p&lt;0.05). In adolescents, but not for the other age groups, a significant reduction in dispensing was also found post COVID-19 lockdown (p&lt;0.001). For children, a general reduction in the number of dispensed antidepressant drugs was seen in 2020 before and during COVID-19 lockdown (p&lt;0.001). In male children there was a significant reduction in dispensing during COVID-19 lockdown (p=0.04), which was not significant among female children. For anxiolytics, in both male and female children and adolescents, a general reduction of dispensing was seen throughout 2020 (p&lt;0.05). In male adults, in 2020 a significant reduction in dispensing was found during COVID-19 lockdown (p=0.01), and for both male and female adults post-COVID-19 lockdown (p&lt;0.05). For elderly, no significant differences in dispending were found between 2019 and 2020. Conclusions: Across all age groups a significant reduction was seen for the number of newly dispensed antidepressant drugs. For all age groups except the elderly a significant reduction in dispensed anxiolytic drugs was seen during COVID-19 lockdown. This data corresponds with reports of delayed care. However, in elderly no reduction was found for dispensed anxiolytics during COVID-19 lockdown. Future research should determine if the continued dispensing of anxiolytics among elderly during lockdown may reflect the fact that fear of COVID-19 may be greater among this age group, as they are over-represented in COVID-19 related hospital admissions and have the highest mortality rates.

"P0492 Impact of mood and stress during COVID-19 lockdown on perceived immune fitness and the presence and severity of COVID-19 symptoms","Background: To address the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) around the world, in the absence of a vaccine or adequate treatment for the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), many governments around the world enforced lockdown periods. While lockdowns are beneficial in reducing the spread of the virus, literature shows that lockdowns may also have a significant negative impact on mood, wellbeing, and health. In this context, we hypothesized that negative mood changes increase overall stress levels, which in turn has a negative effect on perceived immune fitness, expressed in a greater presence and severity of COVID-19 symptoms [1]. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of mood and stress during COVID-19 lockdown on perceived immune fitness and reported COVID-19 symptoms. Methods: An online retrospective survey was held among Dutch adults, to evaluate the first lockdown in The Netherlands [1]. Questions were answered for the period before the lockdown (15 Januaryâ€“14 March 2020) as well as for the lockdown period (15 Marchâ€“11 May 2020). Mood was assessed via 1-item scales including â€œstressâ€, â€œanxietyâ€, â€œdepressionâ€, â€œfatigueâ€, â€œhostileâ€, â€œlonelyâ€ and â€œhappyâ€ [2]. Perceived immune fitness was assessed on a scale ranging from 0 (very poor) to 10 (excellent) [3]. The COVID-19 Symptoms Scale comprised the items sneezing, running nose, sore throat, cough, and malaise/feeling sick, high temperature (up to 38 Celsius), fever (38 Celsius and higher), shortness of breath, and chest pain [1]. The severity of each of the nine items could be rated as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). The sum score of items served as COVID-19 symptom severity score, with a possible range from 0 (no complaints) to 27 (severe complaints). In addition, the presence of COVID-19 symptoms was calculated by counting the number of symptoms with a score &gt; 0. Assessments before and during COVID19 lockdown were compared using the Related Samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. For each variable, difference scores (<U+0394>, lockdown â€“ before lockdown) were calculated. Pearson's correlations were calculated between difference scores. Results: Data of 1415 Dutch adults (64% women, age range: 18 to 94 years old) were analyzed. During lockdown, all mood ratings, stress, and perceived immune fitness were significantly poorer compared to the period before lockdown (p&lt;0.0001). The COVID-19 symptom severity score as significantly higher during the lockdown period (p=0.018), but no difference was found for the number of reported COVID-19 symptoms (p=0.256). Significant correlations were found between mood changes and <U+0394> stress (r ranged from 0.334 to 0.557, all p&lt;0.0001). The correlation between <U+0394> stress and <U+0394> perceived immune fitness was also significant (r=-0.310, p&lt;0.0001). Finally, <U+0394> perceived immune fitness correlated significantly with difference scores for the presence (r=-0.223, p&lt;0.0001) and severity (r=-0.245, p&lt;0.0001) of COVID-19 related symptoms.

"COVID-19 In Hemodialysis Patients","The COVID-19 outbreak poses a significant risk in this patient population, as dialysis patients are older and frequently have significant comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cerebrovascular disease. Impaired lymphocyte and granulocyte functions due to the uremic environment in chronic kidney patients lead to immune system dysfunction and infections may lead to more negative clinical outcomes in dialysis patients. In many large-scale observational studies, the incidence of COVID-19 is higher among hemodialysis (HD) patients, and the infection is more fatal in this patient cohort. Many nephrology societies have recommendations for the prevention, mitigation and control of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic that emerged in hemodialysis centers. Methods such as peritoneal dialysis and home HD stand in front of us as an attractive, alternative method in order to minimize the COVID-19 infection in kidney patients. A significant proportion of HD patients with COVID-19 may not develop symptoms. This situation stands before us as a serious problem that can cause a delay in diagnosis and an epidemic in the center.

"The Experience of Our Cardiovascular Surgery Intensive Care in Preoperative False-Negative and Asymptomatic Patients with SARS-COV-2 Infection","Objective: There is little data in the literature on the effects of COVID-19 in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Our aim in this study is to describe the post-cardiac surgical effects of COVID-19, the basic characteristics of the patients and their laboratory findings;and also to discuss the mechanism underlying the poor diagnostic performance of rRT-PCR. Methods: The data of 191 patients who were operated between 18 May 2020- 07 June 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 12 patients who were asymptomatic and rRT-PCR (-) preoperatively and rRT-PCR positive postoperatively were included. Patients who required emergency operation, did not perform rRT-PCR in the preoperative period or had rRT-PCR (+), had outpatient surgery were not included. The patientsâ€™ age, operation, length of stay in the ICU, intubation times, echocardiography, blood gas and biochemistry results and PCR results were recorded. Results: In the study, postoperative rRT-PCR was studied from 87 patients and the result was (+) in 12 (13.8%) patients. Two of 12 (16.7%) patients died due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. While the mean values of preoperative leukocytes (7.78 103/mcL), lymphocytes (1.52 103/mcL) and CRP (49.27mg/dL) were within the normal range, the mean values of ferritin (823 ng/ml) and D-Dimer (1138 ng/ml) were above the normal range. Conclusion: We recommend that patients has to be isolated for at least 7 days before the operation. Also sputum samples from the tracheal tube should be studied simultaneously nasopharyngeal PCR samples in the preoperative and the early postoperative period in order to minimize false negative PCR results.

"COVID-19 and Vaccine","The most important of the ten great public health achievements today is vaccination. Vaccination is an example of social solidarity as well as providing individual protection against disease. If the rate of immunization with the vaccine is as high as 85-95% in a society, vulnerable populations who are not vaccinated are also protected. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which caused the COVID-19 disease, continues to spread with new mutations despite all individual and national measures taken. Since there is no effective antiviral drug yet, the most important method of fighting the disease is vaccination. In a short period of one year, COVID-19 vaccines were developed and started to be used on a global scale with emergency use approval. The discovery of a pandemic vaccine in such a short time is a great achievement for humanity. A total of 408 vaccine studies are currently available, including preclinical studies in 60 countries. The number of vaccines currently in clinical phase studies is 138 (Phase 1: 36, Phase 2: 65, Phase 3: 31). 6 vaccine studies, which are in clinical phase studies, have been terminated. 21 vaccines have been approved for immediate use. Among these vaccine candidates, in addition to the traditional methods, there are also new technologies that have never been licensed before.

"Cardiovascular diseases, social and demographic factors, and quality of life in convalescents of COVID-19-associated pneumonia three months after hospital discharge","COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019), highly contagious disease with an unpredictable course, leads to damage of different organs and systems, adversely impacting the daily life of patients and reducing the quality of life (QOL). Objective. To study the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and their relation to QOL in convalescents of documented COVID19-associated pneumonia depending on sex and age three months after hospital discharge. Material and methods. The study included 102 convalescents of SARS-COV-2-induced pneumonia three months after hospital discharge. Fifty percent were females;the mean age was 46.53Ã‚Â±15.86 years. Data were obtained during the ""Prospective surveillance of convalescents of COVID-19-associated pneumonia"". Three age categories have been identified to calculate pairwise age comparisons: group 1 - 19-39 years old, group 2 - 40-59 years old, group 3 - 60-84 years old. QOL was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. Signs of anxiety and depression were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) diagnostic scales. Results. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) were identified in 48% of patients;arterial hypertension (44%) and chronic heart failure (24.5%) were the most common. Signs of anxiety and depression were observed in more than 25% of patients, signs of stress in less than 10%. The highest incidence of CVDs was observed in the older age group (group 3): the most common were arterial hypertension (18.6%;p&lt;0.01), coronary heart disease (11.8%, p=0.01), and chronic heart failure functional class I-II (NYHA) (10.8%;p&lt;0.01). The physical component of health in group 1 was significantly higher vs. group 2 (p=0.03) and group 3 (p&lt;0.01). The correlation between SF-36 physical health scores and the number of CVDs was statistically significant, as was the relationship between age and QOL. In addition, there were higher correlation coefficients between QOL values and age than between QOL values and the number of concomitant CVDs. The results of the multivariate analysis showed that the physical component of health is only significantly affected by age. In patients with CVD, lower QOL scores were related to physical health. The QOL values in females vs. males were significantly lower on indicators reflecting psychological, physical, and social aspects of health. The significantly lower QOL values, reflecting psychological health, were determined in patients with the signs of anxiety and depression. Overall, the psychological component of health was significantly impacted by levels of depression and stress. Higher scores of the physical functioning scale (p=0.03) were observed in married patients. Among non-working patients, pain intensity scale values were significantly lower (p=0.04) vs. working patients. Conclusions. In convalescents of COVID-19 pneumonia three months after hospital discharge, low indices of the physical aspect of QOL have stronger relation to age and cardiovascular comorbidity. The psychological aspect of QOL is worsened due to stress and emotional disorders. No effect of COVID-19-associated pneumonia course severity on QOL was found. All aspects of QOL are lower in females vs. males. Having a spouse and working activities were identified as factors improving QOL.

"The History of Mental Epidemiology","The article analyzes the development of mental epidemiology, the practice of psychological support for the population during pandemics at different historical stages. The time frame of the study ranges from 430-426, when the outbreak of the Athenian plague occurred, until now - the 2019-2020 COVID-19 pandemic. It turns out that the emergence of all kinds of methods of psychological work with the population during such social crises was preceded by an epidemic of viral infections, various diseases and other adverse events that, in one way or another, disrupt the mental balance and well--being of the world community. The key problems that existed in the practice of providing psychological assistance and support to the population during different types and scales of epidemics and pandemics were identified. Based on the results of the analysis, some directions for improving the policy in the field of maintaining the mental health of the population during periods of epidemics, pandemics and social crises are proposed.","Li, Z.

"COVID-19 Pandemic and Pilot Mental Health Care","When the COVID-19 crisis hit air transport, the whole aviation industry was affected. The change in the behavior of passengers following the COVID-19 crisis, travel restrictions and the ensuing economic crisis have resulted in a dramatic drop in demand for airline services. The COVID-19 pandemic, with all its associated consequences, has had a significant impact on the mental health and well-being of pilots, which could impact operational safety. As the number of international flights has decreased, pilots are exposed to high levels of psychological stress such as job instability, reduced income and increased risk of infection during flight work. Psychological stress lowers work performance and threatens aviation safety. The pilot needs mental health management during the COVID-19 pandemic, but psychological support is weak. For pilot mental health management, it is important to raise awareness about mental health and to continuously respond. To this end, it is necessary to foster a safe and trustworthy culture in which mental health issues are discussed freely and solved together without hiding them. They should also support the establishment of a peer support program that is easily accessible and that allows pilots to discuss their issues with confidence.

"Fear and behavioral self-assessment for care in the face of the covid-19 health emergency in the population of azogues","The aim was to determine the effect of fear and behavioral self-evaluation in the care in the face of the health emergency due to COVID-19 in the population of Azogues, as well as the generation of a nursing care plan with a health promotion approach for the prevention. A quantitative, descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional, and non-experimental study was carried out with a sample made up of 438 adults residing in the canton of Azogues. The questionnaires fear of the coronavirus-19 scales (FCV-19S) and the behavioral self-assessment for care in the face of the health emergency COVID-19 were applied. Data collection was carried out using the survey technique, virtual format. Informed consent was requested online, after completing the survey. An internal consistency of 0.82 was obtained on the COVID-19 Fear Scale and 0.88 for the behavioral selfassessment scale for care in the face of the COVID-19 health emergency. The analysis indicates of the total of 438 people studied, 26.48% are afraid of COVID-19, and in the behavioral self-assessment for care in the face of the health emergency COVID-19 they indicate that 6.85% are not taking care of themselves adequately. In the behavioral self-assessment for care in the face of the COVID-19 health emergency, significant differences were evidenced with the place of residence (urban vs rural) and occupation. In conclusion, adherence to self-care and biosafety measures in the study population helps to reduce fear levels and improve mental health in the face of COVID-19.","GonzÃ¡lez-LeÃ³n, F.

"Quality Evaluation of Online Mental Health Education Based on Reinforcement Learning in the Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the biggest major health crises reported due its massive impact on many countries. From mental health experts, we know that we cannot lose sight of an equally alarming issue which is the long-term mental health impact the pandemic is going to leave on the society. The rapid spread of the pandemic gives little chance to prepare for or even process all that has happened in terms of job losses and the complete uprooting of everyday life and relationships. It is understandable that students may feel irritable, frustrated, or sad sometimes. Loneliness, confusion, and anxiety are also common, but the issue is how we can know if students' emotions are a normal reaction to an abnormal situation. Therefore, online mental health education has become pretty important for students during the pandemic. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate the quality of online mental health education through microlessons. In this paper, based on Q-learning algorithm, the real-time adaptive bitrate (ABR) configuration parameters mechanism is proposed to detect the changes of network state constantly and select the optimal precalculated configuration according to the current network state. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm based on Q-learning outperforms other baselines in average latency, average bitrate, and Mean Opinion Score (MOS) on Chrome DevTools and Clumsy. Meanwhile, the experimental results also reveal that the average number of identified mental health problems of the proposed mechanism has always been the best with the bandwidth from 10 Mbit/s to 500 Mbit/s.

"CHICAGO FIREARM DEATHS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","There were overall similar numbers of firearm homicides, with months during the SAH order seeing fewer suicides and the month following the SAH seeing more suicides. We hypothesized there would be a greater number of both firearm homicides and suicides in Chicago during the COVID-19 pandemic and SAH order. Chicago also had increased firearm purchases during this time, a risk factor for homicide and suicide.

"Media use and emotional distress under COVID-19 lockdown in a clinical sample referred for internalizing disorders: A Swiss adolescents' perspective","The COVID-19 outbreak has profoundly affected adolescents' life. Adolescents with pre-existing psychiatric disorders have been at particular risk of increased mental health problems and problematic media use. 178 patients, aged 12â€“18 years, referred before the COVID-19 outbreak to child and adolescent psychiatry, participated in an anonymous online survey on the impact of the lockdown on media use and mental well-being. The survey was conducted approximately one month after the first easing of restrictions following a six-week lockdown in Switzerland. Based on self-report, half of the patients had been diagnosed with internalizing disorders (ID;depression or anxiety disorder) and the other half with other disorders (non-ID, e.g. ADHD, autistic spectrum disorder). Patients with ID reported higher emotional distress during the lockdown, and a larger number of patients with ID indicated a deterioration of pre-existing symptoms compared to non-ID patients. Although more patients with ID than with non-ID indicated spending a large amount of time on social media, social media time per day in hours was not significantly higher in ID. Patients with ID indicated a higher impact of media use on well-being and mood in everyday life during the lockdown. Social media time was higher in worsened than in improved non-ID patients, while the opposite was found in ID patients, indicating a possible protective effect of media use at least for some ID patients. The results confirm positive as well as negative associations between mental health, emotional well-being and media use for adolescents with ID during the lockdown.","Werling, Anna Maria, Walitza, Susanne, Gerstenberg, Miriam, GrÃ¼nblatt, Edna, Drechsler, Renate","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.01.004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25281,""
"P0435 Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a comprehensive review","Background and Aims: The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 is having unprecedented effects in healthcare systems, economies and society [1]. Although the respiratory tract is the primary target of SARS-CoV-2, emerging evidence suggests that the virus may also invade the central nervous system (CNS), leading to numerous neurological issues [2]. In particular, people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are vulnerable group at risk of contracting COVID-19 and present more severe forms and worse outcomes. Social isolation measures (e.g., visitation bans, stay-at-home orders, and lockdowns in care facilities), which are necessary for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing thus the disease transmission, could cause an imbalance in the lifestyle and mental health, increasing the risk of hospitalization and mortality for people suffering from AD [3]. This situation can cause a wide range of psychological and clinical problems, such as agitation, anxiety, irritability, delirium, aggressiveness, depression and sleep disorders that may contribute to the acceleration of neurodegenerative processes. Given the high prevalence of AD individuals affected by COVID-19, the present review provides an updated overview on published literature on the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in patients affected by AD. Methods: A literature search was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed database in English language was searched for publications before 6st April 2021 using the keywords: â€œAlzheimer's diseaseâ€ AND â€œCOVID-19â€ AND â€œpsychologyâ€. Reviews, clinical studies and meta-analyses were also included with no geographic limitations. All fields were selected and no other filters were applied. Results: A total number of 83 published manuscripts were included (67 research articles, 14 reviews, 1 clinical study and 1 meta-analysis). As expected, the majority of AD patients were women. Interestingly, a general function and cognitive decline has been often observed in demented subjects, leading to an impaired performance in activities of daily living. In regard with the most frequently reported behavioral symptoms related to social distancing, AD patients presented increased mood, sadness, apathy, agitation, hallucinations, anxiety, irritability, sleep disorders such as insomnia or sleep-wake cycle alterations. In addition, these symptoms were greater in patients affected by moderate or severe AD. Conclusions: Current literature reported an increased burden of behavioral symptoms in the majority of AD patients, suggesting a complex and bidirectional relationship with COVID-19. These symptoms were probably triggered by deprivation or reduced social contact, loneliness during the lockdowns, decreased daily activities, lack of physical contact with family members. In turn, an impaired cognitive performances may exacerbate mental health concerns in these patients, which may accelerate the neurodegeneration in AD patients. Therefore, during and after the pandemic, implementation of caregiver support, the presence of skilled nursing home staff or the implementation of new technology solutions are essential to maintain social interaction and to provide adequate support to people suffering from AD.

"P0501 COVID-19 and grieving in children and adolescents â€“ non-systematic review","Background: For some children and adolescents, the deaths related to COVID-19 are their first experience with death. And the loss of a loved one during this pandemic comes with extra-challenges such as COVID-19 death characteristics (e.g., intensive care admission, unexpected death, impossibility to visit the hospitals) and circumstances (e.g., secondary stressors, social isolation, deprivation of many funeral rites). This may precipitate a worldwide increase of prolonged grief disorder and persistent complex bereavement disorder. And children may in fact be at a higher risk for mental health effects, given their limited capacity to understand their surroundings, cope with stressors, and control their environments. Methods: Bibliographic research in English, in the platforms PubMed, Web of science and Science Direct with the following search strategy: (mourning OR grieving OR grief OR bereavement) AND (Covid-19 OR coronavirus) AND (children OR adolescent). The studies where selected based on their relevance and the results are presented in a narrative form. Results: We retrieved 385 articles after excluding duplicates. After evaluating the title and s we included 10 articles in this review, including 2 case reports. No systematic reviews were retrieved. Victims of the virus will likely leave behind a large number of grieving children and grandchildren, with rates of 2.2 children and 4.1 grandchildren bereaved for each person who dies. In usual circumstances, bereavement would result in mental health conditions for only a minority of this group. The particular circumstances associated with COVID-19 deaths may constitute a significant risk factor for children's grief process, as research shows that unexpected and sudden losses or multiples deaths in the family are particularly impactful. Of central concern is the transformation of normal grief and distress into prolonged grief and persistent complex bereavement. A mediating factor in this type of reaction in young people is the lack of social support at the time of loss, which may be intensified due to current social limitations and exhaustion of emotional resources in the caregivers (e.g., parents). This pandemic has accelerated many of the risk factors for complicated grieve. Social isolation has become a global policy, collective structures for grieving have been difficult or impossible to access, young people have been forced to say goodbye to loved ones via electronic devices. Pre-Covid, research had established that young people from disadvantaged backgrounds were more likely to lose a parent early in life and to suffer from complicated grieve due to fewer opportunities to bounce back. Covid-19 has impacted disadvantaged communities significantly and consequently, a significantly elevated risk of complicated grieve for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds is expected. Conclusions: It is likely that the effects of COVID-19 deaths on childrenÂ´s and adolescents mental health will be profound. And given the traumatic and unexpected nature of Covid-19 deaths, we may see a rise in the numbers of complicated grieve. Future research in this area is needed and should include observational and epidemiologic studies as well as a literature review on complicated grieve and young people during and in the aftermath of this pandemic.

"CHALLENGE: A phase III study of the impact of a physical activity program on disease-free survival in patients with high-risk stage II or stage III colon cancer: A randomized controlled trial (NCIC CTG CO21)","Aims: To determine the efficacy of physical activity (PA) in reducing disease recurrence in patients with localised colon cancer. Our primary hypothesis is that a PA program will improve disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with resected stage II (high risk) and III colon cancer who have completed adjuvant therapy. In addition, we hypothesise that exercise can improve fatigue, quality of life (QOL), physical functioning and body composition. Methods : An international multi-centre phase 3 RCT primarily between Australia and Canada. Subjects are randomised to PA program or standard care. Primary objective compares DFS between patients in PA and control arms. Key secondary objectives are to compare: 1. fatigue, QOL, depression, anxiety, sleep, body composition, exercise behaviour and fitness;2. overall survival (OS);3. association of cytokines, and insulin axis levels with PA, fatigue, and DFS;4. Health economic evaluation of the PA intervention. The study intervention is a 36-month PA programme aiming to achieve &gt; 10 metabolic equivalent rates/week above baseline. Study assessments include: Disease status, fitness, body composition, QOL questionnaires at 0/6/12/18/24/30/36 months. Then annual patient reported outcomes and disease status until study closure. Interim analysis (n = 273 with 12 months follow up) showed good intervention adherence, significant difference in PA with 10.5 MET hours/week difference between groups, and objective fitness improvements in PA group. Adaptations due to COVID: In 2020, rapid amendments were made in response to COVID-19 to provide alternative modes for intervention delivery (via phone or virtual) and assessments conducted virtually where possible, with option of electronic completion of patient-reported outcomes.

"AN INTERNATIONAL STUDY ON WELL-BEING OF PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS DURING THE COVID19 PANDEMIC","INTRODUCTION: The COVID19 pandemic has been primarily mitigated with behavioralstrategies such as social distancing, mask wearing, increased hand washing, and stay athome orders. Negative consequences were increased isolation, lack of access to medicalservices, medication shortages, and scarcity of daily necessities;all of which can lead toadverse mental health consequences. The aim of the current international study was todescribe the effect of the pandemic on the well-being of people with gastrointestinal (GI)diseases. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, participants were recruited through socialmedia ads, posted by patient organizations, opinion leaders, and the authors from May toOctober 2020, and asked to complete online surveys. Psychological distress was measuredwith the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), GI symptoms with the GastrointestinalSymptoms Rating Scale (GSRS), and quality of life (QoL) with the World Health OrganizationQuality of Life scale (WHOQOL). All questionnaires were in English and answered byEnglish speakers only. Three separate regressions were run with psychosocial distress, QoL,and GI symptoms as dependent variables and self-reported impacts of the pandemic on GIdisease as the independent variables. All models controlled for gender and self-reported prepandemiclevels of the dependent variables. RESULTS: 831 people participated from 22countries (top five were: 37.7% England, 12.2% Australia, 9.5% Poland, 8.3% New Zealand,7.6% USA). Mean age was 49.3 years;82.3% female. The most common GI conditions wereinflammatory bowel disease (38.4%), celiac disease (33.6%), and irritable bowel syndrome(31.4%). Table 1 shows the self-reported impact of the pandemic on aspects of care fortheir GI condition(s). Table 2 shows significant correlations between all these challengesand ratings of psychosocial distress, GI symptoms, and QoL. Regression analyses indicatedthat increased GI symptoms during the pandemic (R2= 0.65) were associated with increaseddifficulties relayted to managing GI disease (ÃŸ=0.133, p=0.009), appointments with primarycare doctor (ÃŸ=0.152, p=0.013), and diet adherence (ÃŸ=0.143, p=0.016). Decreased QoLduring the pandemic (R2= 0.60) was associated with perceived difficulties in accessing toiletpaper (ÃŸ=-2.611, p=0.010). None of the variables were associated with psychological distressafter controlling for pre-pandemic levels. CONCLUSION: COVID19 pandemic is affectingGI patients by restricting access to care, medications, toilet paper, and usual diet. Qualityof life and GI symptoms were associated with these challenges, but no effect was found formental health. These findings indicate that the COVID19 pandemic is having adverse impactson GI patients that should be mitigated with future appropriate planning and preventionstrategies.(Table Presented) (Table Presented)","Van Tilburg, M.

"P0266 The mental health response to the first wave of covid-19 in an international sample","Background: Multinational studies have recently reported significantly higher rates of anxiety and depression seen in the general population, compared to pre-COVID-19-pandemic levels.[1] Younger age cohorts and female sex have emerged as predictors for worse mental health (MH) and there is also evidence to suggest that the MH burden on healthcare practitioners (HCPs) is a significant cost of the pandemic.[2,3] Negative psychological consequences for HCPs have been highlighted in previous epidemics and pandemics including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome[SARS], SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, H1N1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS] and Ebola. This study aims to examine and compare the impact of COVID-19 on the MH of an international cohort from Canada, the United States of America (US), Brazil and Italy. Given that very few studies have reported this information thus far, we focused our analysis on the MH of HCPs within these countries. Methods: Adults aged 18 and over completed an online survey posted at anxiety treatment centre websites in Canada, USA, Brazil and Italy from April 8th - June 11th, 2020. The survey included questions regarding COVID-19 experience, perceived impact of the pandemic on life domains (e.g., social communication, finances), coping strategies (e.g., online activities, substance use), and MH treatment history. Current psychiatric symptom severity and impairment were evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Perceived Stress Scale, the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R), the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire. Results: Overall, 1315 individuals (74% female, mean age:42.9+16.4) in Canada (n=443), the USA (n=203), Brazil (n=517) and Italy (n=152) completed the survey. Nearly 26% met diagnostic thresholds for GAD and MDD. Compared to the other countries, fewer Italians met DSM-5 screening criteria for GAD (&lt;0.001) or depression, (p&lt;0.05). In addition, quality of life satisfaction scores were significantly lower in Italy and Brazil when compared to North America, (p&lt;0.001), indicating lower satisfaction. Non-HCPs (vs. HCPs) reported significantly higher scores (p=0.005) on all MH scales with the exception of the GAD-7, even after adjusting for age, sex, past MH treatment and country. Non-HCPs also reported lower quality of life. Amongst the HCPs, Canadian HCPs reported the highest rates of anxiety, depression, stress and PTSD compared to Canadian non-HCPs and to HCPs in the other countries. Higher proportions of Canadian HCPs also reported decreases in sleep, increases in eating and more time spent watching the news as well as lower levels of perceived emotional support compared to Canadian non-HCPs Conclusion: Despite key infrastructural and COVID-19 mortality differences between the countries, the MH effects appeared to be quite similar within the general populations. HCP status was associated with lower levels of stress, anxiety, depression and related symptoms, with the exception of Canada. Canadian HCPs reported higher symptom severity scores than HCPs from the remaining countries. Therefore, with the exception of Canada, HCPs reported less impact on their mental health compared to the general population, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially suggesting resilience in the face of adversity.

"P0813 Digital Psychiatry in the COVID-19 era: the first Italian cross-sectional survey","Background and objectives. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly changed the mode in which mental health services provide care. The rapid development of technological tools led to the implementation of digital psychiatry in everyday clinical practice both in the public and the private sector. This advanced innovation resulted in the ever-increasing need for a skilled workforce. Our purpose was to investigate the level of expertise of young mental health professionals and students in this field. In particular, we aimed 1) to assess the level of knowledge, education, and experience in the use of digital psychiatry in the different stages of the medical and psychiatric training;2) to investigate the opinions and experiences regarding digital psychiatry. Methods. An ad hoc cross-sectional online survey was designed containing questions about digital psychiatry, telepsychiatry and e-mental health. The study population included Italian early career psychiatrists (within five years of specialization), psychiatry residents, M.D. waiting to start the psychiatry training program, and medical students. From September 28, 2020, to April 07, 2021, 239 subjects completed the survey. Results. The study participantsâ€™ mean age and proportion of women were 26.6 Â± 3.9 years and 61.5% (n = 147), respectively. Most of the sample declared that the topic of digital psychiatry was never discussed within the training in medical school (n = 213;89.1%) and psychiatry residency (n = 260;96.2%). Meanwhile, more than half of the sample stated the importance of addressing these issues during the training in medical school (n = 130;54.4%) and psychiatry residency (n = 182;76.2%). Despite the lack of training experience, over half of the sample provided a correct definition of telepsychiatry (n = 176;73.6%) and correctly identified videoconferencing as the most used communication method in this area (n = 195;81.6%). The majority of the sample (n = 175;73.2%) declared that telepsychiatry is less effective than in-person interventions or equally/more effective only in young patients. Generally, most participants (n = 173;72.4%) declared that digital interventions represent a valuable therapeutic tool in mental health. Conclusions. For many specialists, the current COVID-19 pandemic was the first opportunity to reshape patient care through technological tools. Digital psychiatry represented an ideal response to the social distancing need, but, at the same time, it brought out the advantages of technological tools in increasing access to mental health services. Although digital psychiatry offers numerous opportunities and benefits, digital interventions within this field are still uncommon, and there remains a certain skepticism regarding this field. The lack of formal training on digital psychiatry within medical school and psychiatry residency could be a limiting factor. These training gaps seem to reflect the use and perception that clinicians display about digital psychiatry. Therefore, we believe that addressing these issues in academic settings would be crucial to spreading this innovative practice long after the pandemic has ended. No conflict of interest","Valenta, S.

"Assessment of COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown and Problems of Security Agentsâ€™ Brutality in Southeastern Nigeria","The emergence of COVID-19 pandemic and the Nigerian stateâ€™s attempt to enforce lockdown to prevent further spread of the virus using the security agents exposed citizens to brutalisation. This study was conducted to determine the lawfulness, necessity and proportionality of the security agentsâ€™ intervention in the enforcement of lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic in southeastern Nigeria. The main objective of the study was to determine the human rights violations and health problems experienced by citizens at the hands of security agents. The study utilised a descriptive cross-sectional online survey poll. Data were collected using a structured interviewâ€“questionnaire and analysed with the aid of STATA 12.1 software. The analysis utilised descriptive and inferential statistics with a level of significance of 5%. The results of the study showed that a total of 600 respondents participated in the survey with a mean age of 32.3Â±4.6 years with 408(68%) being males. Further results indicated that, on lawfulness and necessity of security agentsâ€™ involvement in the enforcement of lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic containment, 482(94.5%) reported that it was lawful and necessary. On proportionality of the use of force, 449(74.8%) reported not proportional. Reported human rights violations by security agents included unjustifiable arrest and detention 275(53.9%), seizure/confiscation of properties 464(77.4%), briberies and extortion 470 (78.4%), sexual molestation 217(36.2%) and tear-gassing of human gatherings 194(32.4%). There was an association between security agentsâ€™ arbitrary detention and health challenges of victims. Reported health challenges were: paralysis (94.6%), arthritis (85.7%) and mental health challenges (86.2%). Significant associations were established in in-the-cell fight with injury (p&lt;0.01) and paralysis (p&lt;0.04). Similar significant associations were established between the use of tear-gas and chest-tightness (p&lt;0.02) and choking sensation/shortness of breath (p&lt;0.04). The use of pernicious force by the security agents in the COVID-19 lockdown control was excessive. The paper recommended that efforts should be made by the government of Nigeria and stakeholders to apply least intrusive means of public health management such as social marketing, education and facilitation engagement.","Ugwu, Chukwuka E.; Okechukwu Marcellus, Ikeanyibe, Izueke, Edwin, Attama, Paulinus I.","https://doi.org/10.31920/2516-5305/2021/18n3a1","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: African Renaissance; 18(3):11-11â€“35, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25288,""
"P0638 Comparing the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic between psychiatric patients and healthy subjects: an observational retrospective study from northern Italy","Introduction: From the very beginning, COVID-19 pandemic had a great impact not only on physical, but also on mental health, both in general population and psychiatric patients. Self-isolation, fear of virus exposure and of death, unemployment and poor social network have increased psychological distress and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms [1]. Nevertheless, little is known about the difference between subjects affected by mental disorders and healthy individuals in perceiving the pandemic as a traumatic event [2]. Aim: Comparing psychiatric patients and healthy controls (HC) in terms of change over time of post-traumatic symptoms. Methods: Data about demographic and clinical variables were retrospectively collected. Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) scores were registered referring at two time points: T1, during the so-called â€˜Phase Iâ€™ in March-April 2020 (lockdown period) and T2, during the so-called â€˜Phase IIâ€™ in May-June 2020 (restarting). Descriptive analyses and linear regression models were performed. Summary of results: A total of 166 outpatients were recruited: 66 patients (39.8%) were affected by Schizophrenia (SKZ), 29 patients (17.5%) by Bipolar Disorder (BD), 36 patients (21.7%) by Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), 17 patients (10.2%) by Anxiety or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and 18 (10.8%) by Personality Disorders (PDs). HC sample included 57 individuals from general population. The tests of fixed effects showed that time (F=65.44;p&lt;0.001) and diagnosis (F=2.84;p=0.02) each had a significant effect on the change of IES-R scores. In particular, IES-R scores at T1 were overall higher than T2 scores (p&lt;0.001), except for OCD patients. Moreover, patients presented lower IES-R scores than HC (p=0.02), independently from diagnosis. When HC have been compared with the different diagnostic groups, SKZ patients resulted to have significantly lower IES-R scores than HC (p=0.004). Differently, only PD patients showed higher IES-R scores than HC, but the result did not reach the statistical significance (p=0.44). Conclusions: In general, both patients and HC presented a significant decrease of IES-R scores between T1 and T2, when the pandemic showed a decline and preventive restrictions have been removed;only OCD patients have shown a different trend, which can be explained by a global worsening of obsession and compulsion, associated with the urge of control against risks of contamination [3]. Comparing patients and HC, higher scores on IES-R scale have been observed in HC: this trend is particularly meaningful in SKZ subgroup, and it may be explained considering the limited awareness about the risk of infection, associated with less fear or striking emotion related to pandemic [4]. PD patients, in contrast, were found to be more affected by social restrictions than HC, probably because of a greater vulnerability to PTSD symptomatology and poorer coping skills [5], pointing out the need to implement telematic interventions, such as psychotherapy and group therapy. This is, to our knowledge, one of the few studies evaluating and comparing the psychological distress perceived by psychiatric patients (including all major diagnoses) and HC during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic.

"Adherence to covid-19 preventive measures among dental care workers in vietnam: An online cross-sectional survey","An online cross-sectional survey using a â€œsnowballâ€ sampling method was carried out to assess the adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures among dental care workers (DCWs) during the pandemic. Six questions concerning the COVID-19 preventive guidelines issued by the Vietnam Ministry of Health were used to evaluate DCWsâ€™ adherence to preventive measures at dental care clinics. The quality of life of DCWs was assessed using the WHO-5 questionnaire and was defined as low if the total score was less than 13 points. Factors relating to adherence to COVID-19 prevention measures of DCWs were determined by multivariate linear regression analysis. In total, 514 DCWs completed the questionnaire. A total of 37% DCWs rated their quality of life as low. Regression analysis suggested that older age, a better quality of life, living in an urban area, and training on COVID-19 prevention were associated with better adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, while being a dentist and lack of personal protective equipment was associated with less adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures. The pandemic had a significant negative impact on the physical and mental health of DCWs. Therefore, specific national guidelines for the prevention and control of the spread of COVID-19 in dental facilities should be issued.","Tran, T. T.; Vo, T. V.; Hoang, T. D.; Hoang, M. V.; Tran, N.

"Pre-morbidity and COVID-19 disease outcomes in Pakistani population: A cross-sectional study","Objectives: To identify association of underlying pre-morbidities with disease severity and mortality in hospitalized patients with Corona virus disease 2019. Methods: Total 884 COVID RT-PCR positive patients admitted to KRL Hospital Islamabad from April 2020 to August 2020 were included in this cross-sectional study. Pre-morbidities recorded were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, chronic neuro-psychiatric conditions (stroke and depression) and malignancy. Oxygen requirement, requirement of invasive ventilation, and outcome (recovered versus died) was documented. WHO categories for disease severity were used. Demographic profile and symptoms were also noted. SPSS 22 was used for data analysis. Pearson's Chi square test was used to see association between premorbidities and disease severity categories, oxygen requirement, invasive ventilation and outcome. Pearson's correlation was applied to analyze the correlation between individual pre-morbidities and disease severity categories. P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The mean age was 40 Â± 12.21 years with 98.5% being males. Majority patients (74.8%) were asymptomatic. Fever was the most common symptom. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were the most commonly recorded co-morbidity. Significant correlation (p-value &lt; 0.05) was found between the presence of underlying pre-morbidities and disease severity as well as oxygen requirement, requirement of invasive ventilation and mortality. Conclusion: Results are compatible with worldwide studies and underlying pre-morbidities are convincing risk factors for disease severity and mortality.

"P0206 Mental health during covid-19 infection","Background: Patients with Covid-19 are under great psychological stress, which can lead to the development of various psychiatric symptoms and maladaptive responses, such as anxiety, fear, depression, and insomnia. Psychiatric and psychological support can play a fundamental role in the general control of the disease. During the pandemic, whenever possible, services must provide help through telemedicine approaches. Digital solutions such as â€œPLANO-A-SAÃšDE-C19â€ that allow to evaluate and to monitor the signs of infection of the SARS-CoV-2 while monitoring the states of mind, allow to maximize the capacity of the services without compromising on the quality-of-service provision. Objectives: To present and describe a digital platform that is being developed to remote monitoring Covid-19 patients and their mental health status at different points of the infection, from diagnosis to recovery. Methods: A set of sensors, coupled with a small low-cost device, is used to acquire biometric data according to different profiles. The device is connected wirelessly to a patient's smartphone, which transfers the acquired data to a central platform. Doctors can remotely access the data to assess the patient's condition and make decisions. The application running on the patient's smartphone can generate alerts (such as medication time) and alarms in case of dangerous biometric signals. In the case of Covid-19, the monitored parameters include blood pressure, heart rate, weight, body temperature, peripheral oxygen saturation, blood glucose, and the respiratory cycle. Validated psychiatric scoring tools are also used (the Montgomeryâ€“Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Insomnia Severity Scale, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life - BREF). Results: In this work, we would like to provide some preliminary data related to the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the mental health of individuals infected during the course of the disease. We will describe the signs and symptoms of the virus, highlighting its relevance in changing the infected person's mental health status. Through the use of the digital platform, we hope to guarantee the quality of health services, proactively and continuously, following the fluctuations in the conditions of each patient, and contribute to the Proximity of Health, through the easy access between the patient and the provider of health. Conclusion: Healthcare services are facing a dramatic change in demand related to the effects of COVID-19. Scarce resources have mandated maximal operational efficiency and productivity to ensure timely patient access to best-suited treatment. Many hospitals have already telemedicine and launched hotlines to provide some help to people in need. Digital solutions that allow a double control of the state of organic and mental health can benefit the long-term economic, social and clinical results. The translation of therapeutic strategies that improve coping responses to stress following the needs of infected patients, contributes to the relief of related signs and symptoms. Apart from the Covid pandemic, distant mood follow-up monitoring promises a lot of others benefits.

"P0595 Burnout level associates with reduced strength of resting-state prefrontal brain activity and a sense of meaning in work","Introduction: Burnout has become a major concern in health care systems and has also been a critical issue during the COVID-19 pandemic. As many as 76% of medical professionals report burnout symptoms that may lead to medical errors, substance abuse, and even suicide [1,2]. Meanwhile, previous studies report on the importance of peoplesâ€™ sense of coherence (SOC) or control over work for dealing with burnout experience which implicates a stress-coping capacity involving comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness. However, little is known on how SOC cognitively modulates burnout experiences, as neural substrates for SOC and burnout are insufficiently explored [2,3]. Aim: We aimed to investigate neurocognitive mechanisms of SOC and burnout in medical professionals. Methods: We recruited early-career registered nurses and forty-one were enrolled in this study. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Kyoto University and was conducted in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association. Participants were recruited by advertisements in the hospitals. Participantsâ€™ SOC and burnout levels were investigated using the sense of coherence scale and Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) [3]. Higher scores of SOC and MBI represented a greater sense of coherence and more burnout experience, respectively. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and measured resting-state brain activity. We identified brain regions associated with SOC and burnout levels by correlating these trait scores to the regional fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF). Subsequently, we investigated whether participantsâ€™ levels of SOC impacted their fALFF-burnout association by mediation analysis. Results: SOC and the depersonalization dimension of burnout were negatively correlated. The fALFF in the mid dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) correlated positively with SOC scores, and negatively with the depersonalization dimension of burnout. Based on the above correlations, we conducted a mediation analysis and observed that SOC mediates the negative relationship between DLPFC activity and burnout severity (p &lt; 0.05). That is, the participantsâ€™ depersonalization level was better explained by their SOC level, together with their resting-state brain activity (fALFF of the DLPFC), rather than the brain activity level alone. Conclusions: The results suggest that our participantsâ€™ burnout severity associates with decreased SOC and prefrontal activity those of which may support cognitive control. It is possible that they may facilitate flexible shifting of perspective and optimistic reappraisal of work-stress. In effect, workplace stressors may be acknowledged as being more meaningful than distressing. Meanwhile, without sufficient SOC, frequent exposures to stressors can lead to maladaptive coping to exhibit emotional numbing or depersonalization. The results also suggest that the sense of coherence/control and burnout effect can be generalized and carried over into no-task, spontaneous brain activity to a certain extent. The further approach in this line may pave the ways to illuminate which intervention and training effectively impact the subjective experience of burnout in medical education.

"P0500 Investigation into the factors potentially associated with poor psychological wellbeing in italian healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Italy was strongly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic during spring (first wave) and autumn 2020 (second wave);healthcare workersâ€™ mental health was deeply conditioned by this situation and by the exposition to the highest risk to get infected themselves [1]. Aim of this study was to investigate how healthcare workersâ€™ mental wellbeing was altered by the massive exposition to the pandemic, together with pre-existing personal factors which can be involved in mental health. Methods: Sixty-four healthcare workers from Fondazione IRCSS Policlinico, Milan, were included. Information were retrieved from an ad-hoc questionnaire. Mental health was assessed by the following rating scales: Impact of event scale-revised (IESR) and Patient Health Questionnaires-9 (PHQ-9). The first scale evaluates the post-traumatic stress symptoms, while the second severity of depression. The healthcare professionals were asked to fill the scales thinking about their symptoms during both the first and the second wave. Descriptive analyses were performed. Rating scale scores between first and second wave were compared by paired sample t-tests. In addition, second wave rating scale scores were compared between groups defined by qualitative variables through analyses of variance. Correlations were used to analyze the relation between quantitative variables and second wave rating scale scores. Two final multivariable linear logistic regression models were finally performed with the two rating scale scores in the second wave as dependent variables and statistically significant variables in the univariate analyses as independent ones. Results: Total sample included 25 males and 39 females. 53,2% of workers directly took care of COVID19-infected patients.34% and 18% of the total sample manifested respectively in the first and second wave over the threshold scores for significant Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms as showed by IESR. In addition, 23,2% and 13% of the total sample manifested respectively in the first and second wave over the threshold scores for significant depressive symptoms as showed by PHQ-9. During the second wave the professionals showed less PTSD (t = 5,536, p&lt;0,001) and depressive symptoms (t=-5,559, p &lt; 0.001) compared to the first one. Regression models showed that: (1) IESR scores were significantly associated with type of ward (COVID emergency or not) (ÃŸ=0.24, p=0,03);(2) PHQ9 scores were significantly associated with male gender (ÃŸ=0.32, p=0.01) and IESR scores (ÃŸ=0.62, p&lt;0,001). Conclusions: despite most of available literature is focused on the negative effect of COVID-19 on patientsâ€™ mental health [2,3], also healthcare professionals suffered from the psychological consequences of the pandemic. The difference in the scores between the first and the second wave suggests the fact that health workers passed from an acute mental involvement to a chronic accommodation to a stressing situation. Given the large number of workers fighting worldwide against COVID19 pandemics, the presence of mental illness among them can reach huge proportions. Female workers globally showed lower scores at the PHQ9 scales, suggesting the necessity of further investigations on the association between gender and capacity to manage environmental stressors.

"IMPLEMENTATION OF DIGITAL BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS (FGIDS) DURING THE COVID ERA","Introduction Patients with FGIDs suffer from anxiety and depression and exhibit increased sensitivity to stressors. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is known to help improve mood, increase stress resiliency, and reduces FGID symptom severity but faces substantial barriers to implementation. Integrating behavioral health technology into medical clinic workflows could overcome these barriers. We evaluated the feasibility and initial impact of a digital CBT (dCBT) tool as a lower-barrier, first-line intervention for reducing emotional distress in FGID patients. Methods Patients seen at an integrated behavioral-neurogastroenterology clinic exhibiting or reporting symptoms of anxiety and/or depression during their encounter (in-person or telemedicine visit between March 1-Oct 31, 2020) were offered access to a dCBT app called RxWell, which consists of 40 CBT techniques and is supported by digital health coaches who communicate with patients via within-app texts. Patients completed anxiety (GAD7) and depression (PHQ8) measures at the baseline visit and monthly via the app. The study outcomes include changes in GAD7 and PHQ8 scores over a 3-month period. The app prescription was used as first line behavioral intervention, and was supplemented by sessions with behavioral providers, as clinically indicated. Results RxWell was e-prescribed during ~17% of all patient visits during the study period (77% by GI providers). Of the 298 FGID patients (mean age 43 yrs [sd 16 yrs];73.2% women;Table 1) who were prescribed RxWell, 54% downloaded the app and completed more than 3 dCBT techniques (mean number 15 [sd 28]). Further, 43% of RxWell users communicated with their digital health coaches. About 25% of the cohort met with a behavioral therapist, and of these, 16% met with a psychiatrist. Mean baseline GAD7 scores (11.6 [sd 5.5]) and PHQ8 scores (11.2 [sd 6]) indicated moderate severity. There was a significant improvement in GAD7 (mean change 3.7 [t 5.1, df 47;p &lt;.001]) and PHQ8 scores (mean change 3.4 [t 4.8, df 42;p&lt;0.001]).Additionally, RxWell users who utilized a health coach, compared to self-guided users, completed a significantly greater number of techniques (37 [sd 39] vs. 8.7 [sd 6.8]) and demonstrated greater improvements in GAD7 and PHQ8 scores (Table 2). Conclusion We demonstrate the feasibility of implementing dCBT in the care of FGID patients with moderate anxiety and depressive symptom scores. The use of the dCBT app is associated with clinically and statistically significant mood symptom reductions within 3 months, and supplementation with digital health coaching further enhanced these benefits. These preliminary results suggest that dCBT is a viable strategy to improve FGID patient access to effective behavioral therapy.(Table Presented) (Table Presented)","Tansel, A.; Szigethy, E.; Marroquin, M.; Pavlick, A.; Kingsley, M.

"EVALUATION OF MENTAL STATE AND CLINICAL SYMPTOMS OF CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE","Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide and the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11th, 2020. In Japan, there have been more than 135,000 infected patients and 1950 deaths at late-November 2020. It remains unclear whether COVID-19 affects the clinical course of patients with chronic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We previously reported that 75% in 1078 IBD patients believe that psychologic stress triggered an exacerbation of their disease, and that a worsened mental state corresponds with disease activity in IBD patients, especially in those who believe that their disease is exacerbated by psychologic stress (Araki M, et al. PLoS One, 2020). The aim of this study was to assess an association of psychologic stress /mental state and clinical symptoms of IBD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods IBD outpatients were recruited to obtain questionnaires about clinical symptoms, lifestyle habit, medication status, psychologic stress and mental state in Osaka University Hospital from May to June 2020, which was at the end of the first peak of COVID-19 pandemic in Osaka, Japan (pandemic period). As for mental state, the center for epidemiologic studies depression (CES-D) score of 7 points or higher was defined as depression, and the CES-D scores at the pandemic period were compared with those obtained in the previous survey performed from 2015 to 2017. The clinical activity indices [partial Mayo score for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohnâ€™s disease activity index for Crohnâ€™s disease (CD) ]at the pandemic period were compared with those from December 2019 to February 2020 (pre-pandemic period). Results A total of 99 adult IBD patients, comprising 38 patients with UC and 61 with CD, were recruited. The mean age (Â± SD) of the patients was 47.5 (Â± 14.7) years, and the age at diagnosis was 30.9 (Â± 13.9) years. No patients were diagnosed as COVID-19. Eighty-four percent of the patients reported as mentally stressed in the questionnaire. The average CES-D score was 5.89 (Â± 3.41) during the pandemic, which was significantly higher than the previous survey (2.27 Â± 3.44, p &lt;.001). The proportion of depressed patients was 40% (38/96), which was also significantly higher than the previous survey [13% (16/122), p &lt;.001]. The mean values of partial Mayo score, Crohnâ€™s disease activity index, and CRP during the pandemic period were 1.29 (Â± 1.78), 118 (Â± 85.0), and 0.23 (Â± 0.52) mg/dl, respectively, all of which were comparable with those in the pre-pandemic period [1.74 (Â± 2.16), 115 (Â± 76.8), 0.47 (Â± 1.18) mg/dl, respectively]. Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic, IBD patients were mentally stressed, although their clinical activities were not significantly changed during the short-term period.","Tani, M.; Shinzaki, S.; Asakura, A.; Tashiro, T.; Amano, T.; Otake, Y.; Yoshihara, T.; Yoshii, S.; Tsujii, Y.; Hayashi, Y.; Inoue, T.; Iijima, H.; Takehara, T.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0016-5085(21)02027-8","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Gastroenterology; 160(6):S-557, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25296,""
"Healthcare Funding Policies for Reducing Fragmentation and Improving Health Outcomes","This policy paper examines potential roles of â€˜funding policyâ€™ to address yawning gaps in continuity of healthcare delivery and inequality in health outcomes across Canada. Funding policy is but one tool available to healthcare decision makers to affect the volume, type, timeliness and cost of healthcare services, products and devices provided to a countryâ€™s residents. Healthcare funding policies involve trade-offs and conflicts that may drive the â€˜priceâ€™ of change to be too high. As Canada exits the COVID-related healthcare crises, the price of healthcare reform may be changing which may cause provinces and territories to consider new healthcare funding policies. The paper begins with a brief background outlining the utility of funding policies to affect the cost-efficiency, effectiveness and equity of healthcare delivered in provinces and territories. Two complementary policy options are proposed that show considerable promise to improve value from healthcare funding. The paper is written from the perspective of the role of the federal government and highlights possible strategies for the federal government to remove barriers to support funding policy reforms in provinces and territories. The federal government is not responsible, nor does it play a meaningful role, in developing, implementing or monitoring funding policy for healthcare organizations or individual providers. This role rests with the respective provinces and territories with the exceptions of federally-insured populations. Nonetheless, the federal government could show leadership in the domain of funding policy by removing provincesâ€™ and territoriesâ€™ barriers to policy reforms. To bridge the federal governmentâ€™s strengths with provincesâ€™ and territoriesâ€™ barriers, a number of specific recommendations are offered to the federal government for its consideration. First, this policy paper recommends that substantive and meaningful funding policy reform should not consist of solely of paying organizations or people differently. There should be commensurate advancements in: national standards for new streams of data and reporting, organization-building and skills development, and robust risk adjustment. These barriers are not show-stoppers, and activities to remove many barriers are fairly straightforward. Second, the federal government could take a leadership role in immediately supporting episode-based payments. These activities could include national efforts to define episodes of care, link data, establish non-binding payment amounts, and publish health outcome performance measures. Third, deliberate federal leadership is needed to establish and grow new streams of data critical to measuring value â€“ including patient-reported outcomes and non-insured health services, such as physiotherapies and mental health services. These activities will be ground-breaking in Canada from the perspective of measuring health and population outcomes. Fourth, the federal government could lead efforts to link social care data with healthcare data. The measurement and analyses of this data will create a roadmap for future interventions to improve population health. The policies proposed in this paper are based on the federal government â€˜nudgingâ€™ provinces and territories to make changes in funding policy by removing barriers. The policies are incremental from an international perspective, though have important consequences for healthcare organizations and individual providers if they were to be implemented and transformational to healthcare performance were the policies proven to be successful in the long-term.","Sutherland, Jason","https://doi.org/10.11575/sppp.v14i1.74017","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: The School of Public Policy Publications (SPPP); 14, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25297,""
"Surviving a global pandemic: The experience of depression, anxiety, and loneliness among individuals with multiple sclerosis","Background The world has been experiencing one of the most significant worldwide health pandemics in modern history. The result has been increased depression, anxiety, and loneliness in the general population. However, populations who demonstrated pre-pandemic emotional disturbance and social isolation, such as individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), are likely uniquely vulnerable to such symptoms. Objective The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the emotional outcomes, including reports of loneliness, in individuals with MS during the COVID-19 pandemic. We additionally sought to examine how individualsâ€™ experiences during the pandemic may contribute to a specific COVID-19-related depression or anxiety. Methods 142 individuals with MS who previously participated in a national, online, survey-based study were asked to complete an online survey assessing their current level of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Increases in the rates of depression and anxiety were noted, with approximately 54% and 33% reporting â€œnewâ€ depression or anxiety, respectively. Given this increase, we examined how individuals with â€œnewâ€ depression or anxiety differed from those without depression and anxiety and those with pre-pandemic depression and/or anxiety. Significant differences in person-specific factors (e.g., personality, self-efficacy) were noted between the groups. Increased loneliness was also found among both those with depression or anxiety regardless of whether â€œnewâ€ or pre-pandemic. Finally, all those depressed or anxious reported greater disruption and distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic with a trend for increased anxiety specifically related to the pandemic (e.g., fear or dying due to COVID-19) among those with new depression or anxiety when compared to those with existing depression or anxiety, suggesting an influence of the pandemic that is specific to reports of new depression or anxiety. Conclusion Findings suggest increased depression, anxiety, and loneliness among individuals with MS following the COVID-19 pandemic, with reports of â€œnewâ€ depression or anxiety, which appears to be related to the pandemic, specifically. Moreover, factors commonly associated with depression or anxiety in MS (e.g., personality, self-efficacy) were more common among those with existing depression or anxiety but not among those experiencing new depression or anxiety. These differences should be considered when attempting to ameliorate the impact of the COVID-19 among those experiencing emotional distress.","Strober, L.; Weber, E.; Lequerica, A.; Chiaravalloti, N.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2022.103497","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders;: 103497, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25298,""
"P0509 Emotion de-regulation in a cohort of young europeans during the spring 2020 lockdown","Introduction: The first lockdown response to the Covid-19 pandemic has been an unexpected public health stress, notably in Europe. Its putative effect on mental health in young people was rapidly emphasized, but thorough evaluation of its impact on emotional components are scarce. Therefore we investigated the emotion regulation in a sample of young europeans during the peri-lockdown period. Aim(s): i) to specify some emotional components assessed by a self-questionnaire in young adults and ii) to investigate the subjective perception of their degradation with the change in their social environment 3 months before and during the first lockdown period. Methods: a modified version of the Coronavirus Health Impact Survey (v.0.2;, was completed online by 447 22-23 years-old participants, part of the IMAGEN cohort (https://imagen-europe.com) in Paris, London, Nottingham, Berlin, and Mannheim areas. It assessed participantsâ€™ self-perception in life changes caused by the coronavirus crisis. Participants retrospectively rated their own levels of emotions and worries in the 3 months before the onset of the COVID-19 crisis in the participantsâ€™ local area (preâ€“COVID-19 symptoms), as well as in the past 2 weeks (periâ€“COVID-19 symptoms) with a Cronbach's alpha =.81 and.87 for the past 3 months and past 2 weeks, respectively. participants indicated their levels of 1) worry, 2) happiness versus sadness, 3) enjoyment in usual activities, 4) feeling relaxed versus anxious, 5) feeling fidgety or restless, 6) feeling fatigued or tired, 7) concentration, 8) irritability or anger, 9) loneliness, 10) experiences of negative thoughts and 11) suicide thoughts/self-harm. An exploratory factor analysis with Varimax rotation and using maximum likelihood method of estimation was performed on scored data. Thereafter, effects on mental health variables were searched with ANOVAs. Results: The factor analysis revealed three factors within the emotion/worries section of the questionnaire: valence, psychomotor, and attention. To investigate the effect of the lockdown on emotional health, a score for every participant has been determined in relation with each factor. Then, the difference between the value of factor score for each participant at three months before and during the last two weeks of the first lockdown was further used in the analyses. ANOVAs showed that the item markedly related to emotional deterioration was social distance, which had a deleterious effect on emotional valence (p=2.09e-06), psychomotricity (p=0.0167), and attention (p=8.99e-05) factor scores. The participants who had a poor emotional health as denoted by their valence scores and suicidal thoughts before the lockdown were in majority better during the lockdown, whereas the reverse was detected in those with initial low scores in those measures. In contrast, the socio-professional category, drug addiction diagnosis, closure of university/business building and financial problems had no statistical impact on the emotional state of this sample of young europeans during the first lockdown. Conclusion: The present participantsâ€™ self-evaluations further support that the social distancing was the major item related to emotional health deterioration during the first COVID-19 lockdown.

"P0286 Apathy and anhedonia in adult and adolescent cannabis users and controls before and during the coronavirus lockdown","Background: COVID-19 lockdown measures have caused significant disruptions to work and education, and have prevented people from participating in activities they normally find rewarding. Cannabis users might be especially vulnerable to adverse effects of lockdown and social isolation on motivation and hedonic capacity, due to putatively elevated levels of apathy and anhedonia. Additionally, due to the brain still being in development and to peer interaction being critical, adolescence may constitute a particularly vulnerable period for harmful effects of cannabis, as well as social isolation, placing adolescents at further risk. In the current study, we investigated apathy and anhedonia before and after lockdown measures were implemented, in a large sample of adult and adolescent cannabis users and controls. We hypothesised that cannabis users would have higher levels of apathy and anhedonia compared to controls, and a larger increase in levels since lockdown onset. We also hypothesised that the difference between users and controls would be larger for adolescents compared to adults. Methods: A total of n=256 adult and n=200 adolescent cannabis users, and n=170 adult and n=172 adolescent controls participated in this online survey study, between June and August 2020. Apathy was measured with the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), and anhedonia was measured with the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS). Higher scores indicated greater levels of apathy and anhedonia, respectively. The Severity of Dependence Scale was used to assess cannabis dependence. Scores on the AES and SHAPS were investigated with separate mixed measures Analyses of Covariance, with factors User-Group, Age-Group, and Time. The Time*User-Group, Time*Age-Group, User-Group*Age-Group, and Time*User-Group*Age-Group interactions were also included. All models controlled for depression and anxiety, as well as alcohol, cigarette, and other illicit drug use. Results: Adolescent cannabis users had significantly higher SHAPS scores before lockdown, compared to adolescent controls (p=0.03, <U+03B7>p2=0.013). After lockdown, conversely, adult users had significantly lower scores on both the SHAPS (p&lt;0.001, <U+03B7>p2=0.030) and AES (p&lt;0.001, <U+03B7>p2=0.048) compared to adult controls. Scores on both scales increased during lockdown across groups, and this increase was significantly smaller for cannabis users (AES p=0.001, <U+03B7>p2=0.014;SHAPS p=0.01, <U+03B7>p2=0.008). A total of n=130 adult and n=69 adolescent cannabis users were classified as dependent. Due to strong bivariate correlations between cannabis dependence and scores on the AES and SHAPS, we performed additional exploratory analyses within cannabis users, with factor Dependence in place of User-Group. Dependent cannabis users had significantly higher scores on both the AES (p&lt;0.001, <U+03B7>p2=0.037) and SHAPS (p&lt;0.001, <U+03B7>p2=0.029) compared to non-dependent users, and a larger increase in scores on both scales during lockdown (AES p=0.04, <U+03B7>p2=0.010;SHAPS p=0.04, <U+03B7>p2=0.010). Conclusions: Our results suggest that adolescents and adults have differential associations between cannabis use, and apathy and anhedonia. Adolescent cannabis users appear to be at especially increased risk of anhedonia. We found no evidence of higher levels of apathy or anhedonia in adult users, compared to age-matched controls. Cannabis dependence may be associated with higher levels of apathy and anhedonia within users, regardless of age, and a greater increase in levels during the COVID-19 lockdown.

"Fear Of Covid-19, Along With Stress, Anxiety, And Depression, Is Associated With Biologic Usage In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease","Background: During The Covid-19 Pandemic, The General Population Has Been Subject To Heightened Stress, Anxiety, Depression, And Fear Of The Virus. However, The Impact Of Covid-19 On These Psychometric Factors Have Not Been Formally Assessed In Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ibd), Specifically Those On Biologic Therapies. The Aim Of This Study Was To Examine The Relationship Between Fear Of Covid-19 And Biologic Usage In Ibd Patients. Methods: Adult Ibd And Non-Ibd Patients Were Recruited From An Academic Clinic And Via Social Media Outlets. Patients Were Administered A Qualtrics Survey Assessing Demographics Disease Characteristics, And Perceptions Around Covid-19. The Validated Fear Of Covid-19 Scale (Fcv-19s), Perceived Stress Scale (Pss), And Hospital Anxiety And Depression Scale (Hads) Were Used To Assess Fear Of Covid-19, Stress, Anxiety And Depression, Respectively. Analyses Evaluated The Associations Between These Psychological Experiences, Ibd Diagnosis, And Medication Usage. Results: There Were 399 Participants (17% Crohnâ€™S Disease;43% Ulcerative Colitis;4% Ibd-Unclassified;36% Non-Ibd). Ibd Participants Had Higher Levels Of Stress (P&lt;.01), Anxiety (P&lt;.01), Depression (P&lt;.01), And Fear Of Covid-19 (P&lt;.01) Compared With Non-Ibd Participants. When Asked About Perceived Likelihood Of Contracting Covid-19, Ibd Participants More Often Responded With A â€œHighâ€ Or â€œExtremeâ€ Likelihood (26.3% Vs. 9.1%;P&lt;.01). Among The Risk Perception Screening Domains, 77.9% And 45.9% Of Ibd Participants On Biologics Responded â€œVeryâ€ Or â€œExtremelyâ€ Affirmatively To Questions Related To Perceived Level Of Precaution Needed To Avoid Contracting Covid-19 And Perceived Severity Of Infection If Contracted, Respectively. Additionally, 41.5% Of Ibd Participants On Biologics Were More Likely To Report Feeling That Their Ibd Medications Made Them â€œExtremelyâ€ Or â€œVeryâ€ Vulnerable, Compared With Only 20.3% Of Ibd Participants Not On Biologic Therapy. Use Of Biologic Therapy Was Associated With Higher Levels Of Stress (P=.011), Anxiety (P&lt;.01), And Fear Of Covid-19 (P&lt;.01). Due To Concerns Of Covid-19, 5.6% Decided To Defer Starting Biologic Treatment, While 2.0% Decided To Discontinue Biologic Medication. Conclusion: This Study Is One Of The First To Evaluate The Mental Health Of Ibd Patients During The Covid-19 Pandemic And Uniquely Evaluates Psychological Variables As They Relate To Biologic Usage. Fear Of Covid-19, Anxiety, And Perceived Stress Were Strongly Correlated With Biologic Usage In Ibd Patients, Suggesting That Participants Using Biologic Therapy Felt More Susceptible To Infection.

"P0474 New variants, new symptoms in COVID-19: first episode psychosis and cotard's syndrome after infection with the B117 variant of coronavirus","Introduction During the course of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many neuropsychiatric manifestations of the disease have been observed while the precise pathophysiology remains unknown [1]. New variants of coronavirus such as the 501.V2 and B.1.1.7 have emerged and obscurities in pathogenesis have increased even further with these variants. Here, we describe a patient with long-term effects of COVID-19, manifesting first episode psychosis accompanied by Cotard's Syndrome (CS) after infection with the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2. Case A 41-year-old female with no adverse medical history was admitted to the emergency department with symptoms of loss of smell, myalgia and sore throat and COVID-19 infection was confirmed by a positive RT-PCR test result for the B.1.1.7 variant of coronavirus. Two months after the completion of treatment for COVID-19, the patient started to have thoughts of being annihilated by viral occupation of her body and of her nervous system getting decomposed. The patient's family brought her to the psychiatric emergency department. The patient was found to have strong suicidal ideations, referential thoughts, belief of being physically dead and her children being in danger of obliteration by COVID-19. Clinical evaluation of the mental state of the patient was significant for decreased speech output and speed as well as psychomotor activity. Nihilistic, persecutory and referential delusions with no insight were recorded. Upon hospitalization and treatment with olanzapine 20mg/day orally and electroconvulsive therapy, her psychiatric symptoms and suicidal ideation ameliorated. The patient was discharged from the hospital with olanzapine 20mg/day orally and she is currently being followed-up in our outpatient clinic. Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient who developed CS and psychotic symptoms associated with COVID-19 following infection with a new variant of coronavirus. CS is a rare self-perceptual anomaly with the presentation of nihilistic delusions. While the exact pathogenesis of CS remains unexplained, defective mechanisms of proprioception or interoception may lead to a self-misattribution following a perceptual dysfunction which might trigger CS [2]. Although blood tests indicated no systemic inflammation for the index patient, an indistinct neuroinflammatory process may lead to neurotoxicity that might result in perceptual disruption and CS or psychotic features, as suggested in previous reports [3]. Considering well-described anosmia and ageusia with COV&Iacute;D-19 and our case's symptoms after the infection, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 might affect the perceptual pathways. The angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor which might modulate smell and taste perception, has been identified as a potential viral receptor. Such interaction may disrupt chemosensory perception. Overall, COVID-19 may cause abnormal processing of perceptions. This in turn can lead to anosmia, ageusia and defective proprioception, resulting in self-misattributions as seen in the patient in the current case report who was diagnosed with CS. Clinicians should keep in mind that infections with the rapidly spreading B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 might result in more severe symptoms or long-term consequences of COVID-19 compared to other strains.

"P0876 Perceived stress during COVID-19 confinement in elderly participants with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia: a cross-sectional study","Introduction: Covid-19 disease forced the Spanish government to declare a national state of alarm implementing restrictive measures such as lockdown, social distancing and stay at home measures. These measures can be related to negative consequences on mental health and stress increase in elderly people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the impact of this strict confinement and to analyze factors associated with perceived stress on community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This study was conducted in MÃ¡laga a Spanish region of AndalucÃ­a. In total 143 elderly participants (&gt;55 years old) with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, from the SMART 4 MD (n=69) and TV-AssistDem (n=74) randomized clinical trial (RCT), were interviewed by telephone between May 11 and June 25 2020. Participants were contacted by telephone by 5 health professionals (two Neuropsychologists, a Clinical Psychologist, a Psychologist and a Psychiatric and Mental Health Clinical Nurse Specialist). Researchers had previously established relationships with participants during both RCTs. The mean time from the start of the lockdown and home-confinement measures to the interview was 70.93 days (SD=12.36, Range: 52-102). Perceived stress was assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14). Depression (Geriatric Depression Scale), cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination-22), quality of life (Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease Scale), health status (EuroQoL-5D-3L) and other variables (specific structured questionary) were also measured. To analyze the factors associated with perceived stress linear regression models were used. R version 4.0.4 program was used for statistical analysis. Results: Of the respondents, 94/143 (65.7%) were women. The mean age was 74.12 years (SD 6.49), and 36/143 (25.2%) lived alone. 66/143 (46.48%) participants were worried and 33/143 (23.24%) were afraid at the time of the evaluation. Perceived stress was negatively associated with change in living arrangement (B=-4.89;p&lt;0.05), feeling well (B=-7.88;p&lt;0.001), feeling calm (B=-3.12;p&lt;0.05), quality of life (B=-1.02;p&lt;0.001) and health status (B=-0.20);p&lt;0.001) and positively associated with feeling sad (B=7.32;p&lt;0.001), feeling worried (B=6.45;p&lt;0.001), feeling afraid (B=7.77;p&lt;0.001), feeling anxious (B=10.44;p&lt;0.001), feeling bored (B=6.77;p&lt;0.001), sleep disturbances (B=5.49;p&lt;0.01) and score of depression (B=1.83;p&lt;0.001). Discussion: Surprisingly, the score of perceived stress was similar to other studies with comparable samples1,2. The strict confinement seems not to have affected this population significantly regarding perceived stress. Less perceived stress was associated with wellbeing and better quality of life. More perceived stress was associated with less mental health and sleep disturbances. A change in living arrangements was negatively correlated with perceived stress, probably due to the increase in family support. More studies are necessary to evaluate the long-term consequences of COVID-19 restricted measures in perceived stress and mental health in this vulnerable population.

"P0564 Active suicidal ideation one year after the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic in a large spanish sample: risk and protective factors","Introduction: The influence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic over mental health and suicidal behavior has been described worldwide [1,2]. Active suicidal ideation (ASI) and its associated risk and protective factors after one year of COVID-19 pandemic need to be measured and described in order to easy design effective mental health strategies. Objectives: To assess the prevalence of active suicidal ideation in a sample of the general Spanish population after one year of COVID-19 pandemic and to characterize factors associated with active suicidal ideation. Methods: Cross-sectional study based on an anonymous self-report online survey consisting of sociodemographic and clinical questions. The survey was conducted between March 16 and 31, 2021. It was completed by 5,646 participants, aged 18 and over, from all over Spanish territory. The Spanish versions of Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Dep5 and Anx5, and the Paykel Suicidal Ideation Scale (PSS) were used to assess psychological impact and suicidal ideation. The sample was divided into two different groups based on PSS responses: â€œactive suicidal ideationâ€ (ASI) (positive answer to questions 3 and/or 4) and ""no active suicidal ideation"" (NASI) (negative answer to questions 3 and 4). Logistic regression models (forward stepwise selection) were estimated to determine the independent factors associated with having ASI. Cohen's d equivalence for Odds Ratios (OR) has been included. Due to multiple comparisons and to avoid inflation in Type I error, the level of statistical significance was set at a = 0.001 (two-tailed). Results: The total sample included 5,654 respondents [mean age (SD) = 39.65 (12.65);females: n = 4,575 (80.9%)]. From the total sample, 415 participants (7.3%: IC 95% [6.7-8.0]) presented ASI during the last month. A logistic regression model, including all significant variables from bivariate analyses, was run to assess variables associated with ASI. Risk factors for ASI were: income reduction &gt; 50% [OR (IC 95) = 1.994 (1.317-3.020), p = 0.001], history of past or current mental disorder [OR (IC 95%) = 1.469 (1.067-2.023), p = 0.018;OR (IC 95%) = 3.161 (2.468-4.048), p &lt; 0.001, respectively], insomnia [OR (IC 95%) = 1.850 (1.404-2.437), p &lt; 0.001] and personal history of suicide attempt [OR (IC 95) = 3.779 (2.681-5.327), p &lt; 0.001]. Protective factors against ASI were: older age [OR (IC 95%) = 0.968 (0.958-0.978), p &lt; 0.001), living with one or more than one other person [OR (IC 95%) = 0.537 (0.385-0.747), p &lt; 0.001;OR (IC 95%) = 0.634 (0.466-0.863), p = 0.004, respectively] and neutral or sleep satisfaction [OR (IC 95%) = 0.672 (0.510-0.886), p = 0.005;OR (IC 95%) = 0.472 (0.349-0.638), p &lt; 0.001, respectively]. Conclusion: The estimated prevalence of ASI in this large sample of Spanish general population was significantly high. In addition, significant income reduction, history of past or current mental disorder, insomnia or history of suicide attempt have been described as risk factors associated with ASI, whereas older age, neutral or sleep satisfaction act as protective factors.

"P0262 Self-directed virtual care: a review of the evidence for current digital therapeutic methods in adult mental health patients","Background -Healthcare systems have changed dramatically in the last fifty years. The COVID-19 pandemic specifically has disrupted the traditional healthcare delivery model. New methods of care are needed that can be delivered safely and that complement and improve the way treatment is provided in and out of the doctor's office. Technological interventions used to treat illnesses and promote health are grouped under the umbrella term of digital therapeutics. The use of digital therapeutics is becoming increasingly common in the field of mental health. Although there are many technologies currently being implemented, the research supporting their usability, efficacy and risk requires further examination, especially those interventions that can be used independently and without support. Objective - This review aims to identify evidence-based, self-directed virtual methods of care that could be used in adult patients after discharge from mental health services and have been evaluated with objective (in terms of improving health outcomes) and subjective measures (acceptability and usability). Methods - A systematic review was conducted broadly following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)/Prospero guidelines in 3 databases: PubMed, Web of Science and Ovid. We enforced strict criteria, all interventions reviewed had to be automated with no human input required (either at the patient's or the technology's end), so patients could implement them independently without any support from a healthcare professional or technical staff. Inclusion criteria were self-directed, automated, technology-based interventions related to mental health, for adults and with a solid evaluation process. Results â€“ Thirty-four papers were identified that fit the inclusion criteria: 24 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), 9 non-RCT quantitative studies and 1 qualitative study. Technologies employed included websites, automated text messaging, phone applications, videos, computer software and integrated voice response. Twenty studies focused on Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (iCBTs) as a therapeutic paradigm compared to waitlist, on- line human delivered therapy and other interventions. Fourteen studies used paradigms other than iCBT. Out of eight studies directly comparing directly guided to unguided digital care, three studies showed no differences, three favored guided interventions and two favored unguided interventions. Research showed dropout rates as high as 80% in unguided interventions citing potential problems with acceptability of the suggested technologies. Conclusions - The use of virtual interventions in healthcare is increasing, but there seems to be a lack of research on efficacy and limited information over what types of interventions are most suitable for mental health care. Current research suggests an effectiveness of virtual care interventions that is superior to waitlist controls. However, to show effectiveness over traditional psychiatric care studies should use comparison groups that are comparable to the intervention studied avoiding waiting list or other non-intervention arms. One of the main advantages of digital therapeutics is that these interventions will also become accessible to people who do not have access to healthcare, such as patients who live far from healthcare centres, cannot travel because of disability or family commitments or cannot afford traditional care. In this way, self-directed digital therapeutics can contribute to healthcare equity.

"P0205 Telepsychiatry with adolescents in the time of covid: family caregiver perspectives","Introduction: In response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, telepsychiatry was suddenly introduced in mental health services. Evidence concerning the efficacy and viability of these interventions in child and adolescent population is lacking. This study aims at developing a thorough understanding of family caregiver experiences with phone consultations, at the beginning of the pandemic. Material and Methods: We interviewed adolescent's caregivers under psychiatric follow-up, that were assisted at a phone consultation between April and June 2020. We used a semi-structured interview, that compared phone to physical consultations, regarding different dimensions: 1) accessibility and availability of care;2) effectiveness of communication (concretely, in the sub-dimensions of expression by oneself, understanding by the doctor and understanding by oneself);3) therapeutic relationship (specifically, in the sub-dimensions of one's own posture in the relationship, empathy / respect for the doctor and trust in the doctor);4) therapeutic results;5) satisfaction with care and 7) confidentiality. Results: Out of the 50 interviewed adolescent's caregivers, 34 (68%) consider there is an increment in access and availability with phone consultations. To 28 caregivers (56%), the way of expressing themselves has been affected and 33 (66%) believe that the doctor understands them in just the same manner. The majority considers there is no difference in doctor's empathy/respect (n=34, 68%), neither in reliance on the doctor (n=44, 88%). More than a half refers the therapeutic results are inferior (n=27, 54%) but the same number mentions satisfaction with the care provided (n=27, 54%). Confidentiality and trust in doctor seem to be the same, in telephone consultations, to 40 (80%) caregivers, while 8 (16%) said it is more difficult, due to impaired communication and doubts about maintaining privacy. Curiously, 2 parents (4%) consider that this aspect is superior in the telephone consultation, because face-to-face consultations are for the adolescent, and this is a way of having an exclusive and private time for them. Discussion: One of the findings to be highlighted is the benefit of phone consultations in terms of accessibility and availability of care (due to the absence of travel and less time spent). Communication seems to be impaired in phone consultations, which was mainly justified by the absence of body language and eye contact. However, due to increased access and availability, in the face of public health contingencies, most patient's caregivers were pleased with the care received. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry has emerged as a promising treatment option in the pandemic context. Nevertheless, to be a viable complement and/or alternative to physical consultations, it demands further training and investigation. It could also be important to evaluate the perspective of the adolescents and health professionals themselves, crossing it with that of caregivers, for a complete assessment of the experience from different point of views.

"Challenges among Children during Three Phases of COVID-19 in Pakistan","Children are not indifferent to mental health issues in response to COVID-19 and experienced surge of challenges. Therefore, in the current study children of 8 to 16 years were recruited to investigate the challenges and its impact on children mental health during all three phases of COVID-19. The Colaizzis phenomenological method for qualitative analysis was used to investigate the students response. The reactions of students were summarized into three themes and sixteen sub-themes considering all three phases of COVID-19. The three major themes are religious concerns, mental health issues, and academic concerns. The findings have been discussed in terms of counselling for mental health issues and devising online education policy to meet children needs and carter their fears.","Rehman, Sana","https://doi.org/10.46743/2160-3715/2021.4976","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: The Qualitative Report; 26(12):3870-3885, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25308,""
"P0493 COVID-19 related perceived stress in patients with rheumatic diseases: an Italian cross-sectional study","Background: COVID-19 outbreak is a public emergency that forced people to a radical change in their daily life, generating great insecurities and concerns about health, work, and social relationships [1]. Quarantine measures were responsible for detrimental effects on mental health of the general population, leading to the exacerbation of stress, depression and anxiety [2]. Psychological impact might be even more severe on fragile people such as those suffering from rheumatic diseases (RDs), for whom previous evidence demonstrated a negative effect of psychological stressors on outcome disease [3]. Objective: The aim of the present study is to identify the factors associated with higher levels of perceived stress in patients affected by RDs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from an anonymous online survey about mental health of people with RDs. Participants were enrolled through several RD patientsâ€™ associations between May and September 2020, after the first pandemic wave in Italy. They filled out a questionnaire including demographic and clinical information, mental health issues and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Perceived stress levels were stratified as follows: low (&lt;14), moderate (14-26) and high (&gt;27). Descriptive analyses were performed on the total sample;one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson's correlation were used to compare PSS scores between groups defined by qualitative and quantitative variables. Finally, multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify independent variables associated with higher PSS scores. Results: 507 patients with RDs participated in the survey: 419 females (82.6%) and 88 males (17.4%) with a mean age of 53.06 years and mean disease duration of 13.74 years. As regard PSS scores, total sample mean (SD) was 18.1 Â± 8.1. Specifically, 154 patients (30,4%) reported low, 264 (52.1%) moderate and 89 (17.6%) high levels of stress. PSS scores resulted significantly different with regard to: gender (F=18.32, P&lt;0.01), residence in Lombardy (F=14.90, P&lt;0.01), diagnostic group (F=6.20, P&lt;0.01), hypertension (F=4.06, P=0.04), gastritis (F=3.83, P=0.05), bowel diseases (F=9.74, P&lt;0.01), overweight/obesity (F=5.96, P=0.02), COVID-19 infection (F=4.32, P=0.01), depressive symptoms (F=17.18, P&lt;0.01), anxiety symptoms (F=19.79, P&lt;0.01), prescription of psychiatric therapy before COVID-19 (F=30.90, P&lt;0.01), type of pre-existing psychiatric symptoms (F=12.41, P&lt;0.01), use of psychiatric compounds before COVID-19 (F=36.39, P&lt;0.01), type of psychiatric compounds before COVID-19 (F=13.53, P&lt;0.01), current prescription of psychiatric compounds (F=44.68, P&lt;0.01), type of ongoing psychiatric compounds (F=15.18, P&lt;0.01), anxiety sources (F=30.90, P&lt;0.01). Independent variables associated with higher PSS scores were: female gender (ÃŸ=0.12, P&lt;0.01), younger age (ÃŸ=-0.23, P&lt;0.01), residence outside Lombardy (ÃŸ=-0.09, P=0.03), presence of overweight/obesity (ÃŸ=0.11, P=0.01), current prescription of psychiatric compounds (ÃŸ=0.26, P &lt;0.01) and financial difficulties (ÃŸ=0.19, P &lt;0.01). Conclusion: Our findings highlight the considerable psychological impact derived from COVID-19 pandemic on people affected by RDs. In addition, different factors resulted to be predictive of significant levels of perceived stress in these patients.

"P0494 Which rheumatic patients are more vulnerable to the stressful effects of COVID-19?","Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition that may develop after exposure to a traumatic event [1];COVID-19 pandemic could be defined as a traumatic experience since it has resulted in either direct (e.g. the fear of contagion and the risk of death) or indirect aftermaths (e.g. psychological distress, depression and anxiety) [2]. Besides, it has been shown that PTSD, promoting inflammatory responses, might worsen the prognosis of patients affected by illnesses characterized by systemic inflammation such as rheumatic diseases (RDs) [3]. Objective: The aim of the present study is to verify the presence of PTSD symptoms and related factors in patients suffering from RDs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from an anonymous online survey about mental health of people with RDs. Participants were enrolled through several RD patientsâ€™ associations between May and September 2020, after the first pandemic wave in Italy. They filled out a questionnaire including demographic and clinical information, mental health issues and the 22-items of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The total score ranges from 0 to 88;a score = 33 defines patients at risk of PTSD. Descriptive analyses were performed on the total sample: one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to compare IES-R scores between groups defined by qualitative variables;Pearson's correlations were performed to study the relation between rating scale scores and quantitative variables. Finally, multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify independent variables associated with IES-R scores. Results: 507 patients with RDs participated in the survey: 419 females (82.6%) and 88 males (17.4%) with a mean age of 53.06 years and mean disease duration of 13.74 years. As regard IES-R scores, total sample mean (SD) was 29.7 Â± 17.5;of note, 209 participants (41.2%) had scores =33. IES-R scores resulted to be significantly different according to: gender (F=14.75, P&lt;0.01), residence in Lombardy (F=8.22, P&lt;0.01), diagnostic group (F=4.17, P= 0.02), prescription of psychiatric therapy before COVID-19 (F=17.87, P&lt;0.01), type of pre-existing psychiatric symptoms (F=7.59, P&lt;0.01), use of psychiatric compounds before COVID-19 (F=27.17, P&lt;0.01), type of psychiatric compounds before COVID-19 (F=14.58, P&lt;0.01), current prescription of psychiatric compounds (F=29.30, P&lt;0.01), type of ongoing psychiatric compounds (F=13.81, P&lt;0.01), anxiety source (F=20.81, P&lt;0.01), and the presence of overweight/obesity (F=7.60, P&lt; 0.01), bowel diseases (F=8.00, P&lt;0.01), depressive symptoms (F=5.74, P=0.02), anxiety symptoms (F=26.81, P&lt;0.01). Independent variables associated with higher IES-R scores were: female gender (ÃŸ=0.14, P &lt;0.01), living outside Lombardy (ÃŸ=-0.10, P=0.02), intestinal diseases (ÃŸ=0.10, P=0.03), anxiety (ÃŸ=0.19, P &lt;0.01) and health related concerns (ÃŸ=0.13, P &lt;0.01). Conclusion: These findings point out high rate of severe self-reported distress among Italian RD patients in response to the pandemic.

"P0646 The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on peripartum affective psychopathology","Background: The outbreak of 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) significantly determined political, economic and social changes as well impacted on mental health. To date, few studies evaluated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health [1]. The aim of this study is to assess the mental health status and psychological distress of pregnant and puerperal women during the current situation experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Among 185 women consecutively screened at our Perinatal Psychiatric Outpatient Service during the timeframe March 2020-March 2021, and after a further screening a total sample consisting of 70 were recruited (41 pregnant and 29 puerperal women). The sample was administered a battery of perinatal questionnaires as well as specifically designed COVID-related questionnaires. The EPDS (Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale), FCV-19-S (Fear of Covid-19 Scale), CAS (Coronavirus Anxiety Scale), and an ad hoc socio-demographic and clinical questionnaire were administered to the sample of pregnant women. While the same battery of tests together with the WDEQ (Wijmia Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire) were administered to the sample of puerperal women. Statistical analyses were carried out by using ANOVA and the X2 test. Significance was measured at P&lt;0.005. Results: The median total score at EPDS was 7.9, at FCV-19-S of 14.9, at CASof 1.7 and at WDEQ of 100.9 (part A) and 100.9 (part B). A statistically significant difference was found at FCV-19-S scores between pregnant and postpartum women (16 Â± SD 6.9 vs 13.4 Â± SD 4.4;p=0.003). In addition, women who scored at the EPDS = 12 displayed statistically significant higher scores at FCV-19-S (p=0.005). Similarly, those who had a score higher than the cut-off at the EPDS showed statistically significant higher total scores at CAS (p=0.003). Moreover, those who achieved a clinically significant value at FCV-19-S reached significantly higher values at the CAS (p&lt;0.001). There was a trend (p=0.076) in women with lower FCV-19-S scores who display higher WDEQ-A scores compared to those not clinically significant. Furthermore, a positive correlation (F=0.377) was observed between the EPDS and the CAS and between the CAS and the FCV-19-S (F=0.641). There was, also, a positive correlation, albeit with a less significant significance (F=0.290) between EPDS and FCV-19-S. those women who had a miscarriage, displayed statistically significant higher CAS total scores, compared to control group (p=0.0028). Moreover, women with a previous pregnancy displayed higher CAS total scores (p=0.028). Conclusions: Altogether, our findings reported a significant impact that COVID-19-related pandemic and its related restriction measures had among women in the pregnancy and/or postpartum period, by underlining how the current situation greatly impacted in terms of stress and mental distress also in a particular vulnerable population. For this reason, it might could be useful to propose screening tools to all pregnant women and during their first year of postpartum, in order to early identify and provide preventive and therapeutic strategies to help this particularly vulnerable population.

"GUT-BRAIN AXIS AND IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME DURING SARS COV-2 PANDEMIC A SURVEY BASED STUDY","INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder with high prevalenceimpacting on patientâ€™s quality of life. IBS is considered a multifactorial entity, in whichsocioemotional factors and social stress might play a central role in the generation andworsening of symptoms. The mandatory lockdown in response to SARS CoV-2 pandemic,represents a unique scenario of reduced social interaction and complexity, potentially impactingthe IBS-patientsâ€™ symptoms evolution. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the mandatorylockdown due to the SARS CoV-2 pandemic on the brain-gut axis symptomatology inIBS patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All IBS-diarrhea and mixed bowel habits patternsubtype patients, from an existing Rome IV-defined cohort database, were invited to participate(n = 129, mean age 54 [+/-16], 78% female). Patients were assessed via an onlinesurvey or phone interview. The survey included Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Scale(IBS-SS), Likert scale, as well as measures of Bristol scale, anxiety and depression andsomatization. Further, patients were asked about comorbidities (pyrosis and/or regurgitation,dyspepsia, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, non-migraine headache, weight and eating habits).Most of this data was compared with pre-pandemic existing data. RESULTS: During lockdown,there was a significant decrease in severe IBS patientsâ€™ proportion (50.39 % vs 30%, p=0.000) compared to the pre pandemic state. Before pandemic, this cohort of patientshad a mean IBS-SS of 278.54 (+/- 88.64) compared to 212.36 (+/-117.50) during lockdown(difference -65.9 [95% CI: -89.4 to â€“ 42.4];p = 0.000). Likewise, there was a decrease ofone average point on the Likert Scale on global IBS symptoms, pain, and distension, as wellas an improvement in stool consistency (2-point average decrease on Bristol Scale). Similarly,anxiety and somatization scores were improved and there was a significant decrease infibromyalgia and chronic fatigue symptoms during lockdown (in comparison with prepandemictimes). Conversely, headache and pyrosis and/or regurgitation symptoms increasedsignificantly. These effects remained when adjusted for confounders (age, sex, anxiety, anddepression), evidencing that the mandatory lockdown represented an independent protectivefactor for severe IBS-symptoms (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18-0.87;p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Incomparison with a pre-pandemic period, there was a significant improvement in IBS-severitysymptoms, anxiety and somatization during the SARS CoV-2 pandemic and mandatorylockdown. Lesser exposure to external stress burden during lockdown could have beeninvolved in a better control of affecting gut-brain axis factors.(Table Presented)(Image Presented)","Piskorz, M.; Stefanolo, J.

"P0817 Sociodemographic and lifestyle predictors of mental health adaptability during COVID-19 compulsory confinement: a longitudinal study","Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 and the physical isolation measures taken by the governments to reduce its propagation might have negative psychological consequences on the population [1, 2]. In this study, we aimed to explore, for the first time, how mental health status fluctuated along the weeks of the emergency state in Portugal, and to identify which factors may shape these changes in mental health outcomes. Methods: A longitudinal survey study using a convenience sample was conducted, evaluating demographic, clinical, lifestyle and mental health variables in the Portuguese population at three different time-points. Mental health was assessed by means of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and with quality of life (QoL) self-evaluation, satisfaction, and quality of sleep questions. Google Forms was used for the online survey, and social media and national newspapers were used to advertise and recruit possible volunteers. The first time-point took place between the 23rd of March and the 5th of April 2020, and the second and third time-points were 4 weeks and 8 weeks later, respectively. 748 participants (mean age = 39.52, % females = 79.95) provided data at all time-points. Repeated-measures analyses were performed to explore whether mental health significantly varied across time. Next, multiple regression models were used in order to identify the sociodemographic, clinical and lifestyle factors significantly associated with each dependent variable's change (DASS-21 subscales and QoL measures). The following predictors were tested in the multiple regression models: age, sex, employment status, house balcony and/or terrace, living with children/teenagers/elderly, having a diagnosis of a psychiatric/physical disorder, consumption of substances several times a week, daily amount of time dedicated to sport/looking for COVID-19 related news, and the NEO-FFI subscales. Results We observed that depression (<U+03C7>2F(2)=23.19, p&lt;.001, Kendall's W=0.793), anxiety (<U+03C7>2F(2)=97.04, p&lt;.001, Kendall's W=0.745) and stress (<U+03C7>2F(2)=35.11, p&lt;.001, Kendall's W=0.788) symptoms seemed to improve as the weeks passed during the state of emergency, while the perception of quality of life (self-evaluation: <U+03C7>2F(2)=140.4, p&lt;.001, Kendall's W=0.749;satisfaction: <U+03C7>2F(2)=82.02, p&lt;.001, Kendall's W=0.765) and sleep (<U+03C7>2F(2)=23.5, p&lt;.001, Kendall's W=0.796) got worse. All multiple regression models were statistically significant (DASS-21 Depression: F(17,730)=6.53;p&lt;.001, R2=0.132;DASS-21 Anxiety: F(17,730)=5.12;p&lt;.001, R2=0.106;DASS-21 Stress: F(17,730)=7.16;p&lt;.001, R2=0.143;QoL self-evaluation: F(17,730)=5.8;p&lt;.001, R2=0.119;QoL satisfaction: F(17,730)=6.9;p&lt;.001, R2=0.138;Quality of sleep: F(17,730)=1.98;p=.01, R2=0.044). Regarding the significant predictors, in summary, being female, younger, actively working, and extroverted appear to be protective factors of mental health adaptability during this particular period. On the contrary, having a psychiatric diagnosis or physical illness, and higher neuroticism seem to be risk factors for mental health worsening. Conclusions: Our results provide relevant and novel insights about the course of mental health changes and its predictors during the outbreak of COVID-19, which may help identify potential vulnerability groups. Importantly, the lack of a more diverse sample could limit the generalizability of our results, and other factors that were not considered in our analysis might also have a significant impact on mental health.

"P0729 Highlights of psychedelic history and current research on psilocybin application for treatment of depression â€“ a comprehensive literature review","Introduction: Psychedelics have seen various labels: mystical sacrament aids, potential interrogation tools for the Cold War, agents for social change in the Hippie counter movement, a panacea for various mental disorders, and a tool to â€œhackâ€ of the psyche. This has led to their reputation as both societal threat and a psychopharmacological breakthrough. After the loss of data on over 1000 clinical papers spanning 40000 study subjects in the 60's, a 40-year hiatus, and a few very determined researchers, new insights of increasingly quality have been emerging from research on the potential benefits of the use of psilocybin in depression. We aim to review available data on psilocybin for treating depression, providing a bird's-eye view on the literature (historical and current), while reporting potential neurobiological, psychological and cognitive mechanisms involved, safety and methodological concerns (as well as recent advancements), emerging modalities of treatment, with a commentary on social and cultural movements occurring in parallel to the scientific endeavor to create regulated and scientifically approved treatments. Methods: Eligible studies will be identified through an electronic search of Medline and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to the date of  submission. The search strategy will combine relevant standardized subject terms and text words for psychedelics, psilocybin, and depression, with relevant Boolean operators implemented. Only articles written in the English language will be included. Reference lists from eligible studies will be cross-checked to identify potential additional studies. For data synthesis, results and outcomes will be explored narratively, along reporting and critical analysis of relevant statistical data. Results: Psilocybin emulates serotonin, with special affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor. Neuroimaging studies suggest an attenuation of the default mode network and an overall increase in multiple brain area connectivity [1]. Current treatment models involve previous psychological profiling and preparation, followed by one to two sessions where administration of 25 mg of psilocybin under supervision and support from the researcher, a physician, and a therapist, with post-treatment integration. Since 2011, five clinical studies, evaluated psilocybin treatment efficacy on patients suffering from clinical depression [2,3,4]. Limited by small samples, variability of setting, timeline, and methodology, they combined number of 139 patients. Despite these limitations, 60% of patients reported significant symptom reduction (58-83%) providing promising preliminary evidence for further investment. A recent trial found no significant difference in antidepressant effects between psilocybin and escitalopram in a selected group of patients, further contributing to this trend of research [5]. Over 50 studies addressing effects of psilocybin in depression have been approved on clinicaltrials.gov. One of these [6] is a phase 2 multicentered clinical trial, aiming to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in treatment resistant depression in a variable dose range. Conclusion: Psilocybin might become a promising approach to depression. These therapies have been (re)gaining social and cultural support, with parallel â€œoff labelâ€ use in various spiritual and psychotherapeutic settings. There is a need for the upmost rigor in designing future research. Psilocybin might emerge as an important therapeutic tool for current and upcoming global mental health challenges in a post-COVID-19 world.

"P0196 Post-traumatic stress symptoms among parents of children with covid-19 suspected infection in the acute phase of covid-19 pandemic in Italy","Background: Since the identification of a cluster of pneumonia cases in China (Wuhan) in December 2019, the COronaVIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak rapidly spread across different countries. Italy was the first European Country to face COVID-19 Emergency and one of the most affected. The COVID-19 Emergency has forced people to change everyday life habits in response to restrictions, stimulating people's feelings of fear and physical health threat, increasing the risk of psychological adverse outcomes, such as anxiety, depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) [1]. A severe illness in one's child is acknowledged to be a destabilizing event, having a negative impact on parent psychological wellbeing with an increased risk of negative mental health consequences, among which PTSS throughout the development of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) [2,3]. Consistently with this evidence, parents who interfaced with suspected COVID-19 infection in their children, particularly in the early acute phase of the pandemic, may have resulted a challenging population at risk for negative psychological consequences [4]. However, scant data explored this issue. Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate psychological outcomes on parents who accessed Pediatric Emergency Departments of three University Hospitals in Italy (Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Pisana, Pisa;Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Sant'Orsola Malpighi, Bologna;Fondazione IRCSS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia) for symptoms of suspicious COVID-19 in their children during the acute phase of the COVID-19 outbreak (April, 2020), with particular attention to the onset of PTSS. Methods: 110 parents of children with suspected COVID-19 were recruited within one month from diagnostic assessment for COVID-19 and were assessed through the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to evaluate PTSS. Comparison of socio-demographic and clinical features between subjects with and without PTSS was performed. A logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with the development of PTSS. Results: 39 (35.4%) parents reported moderate to severe PTSS (IES-R score=24). Results showed parents of children tested positive for COVID-19 being more prone to develop PTSS as compared to those whose children were negative (p&lt;0.001). Similarly, PTSS rates were significantly higher among mothers with respect to fathers (p=0.012), among those tested positive themselves for COVID-19 compared to those negative (p=0.026) and among those who received indication to quarantine with respect to ones who had not (p&lt;0.001). Mean age of participants was significantly lower among subjects with PTSS than those without (p=0.025). Finally, having a child tested positive for COVID-19 showed a positive association with the onset of PTSS (p=0.007). Conclusions: These results highlight the traumatic burden of children's illness on parents, particularly on the mothers that, besides representing the most vulnerable gender to post-traumatic stress reactions, often represent the principal caregiver and suggest the need of further studies to address tailored prevention and intervention strategies, also in the framework of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

"Study of screening of mental health status of coronavirus disease-19 confirmed noncritical patients admitted at a tertiary care hospital and a coronavirus disease care center in Ahmedabad","Background: Despite coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) being a major health crisis in the current times, only a few studies have addressed its potential direct effect on mental health, especially among COVID-19 patients. Aims: This study was conducted to assess the mental health of COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: In cross sectional study, mental health status of 301 symptomatic and 200 asymptomatic COVID-19 participants was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire-28. Results: Around 8.78% COVID-19 patients were found to be psychologically distressed that was predominantly higher among symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Risk of psychological distress was significantly higher in females, living in nuclear families and having a history of addiction. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients suffer from psychological distress, which needs to be addressed to cope well with this pandemic situation.","Parikh, Nimesh, Balchandani, Anisha, Nakum, Dhruv, Patel, Bintal, Bhowmick, Shreyasee, Shah, Nilima, Darji, Vinod","https://doi.org/10.4103/psychiatry.IndianJPsychiatry_930_20","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Indian Journal of Psychiatry; 63(6):584-587, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25316,""
"P0797 Effects on mental health, sleep and quality of life in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection","Background: Experience from previous coronavirus outbreaks had shown that infected patients are at risk for developing psychiatric disorders, such as mood and sleep disturbances. Similarly, accumulating evidence suggests that patients with COVID-19 infection experience an excess of adverse psychological outcomes and neuropsychiatric complications [1,2]. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization on the mental health, quality of life, and sleep of patients following hospital discharge. Methods: Patients were assessed during follow up visits in the outpatient clinic 1-2 months after hospital discharge from a large Covid-19 reference hospital in Athens, Greece (from May 8th 2020 till February 4th 2021) using validated screening tools for Depression and Anxiety (HADS), post-traumatic stress disorder (IES-R), sleeping difficulties (Athens Insomnia Scale, AIS), and Quality of Life (EQ-5D-5L). Sociodemographic information, smoking history, co-morbidities and severity of disease (hospitalization, ICU) were also collected. Results: A total of 131 eligible patients who provided informed consent were included. Overall, Covid-19 patients experienced considerable levels of mental health symptoms following hospital discharge. Moreover, rates were significantly higher for female compared to male patients despite having shorter duration of hospitalizations (14.89 vs 18.82 bed days) and/or ICU admissions (13.51 vs 14.92). This finding was consistent across all recorded psychological outcomes i.e. depression (p=0.004), anxiety (p=0.017), traumatic stress (p&lt;0.001), fear (p&lt;0.001) and insomnia (p=0.002). In addition, differences in prevalence rates between genders were particularly marked for moderate levels of depression and traumatic stress and for severe levels of anxiety. Smoking and comorbidities were not found to significantly correlate with the presence of affective symptoms or sleep dysfunction. However, an association was observed between severity and the existence of comorbidity with the proportion of patients with comorbidities increasing from 67.5% of the patients with minimal depression to 91.43% to those with mild and 80% with moderate depression (p-value=0.018). Finally, quality of life was worse for patients that have had an admission in the ICU (EQ-5D-5L: 15.82 Â± 5.27) compared to those who were hospitalized but did not require ICU treatment (EQ-5D-5L: 8.39 Â± 2.81) (p-value&lt;0.001). Conclusion: COVID-19 disease can have a significant psychological impact on hospitalized patients and particularly women despite the relative less severe course of their illness. This finding is in line with a previous study, showing that, despite significantly lower levels of baseline inflammatory markers, female patients suffered more for both anxiety and depression at one-month follow-up following hospital admission (3). Regardless of potential sex differences, the prevalence of moderate and severe mental illness symptoms in COVID-19 patients may be higher compared with the general population or other high risk groups such as different patient groups or healthcare workers [2-4]. Our results highlight the need for appropriate interventions to promote physical and mental wellbeing of COVID-19 survivors and cater for long-term needs.

"P0279 Neural underpinnings of depressive and post-traumatic symptomatology in covid-19 survivors: a voxel-based morphometry study","Background: A high prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia and PTSD has been reported in COVID-19 survivors [1]. This is similar to what previously observed in other Coronavirus-related diseases such as SARS and MERS [2]. The pathophysiology of post-infection neuropsychiatric symptoms is likely to be multifactorial, with a role played by inflammatory and immunological factors [3], but it is still largely unknown;we thus investigated COVID-19 survivors via 3T MRI imaging to identify neural underpinnings of post-infection neuropsychiatric symptoms in order to further elucidate their complex pathophysiology. Methods: Covid-19 survivors were recruited during an ongoing prospective cohort study at IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital in Milan;psychopathology was initially measured via several self-report questionnaires (Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS), 13-item Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI));subsequently patients (n=28) underwent 3T MRI scanning (Philips 3T Ingenia CX scanner with 32-channel sensitivity encoding SENSE head coil). T1 weighted images were processed using Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12) for Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) in Matlab R2016b;segmentation into Gray Matter, White Matter and cerebrospinal fluid, bias regularization, non-linear modulation and normalization to MNI space were performed;measures of Total Intracranial Volume (TIV) were obtained and images were smoothed with an 8-mm full width at half maximum Gaussian filter. Multiple regressions were performed using SPM12 software package: with no a priori regions of interest selected, whole-brain gray matter volumes were used as dependent variables, psychometric scales scores as independent variables, and age, sex and TIV as nuisance covariates. Results: After VBM regression analysis covarying for age, sex and TIV, ZSDS Index scores were inversely correlated with gray matter volume in the Bilateral Anterior Cingulate Cortex (MNI 2, 24, 28, cluster level pFWE = 0.045, k=767);furthermore 3 cluster were identified comprising again the anterior cingulate cortex and the insular cortex bilaterally in which IES-R scores were inversely correlated with gray matter volumes (Cluster 1: MNI -30, 9, 3, cluster level pFWE = 0.005, k=1284;Cluster 2: MNI 36, -3, -3, cluster level pFWE = 0.037, k=773;Cluster 3: MNI 9, 30, 28, cluster level pFWE = 0.038, k=766). No other statistical significant result was found. Conclusions: Our study identified an inverse correlation between anterior cingulate cortex volumes and depressive symptomatology, measured via ZSDS, and between bilateral insulae and anterior cingulate cortex volumes and the degree of distress in response to the traumatic event, measured via the IES-R. Analogous findings have already been reported in patients with Major depression [4] and PTSD [5], and our study confirms the role of volumetric reductions of these brain regions in depressive and post-traumatic symptomatology. Given the nature of our study it is not possible to infer whether the reduction of gray matter volume is a consequence of the Covid-19 infection itself or, as it appears more likely, precede the infection acting as predisposing factor for the subsequent development of depressive and post-traumatic symptomatology.

"Subjective experience on group activities of patients admitted in a psychiatric facility during the COVID-19 epidemic: ""the Santi's Magazine""","Objectives Italy is one of the most affected countries in the world during the COVID-19 pandemic. The recurring waves of the epidemic largely compromised routine activities of the Italian Departments of Mental Health, significantly reducing outpatient and day service activities. Psychiatric facility and hospital treatments have also been maintained. albeit widely remodeled and conditioned by the fear of contagion. The aim of this paper was to report the subjective experiences on group activities offered in an Italian psychiatric facility for intensive interventions (the Santi Center) during the second wave of the pandemic in the fall of 2020. Methods The format of these group activities included weekly face-to-face meetings using supportive, psychoeducational motor and relaxing techniques, all conducted by mental health professionals. Here we reported the participants' subjective experiences written during the two months of these meetings, all of which merged into the special 2020 Christmas edition of the Santi's magazine. Results All participants (8 out of 12 inpatients hospitalized in the facility at that time) were affected by psychotic disorders. Patients' experiences on group activities were uniformly positive. In this paper we reported the most significant passages. Conclusions Inpatients with psychotic disorder found our group activities very beneficial. Our real-world experience is a useful witness to contrast the general paralysis of mental healthcare interventions, which too much often affected Italian mental healthcare services during the pandemic. Moreover it advances our understanding of the usefulness of group activities for increasing patient's resilience also in an epidemic era and in a forced social isolation.","Palmisano, D.; Leuci, E.; Varesi, D.; Taurino, M.

"P0691 Mood-congruent cognitive distortion and processing bias in depressed covid-19 survivors: a comparison with major depressive disorder","Introduction. COVID-19 survivors often experience psychiatric sequelae, with depressive psychopathology as the leading cause for needing psychiatric intervention [1]. Depressive cognitive distortion is a core feature of major depression, fostering the experience of negative emotions and hampering recovery [2]. Moreover, cognitive biases are well-documented in patients with inflammatory diseases and associated depressive symptomatology [3]. Considering both the high prevalence of clinical depression among COVID-19 survivors and the critical role of cognitive distortions in depression, we consider of crucial importance to investigate cognitive processing biases in COVID-19 survivors. Methods. We studied 729 participants, divided in three groups: (1) 362 COVID-19 survivors;(2) 73 inpatients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD);(3) 294 healthy participants (HC). Severity of depression was self-rated on the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS). Neuropsychological bias toward emotional stimuli and the general negative outlook on the self were tested in a self-description task [4], during which subjects were asked to self-attribute or refuse positive and negative morally tuned adjectives, and latencies and frequencies of attribution were recorded. Depressive dysfunctional attitudes in causal attribution and interpretation of hypothetical events were measured on the Cognition Questionnaire (CQ). We performed homogeneity of slope or separate slopes analysis when appropriate in the context of Generalized linear model (GLMZ), with an identity link function. Likelihood ratio test was computed as a measure of significance for tested effects and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was obtained as goodness of fit measure [5]. Results. 22.4% COVID survivors self-rated their depressive symptoms above the clinical threshold. Bias in speed of information processing significantly predicts self-description in all groups (COVID depressed: Wald W2=19.81;COVID non depressed: W2=15.48;MD: W2=13.65;HC: W2=33.54;all p&lt;0.001). Information processing bias and frequencies of attribution of morally negative elements strongly predicted the severity of self-rated depressive psychopathology (ZSDS scores) (Processing bias: LR <U+03C7>2=40.99, p&lt;0.0001;Frequencies: LR <U+03C7>2=127.89, p&lt;0.0001). Additionally, the cognitive distortion in causal attribution and interpretation of hypothetical events (CQ scores) in depressed post-COVID patients showed intermediate levels of severity in all dimensions between non-depressed post-COVID patients, and MDD (post-hoc Fisher's least significance test: p&lt;0.05 at all comparisons). Moreover, the CQ total score significantly influenced the ZSDS scores (<U+03C7>2=84.60, p&lt;0.0001). Interestingly, homogeneity of slope analysis revealed regression slopes were parallel in COVID-depressed and hospitalized MD patient groups in all models, yielding no significant group interaction. Finally, bias in information processing and negative self-description both predicted CQ scores (Latencies ratio: <U+03C7>2=3.91, p=0.0479;Frequencies: <U+03C7>2=42.96, p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions. The breadth of moral self-reproach and the severity of cognitive distortion in evaluating events showed the same association with severity of depression in MDD and in post-COVID depressed patients, distributing along a gradient of severity, thus suggesting that these individual features of depressive cognitive distortion are shared in these conditions and should be addressed as treatment targets in depressed COVID-19 survivors.

"P0014 Alcohol use, anger, aggression, resilience, and family support during the Covid-19 lockdown in Greece","Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has affected people's lives in a wide range of dimensions, precipitating psychological problems [1], health behavior changes, and addictive issues, including alcohol consumption [2]. Mental resilience and family support emerge as protective factors against the pandemic-induced worsening of mental state [1,3]. Aim: To investigate the relationship between alcohol use, anger, aggression, resilience and family support in a general and healthcare population sample during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: An online cross-sectional study was conducted during the Greek lockdown (April 2020). 378 participants (247 healthcare workers and 131 individuals from the general population) completed the following self-report mental health measures: The alcohol use disorder questionnaire CAGE, the Dimensions of Anger Reactions-5 (DAR-5), the Brief Aggression Questionnaire (BAQ) [4], the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) and the Family Support Scale (FSS) [5]. Descriptive statistics were computed for all variables in the analysis. Independent-samples t-tests assessed for differences between healthcare workers and those from the general population, as well as between individuals who scored above and those who scored below CAGE cut-off score. The internal consistency reliability of the DAR-5, BAQ, BRS and FSS in our sample was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient (=0.70). The Shapiroâ€“Wilk test was used to assess normality of data. Pearson Correlation was performed to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between variables. Linear regression models were built to investigate whether related variables were significant predictors of aggression and alcohol use. Results: The study included 67 men and 311 women (mean age 41.37Â±9.83). 33 participants (8.73%) scored above cut-off (= 2) on CAGE questionnaire. The mean total score on the BAQ was 23.22 Â± 6.7, on the BRS 21.35Â±4.97, on the DAR-5 9.75Â±3.43 and on the FSS 49.74Â±8.65. Healthcare workers displayed higher scores on the DAR-5 scale (10.1Â±3.33 versus 9.08Â±3.5, p&lt;0.01) and on the CAGE questionnaire (0.4Â±0.8 versus 0.24Â±0.67, p&lt;0.05) compared with participants from the general population. Individuals who engaged in problematic alcohol use (CAGE=2) showed a significant increase in aggression (27.42Â±8.5 versus 22.82 Â± 6.38, p&lt;0.001), as well as a significant decrease in the sense of family support (44.62Â±12.08 versus 50.2Â±8.14, p&lt; 0.01). A positive correlation was found between CAGE and BAQ scores (p&lt;0.001), while FSS scores correlated negatively with both CAGE (p&lt;0.01) and BAQ (p&lt;0.001) scores. Positive correlations were evidenced between BRS and FSS scores (p&lt;0.001) and negative between BRS and BAQ scores (p&lt;0.001). Scores on DAR-5 correlated positively with BAQ scores (p&lt;0.001) and negatively with FSS (p&lt;0.001) and BRS scores (p&lt;0.001). BRS scores correlated positively with age (p&lt;0.05). The regression models revealed that â€˜scores on DAR-5â€™, â€˜scores on BRSâ€™, â€˜scores on CAGEâ€™ and â€˜scores on FSSâ€™ were all significant predictors of â€˜scores on BAQâ€™, each explaining 13.7%, 5.6%, 3.8% and 0.9% of the variance. Also â€˜Scores on BAQâ€™ were significant predictors of â€˜scores on CAGEâ€™ explaining 5.6% of the variance. Conclusion: Problematic alcohol use during the Covid-19 pandemic was 8.73% and seemed to fuel the high levels of aggression in this subpopulation, while minimizing the protective effects of family support.

"P0641 Mental health status of the intensive care unit healthcare workers in an university hospital at the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic","Background: COVID-19 has quickly led to a global pandemic after WHO announced it as a new viral pneumonia on December 31, 2019 (1). A pandemic is defined as a disease or infectious factor that occurs worldwide or in a wide area which crosses international borders and affects a large number of people (2). Mental health is also significantly affected during pandemic periods as well as physical health (3). When the studies about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health status of healthcare workers are examined, a study by Lai et al. in China revealed that depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stress symptoms appeared in a significant portion of healthcare workers, particularly in women, nurses and frontline healthcare workers (4). In the literatÃ¼re, it was also stated that healthcare workers, especially those working in the emergency department, intensive care unit, and infectious diseases services, were at high risk for psychiatric disorders (5). Objective: To reveal anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and stress levels in intensive care unit healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigate the factors affecting them. Method: 79 participants working at Adiyaman University Hospital Intensive Care Units between 20-30 April 2020 were included in the study. Participants filled the questionnaire form regarding sociodemographic data and COVID-19, and PSQI, DASS-42, BDI, and BAI scales. SPSS 25.0 was used for statistical analysis. T-Test and Mann-Whitney-U tests were used for Independent Groups in paired comparison groups and Kruskal-Wallis tests in triple comparison groups. Results: 58 of the participants were the healthcare workers of intensive care units with COVID-19 (+) patients. 22 of the participants were doctors, 43 were nurses, and 14 were other healthcare workers. It was found that 19 of the participants had poor sleep quality, 35 had depression, 51 had anxiety, and 44 had distress. Participants working in intensive care units with COVID-19 (+) patients were found to have higher DASS-S, BAI, and BDI scores than the participants working in other intensive care units (p &lt;0.016, p &lt;0.023, p &lt;0.039, respectively). Doctors were found to have lower BDI scores than nurses and other healthcare workers (p &lt;0.033, p &lt;0.001, respectively), and the participants with COVID-19 symptoms were found to have higher mean BAI scores than those without COVID-19 symptoms (p &lt;0.010). Conclusion: The main findings of this study included that healthcare workers in intensive care units with COVID-19 (+) patients had higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, doctors had lower levels of depression than nurses and other healthcare workers, those with COVID-19 symptoms had higher anxiety levels. In the light of these findings, providing psychological and social support for the mental health of healthcare workers at the frontline departments such as intensive care units during the COVID-19 pandemic has a great importance. Remarkably, healthcare workers who are in direct contact with COVID-19 (+) patients should be evaluated in terms of depression, anxiety, and stress. There is a need for prospective studies with large samples to reveal the effects of psychological interventions on this issue.

"OUTCOMES OF AN UNGUIDED, WEB-BASED COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY PROGRAM FOR IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME DELIVERED DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is linked with elevated anxiety and depression in the general population, both of which are associated with more severe IBS symptoms. This analysis of a pilot feasibility study assessed IBS, depression, and anxiety outcomes of a webdelivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program for IBS management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In April 2020, 25 participants with at least mild IBS symptoms (IBS-Symptom Severity Scale [IBS-SSS] score $75) were randomly selected from a participant registry (average age 39 years, 72% female;see Table 1 for prevalence of IBS types). Participants were provided 12-week access to an 8-session online CBT program. At 2 and 3-month follow-up, participants reported whether they or a loved one were directly impacted by COVID-19. Depressive (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and IBS symptoms (IBSSSS) were measured at baseline and 3 months. Results: Eleven participants reported being impacted by COVID-19. Among participants with 3-month follow-up data, IBS symptoms significantly decreased at 3 months (p&lt;0.0001), with 63.6% (n=14) experiencing clinically meaningful improvement (i.e., a $50-point reduction on the IBS-SSS). Of the COVID-19 impacted subgroup, 63.6% (n=7) also had a clinically meaningful improvement. IBS-SSS mean change at 3 months was -66.5 (SD=74.5;95%CI=-16.5, -116.6) among those impacted by COVID-19, relative to -73.9 (SD=49.2;95%CI=-40.9, -107) among those not impacted by COVID-19. Although the correlation was weak between COVID-19 impact status and IBS-SSS change (r=0.06;NS), there was greater variability in IBS-SSS scores among the COVID-19 impacted subgroup (score range 230 points vs. 145 among those not impacted). The average baseline PHQ-9 score (i.e., depressive symptoms) was above the clinical threshold (PHQ-9 $10) for the entire sample and close to the clinical threshold (GAD-7 &gt;10) for baseline anxiety symptoms. Among participants above the PHQ-9 clinical threshold (n=10), depressive symptoms significantly reduced from baseline (M=16.8, SD=4.3) to 3 months (M=11.0, SD=7.1;p&lt;0.05). Similarly, among those above the GAD-7 clinical threshold (n= 11), anxiety symptoms significantly decreased from baseline (M=13.5, SD=3.5) to 3 months (M=7.2, SD=6.9;p&lt;0.05). IBS-SSS, PHQ-9, and GAD-7 scores by COVID-19 impact status are reported in Table 1. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that unguided web-CBT for IBS may address IBS symptom severity and anxiety and depressive symptoms in a sample of adults with IBS, that included those directly impacted by COVID-19 during the first 6 months of the pandemic. The ability to show that a digital therapeutic program provides immediate access during a time when outpatient healthcare was curtailed holds promise for IBS patients as a viable solution for effective care. A larger trial with a comparison group is the next step.","Owusu, J. T.; Sibelli, A.; Sipe, W.

"P0680 Hypernatremia secondary to kidney injury after long-term lithium therapy during COIVD-19 pandemic","Introduction: As bipolar disorder often requires long-term lithium treatment, assessment of adverse effects is critical. Long-term treatment with lithium induces functional and / or structural disturbances in the kidneys. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) occurs in up to 40% of lithium users and leads to a 2-3 times increased risk of chronic kidney disease. Polyuria-associated fluid imbalances and NDI, increase the risk of hypernatremia. Without appropriate and quick treatments, hypernatremia can easily lead to life-threatening consequences. A major adverse effect, hypernatremia secondary to kidney injury induced by lithium should not be misdiagnosed. We report cases of three patients with mood disorders treated with long-term lithium therapy. They presented to our hospital during the state of emergency declared by the Japanese government in response to curb the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. They showed hypernatremia and disturbance of consciousness. All three patients had been taking lithium for more 10 years and had dehydration and / or renal damage on admission. The main cause of clinically significant hypernatremia is not drug-induced kidney injury after long-term lithium treatment, but lithium is one of the most common causes of acquired NDI. Case Report: Case 1 A 65-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder and presented with polyurea, dehydration, and altered consciousness. He had been on lithium carbonate (800 mg twice daily) for over 20 years. Case 2 A 58-year-old woman with recurrent depressive disorder presented with high fever, drowsiness, spasms, and a highly serum creatine phosphokinase. She was admitted to the emergency department to rule out neuroleptic malignant syndrome. She was prescribed lithium carbonate (800 mg twice daily), but was not fully compliant with the treatment. Case 3 A 72-year-old-woman with bipolar disorder and history of hospitalizations at a mental-health rehabilitation institution presented with disturbance of consciousness and psychomotor retardation. She had been on lithium carbonate (400 mg twice daily) for 16 years. Oral dyskinesia and dysarthria were observed as were high fever and confusion. Of the three patients, one was a COVID-19 patient, while the others were not: however, all of them showed hypernatremia. A cohort study showed that infection, intoxication other than lithium, and dehydration were the main causes of hypernatremia. Lithium intoxications only accounted for 1% of all hypernatremia episodes. Probably the COVID-19 infection may directly cause hypernatremia, and dehydration may indirectly cause hypernatremia owing to a close ward, delirium, and physical restraint because they cannot complain about thirst. The COVID-19 pandemic affects the mental health of patients with bipolar disorder. Amounts of alcohol, soft drinks, and food can potentially trigger symptoms of kidney injury and diabetes. Conclusion: These patients with mood disorders after long-term lithium therapy must be carefully monitored their mental condition, including delirium, their complaints, and laboratory data to avoid overlooking severe conditions.

"Quaternary ammonium compounds: perspectives on benefits, hazards, and risk","Quaternary ammonium compounds are antimicrobial chemicals that provide significant public health benefits by controlling bacteria and viruses that cause infections such as colds, flu, and COVID. The benefits of antimicrobial QACs are seen in increased quality-of-life measures, such as reduced time away from work and school and reduced medical costs. As active antimicrobial agents, QACs and QAC-containing consumer and professional products are highly regulated by authorities such as the US Environmental Protection Agency and the European Chemicals Agency. A complete database of guideline safety studies, covering human and environmental health, is available and has been reviewed by multiple regulatory agencies globally. The conclusions of regulatory agencies from these studies indicate no concerns regarding reproductive effects, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, or other systemic adverse effects. In contrast, some published academic studies provide mixed findings on lipid synthesis, reproductive effects, and asthma. However, many of these studies have been found not to be robust in design and lacked appropriate controls to support conclusions of a clear and direct association with an adverse effect. The hazard data for the QACs show that their primary critical effects are point-of-contact effects such as irritation, which exhibit a threshold and occur in a doseâ€“response manner. This review compares toxicity information for QACs, examines human exposures, and quantifies the risks estimated from QAC product use. QACs are an important cleaning and hygiene tool, and the abundance of safety data generated for them provides assurance they can be safely used in professional and household products.","Osimitz, Thomas G.; Droege, Wiebke","https://doi.org/10.1177/23978473211049085","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Toxicology Research and Application; 5, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25326,""
"P0259 Topic modeling analysis of publications on the psychological and psychiatric aspects of covid-19 (monthly dynamics in 2020)","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on psychological well-being around the world. However, it remains unclear if there are trends in the scientific literature for individual countries in mental conditions in case of COVID-19. Objective: Topic modeling of publications on the psychological and psychiatric aspects of COVID-19 and comparing the publication activity monthly during 2020 using machine learning. Methods: systematic search was carried out for publications on the Pubmed for the period from December 2019 to January 2021 and the selection of those related to the psychological and psychiatric aspects of COVID-19. 3366 s were identified and performed into a text corpus. Topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet allocation was carried out using Python-based machine learning. Results: 10 main topics identified: Topic 1 (Public mental health and behavioral patterns in a pandemic and lockdown) showed rapid growth at the beginning of pandemic, with publications peaking in February. By May, the proportion of Topic 1 is decreasing and is scarce further. Topic 2 (Clinical aspects of coronavirus infection) discussed only in January, November and December 2020. The proportion of Topic 2 among other publications is minimal and does not exceed 0.3%. Topic 3 (Organization of medical care and palliative treatment, including telemedicine technologies) occurs in publications in January 2020, and is also discussed from September 2020 to January 2021. The proportion of Topic 3 among other publications is 0.6%. Topic 4 (PTSD and burnout of healthcare personnel) is actively discussed in January-March, reveals a significant drop by April and then grows, becoming by the end of 2020 the most discussed topic (about 50% of all publications) Topic 5 (Therapeutic and scientific activities of various medical fields in the context of COVID-19) discussed every month. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a rapid increase in this topic, with a peak in publication activity in February and April 2020, followed by a gradual downward trend. Topic 6 (Disinformation and domestic violence in a pandemic) unlike other topics, it decreases sharply with the onset of a pandemic. The reduction and restoration of interest in the topic under discussion is associated with March 2020, with the subsequent preservation of topic 6 at the level of 20% among all publications. Topic 7 (Personal protective equipment and panic shopping in a pandemic) was discussed in publications for January, April, June, September - December 2020 and January 2021, but the proportion is small and varies from 0.2 to 2.2%. Topic 8 (Anxiety disorders, eating-disorders) occurs throughout the entire analyzed period, with the exception of February 2020, with a maximum representation in March 2020 and a further gradual decrease in the share value of the topic under discussion. Conclusion: When analyzed by month, the two most discussed topics were burnout among healthcare workers and the functioning of related areas of medicine in a pandemic. The discussion of these topics is reciprocal in nature - in the first months, the functioning of related fields of medicine was discussed more intensively, while by the end of 202, the discussion of professional burnout came to the fore.

"P0213 Self-perceived mental health and isolation as screening tools in mental health symptoms during covid-19 pandemic","Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a deterioration in mental health, with increased levels of stress, anxiety and depression in the population [1]. There are different scales used for measured these symptoms. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) is one of them, with strong psychometric properties [2,3] and it is validated in Spanish [4]. Due to the increase on mental health problems it is mandatory to look for new parameters that can be used on population as screening tool. Isolation and self-perceived mental health (SPMH) will be studied. Aims: To study how Spanish lockdown affected mental health during COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, to study the potential of isolation and SPMH as screening tools in mental health symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic in comparison with DASS-21. Methods: A retrospective observational study was designed using a Spanish telematic anonymous survey from 6th-22nd September 2020 (N=650), created with Google Forms platform. For SPMH, Likert-type scales were used (1-lowest to 10-highest) focusing on isolation, anxiety, stress and depression. As validated scale, DASS-21 was used. Both scales were used to study the items during Spanish lockdown period. Statistical significance was analysed using GraphPad Prism v.6. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used, calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Results: Participants were predominantly young (61.08%, 17-25 years) and female (78%). Based on intrinsic DASS-21 cut-offs, the sample was divided into control (mild or no symptom) and patient groups (moderate, high or extremely high symptom) for each item. DASS-21 showed a high prevalence of stress (50.92%), anxiety (46.31%) and depression (56.00%) symptoms. Regarding stress (9.5 cut-off), the sample was divided into controls (n=319) and patients (n=331). Higher levels of self-perceived stress were found in patient group (mean (M)=7.96Â±2.01) than in control group (M=5.46Â±2.54), being the comparison statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001). Concerning anxiety (4.5 cut-off), higher levels of self-perceived anxiety were found in patients (n=301, M=7.65Â±2.24) than in controls (n=349, M=4.67Â±2.66), with a statistically significant comparison (p&lt;0.0001). About depression (6.5 cut-off), self-perceived depression had higher levels in patients (n=364, M=6.21Â±2.58) than in controls (n=286, M=3.30Â±2.27), being the comparison statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001). ROC curve analysis showed a high diagnostic capacity to differentiate between control and patient in stress (AUC=0.7822, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.7471-0.8173, p&lt;0.0001), anxiety (AUC=0.7992, IC=0.7653-0.8331, p&lt;0.0001) and depression (AUC=0.7951, IC=0.7609-0.8293, p&lt;0.0001). Using bimodal DASS-21 (anxiety-depression) and their intrinsic cut-offs, the sample was divided into control (n=243) and patient group (n=407) for self-perceived isolation. The comparison exposed higher levels of self-perceived isolation in patients (M=7.47Â±2.06) than in controls (M=6.08Â±2.56), with statistical significance (p&lt;0.0001). ROC curve analysis showed some diagnostic capacity to differentiate control and patient (AUC=0.6590;CI=0.6147-0.7033, p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions: DASS-21 scale showed high levels (moderate to extremely high) of stress, anxiety and depression during Spanish lockdown period. Self-perceived stress, anxiety and depression have the potential to be used as a mental health screening tool. Moreover, self-perceived isolation could be used to anxiety and depression symptoms.

Aims: To study how isolation and SPMH affects the population's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and their use as screening tool. Besides, to study the relation between DASS-21 results and isolation and SPMH. Methods: A retrospective observational study was design using a telematic anonymous survey in Spanish from 6th-22nd September 2020 (N=650), created with Google Forms platform. For SPMH, Likert-type scales were used (1-lowest to 10-highest) focusing on isolation, anxiety, stress and depression. As validated scale, DASS-21 was used. Three periods of time were studied: before pandemic period (NL), Spanish lockdown (L) and post-lockdown period, called â€œnew normal lifeâ€ (NNL). Statistical significance was analysed using GraphPad Prism v.6. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was used. Results: Participants were predominantly young (61.08%, 17-25 years) and female (78%). SPMH on isolation, stress, anxiety and depression was higher during lockdown (mean (M)=6.95Â±2.36;M=6.74Â±2.60;M=6.05Â±2.89;M=4.93Â±2.84;respectively) compared to NNL (M=5.20Â±2.18;M=6.01Â±2.35;M=5.52Â±2.74;M=4.22Â±2.68;respectively) and compared to NL (M=3.01Â±2.15;M=4.69Â±2.33;M=3.98Â±2.59;M=3.15Â±2.38;respectively). A statistically significant difference was demonstrated in all the parameters comparing NL vs L (p&lt;0.0001), L vs NNL (p&lt;0.0001) and NL vs NNL (p&lt;0.0001). Studying the bivariate correlation, moderate significant correlations were found between self-perception of isolation and self-perception of stress (r=0.5333, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.5008-0.5643, p&lt;0.0001), self-perception of anxiety (r=0.5157, CI=0.4824-0.5476, p&lt;0.0001), and self-perception of depression (r=0.4659, CI=0.4304-0.5000, p&lt;0.0001). DASS-21 scale shows high levels of stress (M=9.64Â±5.42), anxiety (M=5.58Â±5.29) and depression (M=8.18Â±5.80) during lockdown (L). Moderate significant correlation between the values of SPMH and DASS-21 scale was observed in stress (r=0.5922, CI=0.5399-0.6400, p&lt;0.0001) and anxiety (r=0.5334, CI=0.4760-0.5863, p&lt;0.0001);strong on depression (r=0.6190, CI=0.5692-0.6643, p&lt;0.0001);and low between self-perception of isolation and DASS-21 results on stress (r=0.3357, IC=0.2657-0.4023, p&lt;0.0001), anxiety (r=0.2648, IC=0.1918-0.3349, p&lt;0.0001) and depression (r=0.3327, CI=0.2625-0.3994, p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions: Higher levels of self-perceived isolation, stress, anxiety and depression were observed during COVID-19 pandemic, especially during lockdown period. In the same way, DASS-21 scale showed high levels of stress, anxiety and depression. Self-perceived isolation seems to correlate with self-perceived stress, anxiety and depression. SPMH and DASS-21 are correlated in stress, anxiety and depression items, showing lower correlation levels on isolation.

"P0404 Rapid antidepressant response to first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in post-COVID-19 depression","Introduction: Depression was reported in 30â€“40% of patients at one, three, and six months following COVID-19 [1]. The host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and related severe systemic inflammation seems to be the main mechanism contributing to the development of post-COVID depression. Emerging literature suggests anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties of antidepressants in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection [2]. We hypothesized that post-COVID depression, triggered by infection and sustained by systemic inflammation, could particularly benefit from antidepressants. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the efficacy of SSRI in treating post-COVID depression. Methods: We included 58 adults patients who showed depressive episodes in the six months following COVID-19. We excluded patients if they showed: other psychiatric comorbidities, ongoing treatment with antidepressants or neuroleptics, somatic disease and medications known to affect mood. The severity of depression was rated at baseline and after for four weeks from the start of the treatment on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and response was considered when the patients achieved a 50% HDRS reduction after treatment. Statistical analyses to compare group means and frequencies (Student's t-test, Pearson <U+03C7>2 test) were performed. To investigate changes in HDRS scores over time, repeated measures ANOVAs (according to sex, mood disorder history, and antidepressant molecule) were performed. Results: We found that 53 (91%) patients showed a clinical response to antidepressant treatment. Age, sex, mood disorder history, and hospitalization for COVID did not affect the response rate. Patients were treated with sertraline (n=26), citalopram (n=18), paroxetine (n=8), fluvoxamine (n=4), and fluoxetine (n=2). From baseline to follow-up, patients showed a significant decrease over time of HDRS score (F=618.90, p&lt;0.001), irrespectively of sex (0.28, p=0.599), mood disorder history (F=0.04, p=0.834), and drug used (F=1.47, p=0.239). Discussion: Common knowledge highlights that among antidepressant-treated patients, response rates are moderate (40â€“60%). On the contrary, we observed a rapid response to the first-line antidepressants in more than 90% of patients irrespectively of clinical variables, thus suggesting a higher antidepressant response rate in post-COVID depression. The pathophysiology of post-COVID neuropsychiatric sequelae mainly entails severe systemic inflammation and subsequent neuroinflammation. In this context, we have previously found that one and three months after COVID-19, the severity of depression was predicted by the baseline systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) [3,4]. Furthermore, we found a protective effect of the IL-1ÃŸ and IL-6 receptor antagonist against post-COVID depression possibly associated with their effect in dampening SII [5]. Mounting evidence suggests that antidepressants may a) decrease markers of inflammation;b) may inhibit acid sphingomyelinase preventing the infection of epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2;c) may prevent the COVID-19 related cytokine storm by stimulating the s-1 receptor;d) may exert antiviral effects via lysosomotropic properties;e) may inhibit platelets activation [2]. In conclusion, we hypothesized that post-COVID depression could particularly benefit from antidepressants since this molecules have anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, pass the BBB and accumulate in the CNS, thus preventing the neuro-inflammation triggered by SARS-CoV-2 and associated with post-COVID depression.

"P0086 Clinical and psychopathological predictors of fatigue in COVID-19 survivors: a machine learning study","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to profound mental health consequences observed during acute infection and at short, medium, and long-term follow-up [1â€“3]. When considering long-term sequelae, a prevalent proportion of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 experience a â€œPost-COVID-19 Syndromeâ€ characterized by fatigue, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, and myalgia. In this context, fatigue is recognized as one of the leading complaints in COVID-19 survivors [4]. Long-term health consequences following COVID-19 and their impact on daily quality of life are largely unknown and need further investigation. Thus, questions about possible effects of mental health on fatigue, and of COVID-19 clinical severity on both, remained unanswered. We aim to predict long-term fatigue symptoms basing on clinical and psychopathological predictors through a machine learning approach. Methods: We evaluated the fatigue syndrome and the psychopathological status of 122 adult COVID-19 survivors (80 male, mean age 59.8Â±12.9) six months after hospital discharge for COVID-19. Clinical and psychopathological predictors were collected for the entire sample. Fatigue at six months was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Descriptive statistical analyses to compare means and frequencies were performed. To better disentangle the relationship between somatic and psychopathological predictors and the development of fatigue, we explored the effect of each predictor in affecting fatigue by implementing 5000 non-parametric bootstraps enhanced elastic net penalized logistic regression. The model's accuracy was estimated by 5-folds stratified nested cross-validations in the outer loop to define balance accuracy value (BA), class accuracies, and area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) (for a complete description of the method see [5]). Results: Six months after hospital discharge, 28%, 29%, and 24% of the total sample showed respectively depression (according to Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale), anxiety (according to State-Trait Anxiety Inventory form Y), and sleep disturbances (according to Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale). Fatigue was present in 19% of the patients. When entering demographical, clinical, and psychopathological predictors in the elastic net penalized logistic regression, only depressive symptomatology significantly predicted the presence of fatigue at six months (Log Odds Ratio: 2.33;Standard deviation: 1.58;Lower and Upper 95% CI: -0.78 - 5.43;Variable Inclusion Probability: 96.7%). The 10-folds cross-validated elastic net model predicted fatigue with a BA of 65%, an AUC of 77%, and a specificity for the absence of fatigue of 74%, and a sensitivity for the presence of fatigue of 55%, showing good performances in excluding fatigue syndrome. Discussion: Besides confirming a high rate of long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae, our main finding is the strict association between fatigue and depression. We fear that, rather independent of pneumonia severity, major depression after COVID-19 is associated with persistent fatigue, thus worsening the burden of a non-communicable condition triggered by infection and by infection-related systemic inflammation, but then persisting on its own. Post-COVID syndrome, mainly characterized by fatigue, depression, and sleep disturbances, will affect COVID-19 survivors' daily functioning and place additional burden on the healthcare system. Clarifying the mechanisms and risk factors underlying such long-term symptomatology is essential to identify target population and to tailor specific treatment and rehabilitation interventions to foster recovery.

"P0267 Persistent psychopathology in covid-19 survivors at one-year follow-up","Introduction: The effects of COVID-19 are highly variable, with potential involvement of almost all organs and systems. While the acute and sub-acute symptoms have been well described, the possible long-term sequelae of COVID-19 have become an increasing concern [1]. One, three, and six-months follow-up studies have reported highly prevalent post COVID neuropsychiatric sequelae [2,3,4,5]. The aim of the present study is to investigate the psychopathological impact of COVID-19 in survivors at one-year follow-up, also considering the effect of possible risk factors. Methods: We prospectively evaluated the psychopathological status of 160 COVID-19 survivors one year after hospital discharge during an ongoing prospective cohort study. To keep a naturalistic study design, exclusion criteria were limited to patients under 18 years. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected. Current psychopathology was measured using the following self-report questionnaire: Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS), Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory form Y (STAI-Y), and Fatigue Severity Score (FSS). Need of antidepressant or anxiolytic treatment in the last year was collected. Statistical analyses to compare group means and frequencies (Student's t-test, Pearson <U+03C7>2 test) exploring effects of sex, psychiatric history, and hospitalization for COVID-19 were performed. Results: Overall, 77 patients (48%) scored in the clinical range in at least one psychopathological dimension among depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Females and patients with a positive previous psychiatric diagnosis showed an increased score on most measures (Table). Hospitalization for COVID-19 did not affect psychopathology. During the year after COVID-19, 25 (16%) and 23 (14%) patients started an antidepressant or anxiolytic treatment respectively.Discussion: This is the first study that investigates psychopathology in a sample of COVID-19 survivors at one-year follow-up after hospital treatment. We reported high rates of persistent psychopathology consistently with previous coronavirus outbreaks. Psychiatric consequences to SARS-CoV-2 infection can be caused by the immune-inflammatory response to the virus itself or by psychological stressors such as social isolation, concerns about infecting others, and stigma. Considering that neuropsychiatric sequelae associates with a markedly increased risk of all-cause mortality, and given the alarming prevalence of post-COVID psychopathology, we now suggest to routinely asses psychopathology of COVID-19 survivors in order to promptly diagnose emergent disorders and to treat them to reduce the disease burden and related years of life lived with disability.

"P0811 Factors and outcomes associated with delirium in critically ill COVID-19 patients","Introduction: Evidence demonstrates that 25-33% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 develop delirium [1,2], with rates up to 65% in critically ill patients [3]. Several potential reasons, including the use of deep sedation and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), as well as the restrictions to limit infection transmission, such as prohibition of family visits and minimal contact with health staff were identified [4]. Although factors and outcomes associated with delirium are well documented, limited data are available regarding severe COVID-19 patients. Aims: This study aims to estimate the rates of delirium in critically ill COVID-19 patients and to analyze factors that may be associated with its development, as well as to examine long-term outcomes. Methods: From March to May 2020 (in COVID-19 first wave), all adult patients (=18y.o.) admitted due to COVID-19, in the Intensive Care Medicine Department (ICMD) of a University Hospital (CHUSJ), in Porto, Portugal, were assessed, unless they had a ICMD length of stay (LoS) =24h, terminal illness or major sensory loss or inability to communicate at the time of follow-up. Participants were evaluated during a scheduled telephone follow-up appointment with a comprehensive protocol, including: Six-item Cognitive Impairment Test (6CIT) (cognitive impairment);Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (symptoms of depression);General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) (symptoms of anxiety);and EuroQol five-dimension five-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) (health-related quality of life-HRQoL), which includes EQ-Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) (global health status patient perception). Data on acute illness severity, sedative/analgesic drugs use, respiratory support and major complications (including delirium, nosocomial infections and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation) during ICMD stay, were obtained from hospital electronic records review. Patients with and without delirium were compared, using Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables, and Chi-square or Fisher tests for paired categorical variables (significance level of 0.05). This study is part of an ongoing larger multidisciplinary research project (MAPA-Mental Health in Critically ill patients with COVID-19). Results: The sample included 59 patients (median age=65 years;66.1% male). Delirium was registered in almost half of the sample (49.2%). Patients with delirium were significantly older (median=72 vs. 62;p=0.010) and presented more nosocomial infections (82.8% vs 53.3%;p=0.032) particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (75.9% vs. 33.3%;p=0.003). Also, they were significantly more likely to be deeply sedated (89.7% vs 60%;p=0.021), more often required IMV (89.7% vs 60%;p=0.021). Moreover, those with delirium stayed longer in the hospital (median=67 vs 37 days;p=0.014). Concerning HRQoL, assessed at follow-up appointment, patients who have developed delirium reported more problems in self-care (48.3% vs 10%;p=0.003) and in everyday activities (79.3% vs 53.3%;p=0.035) after hospital discharge. Nevertheless, no statistically significant differences were found for cognitive impairment, symptoms of anxiety and depression. Conclusions: Delirium was common in this critically ill COVID-19 sample, namely in older patients, who have been deeply sedated, invasively ventilated or had major ICU complications. It was associated with longer hospital stay and worse HRQoL. Recognizing potential associated factors will allow the identification of high-risk patients that should be targeted for early screening with preventive interventions to minimize the adverse outcomes associated to delirium in critical COVID-19 patients.

"Public Libraries Help Patrons of Color to Bridge the Digital Divide, but Barriers Remain","Objective - This study explored the role of the public library in the support of patrons of color who experience digital exclusion. Design - In-person and telephone interviews, grounded theory, and critical race theory. Setting - Public libraries in California. Subjects - Persons of color who were active public library technology resource users due to experiencing the digital divide. Methods - In-person, 60- to 90-minute interviews were conducted with participants referred to the author by public librarians at select libraries in California. Sixteen open-ended questions were asked, relating to demographics, access to technology at home, library technology access and use, technology skills, and thoughts on how libraries could change or improve technology services. A 20-to 30-minute follow-up interview was conducted during the phase of the Covid-19 pandemic when public libraries were closed. Interview transcripts were analyzed by the author, who created a codebook of common themes. Responses were analyzed through the lens of grounded theory and critical race theory. Main Results - Nine participants were recruited;six consented to the first interview and two of the six consented to the second interview. Four of the participants self-reported as Asian, one as Black/African American, and one as Hispanic/Latino American. None of the participants had internet access in their homes, though some reported having laptops or inconsistent cellular service. Common uses of library technology included job search activities (resume building, job searching, applications);schoolwork;research and skill development;and legal or housing form finding. Leisure activities including social media and YouTube were also mentioned. Access limitations included inconvenient library hours, particularly for those attending college or holding a job with daytime hours, and physical distance from the library. A common complaint was the time limit on computer access set by the library;""the concept of time"" was mentioned ""over 70 times collectively by all participants"" (p. 14). Language was another barrier to access, mentioned by three of the participants. Most reported being more likely to ask for help from a library staff person who shared their language or had a similar background. Participants also reported wishing more technology workshops were offered, especially workshops in languages other than English. The two participants who took part in the second interview ""expressed frustration and sadness"" about the lack of library access during the Covid-19 pandemic (p. 16). One participant reported having to get internet access at her home for her children to attend school. The second participant expressed her difficulty in conducting research or printing information with only the small screen of her phone to provide access. Conclusion - Library patrons of color living within the digital divide make use of public library technology but experience multiple barriers. Libraries can alleviate these barriers by examining their hours, policies, and staffing models to be more accessible to patrons of color lacking internet access at home.","MacKenzie, K.","https://doi.org/10.18438/eblip30035","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Evidence Based Library and Information Practice; 16(4):138-140, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25334,""
"S03a-03 Impact of the COVID crisis on European Poison Centres","On behalf of EAPCCT COVID-19 and PCCs activities WG The pandemic has also crystallized the role of clinical toxicology and identified a new role for clinical toxicologists. Poison Control Centers (PCC) and clinical toxicologists have been committed on several fronts: prevention, including campaigns, collaboration with Government Agencies, toxicovigilance, etc. Our activity in addition to prehospital triage of intoxicated patients helped to stabilize the flooded emergency system. An ad hoc EAPCCT Covid-19 Working Group was established so as to evaluate the impact of Covid-19 on European PCCs activities. A pilot study was performed in 4 European PCCs [Copenhagen, Pavia, Utrecht, Zurich] to evaluate critical points on methods, data collection and resources. The study was then extended to all European PCCs to investigate the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic during the first wave on the activities of European PCC. All 65 European PCCs listed in the WHO directory were asked to supply epidemiological data on poisonings (e.g., number of calls, patients, type of caller (medical professional or public), type of exposure (accidental, intentional (all), intentional suicide attempt), and age groups). Investigated exposures were disinfectants, household cleaning products (according to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) classification) and drugs, including antivirals. Data was analyzed during a 4-month period (March-June 2020) and compared with the previous two years. Furthermore, all members of EAPCCT were asked to participate in a survey on organizational changes during the COVID-19 pandem-ic.Results: The study included data from 36 PCCs from 21 countries (55% of EU PCCs). 60 % of Head of PCCs from 24 countries submitted pandemic related organizational data. Twenty per cent of PCC saw an increase in length of shifts while 42% saw an increase of total number of shifts. 25% indicated an increase of time spent on duties other than PCC activities, such as activities in the emergency departments (35%), intensive care units (12%), and nursing wards (9%). Over 50% of PCCs lacked protocols to manage PCC staffing upon massive sick leave. In contrast safe working protocols were in place in nearly every PCC. No centers reported receiving special funds for activities arising from the pandemic. Conclusion: European PCCs activities vary in different countries. A substantial improvement can be made in many areas such as data harmonization, establishing a European database of poisonings, and an improved network and cooperation of European PCC, and timely toxicovigilance especially in times of global emergencies.","Lonati, D.; Hondebrink, L.; Faber, K.; H<U+2298>gberg, L.; Hermanns-Clausen, M.; Zammit, M.; Thiermann, H.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-4274(21)00279-4","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Toxicology Letters; 350:S19, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25335,""
"P0669 Differential response to three antidepressants in patients with major depressive episode who suffered Covid-19â€“related trauma","Introduction. The Covid 19 has probably altered the epidemiology of mental disorders worldwide, with their incidence which is likely to have increased during the pandemic [1,2]. It is possible that it has impacted response to drug treatment in psychiatric conditions, resulting in differential hospitalisation rates. Hence, we compared the responses to three different antidepressant drugs in outpatients with a major depressive episode (MDE) in the course of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) during two time periods, i.e., prior to suffering Covid-19â€“related trauma and after suffering such trauma. Methods. We conducted an observational study on outpatients with MDE during their course of MDD (N=58) or BD (N=84)who were clinically stabilised for at least 6 months and treated with antidepressants, antipsychotics or mood stabilisers according to recent treatment guidelines [3,4]. Outpatients, of whom we had baseline assessments of Montgomery-Ã…sberg Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (Ham-A), were recruited at the time they suffered Covid-19â€“related traumas, defined as developing Covid-19 infection or witnessing Covid-19 infection in a close person, death of a loved one, domestic violence, or job loss. Fifty patients were being treated with 15 mg/day oral vortioxetine, 46 with 450 mg/day oral extended-release trazodone (ERT), and 46 with 150 mg/day oral sertraline. We compared their scores on the MADRS, Ham-A, and WHOQOL-2.0-BREF drug-wise and gender-wise. We used Student's t test for continuous variables and the <U+03C7>2 test for categorical variables. Results. The sample consisted of 142 outpatients (age, mean 39.63 Â± 16.84;70 men and 72 women);women were older than men (mean age 43.18 Â± 17.61 vs. 35.98 Â± 15.30;p=0.01). The two genders did not differ on other variables). There was a main effect of time for MADRS scores (F(1.000,130.000)=147.292, p&lt;0.001, <U+03B7>2=0.531;from 13.75 Â± 4.60 to 20.38 Â± 7.06) and Ham-A scores (F(1.000,130.000)=100.260, p&lt;0.001, <U+03B7>2=0.435;from 13.41Â±7.14 to 20.61Â±7.99) and an interaction effect, i.e., a Time Ã— Treatment effect (F(2.000,130.000)=10.376, p&lt;0.001, <U+03B7>2=0.138) for MADRS and (F(2.000,130.000)=6.836, p=0.002, <U+03B7>2=0.095) for Ham-A, with a lower impairment for the vortioxetine group (from 14.20Â±3.60 to 17.26Â±5.44) than sertraline (from 13.56Â±4.29 to 22.44Â±6.59) and trazodone (from 13.57Â±5.85 to 21.68Â±7.06) for MADRS and for Ham-A (vortioxetine from 13.96Â±6.26 to 17.78Â±7.09 better than sertraline, from 13.79 Â±8.36 to 22.77Â±7.62 and trazodone, from 12.39Â±6.69 to 21.48Â±8.55) from the pre-Covid-19 to the post-Covid-19â€“related trauma period. Improved QoL from the Covid-19â€“related trauma period to 1 month post-trauma was shown for trazodone (from 62.16Â±15.44 to 67.90Â±13.74), but not vortioxetine (from 61.56Â±13.89 to 63.50Â±15.60) or sertraline (from 63.89Â±13.37 to 62.08Â±15.10). The vortioxetine group showed a lower hospitalisation rate (24%) than sertraline (35.4%) and trazodone (38.6%), but this was not significant (p=0.27). Conclusion. We found all drugs to improve depression and anxiety scores with vortioxetine showing a small advantage over the others in patients with and MDE during the course of MDD or BD. Trazodone improved QoL faster than other drugs. No differences between vortioxetine, sertraline and trazodone were found as concerns the need for hospitalisation.

"Disease Burden And Care-Seeking Behavior For Ibs-C Patients In The United States In The Era Of Covid-19","Background: Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) is a chronic disorder of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) that has a significant negative impact on patients. The objective of this study was to examine disease burden and care-seeking behavior of IBS-C patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional, on-line, general health survey collected data on US adults aged &gt;18 from Aug â€“ Oct 2020. IBS-C patients were defined using Rome IV criteria for IBS-C and matched 1:1 by age, sex, region, and comorbidity score to the general population. Health outcomes comparing IBS-C patients vs controls included anxiety (using Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale [GAD-7]), depression (using Patient Health Questionnaire 9 [PHQ-9]), health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (using Veterans RAND 12-item Health Survey [VR-12]), and work productivity using study-specific questions. Mean frequencies were compared with ANOVA and proportions with chi-square tests. For IBS-C patients, care-seeking behavior included healthcare visits in the past 12 months, canceled visits due to COVID-19, and medication use (prescription vs over-the-counter (OTC)). Commonly reported bothersome symptoms and the impact of COVID-19 on the worsening of IBS-C symptoms were also assessed descriptively. Results: Of 7,214 survey participants, 138 met Rome IV criteria for IBS-C. Matching resulted in a sample of 130 IBS-C patients and 130 controls. Mean age of IBS-C patients was 45.1 (SD 15.1) years, with the majority being female (79.2%) and white (82.3%). IBS-C patients had a significantly higher proportion of moderate-to-severe anxiety and depression and significantly lower HRQoL versus controls (see Table). Absenteeism and presenteeism in the past 7 days were also significantly higher among IBS-C patients vs controls. 53.4% percent of IBS-C patients sought care from a healthcare provider in the past year for their IBS symptoms and nearly a quarter of IBS-C patients reported cancelling healthcare visits due to COVID-19. 25.4% of IBS-C patients reported taking a prescription medication whereas 68.5% reported currently taking an OTC for their IBS-C symptoms. The most common bothersome symptoms in the past 7 days included abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, straining, abdominal bloating and incomplete bowel movements. Over a third of IBS-C patients indicated their symptoms worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: There remains a considerable disease burden and unmet need for IBS-C patients, with patients suffering from multiple bothersome symptoms and low rates of prescription medication use. COVID-19 seems to have worsened IBS symptoms for many patients (Table Presented) (Table Presented)","Lacy, B. E.; Parekh, M.; Taylor, D.

"PR90 INSIGHT TO PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF BREAST CANCER","Breast Cancer is one of the most leading cancer of the modern world and just hearing the word cancer itself can create a negative impact in life. Even though psychological distress in cancer is considered as the sixth vital sign it is usually ignored among medical professionals. The baseline of this study: 1) What are the types of psychiatric disturbances in breast cancer settings? 2) Is there any importance in cancer education? 3) How to manage psychiatric disturbances? Background: Psychiatric oncology is the study of psychiatric and psycho-social aspects of cancer, which may be related to the development, course, or outcome of cancer.. Although psychiatric issues with cancer settings are diagnosed it is only from the last decade there undergone a more detailed study of psycho-oncology view. Design: As of lockdown with respect to COVID-19 this study is conducted online among 20 breast cancer patients. This is a crosssectional study where Each patient has explained the purpose of the study, procedures, and consent was taken from patients. Study protocol: Assessment has 2 parts, one is based on CES-D Test where each individual has answered 20 questions and the next part is based on 5 questions regarding financial depression, behavioral changes, feelings, education about cancer, and psychiatric support. Scoring and assessment: Less than 16 = depression is not indicated;16-20 = mild depression indicated;21-25 = moderate depression indicated;26 or higher = severe depression indicated. Results: It is found that 60% population are normal, 25% had mild depression, 10% have moderate depression followed by 5% with severe depression. Among association between marital status and various disorder, it was found that psychological disturbances are 2 times fold more in married people while compared to unmarried. There is also an association between treatment modalities are observed, in that anxiety is prevalent with people who had chemotherapy. Based on education and financial status, those who are with less education about cancer and less financially stable have also a prominent disturbances. Conclusion: Offering mental health services to patients with breast cancer is becoming an integral part of oncologic treatments because psychological problems have an adverse effect on cancer management. The most common psychiatric disorders in cancer patients are depression, anxiety disorders, and adjustment disorders. In conclusion, psychiatric oncology has made numerous advances in the understanding of psychiatric disturbances, and care of cancer patients.","Kunhikkandy, A.

"[Psychiatric Rehabilitation in Austria - A Comparison of Symptoms at Admission Before and During COVID-19 Pandemic, as well as Rehabilitation Success]","International literature reports an increase of the incidence of psychological disorders because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Especially young people and people with pre-existing psychological disorders are troubled by the pandemic. Objective of this study is the extent of psychological symptoms, the functioning and the treatment success of rehabilitation inpatients who participated in a medical and psychiatric rehabilitation in the year before the COVID-19 pandemic and those who participated during the COVID-19 phase. The data of N=1,715 rehabilitation inpatients who completed the rehabilitation before the lockdown in 2019 and N=707 rehabilitation inpatients who began in 2020 after the lockdown of the clinic due to the pandemic (during the COVID-19 phase) from March to Mai 2020 are compared in reference to their sample characteristics and their results in patient reported outcomes. There are no significant differences between the two observed time periods in reference to the sociodemographic characteristics of the rehabilitation inpatients. At the beginning of the rehabilitation there was no significant difference in the scale somatization. There was a significantly higher score in the scales' anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 phase, but only to the extent of a small effect. The results of the scales of activity and participation (ICF 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°F AT) as well as functionality (WHODAS 2.0) do not differ in the time periods at the beginning of the rehabilitation. However, rehabilitation inpatients with low socioeconomic status (rehabilitation allowance or disability pension) have critical scores in some scales. The rehabilitation success is comparable to the one before the COVID-19 pandemic and falls within the range of medium to high effect sizes. The study shows - with respect to its limitations - low or no significant differences in reference to the sociodemographic data and the symptomatic load at the beginning of the rehabilitation. The effect sizes are comparable with the time frame bevor the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of international studies, which reported a considerable increase in psychological stress of the population cannot directly be transferred to the Austrian rehabilitation clientele. In der internationalen Literatur werden Steigerungen der Inzidenzraten psychischer Erkrankungen durch die COVID-19-Pandemie berichtet.

"Impact of COVID-19 on Hematology-Oncology Fellowship Programs: A Quantitative and Qualitative Survey Assessment of Fellowship Program Directors","The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented challenges in medical training, and we sought to assess the specific impact of COVID-19 on hematology-oncology (HO) fellowship programs. We conducted a cross-sectional anonymous online survey of 103 HO program directors (PDs) in conjunction with the American Society of Hematology (ASH) and ASCO. We sought to assess the specific impact of COVID-19 on HO fellowship programs' clinical, educational, and research activities, evaluate perceptions regarding PD and trainee emotional and mental health, and identify ways to support programs. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, parametric and nonparametric tests, and multivariable logistic regression models. Responses to open-ended questions were analyzed with thematic analysis. Significant changes to fellowship activities included transitioning fellow training from outpatient clinics to telehealth (77.7%), shifting to virtual education (94.2%), and moving to remote research work (63.1%). A minority (21.4%) of PDs reported that their fellows were redeployed to cover non-HO services. Most PDs (54.4%) believed COVID-19 had a slight negative impact on fellowship training. PD self-reported burnout increased significantly from 15.5% prepandemic to 44.7% during the pandemic, and most PDs witnessed minor signs of fellow burnout (52.4%). Common PD concerns included inadequate supervision for telehealth activities, reduced opportunities for fellow advancement and promotion, lack of professional development activities, limited research operations and funding, program financial constraints, and virtual recruitment. We encourage institutions and national societies to allocate resources and develop programs that can support fellowships and mitigate the potential negative effects of COVID-19 on trainee and PD career development.","Velazquez, Durani, Weeks, Major, Reynolds, Kumbamu, Das, Murphy, Henry, Lee, Marshall","https://doi.org/10.1200/OP.21.00634","20220111","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25341,""
"[Need of mental health teams for patients hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 and front-line health personnel]","People vulnerable to mental health problems during the COVID-19 outbreak include hospitalized patients and frontline health professionals; mostly reported discomforts include: insomnia, anxiety and depression. Under strict infection measures, non-essential personnel such as clinical psychiatrists and psychologists are strongly discouraged from entering isolation wards; therefore, frontline health-care workers become the main personnel providing psychological interventions to patients in hospitals without knowing how to mitigate patient distress. Health personnel do not receive adequate care for due to lack of time, stigma associated with using mental health services and fear of unwanted intervention. Remote care tools such as tele-psychiatry and online psychological intervention have disadvantages for conditions requiring physical examination. The National Health Commission of China released guiding principles to reduce the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 outbreak recommending the creation of mental health teams. In this article we present the data obtained by a mental health team in a COVID-19 hospital of the Mexican Institute of Social Security, showing differences in emotional discomfort and diagnoses of mental disorders in patients in isolation and in frontline health personnel, suggesting the need for teams made up of psychiatry and psychology staff with face-to-face on-site assessments. La poblaciÃƒÂ³n con mayor riesgo para desarrollar trastornos mentales durante la pandemia por COVID-19 es la de los pacientes en aislamiento y la del personal mÃƒÂ©dico de primera lÃƒÂ­nea; los malestares que mÃƒÂ¡s frecuentemente han sido reportados incluyen: insomnio, ansiedad y depresiÃƒÂ³n. Debido a que el personal de salud mental se considera no esencial para la atenciÃƒÂ³n de los pacientes en aislamiento, se desaconseja su ingreso a ÃƒÂ¡reas COVID, por lo que el personal mÃƒÂ©dico de primera lÃƒÂ­nea debe proporcionar intervenciones psicolÃƒÂ³gicas sin saber cÃƒÂ³mo mitigar la angustia de los pacientes. El personal de salud tampoco recibe atenciÃƒÂ³n adecuada debido a algunas barreras para solicitar ayuda, como la falta de tiempo, el estigma y el temor a una intervenciÃƒÂ³n no deseada.

"Designing and scaling up integrated youth mental health care","Mental ill-health represents the main threat to the health, survival and future potential of young people around the world. There are indications that this is a rising tide of vulnerability and need for care, a trend that has been augmented by the COVID-19 pandemic. It represents a global public health crisis, which not only demands a deep and sophisticated understanding of possible targets for prevention, but also urgent reform and investment in the provision of developmentally appropriate clinical care. Despite having the greatest level of need, and potential to benefit, adolescents and emerging adults have the worst access to timely and quality mental health care. How is this global crisis to be addressed? Since the start of the century, a range of co-designed youth mental health strategies and innovations have emerged. These range from digital platforms, through to new models of primary care to new services for potentially severe mental illness, which must be locally adapted according to the availability of resources, workforce, cultural factors and health financing patterns. The fulcrum of this progress is the advent of broad-spectrum, integrated primary youth mental health care services. They represent a blueprint and beach-head for an overdue global system reform. While resources will vary across settings, the mental health needs of young people are largely universal, and underpin a set of fundamental principles and design features. These include establishing an accessible, ""soft entry"" youth primary care platform with digital support, where young people are valued and essential partners in the design, operation, management and evaluation of the service. Global progress achieved to date in implementing integrated youth mental health care has highlighted that these services are being accessed by young people with genuine and substantial mental health needs, that they are benefiting from them, and that both these young people and their families are highly satisfied with the services they receive. However, we are still at base camp and these primary care platforms need to be scaled up across the globe, complemented by prevention, digital platforms and, crucially, more specialized care for complex and persistent conditions, aligned to this transitional age range (from approximately 12 to 25 years). The rising tide of mental ill-health in young people globally demands that this focus be elevated to a top priority in global health.","McGorry, Mei, Chanen, Hodges, Alvarez-Jimenez, Killackey","https://doi.org/10.1002/wps.20938","20220111","Youth mental health; digital platforms; early intervention; global mental health; integrated mental health care; prevention; primary care platforms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25343,""

"Falls in people post-Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© syndrome in the United Kingdom: A national cross-sectional survey of community based adults","Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© syndrome (GBS) has several enduring effects that can lead to further harm and/or lower quality of life. These effects include falling and body pain, neither of which have been fully explored. This study aims to examine the risk factors associated with falling and potential causes of body pain in a post-GBS population. A cross-sectional survey of 216 participants was conducted using an electronic questionnaire that included. Self-report measures for: overall health, balance, anxiety and depression levels, body pain and demographics related to GBS experience and falls. A large proportion of individuals post-GBS experience ongoing problems beyond those expected with ageing. Comparative tests indicated that people reporting falls in the previous 12Ã‚Â months had: poorer levels of mobility, poorer F-scores, higher levels of body pain, poorer balance, poorer anxiety and depression scores and higher levels of fatigue. Gender did not appear to contribute to falls. Injuries following falls were associated with a lack of physiotherapy postdischarge and time since GBS. In a regression analysis of the identified and expected key variables, age and body pain statistically predicted falls. In over a quarter of cases reported here, respondents did not receive community physiotherapy following hospital discharge. In the midst and aftermath of COVID-19, provision of rehabilitation needs to be recalibrated, not just for COVID patients, but the wider community with ongoing needs. Issues around well-being and quality of life in the post-GBS community also need further consideration.","Davidson, Parker","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13703","20220111","Guillain-BarrÃƒÂ© syndrome; balance; body pain; falls; fatigue; physiotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25345,""
"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality of life of adults visiting emergency departments and primary care settings in Alberta","To examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality of life (HRQL) of adults visiting emergency departments (ED) and primary care (PC) settings in Alberta, Canada, and explore whether this impact varies across demographic subgroups. Data from two repeatedÃ‚Â cross-sectional surveys that measured HRQL using EQ-5D-5L were used; ""pre-COVID"" Sept 2019-Feb 2020 (ED, N=5927; PC, N=317), ""Wave-1"" Mar 2020-Aug 2020 (ED, N=4781; PC, N=375), and ""Wave-2"" Sept 2020-Jan 2021 (ED, N=4443; PC, N=327). In the ED sample, there were decrements in mild-extreme problems of 3.7% in mobility and 4.1% in usual activities from pre-COVID to wave 2. There were very minor changes in mild-extreme problems in self-care (decrement=1.3%), pain/discomfort (decrement=2.6%), and anxiety/depression (decrement=0.9%). In the PC sample, there were increases of 4.8% in mild-extreme pain/discomfort and 10.7% in anxiety/depression from pre-COVID to wave 2. Despite these changes, HRQL of both samples pre-COVID and during waves 1 and 2 was worse than that of the general Alberta population. There were no significant variations in the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on HRQL across age, sex, and income subgroups in the ED survey; however, such variations were observed in the PC survey whereby younger adults, females, and those with high income had the largest HRQL deteriorations. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on HRQL was minimal in adults seeking ED care, but more pronounced in those seen in PC, especially in terms of mental health. Policies around COVID-19 should take into account the needs of certain groups of the population, especially women and young people.

"The association between uncertainty and mental health: a scoping review of the quantitative literature","The current moment is characterised by deep-rooted uncertainties, such as climate change and COVID-19. Uncertainty has been reported to be associated with negative mental health outcomes, such as stress and anxiety. However, no comprehensive review on the association between uncertainty and mental health exists. The aim of the current scoping review was to systematically explore and describe the literature on the link between uncertainty and mental health. A scoping review was undertaken following guidelines by Arksey and O'Malley (2005). One hundred and one papers addressing the association between uncertainty and mental health were identified. Most were cross-sectional studies (67%) conducted in the fields of medicine or nursing (59%), in high-income countries, among adult populations (74%), and in medical settings. Substantial heterogeneity was identified in the measurements of uncertainty and mental health. Most studies (79%) reported a positive association between uncertainty and mental health problems. Research is needed in more diverse contexts and populations. More robust designs are required to provide insight into the directionality and strength of the association between uncertainty and mental health. Few studies reported how individuals coped with uncertainty. Future studies should address the identified gaps and investigate interventions to address uncertainty and its determinants.","Massazza, Kienzler, Al-Mitwalli, Tamimi, Giacaman","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2021.2022620","20220111","Uncertainty; mental health; scoping review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25347,""

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Routine Medical Care and Cancer Screening","COVID-19 restrictions and fear dramatically changed the use of medical care. Understanding the magnitude of cancelled and postponed appointments and associated factors can help identify approaches to mitigate unmet need. To determine the proportion of medical visits cancelled or postponed and for whom. We hypothesized that adults with serious medical conditions and those with higher anxiety, depressive symptoms, and avoidance-oriented coping would have more cancellations/postponements. Four nationally representative cross-sectional surveys conducted online in May, July, October, and December 2020. 59,747 US adults who completed 15-min online surveys. 69% cooperation rate. Physical and mental health visits and cancer screening cancelled or postponed over prior 2 months. Plan to cancel or postpone visits over the next 2 months. Relationship with demographics, medical conditions, local COVID-19 death rate, anxiety, depressive symptoms, coping, intolerance of uncertainty, and perceived COVID-19 risk. Of the 58% (N = 34,868) with a medical appointment during the 2 months before the survey, 64% had an appointment cancelled or postponed in May, decreasing to 37% in December. Of the 41% of respondents with scheduled cancer screening, 20% cancelled/postponed, which was stable May to December. People with more medical conditions were more likely to cancel or postpone medical visits (OR 1.19 per condition, 95% CI 1.16, 1.22) and cancer screening (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.15, 1.24). Race, ethnicity, and income had weak associations with cancelled/postponed visits, local death rate was unrelated, but anxiety and depressive symptoms were strongly related to cancellations, and this grew between May and December. Cancelled medical care and cancer screening were more common among persons with medical conditions, anxiety and depression, even after accounting for COVID-19 deaths. Outreach and support to ensure that patients are not avoiding needed care due to anxiety, depression andÃ‚Â inaccurate perceptions of risk will be important.","Wenger, Stanton, Baxter-King, Sepucha, Vavreck, Naeim","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-021-07254-x","20220111","COVID-19; cancer screening; missed medical appointments","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25349,""

Parent-child activities were measured as total weekly time and combined time across activities within two categories: hands-on play and screen time. Bivariate correlations informed blockwise linear regression models. For families with childcare needs, parental anxiety was associated with higher total hands-on play, combined hands-on play, and combined screen time. Families without childcare needs indicated parenting stress was associated with lower total hands-on play and combined hands-on play, and higher supervised screen time. Family structure and indices of socioeconomic status were also predictive of activities across childcare needs and child ages. To promote high-quality parent-child interactions and positive developmental outcomes during the pandemic, childcare needs and parent wellbeing should be supported, while evidence-based guidelines for child screen time should be further researched in this context.","Stienwandt, Cameron, Soderstrom, Casar, Le, Roos","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10566-021-09668-4","20220111","COVID-19; Hands-on play; Parenting; ParentÃ¢â‚¬â€œchild interactions; Screen time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25351,""

"The impact of lockdown and other stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic on depression and anxiety in a Lebanese opportunistic sample: an online cross-sectional survey","Lockdown measures were taken since February 2020 in Lebanon, a country already going through a socio-economic crisis, to fight the new coronavirus pandemic. The aim of this study is to evaluate the psychological impact of the lockdown in Lebanon. A cross-sectional, online survey was conducted during the lockdown period in order to punctually assess depression, anxiety symptoms as well as eating and substance use disorders using self-rating scales (the DASS-21, SCOFF and CAGE-AID respectively), while identifying factors that might affect those outcomes. Overall, 1133 participants completed the questionnaire. The DASS-21 score was positively correlated with the impact of lockdown on participants' lifestyle and lockdown duration. A highest effect on DASS-21 score was related to the intensity of other stressful life events that have happened during the last 3Ã‚Â months. Linear regression analysis also showed that age, monthly income, professional status, the SCOFF and CAGE-AID scores, the intensity of the lockdown's impact on lifestyle and having been through other stressful life events unrelated to the lockdown per se, were risk factors affecting significantly the DASS-21 score. Lockdown, as well as other stressful life event that have happened during the last 3Ã‚Â months, were therefore associated with higher depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. These findings may guide future policy making strategies in order to prevent mental health problems in case of a pandemic concomitant with other critical stressors.","Khalil, Dagher, Zarzour, Sleilaty, Akl, Kallab, Richa","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02644-0","20220111","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Lebanon; Lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25353,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on seafarers' mental health and chronic fatigue: Beneficial effects of onboard peer support, external support and Internet access","While commercial shipping remained vital for maintaining global supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures imposed to control the spread of infection have disrupted crew changes and impacted interactions with port personnel and among crew members on board. Initial reports indicate that this affected work and life on board, the length of seafarers' time on board as well as seafarers' employment and family concerns. However, the consequences for seafarers' well-being are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on seafarers' mental health and chronic fatigue, and to analyze the role of potential mitigating factors, notably onboard peer support, external support and Internet quality. Survey responses from 622 seafarers on international commercial vessels were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings suggested that the impact of the pandemic increased seafarers' fatigue and mental health problems.

Using socioenvironmental factors as moderators of the relationship between stress and depression, we found that increased depression was alleviated by social attitudes (ÃŽÂ² = 2.064; P &lt; 0.01), family attitudes (ÃŽÂ² = 2.028; P &lt; 0.05) and healthcare services and policies (ÃŽÂ² = -4.579; P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, instrumental activities of daily living increased with decreased stress as moderated by social attitudes (ÃŽÂ² = 0.140; P &lt; 0.05) and healthcare services and policies (ÃŽÂ² = -0.306; P &lt; 0.001). Further, increased social participation alleviated stress as moderated by social attitudes (ÃŽÂ² = 0.106; P &lt; 0.01), mobility and convenience facilities (ÃŽÂ² = 0.158; P &lt; 0.01) and healthcare services and policies (ÃŽÂ² = -0.342; P &lt; 0.001). The results indicate that even in public healthcare crises, it is important for people with disabilities to manage their health and participate in social activities. Their self-management and social participation can be promoted by strengthening community-centered rehabilitation and providing consumer-oriented social services.","Kim, Rhee","https://doi.org/10.1097/MRR.0000000000000514","20220111","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25355,""
"[Impact of middle- and long-distance running on mental health in college students in Guangzhou during COVID-19 outbreak]","To investigate the impact of middle- and long-distance running on mental health of students in a college in Guangzhou during the COVID-19 outbreak. We collected data using online questionnaires from the college students selected via snowball sampling. After exclusion of invalid questionnaires and matching the data of running exercise with physical test scores of the participants, 1022 questionnaires were deemed valid for analysis. Of the 1022 students, 869 completed at least a 60-km running distance each semester as required and 153 students did not complete the task. The mental health status of the students was evaluated using PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). The scale scores were compared between the students who completed the running task and those who did not, and the factors affecting anxiety and depression were analyzed using univariate analysis and binary logistic regression. The students who completed the running task had significantly higher physical test scores than those who did not complete the task (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The PCL-C, SDS, SAS scale scores or the conditions of PTSD, anxiety, and depression did not differ significantly between two groups (<i>P</i>&gt;0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that completing the running task or not did not affect the condition of PTSD, anxiety, or depression of the students; a higher physical test score was associated with a decreased risk of PTSD (OR=0.98, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.97-0.99) and depression (OR=0.99, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.97-1.00) but an increased risk of anxiety (OR=1.02, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.01-1.04) during COVID-19 outbreak.

"Sidelined during COVID-19: a narrative inquiry into how simulationists experienced the pandemic","In the simulation community, colleagues who are no longer clinically practicing were often proximal to the COVID-19 response, not working in the frontlines of patient care. At the same time, their work as simulationists changed dramatically or was halted. This research explored the experiences of those simulationists who have clinical backgrounds but did not provide direct patient care during the initial pandemic response. The aim of this study was to allow those simulationists to share and have their stories heard. This qualitative research used a narrative approach to answer the research question: What were the experiences of those in the simulation community who did not contribute to the frontline patient care response during the early stages of the pandemic? A semi-structured questionnaire aimed at eliciting a story was disseminated through online simulation discussion boards. Data was collected through PHONIC with options to type or speak responses. Responses were analyzed using an inductive analytical process to identify themes or patterns in the narratives. Thirty-six respondents completed the survey between August 1, 2020 and November 30, 2020. Narrative arcs were identified that illustrated the events, actions, thoughts and feelings representative of experiences shared by many simulationists. Two major themes emerged: Challenges and Opportunities. Challenges included feelings of guilt; frustration; overwhelmed, stressed and exhausted; being away from the action, being unused and underappreciated. Opportunities included leadership (evolution and innovation), personal development, and being a part of something. The findings reflect a snapshot in time of how simulation was viewed and used in the world during a pandemic through the personal stories of simulationists with clinical backgrounds who did not provide direct patient care. Sharing these narratives may inform future simulation development; however, it is vitally important that the emotions are recognized and acknowledged. Managers should ensure mental health resources and support are available to all staff, including those not deployed to the frontline.","Leighton, Kardong-Edgren, Jones, Reedy","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41077-021-00196-8","20220111","COVID-19; Healthcare simulation; Narrative research; Qualitative research; Sidelined; Simulationists","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25357,""
"Reasons in favour of universal vaccination campaign against COVID-19 in the pediatric population","Despite the growing evidence of the extreme efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in adults and the elderly, the administration of the same prophylactic measures to pediatric subjects is debated by some parents and by a number of researchers. The aim of this manuscript is to explain the reasons for overcoming hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents and to highlight the importance of universal COVID-19 vaccination in the pediatric population. Recent epidemiological data suggest that the risk that a child with COVID-19 is hospitalized or admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit is greater than initially thought. Children may also suffer from long COVID and school closure because of COVID-19 can cause relevant mental health problems in the pediatric population. Placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, clinical trials showed appropriate efficacy, safety and tolerability of authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents 12-17Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old. Vaccination in children younger than 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age will allow further benefits . COVID-19 vaccine administration seems mandatory in all the children and adolescents because of COVID-19 related complications as well as the efficacy, safety and tolerability of COVID-19 vaccines in this population. Due to the recent approval of COVID-9 vaccines for children 5-10Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old, it is desirable that vaccine opponents can understand how important is the universal immunization against COVID-19 for the pediatric subjects.","Principi, Esposito","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-021-01192-4","20220111","COVID-19; COVID-19 vaccine; Pediatric infectious disease; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25358,""
"Descriptive review of internet-based cognitive behavior therapy on anxiety-related problems in children under the circumstances of COVID-19","COVID-19 continues to have a global impact and has yet to converge. Behavioral restrictions in daily life are widespread, forcing changes to the behavioral patterns of people. Significant changes have also occurred in children's lives, raising concerns about mental health. The same is true for anxiety symptoms. In this paper, we described the COVID-19 pandemic effects on mental health, summarized Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) as an applicability of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for COVID-19, and summarized ICBT's current state as a response for anxiety. An overview of previous intervention studies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on ICBT, showed that many studies were highly effective against anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, regarding the follow-up of ICBT's intervention effect, long-term effect maintenance was also clarified. It was likewise pointed out that ICBT may be used in the future since it is beneficial for children's anxiety symptoms in telemedicine. Based on these results from previous studies, we discuss ICBT's applicability during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, future measures and prospects for children's mental health during the pandemic are discussed in this study.","Shirotsuki, Sugaya, Nakao","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13030-021-00233-y","20220111","Anxiety; COVID-19; Child; Cognitive behavioral therapy; Internet","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25359,""
"Time trends in mental health indicators during the initial 16 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark","The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated national lockdowns have been linked to deteriorations in mental health worldwide. A number of studies analysed changes in mental health indicators during the pandemic; however, these studies generally had a small number of timepoints, and focused on the initial months of the pandemic. Furthermore, most studies followed-up the same individuals, resulting in significant loss to follow-up and biased estimates of mental health and its change. Here we report on time trends in key mental health indicators amongst Danish adults over the course of the pandemic (March 2020 - July 2021) focusing on subgroups defined by gender, age, and self-reported previously diagnosed chronic and/or mental illness. We used time-series data collected by Epinion (N=8,261) with 43 timepoints between 20 March 2020 and 22 July 2021. Using a repeated cross-sectional study design, independent sets of individuals were asked to respond to the Copenhagen Corona-Related Mental Health questionnaire at each timepoint, and data was weighted to population proportions. The six mental health indicators examined were loneliness, anxiety, social isolation, quality of life, COVID-19-related worries, and the mental health scale. Gender, age, and the presence of previously diagnosed mental and/or chronic illness were used to stratify the population into subgroups for comparisons. Poorer mental health were observed during the strictest phases of the lockdowns, whereas better outcomes occurred during reopening phases. Women, young individuals (&lt;34 yrs), and those with a mental- and/or chronic illness demonstrated poorer mean time-series than others. Those with a pre-existing mental illness further had a less reactive mental health time-series. The greatest differences between women/men and younger/older age groups were observed during the second lockdown. People with mental illness have reported disadvantageous but stable levels of mental health indicators during the pandemic thus far, and they seem to be less affected by the factors that result in fluctuating time-series in other subgroups.","Pedersen, Andersen, Clotworthy, Jensen, Strandberg-Larsen, Rod, Varga","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03655-8","20220111","Anxiety; COVID-19; Loneliness; Longitudinal; Mental health; Mental illness; Prospective; Quality of life; Time-series; Trend; Worries","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25360,""
"Qualitative Investigation into the Mental Health of Healthcare Workers in Japan during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the mental health of healthcare workers in many countries including Japan. While many survey-based findings have reported the serious state of their wellbeing among healthcare workers, the first-hand experience of the mental health and coping in this population remains to be evaluated. Accordingly, this study aimed to appraise them using constructionist thematic analysis on semi-structured interviews attended by a purposive and snowball sample of 24 healthcare workers in Japan conducted in December 2020-January 2021. Four themes were identified: (1) increased stress and loneliness, (2) reduced coping strategies, (3) communication and acknowledgement as a mental health resource, and (4) understanding of self-care. Participants noted that the characteristics of Japanese work culture such as long hours, collectivism and <i>hatarakigai</i> (i.e., meaning in work) to explain these themes. These findings suggest that robust support at an organizational and individual level, capturing intrinsic values, are particularly important for this key workforce to cope with increased stress and loneliness, leading to better patient care.","Kotera, Ozaki, Miyatake, Tsunetoshi, Nishikawa, Kosaka, Tanimoto","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19010568","20220111","COVID-19; Japan; coping; healthcare workers; intrinsic rewards; mental health; self-care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25361,""
"Evaluating How Mental Health Changed in Australia through the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from the '<i>Taking the Pulse of the Nation</i>' (TTPN) Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health at the level of the population. The current study adds to the evidence base by examining how the prevalence of psychological distress changed in Australia during the pandemic. The study also assesses the psychometric properties of a new single-item measure of mental distress included in a survey program conducted regularly throughout the pandemic. Data are from 1158 respondents in wave 13 (early July 2020) of the nationally representative Taking the Pulse of the Nation (TTPN) Survey. The questionnaire included the six-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) and a new single-item measure of distress. Results show a significant increase in the prevalence of psychological distress in Australia, from 6.3% pre-pandemic to 17.7% in early July 2020 (unadjusted odds ratio = 3.19; 95% CI (confidence interval) = 2.51 to 4.05). The new single-item measure of distress is highly correlated with the K6. This study provides a snapshot at one point in time about how mental health worsened in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Perception Regarding Knowledge of COVID-19 Prevention in a Sample of a Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) Community in Houston, Texas, USA","(1) Background: Knowledge of COVID-19 prevention among communities is the first step towards protective behaviors. The objective of this study was to assess COVID-19 prevention knowledge among a Middle Eastern and North African community in Houston, Texas. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated quantitative survey; survey questions consisted of three parts: COVID-19 specific questions, general health questions, and sociodemographic questions. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine predictors of perception of knowledge on preventing COVID-19 spread. The outcome of interest comprised of ""good/excellent"" versus ""average and below"" knowledge. (3) Results: A total of 366 participants (66.39% males) completed the survey. A univariate analysis demonstrated significant differences in self-reported COVID-19 prevention knowledge among those with and without health insurance, different ages, level of knowledge, and perceived severity of COVID-19 infection. In the multivariate logistic regression, two predictors were identified: those in the 18-25-year-old group were more likely to have ""excellent/good"" knowledge on COVID-19 spread compared to the Ã¢â€°Â¥40-year-old group (OR: 6.36; 95% CI: 1.38, 29.34).

"Regression Analysis of Perceived Stress among Elite Athletes from Changes in Diet, Routine and Well-Being: Effects of the COVID-19 Lockdown and ""Bubble"" Training Camps","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lifestyles and training of elite athletes around the world. The detrimental effects of lockdown periods may vary among individuals, as well as among sports and sexes. This study investigated the changes in dietary habits, and the predictors of perceived stress during lockdown and a ""bubble"" training camp. This cross-sectional, online survey involved 76 elite and world-class athletes from six able-bodied sports and nine parasports, all of whom were involved in a 30-day ""bubble"" training camp. Questions were asked on socio-demographics, training routines and wellbeing, perceived stress, and dietary habits, pertaining to ""normal"" training (prelockdown), lockdown training, and ""bubble"" camp training periods. Changes in perceived stress were <i>trivial</i> to <i>small</i> during lockdown compared to ""normal"" training, and <i>trivial</i> to <i>moderate</i> during a ""bubble"" camp, compared to lockdown. Para-athletes, males, older athletes, less experienced athletes, married individuals, and specific ethnicities appeared to be more detrimentally affected (increased perceived stress) by lockdown. These negative experiences, however, were largely reversed during ""bubble"" camps. During lockdown, more athletes reported increased evening snack consumption (+8%), later meal-times (+6%), decreased fluid intake (-6%), and no breakfast (+7%). These changes were reversed during ""bubble"" camps (12-18% improvements). Sport classification accounted for 16% of the increased perceived stress (<i>p</i> = 0.001) during lockdown. Overall, socio-demographic factors, improvements in training routines, well-being, and dietary habits explained 28% of the decreased perceived stress during a ""bubble"" camp. In conclusion, better dietary habits, training routines and well-being have implications for reduced perceived stress. During lockdown, ""bubble"" camps may be beneficial, but this observation may be a case-by-case consideration, and short split ""bubble"" periods are recommended.","Washif, Ammar, Trabelsi, Chamari, Chong, Mohd Kassim, Lew, Farooq, Pyne, James","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19010402","20220111","Olympic; Paralympic; detraining; emotion; mental health; perception; quarantine; remote coaching; sports nutrition; training camp","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25364,""
"Prevalence, Incidence, and Factors Associated with Posttraumatic Stress at Three-Month Follow-Up among New York City Healthcare Workers after the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Prevalence, incidence, and factors associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms at follow-up among healthcare workers after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown. A web survey invitation was sent to healthcare worker listservs at a NYC medical center (April, 2020). The Primary Care (PC)-PTSD questionnaire was used to screen for PTSD symptoms at baseline and then every 2 weeks for 10 weeks. Incidence and prevalence of PTSD symptoms were determined at each time point. Multivariable generalized estimating equation models were performed to investigate the factors associated with a positive PC-PTSD screen at follow-up. Median age (interquartile range) of N = 230 participants was 36 (31-48) years; 79.6% were women; 82.6% worked in COVID-19-focused settings. The prevalence of PTSD symptoms decreased from 55.2% at baseline to 25.0% at 10 weeks (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Among participants who had a baseline negative screen for PTSD symptoms, the incidence of PTSD at 10 weeks was 12.2% (p-trend 0.034).

"Divergent changes: abstinence and higher-frequency substance use increase among racial/ethnic minority young adults during the COVID-19 global pandemic","Identifying factors influencing substance use among racial/ethnic minorities (REM) is important given the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on this population. We examined factors in four domains and hypothesized that poor mental health, negative coping behaviors, negative environmental aspects, and belonging to more vulnerable social groups would be associated with increased substance use during the pandemic. Multiple regression was applied to longitudinal data from a college sample assessed prior (fall 2017 to spring 2019) and during (spring 2020) the pandemic (<i>n</i>=Ã‚Â 323; 81.5% cisgender women; 34.5% African-American, 36.1% Asian-American, 15.5% Hispanic/Latinx, 11.8% multi-racial) to identify factors predicting current alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine use frequency (spring 2020) and change in frequency of use between springs 2019 and 2020. While infrequent substance use (monthly or less) decreased during the pandemic, abstinence rates increased (alcohol 39%; cannabis 18%; nicotine 18%) and higher-frequency alcohol use increased (207%-1600% 2-3 times+/week) compared to spring 2019. The strongest protective factor was change in living situation during the pandemic, associated with lower current alcohol and cannabis use. Risk factors included a history of trouble with police and impulsivity since the pandemic, both associated with higher current and increased alcohol and cannabis use. REM did not differ on most factors and the outcomes. However, a higher percentage of Asian-Americans than other REM reported living situation changes. Substance use rates diverged during the pandemic, with both increased abstinence and higher-frequency use, attributed mostly to mental health and environmental domain factors with few REM differences.","Hicks, Chartier, Buckley, Reese, Working Group, Vassileva, Dick, Amstadter, Peterson, Moreno","https://doi.org/10.1080/00952990.2021.1995401","20220110","Alcohol; COVID-19; cannabis; nicotine; pandemic; racial/ethnic minorities; substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25366,""
"Adolescent Psychosocial Adjustment during COVID-19: An Intensive Longitudinal Study","COVID-19 has presented threats to adolescents' psychosocial well-being, especially for those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. This longitudinal study aimed to identify which social (i.e., family conflict, parental social support, peer social support), emotional (i.e., COVID-19 health-related stress), and physical (i.e., sleep quality, food security) factors influence adolescents' same- and next-day affect and misconduct and whether these factors functioned differently by adolescents' economic status. Daily-diary approaches were used to collect 12,033 assessments over 29Ã‚Â days from a nationwide sample of American adolescents (<i>n</i> =546; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 15.0; 40% male; 43% Black, 37% White, 10% Latinx, 8% Asian American, and 3% Native American; 61% low-income) at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Peer support, parent support, and sleep quality operated as promotive factors, whereas parent-child conflict and COVID-19 health-related stress operated as risk factors. Although these links were consistent for adolescents irrespective of economic status, low-income adolescents experienced more conflict with parents, more COVID-19 health-related stress, less peer support, and lower sleep quality than higher-income adolescents. Food insecurity was connected to decreased same- and next-day negative affect for low-income adolescents only. Low-income adolescents also displayed greater negative affect in response to increased daily health-related stress relative to higher-income adolescents. These results highlight the role of proximal processes in shaping adolescent adjustment and delineate key factors influencing youth psychosocial well-being in the context of COVID-19. By understanding adolescents' responses to stressors at the onset of the pandemic, practitioners and healthcare providers can make evidence-based decisions regarding clinical treatment and intervention planning for youth most at risk for developmental maladjustment.","Wang, Henry, Scanlon, Del Toro, Voltin","https://doi.org/10.1080/15374416.2021.2007487","20220110","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25367,""
"Introduction of Special Section of Infant Mental Health Journal: Meeting the needs of vulnerable infants and families during COVID-19: Moving to a telehealth approach for home visiting implementation and research","Parents of infants and young children who experience harsh circumstances are among those most vulnerable to the added stressors associated with COVID-19. Home visiting models have been shown to enhance outcomes for parents and infants when delivered in person, but in many parts of the world, the pandemic rendered in-person home visits difficult or impossible. In this special section, we examine adaptations made by home visiting programs to allow continued service delivery through telehealth, and strategies for assessing whether interventions maintain reach and fidelity when implemented remotely. In the first paper, Bullinger etÃ‚Â al.

"Successful application of pulsed electromagnetic fields in aÃ‚Â patient with post-COVID-19 fatigue: aÃ‚Â case report","Post-COVID-19 fatigue is a frequent symptom in COVID-19 survivors, which substantially limits patients to achieve full recovery and potentially restrains return to work. The previous literature has not yet reported the use of pulsed electromagnetic fields in this indication. Over the course of 5 weeks, 10 sessions of pulsed electromagnetic field treatment with a high magnetic flux density were applied to a patient suffering from post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome. Fatigue, work ability, quality of life as well as anxiety, depression, stress level, and resilience were evaluated using validated patient-reported outcome measures. Fatigue, work ability, quality of life, and psychological well-being improved clearly over the course of the treatment and showed stable results 6Ã‚Â weeks later. The use of pulsed electromagnetic field therapy with a device that allows sufficient penetration of the body tissue might be a promising physical modality to manage post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome, which could reduce clinical and economic health consequences. Clinical sham-controlled studies are needed to evaluate the effect of pulsed electromagnetic fields in this indication.

In der bisherigen wissenschaftlichen Literatur wurde noch nicht ÃƒÂ¼ber den Einsatz gepulster Magnetfelder bei dieser Indikation berichtet. Eine Patientin, die an einem Post-COVID-19 ErschÃƒÂ¶pfungssyndrom litt, wurde ÃƒÂ¼ber einen Zeitraum von 5 Wochen mit 10 Einheiten gepulster Magnetfeldtherapie von hoher magnetischer Flussdichte behandelt. MÃƒÂ¼digkeit, ArbeitsfÃƒÂ¤higkeit, LebensqualitÃƒÂ¤t, Ãƒâ€žngstlichkeit, Depression, Stressniveau und Resilienz wurden mittels validierter FragebÃƒÂ¶gen erfasst. Die MÃƒÂ¼digkeit, ArbeitsfÃƒÂ¤higkeit, LebensqualitÃƒÂ¤t und das psychische Wohlbefinden besserten sich im Verlauf der Behandlung deutlich und zeigten auch 6 Wochen spÃƒÂ¤ter stabile Ergebnisse. Die Anwendung der gepulsten Magnetfeldtherapie mit einem GerÃƒÂ¤t, das eine ausreichende Eindringtiefe in das KÃƒÂ¶rpergewebe ermÃƒÂ¶glicht, kÃƒÂ¶nnte eine vielversprechende physikalische Methode zur Behandlung des ErschÃƒÂ¶pfungssyndroms nach COVID-19 sein, um die gesundheitlichen und wirtschaftlichen Folgen der Erkrankung zu reduzieren. Klinische placebokontrollierte Studien sind notwendig, um die Wirkung gepulster Magnetfeldtherapie in dieser Indikation zu erforschen.","Wagner, Steiner, Markovic, Crevenna","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10354-021-00901-2","20220110","Ion-induction therapy; Long COVID syndrome; Magnetic field therapy; PEMF; Rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25369,""
"Worry from contracting COVID-19 infection and its stigma among Egyptian health care providers","Healthcare providers (HCPs) in COVID-19 epidemic face stressful workload of disease management, shortage of protective equipment and high risk of infection and mortality. These stressors affect greatly their mental health. The aim is to identify working conditions among Egyptian HCPs during COVID-19 epidemic as well as stigma and worry perceptions from contracting COVID-19 infection and their predictors. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 565 HCPs. Data was collected through Google online self-administered questionnaire comprised seven parts: demographics characteristics, knowledge and attitude of COVID-19, working condition, worry of contracting COVID-19 at work, discrimination intention at work for COVID-19 patients, stigma assessment using impact stigma, and internalized shame scales. The vast majority of HCPs (94.7%) were worried from contracting COVID-19 at work. Risk factors for perceiving severe worry from contracting COVID-19 were expecting infection as a severe illness, believing that infection will not be successfully controlled, improbability to continue working during the pandemic even if in a well/fit health, high discrimination intention and impact stigma scales. Significantly high impact stigma scores were detected among those aged &lt; 30 years, females, workers primarily in sites susceptible for contracting COVID-19 infection, those had severe worry from contracting infection at work, and high internalized shame scale. The risk factors for perceiving higher internalized shame scores were not having a previous experience in working during a pandemic, high discrimination intention towards COVID-19 patients and high impact stigma scale. Considerable levels of worry and stigma were detected among Egyptian HCPs during COVID-19 outbreak.Ã‚Â The psychological aspect of health care providers should not be overlooked during epidemic; appropriate institutional mental health support should be provided especially for young HCPs, those without previous work experience in epidemic and those who work in high-risk units. Raising the community awareness about contribution of HCPs in fighting the epidemic might decrease stigmatization action toward HCPs.","Osman, Khalaf, Ahmed, Abdelbadee, Abbas, Mohammed","https://doi.org/10.1186/s42506-021-00099-6","20220111","COVID-19; Egypt; Health care providers; Stigma; Worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25370,""
"Demographic and clinical characteristics of primary care patients vaccinated against COVID-19 in spring 2021","The aim of this study was to examine the age distribution and comorbidities of individuals vaccinated in primary care practices in April and May 2021. The analysis was based on data from the IQVIA Disease Analyzer database and included 245,948 patients who received their first COVID-19 vaccination from one of 820 family medicine practices in April or May 2021. 93.6% of individuals received a vaccination based on general indication, 6.2% based on occupational indication, and 0.2% were nursing home residents. Men were 3.5 years younger on average than women (59.2 vs. 62.7 years). 54% of women and 52% of men younger than 60 years had at least one diagnosis from the priority list. Hypertension was the most common diagnosis (23.6% of men and 20.7% of women). In men, chronic respiratory diseases such as COPD or asthma were the second most common diagnosis (11.0%), while in women, depression (17.0%) was the second most common diagnosis. In the first 2 months of vaccination in general practices, most patients vaccinated were either elderly or chronically ill. Further studies comparing the characteristics of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals would also be of great epidemiological relevance.","Kostev, Beinker, Weber, Bohlken, Tanislav","https://doi.org/10.5414/CP204178","20220110","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25371,""

"The Moderating Role of Personal Resources Between Demands and Ill-Being of Romanian Healthcare Professionals in the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background and Objectives:</b> The illness caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) triggered considerable mental consequences for the medical staff. Our aim was to research whether frontline healthcare workers' positive psychological state-PsyCap-impacts the relationship between anxiety/depression and burnout/mental health complaints. <b>Material and Methods:</b> One hundred twenty-six medical professionals working on the frontline at the Intensive Care Unit and Emergency Department in Romania took validated surveys between March and April 2020. All information was collected online after accessing a link that was received in an email message. The inclusion criteria concerned the categories of healthcare professionals who came into direct contact with patients during the COVID-19 global epidemic through the performed medical act, as well as time spent in the medical field of ICU an EM, namely at least 1 year in the department. We excluded from the research other categories of employees and auxiliary staff, as well as healthcare workers with &lt;1-year experience in the medical field. The moderating role of personal resources (PsyCap) between demands (such as anxiety and depression) and ill-being (burnout and mental health complaints) of healthcare professionals were tested <i>via</i> hierarchical multiple regressions. <b>Results:</b> We tested the moderating role of PsyCap on the relation between anxiety and ill-being. The results indicated that high anxiety predicts lower emotional exhaustion and a low level of mental health complaints about Romanian healthcare professionals when PsyCap is high. The moderating role of PsyCap on the relation between depression and ill-being was tested in the second hypothesis. The results indicated that high depression predicts lower inefficacy and a low level of mental health complaints about Romanian healthcare professionals when PsyCap is increased. <b>Conclusions:</b> PsyCap is a crucial variable that may decrease the impact of anxiety and depression on psychological outcomes such as emotional exhaustion, inefficacy, and psychological problems among Romanian medical professionals working on the frontline during the COVID-19 global epidemic. Thus, psychological interventions that help medical staff gain personal resources are appropriate in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Secosan, Virga, Crainiceanu, Bratu, Bratu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.736099","20220111","COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; depression; frontline healthcare workers; mental health complaints; psychological capital","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25373,""
"Early Mental Health and Quality of Life in Discharged Patients With COVID-19","<b>Aim:</b> This study aimed to analyze the early mental health (MH) and quality of life (QoL) of discharged patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which can provide a scientific basis for the further development of intervention programs. <b>Methods:</b> In total, 108 subjects participated in this study, including an experimental group (90 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from March to April 2020 and hospitalized in Wuhan China Resources &amp; WISCO General Hospital, Wuhan, China, 83.3%) and a control group (18 healthy participants, 16.7%). Their MH and QoL were measured through the 12-item Short Form Health Survey version 2 (SF-12v2), the Self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), the Self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The results of questionnaires were compared between these two groups. <b>Results:</b> (1) Comparison of anxiety status: among 90 discharged patients with COVID-19, 30 patients (33.3%) had a state of anxiety. Compared with healthy participants and the general population, patients with COVID-19 in the early stages of discharge had a higher incidence of anxiety and more severe anxiety symptoms (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). (2) Comparison of depression status: among 90 discharged patients with COVID-19, 29 patients (32.2%) had a state of depression. Compared with healthy participants and the general population, patients with COVID-19 in the early stages of discharge had a higher incidence of depression and more severe depression symptoms (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). (3) Comparison of QoL: 78 patients (86.7%) presented a decrease in physical health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and 73 patients (81.1%) presented a decrease in psychology-related QoL. The SF-12v2 physical component summary (PCS) and the SF-12v2 mental component summary (MCS) of patients were significantly lower than those of healthy people, especially in physical function (PF), vitality (VT), social function (SF), and mental health (MH) (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). (4) Gender differences in mental health and the QoL among patients with COVID-19: women had more severe anxiety/depression symptoms than men (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The scores of women in all dimensions of SF-12V2 were lower than those of men, and there were statistically significant differences between the two groups in PCS, PF, general health (GH), VT, and role-emotional (RE) (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> During the early phase after being discharged, patients with COVID-19 might experience negative emotions, such as anxiety or depression, and also problems with reduced QoL, especially among female patients. Therefore, an intervention plan should focus on strengthening psychological condition and improving physical function, and gender-specific rehabilitation programmes should be adapted to improve psychological status and QoL.","Hu, Zhang, Xue, Song, Li, Lei, Wu, Qian","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.725505","20220111","coronavirus disease 2019; discharged patients; mental health; quality of life; the 12-item short form Health Survey version 2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25374,""
"The Mental Health of Caregivers and Their Patients With Dementia During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review","<b>Background:</b> Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide public health concern. It continues to spread rapidly throughout the world causing multiple physical and psychological consequences in the population. Especially, people affected by severe psychiatric or neurological diseases are highly susceptible to serious health complications not only due to the direct effect of the infection but also to the indirect effect of COVID-19 following social distancing during lockdowns and its general social consequences. Indeed, lockdown and difficulties in using the care services produced psychological consequences in caregivers such as depression, anxiety, and worsening of the quality of life which in turn affected the ability to manage patients. Our aim was to systematically review the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 lockdown in caregivers of patients with cognitive impairment and dementia and the impact on the health of their patients. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic literature search was conducted by searching in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science by two independent researchers following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Data extraction and quality assessment were also performed. Papers were screened for eligibility by abstract and then those which met inclusion criteria were included in this review. <b>Results:</b> The initial search returned 410 records. After the abstract screening and the inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied, 315 were excluded because they were irrelevant, 30 because they were reviews, meta-analyses, letters to editors, editorials, guidelines, or case reports, and 10 because they were duplicates. Then, 38 out of 55 abstracts/full-text articles were excluded because they did not simultaneously assess mental health of patients and caregivers. In the end, 17 papers were deemed eligible and included in the present review. <b>Conclusion:</b> Based on current literature, the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown caused severe psychological consequences for caregivers of patients with dementia, worsening their mental health, and increasing the psychological and physical burden, independently from the severity of the disease of their relatives, which resulted also independently globally worsened.","Carbone, de Filippis, Roberti, Rania, Destefano, Russo, De Sarro, Segura-Garcia, De Fazio","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.782833","20220111","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; caregivers; cognitive dysfunction; dementia; pandemic; psychological symptoms; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25375,""
"The Feasibility of Outdoor Psychology Sessions in an Adult Mental Health Inpatient Rehabilitation Unit: Service User and Psychologist Perspectives","Few studies have explored outdoor therapy when facilitated by clinical psychologists within an inpatient mental health service. In the present study, outdoor psychology sessions were introduced after service users (SUs) expressed a desire to return to face-to-face working during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explore SUs' and clinical psychologists' perspectives on the feasibility of conducting outdoor therapy within the service. A mixed-method approach was underpinned by critical realist philosophy. Three psychologists maintained reflective diaries following outdoor therapy sessions with 16 SUs. A subsample of 14 SUs completed scales measuring therapeutic alliance and comfort during outdoor sessions. A subsample of eight SUs participated in semi-structured interviews. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Quantitative and qualitative data demonstrated high SU satisfaction with therapeutic alliance and comfort outdoors. Six themes were identified: utilising a person-centred approach; the value of multi-disciplinary team support; enhancing therapeutic engagement; the benefits of time away from the ward; managing confidentiality; physical health and safety. This feasibility study demonstrated the introduction of outdoor psychology sessions within an inpatient mental health service to be a viable response to COVID-19. The findings suggest outdoor therapy can be an effective and safe mode of therapy, and can offset the challenges of indoor working, providing certain risk factors are considered and managed. The limitations of this study and implications for clinical practice are discussed. Further research is now required to support future integration into clinical practice.","James, Kidd, Cooley, Fenton","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.769590","20220111","COVID-19; clinical psychology; inpatient mental health services; nature exposure; outdoor therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25376,""
"The Persian Language Version of the Obsession With the COVID-19 Scale for Adolescents","<b>Objective:</b> The worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused significant public health burdens and psychological dysfunctions. In this challenging time, adolescents require special care. The Persian version of the Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS) for adolescents was developed to screen for dysfunctional obsession associated with the coronavirus during the global pandemic. The structure and internal consistency of the OCS were established. <b>Design and Measures:</b> Although there are different language versions of the OCS, this is the first study to validate the psychometric properties of the OCS in Iranian adolescents. Seven hundred and nine students (369 girls) participated in the study. Demographic questions and the OCS were administered. <b>Results:</b> The findings provided support for the existence of a unidimensional structure that met the criteria for configural, metric, and full scalar invariance across gender (girls and boys), inhabitancy (urban and rural), and infection experience (infected and non-infected). The OCS is short and highly reliable measurement. However, further research is necessary to establish the validity of the scale in Iranian population. <b>Conclusions:</b> The development of such valid scales is an essential part of both research and practice during times of crisis, like a global pandemic. Diagnosis of pandemic related to obsessive thoughts in adolescents is needed as the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing and as experts point out, it can be expected that the effects of the pandemic will be observed in the coming years. The Persian version makes it possible to conduct international comparative research on the anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Asanjarani, SzczygieÃ…â€š, Arif","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.800982","20220111","COVID-19; adolescent; mental health; obsession; validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25377,""
"The Mental Health Status and Associated Factors Among Medical Students Engaged in Online Learning at Home During the Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study From China","<b>Background:</b> The purpose of this study was to assess the mental health status of medical students engaged in online learning at home during the pandemic, and explore the potential risk factors of mental health. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted via an online survey among 5,100 medical students from Wannan Medical College in China. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress scale (DASS-21) was used to measure self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress among medical students during online learning in the pandemic. <b>Results:</b> In total, 4,115 participants were included in the study. The prevalence symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were 31.9, 32.9, and 14.6%, respectively. Depression was associated with gender, grade, length of schooling, relationship with father, students' daily online learning time, and students' satisfaction with online learning effects. Anxiety was associated with gender, length of schooling, relationship with father, relationship between parents, students' daily online learning time, and students' satisfaction with online learning effects. Stress was associated with grade, relationship with father, relationship between parents, students' daily online learning time, and students' satisfaction with online learning effects. <b>Conclusions:</b> Nearly one-third of medical students survived with varying degrees of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms during online learning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gender, grade, length of schooling, family environment, and online learning environment play vital roles in medical students' mental health. Families and schools should provide targeted psychological counseling to high-risk students (male, second-year and third-year, four-year program).

"Negative Emotions in Chinese Frontline Medical Staff During the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Epidemic: Status, Trend, and Influential Pathways Based on a National Investigation","<b>Objective:</b> The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), declared as a major public health emergency, has had profound effects on public mental health especially emotional status. Due to professional requirements, medical staff are at a higher risk of infection, which might induce stronger negative emotions. This study aims to reveal the emotional status of Chinese frontline medical staff in the early epidemic period to better maintain their mental health, and provide adequate psychological support for them. <b>Methods:</b> A national online survey was carried out in China at the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. In total, 3025 Chinese frontline medical staff took part in this investigation which utilized a general information questionnaire, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), and the Berkeley Expressivity Questionnaire (BEQ). <b>Results:</b> At the early stage of COVID-19, anxiety was the most common negative emotion of Chinese medical staff, followed by sadness, fear, and anger, mainly at a mild degree, which declined gradually over time. Nurses had the highest level of negative emotions compared with doctors and other healthcare workers. Women experienced more fear than men, younger and unmarried medical staff had more anxiety and fear compared with elders and married ones. Risk perception and emotional expressivity increased negative emotions, cognitive reappraisal reduced negative emotions, while negative emotions led to more avoidant behavior and more physical health disturbances, in which negative emotions mediated the effect of risk perception on avoidant behavior tendency in the model test. <b>Conclusion:</b> Chinese frontline medical staff experienced a mild level of negative emotions at the early stage of COVID-19, which decreased gradually over time. The findings suggest that during the epidemic, nurses' mental health should be extensively attended to, as well as women, younger, and unmarried medical staff. To better ensure their mental health, reducing risk perception and improving cognitive reappraisal might be important, which are potentially valuable to form targeted psychological interventions and emotional guidance under crisis in the future.","Sun, Xie, Chen, Shi, Shen, Chen, Yuan, Zhang, Qin, Liu, Wang, Dai","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.567446","20220111","COVID-19; Chinese frontline medical staff; influential pathway; negative emotion; status; trend","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25379,""
"Impact of Academic Support on Anxiety and Depression of Chinese Graduate Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mediating Role of Academic Performance","The COVID-19 pandemic broke out and has spread globally since 2019. It became a public health concern. This pandemic has brought tremendous changes in students' lives and modes of learning. Graduate students are likely to be more affected as they are a part of a special training program. According to the main-effect model, social support has a positive effect on mental health. The pandemic has exerted a negative impact on the social support of individuals, and as a result, the behavior of a person is more likely to be at risk and has resulted in psychological crisis in people/individuals. A sample of 3137 graduate students responded to the instrument developed to assess the impact of the pandemic on the academic activities and performance, Self-rating Anxiety Scale and Self-rating Depression Scale. The results showed that: 1) the pandemic impacted the academic support and performance of graduate students in varying degrees, 21% of graduate students experienced anxiety, and 33.9% of graduate students experienced depressive symptoms in varying degrees; 2) academic support variables (ie, academic exchange with mentors and peers) and academic performance variables (ie, data collection and thesis writing) were significantly associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms; 3) the model fitted the data well (RMSEA = 0.029; SRMR = 0.014; TLI = 0.99; CFI = 0.996). The direct effects of academic support on anxiety and depressive symptoms were significant. The impact on academic performance played a mediating role between the impact on academic support, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Academic support significantly affected academic performance, which in turn affected anxiety and depressive symptoms. So, it implies that, due to the pandemic, the academic support for graduate students had decreased, resulting in deterioration in academic performance, causing anxiety and depressive symptoms.","Zeng, Liang, Zhang, Xia, Li, Kang, Yi, Wang","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S345021","20220111","COVID-19 pandemic; academic performance; academic support; anxiety; depressive symptoms; graduate students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25380,""
"Assessment of Quality of Life Among Health Professionals During COVID-19: Review","In 2019, coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) influences the quality of life of health personnel who are on the front lines in dealing with COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this study is to assess the quality of life of health professionals during the COVID-19 epidemic. The novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread across the globe with the direct causal viral agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and infected many people. All health professionals (HPs) such as physicians, nurses, and other allied health staff members are primary caregivers in hospitals and other health care settings, specifically under pandemic situations such as COVID-19. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused numerous diversions in the preservation of the quality of life (QoL) of health professionals by deviations from normal physical, mental, and social wellbeing aspects. HPs are the most vulnerable population to COVID-19 viral transmission while delivering emergency medical services to persons infected with the virus in various health care sectors, such as direct engagement in lifesaving management. In this perspective, some recent literature on QoL of health professionals was examined, uncovering that they frequently experience fear and anxiety due to viral transmissions in the place of work and probable cross-contamination among family members, tend to experience insomnia caused by sudden increased work pressure, struggle to balance professional and personal life, suffering from mental health disturbances such as depressive episodes, mood disturbances, and suicidal tendencies due to the unpredictability of the disease outbreak. The current review is looking to determine and address the degree of QoL maintained by specific types of health professionals during critical moments of COVID-19 pandemics. This study may assist health organization stakeholders in enhancing QoL among health professionals by introducing required provisions, measures, or initiatives for the welfare of health professionals, notably in resolving pandemic demands in all health organizations.","Kandula, Wake","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S344055","20220111","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; assessment; health professionals; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25381,""

"Parental experiences in neonatal intensive care unit in Ethiopia: a phenomenological study","Neonatal intensive care unit is important to save the lives of a sick neonate; however, parents are challenged by several stressful conditions during their stay. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the lived experiences of parents in neonatal intensive care units in Ethiopia. We used a phenomenological study design. The data were collected using an in-depth interview method from purposively selected parents. In addition, we followed a thematic analysis approach and used Open Code Software Version 4.02 to process the data. In this study, 18 parents were interviewed. The researchers have identified six themes. Parents complained of psychological problems like anxiety, stress, worries, hopelessness, and a state of confusion. In addition, anger, crying, sadness, frustration, dissatisfaction, regret, disappointment, feeling bad, self-blaming, nervousness, disturbance, and lack of self-control were major emotional problems raised by the parents. Parents expressed that health care providers showed indiscipline, lack of commitment, and uncooperative behaviour. Likewise, shortage of medicines, money, and limited time to visit their neonates were the other concerns of many parents. At the same time, parents were provided minimal information and limited cooperation from health care providers. Parents whose infants admitted to the NICU were suffered from various psychological and emotional problems.

Using data from a national sample of 2,485 U.S. adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥55, we aimed to describe the magnitude of disruptions to family care arrangements during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the associations between these disruptions and the mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, loneliness, and self-rated health) and employment outcomes (job loss or furlough, hours or wages reduced, transition to work-from-home) of family caregivers. We found that COVID-19 disrupted over half of family caregiving arrangements, and that care disruptions were associated with increased depression, anxiety, and loneliness among caregivers, compared with both noncaregivers and caregivers who did not experience disruptions. Family caregivers who experienced pandemic-related employment disruptions were providing more care than caregivers who did not experience disruptions. These findings highlight the impact of the pandemic on an essential and vulnerable health care workforce.","Truskinovsky, Finlay, Kobayashi","https://doi.org/10.1177/10775587211062405","20220110","COVID-19; aging; family caregiving; long-term care; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25384,""
"[Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health inequalities and mental health: effective public policies]","The aim of this article is to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health inequalities and mental disorders and to analyse the most effective public policies in containing them. COVID-19, in addition to causing the worst health crisis since World War II, has generated a severe economic recession and a rise in unemployment. The poorer socioeconomic classes have been most affected by infections and deaths caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus due to inequalities in working, housing and area of Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹residence conditions, psychosocial factors, and unequal access to health care. The pandemic crisis, in addition to causing psychiatric and neurological problems in people who have been hospitalized, appears to have increased the risk of psychological problems through various mechanisms such as social distancing, loss of a loved one, unemployment, and economic difficulties. In many countries, however, there was no significant increase in suicides in 2020 and there have even been decreasing temporal trends. It is possible that the crisis, in addition to creating stress and social isolation, may have promoted reciprocity, interpersonal help, and greater motivation to take care of one's health.The most effective policies in reducing COVID-19 mortality have the potential to limit the most adverse effects of the pandemic on health inequalities and mental health. Thanks to vigorous preventive interventions on the territory, based on testing, tracing, isolating, timely, countries who managed best the pandemic avoided prolonged and repeated lockdowns, protected public health and the economy. However, more vigorous social protection measures are needed in favour of those populations most affected by the health crisis and its socioeconomic effects. This pandemic offers the opportunity to learn lessons on the protection of public health and stress the need to adopt a syndemic model oriented towards prevention.","De Vogli, Buio, De Falco","https://doi.org/10.19191/EP21.6.125","20220111","COVID-19; Inequalities; Mental health; Social policies; Syndemic; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Italy; Mental Health; Pandemics; Public Policy; SARS-CoV-2; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25385,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of care by Australian primary health care nurses","This qualitative study describes the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of care by Australian primary health care (PHC) nurses. Participants were purposefully recruited following completion of a national survey about PHC nurses' experiences during the pandemic. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted by two experienced researchers and professionally transcribed. The mean duration of interviews was 38.5Ã‚Â min. Thematic analysis revealed three themes about the impact of COVID-19 on PHC nurses' provision of care. These were: workplace adjustments, changes in healthcare delivery and concerns about long-term health impacts of COVID-19. The sudden disruption and de-stabilisation of care delivery was reported as significantly impacting on initial service provision, although participants reported adapting quickly and finding new ways to deliver care. The impact of the pandemic on high risk communities and mental health support needs of clients created additional challenges, although some participants reported positive outcomes such as increased confidence of some clients to provide self-care. There were concerns about the potential long-term health impact on communities due to reduced levels of cancer screening, disrupted management of chronic conditions and reduced opportunistic health assessments. Findings from this study demonstrated how PHC nurses played an important role in the continued provision of PHC by adapting quickly to changed circumstances, adjusting and modifying clinical activities, and by monitoring for future potential negative outcomes from the pandemic. These findings are important for the future management of pandemics and inform the long-term planning of PHC services.","Ashley, Halcomb, James, Calma, Stephen, McInnes, Mursa, Williams","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13710","20220110","COVID-19; community nursing; general practice; nurses; pandemic; primary care; primary health care; qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25386,""
"Maternal mood moderates the trajectory of emotional and behavioural problems from pre- to during the COVID-19 lockdown in preschool children","The COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown have dramatically impacted families' life, raising serious concerns about children's emotional wellbeing. However, few studies have investigated whether the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on psychological adjustment in youngest can be moderated by maternal mood and, to our knowledge, none of them has adopted a longitudinal design. The main aim of the current study was to explore if the intensity and directionality of maternal mood symptoms moderated the trajectory of emotional and behavioural problems in Italian pre-schoolers from pre- to during the lockdown adopting a longitudinal design. To assess maternal anxiety and depression symptoms, the EPDS and the STAI-Y were filled in by 94 and 88 women before the lockdown, when their children were 1 (Wave P1) and 3Ã‚Â years old (Wave P2), respectively, and by 74 women during the lockdown, when their children were 4Ã‚Â years old (Wave L). Mothers also filled in the CBCL/1 Ã‚Â½-5 to assess their children's emotional and behavioural problems at each assessment wave. As a whole, children's emotional and behavioural problems significantly increased from pre- to during the lockdown. Furthermore, maternal mood moderated this trajectory. In particular, greater maternal mood symptoms were significantly associated with a greater increase in emotional reactive, anxious-depressed, withdrawn and aggressive symptoms during the lockdown. These results contribute to shed light on the role played by maternal emotional wellbeing in buffering the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on children's behavioural development. Albeit preliminary, the current findings highlight the need to provide timely psychological interventions to distressed mothers to help their children to better cope with the effects of the pandemic.","Frigerio, Nettuno, Nazzari","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01925-0","20220110","COVID-19; Externalizing problems; Internalizing problems; Maternal anxiety; Maternal depression; Preschool children","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25387,""
"Long-term outcomes after NeuroCOVID: A 6-month follow-up study on 60 patients","Long-term outcomes after neurological manifestations due to COVID-19 are poorly known. The aim of our study was to evaluate the functional outcome and identify the risk factors of neurologic sequelae after COVID-19 associated with neurological manifestations (NeuroCOVID). We conducted a multi-center observational study six months after the acute neurological symptoms in patients from the French NeuroCOVID hospital-based registry. We obtained data on 60 patients. NeuroCOVID had a negative impact on the quality of life (QoL) of 49% of patients. Age was a predictor of residual QoL impairment (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.13, p=0.026). At six months, a significant residual disability was found in 51.7% of patients, and impaired cognition in 68.9% of cases. The main persistent neuropsychiatric manifestations were a persistent smell/taste disorder in 45% of patients, memory complaints in 34% of patients, anxiety or depression in 32% of patients. NeuroCOVID likely carries a high risk of long-term neuropsychiatric disability. Long-term care and special attention should be given to COVID-19 patients, especially if they had neurological manifestations during acute infection.","Chaumont, Meppiel, Roze, TressiÃƒÂ¨res, de Broucker, Lannuzel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurol.2021.12.008","20220110","COVID-19; Long-term outcomes; NeuroCOVID; Neurological manifestation; Post-COVID Syndrome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25388,""
"Psychological Effects of COVID-19 among Healthcare Workers and How They Are Coping: A Web-based, Cross-sectional Study during the First Wave of COVID-19 in Pakistan","To ascertain the psychological impacts of COVID-19 among the Pakistani healthcare workers (HCWs) and their coping strategies. This web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs (N=398) from Punjab province of Pakistan. The generalized anxiety scale (GAD-7), patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Brief-COPE were used to assess anxiety, depression and coping strategies, respectively. The average age of respondents was 28.67 years (SD=4.15), with the majority of medical doctors (52%). The prevalence of anxiety and depression were 21.4% and 21.9%, respectively. There was no significant difference in anxiety and depression scores among doctors, nurses and pharmacists. Females had significantly higher anxiety (p=0.003) and depression (p=0.001) scores than males. Moreover, frontline HCWs had significantly higher depression scores (p=0.010) than others. The depression, not anxiety, score were significantly higher among those who did not receive the infection prevention training (p=0.004). Most frequently adopted coping strategy were religious coping (M=5.98, SD=1.73), acceptance (M=5.59, SD=1.55) and coping planning (M=4.91, SD=1.85). A considerable proportion of HCWs are having generalized anxiety and depression during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

"Evaluating burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic among physicians in a large health system in New York","The COVID-19 pandemic has generated significant psychological distress among health care workers worldwide. New York State, particularly New York City and surrounding counties, were especially affected, and experienced over 430,000 COVID-19 cases and 25,000 deaths by mid-August 2020. We hypothesized that physicians and trainees (residents/fellows) who were redeployed outside of their specialty to treat COVID-19 inpatients would have higher burnout. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess burnout among attending and trainee physicians who provided patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic between March-May 2020 across a diverse health care system in New York. Separate multivariable logistic regressions were performed to determine the association between redeployment and measures of burnout: Emotional Exhaustion (EE) and Depersonalization. Burnout measures were also compared by physician vs trainee status. The differential association between redeployment and outcomes with respect to trainee status was also evaluated. Redeployment was significantly associated with increased odds of EE {OR =1.53, 95% CI: 1.01-2.31} after adjusting for gender and Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII) score. Similarly, being a trainee, especially a junior level trainee, was associated with increased odds of EE {OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.01-2.51} after adjusting for gender and EPII scores. However, neither redeployment nor trainee status were significantly associated with Depersonalization. Interactions between redeployment and trainee status were not significant for any of the outcomes (<i>p</i>&gt;.05). Physicians who were redeployed to treat COVID-19 patients had higher reported measures of EE. Trainees, irrespective of redeployment status, had higher EE as compared with attendings. Additional research is needed to understand the long-term impact of redeployment on burnout among redeployed physicians. Programs to identify and address potential burnout among physicians, particularly trainees, during pandemics may be beneficial.","Singh, Young, Malhotra, McCann-Pineo, Rasul, Corley, Yacht, Friedman, Barone, Schwartz","https://doi.org/10.1080/19338244.2021.2023084","20220110","Burnout; COVID-19; mental health; physicians; redeployment; residents; trainees","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25393,""
"Mental Health and Alcohol Use during and before the Early Phases of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The early phases of the coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic were associated with changes in psychological well-being and alcohol use. However, it is unclear whether these changes are artifacts of psychological well-being and alcohol use prior to the pandemic across different sociodemographic groups. We received surveys from 247 adult residents of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania (United States), with an oversampling of sexual- and gender-minority individuals. Responses included measures of psychological well-being, substance use, and sociodemographic characteristics. Unadjusted mean depression scores, anxiety scores, and number of drinking days increased for all age and income groups during COVID-19, while average number of drinks per drinking day and days intoxicated differentially increased or decreased by age and income groups. Using Bayesian seemingly unrelated regression, we assessed depression and anxiety symptoms and alcohol use during the early stages of the pandemic and one month before COVID-19 was first identified in Allegheny County concurrently. Those in the youngest (18-24) group drank on more days during (but not before) the pandemic than those in the 25-44 age group. Compared to cisgender women, gender-minority adults had higher depression scores during the early stages of the pandemic. Employed adults had lower anxiety scores during (but not before) the pandemic than adults who were unemployed. Those with past-year annual incomes above $80,000 had fewer drinks on average drinking occasions than those in the $40,000 or below group before (but not during) the pandemic. Patterns of psychological distress and alcohol use associated with the COVID-19 pandemic differ by subgroup compared to patterns prior to the pandemic. Interventions addressing worsening mental health outcomes and shifting alcohol use patterns must be sensitive to the needs of vulnerable groups, such as younger adults and those experiencing poverty or unemployment.","Sumetsky, Frankeberger, Coulter, Burke, Friedman, Mair","https://doi.org/10.1080/08964289.2021.2015278","20220110","Alcohol use; COVID-19; anxiety; depression; sexual and gender minorities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25394,""

"Proximity to COVID-19 patients and role-specific mental health outcomes of healthcare professionals","Healthcare professionals (HCPs) experience extreme hardships and challenges during the time of COVID-19, due to their professional roles. At the same time, HCPs may experience a feeling of importance as contributing members of the community, which could enhance their well-being alongside COVID-19-work-related stressors.

The objective of this study was to determine the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombian endoscopists and make a comparison with endoscopists from South America and from Spain. In June 2021, an electronic survey was administered to 292 endoscopists from Colombia, South America and Spain to determine the impact of the pandemic on their professional practice, economic situation, physical and mental health, and the training of the residents they were in charge of. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling. A reduction in the number of endoscopic procedures was reported by 69.9% of the respondents, and 72.3% of endoscopists in Colombia stated their income had decreased. Regarding the doctor-patient relationship, 43.8% of the respondents believed it had worsened. In addition, 70.9% reported having experienced emotional state changes, especially those related to feeling sad or depressed, and 56.5% expressed that the pandemic had negatively affected the training of residents. Finally, 24.7% endoscopists tested positive for COVID-19, and 19.2% reported the death of a family member due to COVID-19.

Thirty one percent (31%) felt hopeless, unhappy even panic attacks but most significant finding was that 21% participants had at least once thought about ending their lives. This is a matter of concern and the workplaces should identify the vulnerable professionals so that they can be supported better mentally and socially. More than half of the participants (55%) were found to have moderate to severe depression in the first peak of COVID 19 pandemic. This is not over yet; more waves are coming.

"A pilot study assessing the feasibility and acceptability of Project UPLIFT adapted for patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures","People with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are at elevated risk of multiple psychiatric comorbidities. Current treatment gaps highlight the need for time-limited, distance-delivered interventions that can be cost-effectively delivered to patients with PNES. Project UPLIFT is a self-management program addressing mood problems in epilepsy that has not previously been adapted for PNES. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of UPLIFT for patients with PNES. Project UPLIFT was minimally adapted by a multidisciplinary research group at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. Participants were recruited into a nonrandomized pilot study and were assessed at baseline, after completing the intervention, and at 1-month follow-up. The intervention was adapted and delivered without additional modification. A total of eight participants enrolled in the trial, and six participated in the first session. All six participants who started UPLIFT completed the intervention, with a 98% attendance record across the eight sessions. At follow-up, 100% reported that UPLIFT provided useful tools for daily life. All participants continued using UPLIFT after completing the program, and 83% felt it helped with seizure management. Preliminary results provide proof-of-concept for future efficacy trials. This study provides initial support for the feasibility and acceptability of Project UPLIFT, minimally adapted for patients with PNES. As a time-limited program that can be distance-delivered to groups of patients, UPLIFT may be well-suited for the healthcare environment brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Streltzov, Mazanec, Schmidt, Jobst, Thompson, Schommer","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108525","20220109","Cognitive behavioral therapy; Depression; Distance delivery; Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy; Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES); Self-management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25400,""
"Changes in healthcare seeking and lifestyle in old aged individuals during COVID-19 lockdown in Germany: the population-based AugUR study","Containment measures in the COVID-19 pandemic protected individuals at high risk, particularly individuals at old age, but little is known about how these measures affected health-related behavior of old aged individuals. We aimed to investigate the impact of the spring 2020 lockdown in Germany on healthcare-seeking and health-related lifestyle in the old aged and to identify susceptible subgroups. We conducted a follow-up survey among the pre-pandemically well-characterized participants of our AugUR cohort study, residents in/around Regensburg aged 70+ years and relatively mobile. A self-completion questionnaire on current behavior, perceived changes, and SARS-Cov-2 infection was mailed in May 2020, shortly before contact restrictions ended. Pre-pandemic lifestyle and medical conditions were derived from previous study center visits. Among 1850 survey participants (73-98Ã¢â‚¬â€°years; net-response 89%), 74% were at increased risk for severe COVID-19 according to medical conditions; four participants reported SARS-CoV-2 infection (0.2%). Participants reported changes in behavior: 29% refrained from medical appointments, 14% increased TV consumption, 26% reported less physical activity, but no systematic increase of smoking or alcohol consumption. When comparing during- and pre-lockdown reports of lifestyle within participant, we found the same pattern as for the reported perceived changes. Women and the more educated were more susceptible to changes. Worse QOL was perceived by 38%. Our data suggest that the spring 2020 lockdown did not affect the lifestyle of a majority of the mobile old aged individuals, but the substantial proportions with decreased physical activity and healthcare-seeking are markers of collateral damage.","Brandl, Zimmermann, GÃƒÂ¼nther, Dietl, KÃƒÂ¼chenhoff, Loss, Stark, Heid","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-021-02677-x","20220111","AugUR; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Lifestyle factors; Old aged population; Physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption; Population-based study; Proportion at risk for COVID-19; Quality of life; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-12","",25401,""
"Fatigue and cognitive impairment in Post-COVID-19 Syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis","COVID-19 is associated with clinically significant symptoms despite resolution of the acute infection (i.e., post-COVID-19 syndrome). Fatigue and cognitive impairment are amongst the most common and debilitating symptoms of post-COVID-19 syndrome. To quantify the proportion of individuals experiencing fatigue and cognitive impairment 12 or more weeks following COVID-19 diagnosis, and to characterize the inflammatory correlates and functional consequences of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Systematic searches were conducted without language restrictions from database inception to June 8, 2021 on PubMed/MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, Embase, Web of Science, Google/Google Scholar, and select reference lists. Primary research articles which evaluated individuals at least 12Ã‚Â weeks after confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and specifically reported on fatigue, cognitive impairment, inflammatory parameters, and/or functional outcomes were selected. Two reviewers independently extracted published summary data and assessed methodological quality and risk of bias. A meta-analysis of proportions was conducted to pool Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformed proportions using the random-effects restricted maximum-likelihood model. The co-primary outcomes were the proportions of individuals reporting fatigue and cognitive impairment, respectively, 12 or more weeks following COVID-19 infection. The secondary outcomes were inflammatory correlates and functional consequences associated with post-COVID-19 syndrome. The literature search yielded 10,979 studies, and 81 studies were selected for inclusion. The fatigue meta-analysis comprised 68 studies, the cognitive impairment meta-analysis comprised 43 studies, and 48 studies were included in the narrative synthesis. Meta-analysis revealed that the proportion of individuals experiencing fatigue 12 or more weeks following COVID-19 diagnosis was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27, 0.37; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001; nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 25,268; I<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 99.1%). The proportion of individuals exhibiting cognitive impairment was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.17, 0.28; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001; nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 13,232; I<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 98.0). Moreover, narrative synthesis revealed elevations in proinflammatory markers and considerable functional impairment in a subset of individuals. A significant proportion of individuals experience persistent fatigue and/or cognitive impairment following resolution of acute COVID-19. The frequency and debilitating nature of the foregoing symptoms provides the impetus to characterize the underlying neurobiological substrates and how to best treat these phenomena.
