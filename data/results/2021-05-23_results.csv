"COVID symptoms, testing, shielding impact on patient reported outcomes and early vaccine responses in individuals with multiple myeloma","Objective: Multiple myeloma (MM)-related morbidity has a profound effect on quality of life (QoL), and immune function, but few studies have prospectively examined the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and attendant vaccination on both immunity and QoL of patients with MM. We aimed to characterise these effects in a prospective cohort study. Design: We initiated a prospective national cohort study of patients with MM from start of the second wave of SARS CoV-2 infections in December 2020 and resultant COVID lockdown in the United Kingdom. We assessed current myeloma status, history of COVID19 symptoms, testing and vaccination including response using the rudystudy.org platform. In addition, healthcare resource use, mental and social well being and loneliness (Lubben scale) from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed. Participants: We report data from the first one hundred and nine adults with MM who completed the questionnaires and the first round of blood testing in the cohort. Results: Five patients (4.5%) had COVID-19 infection confirmed by history and/or testing (Nucleocapsid antibody). Up to 98% of patients shielded completely or partially during both waves of the pandemic, with 18% of patients consequently changing antimyeloma therapy in the shielding period. Using the Lubben scale, 21/99 (21.2 %) reported social isolation. Using HADS scale 23.1% of patients reported symptoms of mild to moderate anxiety or mild to moderate depression during this period. Humoral immune response (spike ab) tested 3 weeks after first vaccination was detected in 17/28 (60%) patients. Conclusion: Myeloma patients shielded during waves of the pandemic with significant change to therapy, low level natural COVID-19 infection (4%) and social isolation. Humoral response following the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine is lower than that reported in non-myeloma cohorts.","Karthik Ramasamy; Ross Sadler; Sally Jeans; Sherin Varghese; Alison Turner; Jemma Larham; Nathanael Gray; Joe Barrett; Stella Bowcock; Gordon Cook; Chara Kyriakou; Dean Smith; Mark Drayson; Supratik Basu; Sally Moore; Sarah McDonald; Sarah Gooding; Muhammad K Javaid","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.20.21257379","20210522","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-23","",13975,""
"Suicide behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic: A meta-analysis of 54 studies","COVID-19, and efforts to mitigate its spread, are creating extensive mental health problems. Experts have speculated the mental, economic, behavioral, and psychosocial problems linked to the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a rise in suicide behavior. However, a quantitative synthesis is needed to reach an overall conclusion regarding the pandemic-suicide link. In the most comprehensive test of the COVID-19-suicidality link to date, we meta-analyzed data from 308,596 participants across 54 studies. Our results suggested increased event rates for suicide ideation (10.81%), suicide attempts (4.68%), and self-harm (9.63%) during the COVID-19 pandemic when considered against event rates from pre-pandemic studies. Moderation analysis indicated younger people, women, and individuals from democratic countries are most susceptible to suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policymakers and helping professionals are advised that suicide behaviors are alarmingly common during the COVID-19 pandemic and vary based upon age, gender, and geopolitics. Strong protections from governments (e.g., implementing best practices in suicide prevention) are urgently needed to reduce suicide behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.","DubÃƒÂ©, Smith, Sherry, Hewitt, Stewart","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113998","20210522","Self-harm; Suicide attempts; Suicide ideation; Suicide prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-23","",13976,""
"Association among income loss, financial strain and depressive symptoms during COVID-19: Evidence from two longitudinal studies","COVID-19 pandemic has major ramifications for global health and economy, with growing concerns about economic recession and implications for mental health. Here we investigated the associations between pandemic-related income loss with financial strain and mental health trajectories over a 1-month course, in two independent cohorts. Two independent studies were conducted in the U.S and in Israel at the beginning of the outbreak (March-April 2020, T1; study I: NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2904, study II: NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1267) and at a 1-month follow-up (T2; study I: NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1318, study II: NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 241). Mixed-effects models were applied to assess associations among COVID-19-related income loss, financial strain, and pandemic-related worries about health, with anxiety and depression, controlling for multiple covariates including pre-COVID-19 income. In both studies, income loss and financial strain were associated with greater depressive symptoms at T1, above and beyond T1 anxiety, worries about health, and pre-COVID-19 income. Worsening of income loss was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in both studies. Worsening of subjective financial strain was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in one study (US). Income loss and financial strain were uniquely associated with depressive symptoms and their exacerbation over time, above and beyond pandemic-related anxiety. In times when a myriad of stressors are affecting mental health worldwide, our findings reveal specific links between the economic impact of COVID-19 and psychiatric outcomes.","Hertz-Palmor, Moore, Gothelf, DiDomenico, Dekel, Greenberg, Brown, Matalon, Visoki, White, Himes, Schwartz-Lifshitz, Gross, Gur, Gur, Pessach, Barzilay","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.04.054","20210522","COVID-19; Depression; Economy; Financial strain; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-23","",13977,""
"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus using an alternative molecular method and evaluation of biochemical, hematological, inflammatory, and oxidative stress in healthcare professionals","In early December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 caused by a new strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), occurred in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. Since then, frontline healthcare professionals have been experiencing extremely stressful situations and damage to their physical and mental health. These adverse conditions cause stress and biochemical, hematological, and inflammatory changes, as well as oxidative damage, and could be potentially detrimental to the health of the individual. The study population consisted of frontline health professionals working in BHU in a city in southern Brazil. Among the 45 participants, two were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and were diagnosed using immunochromatographic tests such as salivary RT-LAMP and qRT-PCR. We also evaluated biochemical, hematological, inflammatory, and oxidative stress markers in the participants. The infected professionals (CoV-2-Prof) showed a significant increase in the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), cholesterol, lactic dehydrogenase, lymphocytes, and monocytes. In this group, the levels of uric acid, triglycerides, leukocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets decreased. In the group of uninfected professionals (NoCoV-2-Prof), significant increase in HDL levels and the percentages of eosinophils and monocytes, was observed. Further, in this group, uric acid, LDH, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels, and the hematocrit count and mean corpuscular volume were significantly reduced. Both groups showed significant inflammatory activity with changes in the levels of C-reactive protein and mucoprotein. The NoCoV-2-Prof group showed significantly elevated plasma cortisol levels. To our kowledge, this study is the first to report the use of the RT-LAMP method with the saliva samples of health professionals, to evalute of SARS-CoV-2.","Trassante, Barboza, Rocha, Correa, Luchese, Wilhelm, Pereira de Pereira, Baldissera, Rech, Giongo, de Almeida Vaucher","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2021.104975","20210522","Health professionals; Inflammation; Oxidative stress; RT-LAMP; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-23","",13978,""
"Preliminary development of the social media disinformation scale (SMDS-12) and its association with social media addiction and mental health: COVID-19 and related information seeking behaviors in Tunisia as a pilot case study","Background: In recent years, online disinformation has increased. Fake news have been spreading about the &quot;Coronavirus disease 2019&quot; (COVID-19) pandemic. Since January 2020, the culprits and antidotes to disinformation have been digital and social media.Aims: Our study aimed to develop and test the psychometric properties of the SMDS-12 measurement scale which assesses the consumption, confidence, and sharing of information related to COVID-19 by social media users.Methods:A total of 874 subjects recruited over two exploratory (Mean age = 28.39, SD = 9.32) and confirmatory (Mean age = 32.84, SD = 12.72)periods, completed thesocial media disinformation scale (SMDS-12),the Internet addiction test (IAT), the COVID-19 fear scale, and the perceived stress questionnaire.The 12-item scale (SMDS-12 ) was initially tested by exploratory factor analysis and subsequently by confirmatory factor analysis..Results: The test supported the three-dimensional structure, in addition, no items were removed from the measurement scale, with three factors explaining up to 73.72% of the total variance, and with items having a lambda factor loading ranging from 0.73 to 0.85. Subsequently, confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the robustness of the measure by referring to a wide range of goodness-of-fit indices that met the recommended standards. The construct validity of the scale has been proved by its convergent and discriminant validity.The reliability of the instrument examined by means of three internal consistency indices and the corrected item-total correlation demonstrated that the three dimensions of the instrument are reliable: Cronbach's ÃŽÂ± indices have values of 0.89, 0.88 and 0.88 for the Consumption, Confidence, and Sharing subscales, respectively.The corrected item-total correlation ranged from 0.70 to 0.78.The correlation between the instrument's dimensions with the internet addiction scale and mental health factors showed positive associations. Conclusion:The scale is eligible for measuring the credibility of disinformation and can be adapted to measure the credibility of social media disinformation in other contexts.","Guelmami, Ben Khalifa, Chalghaf, Kong, Amayra, Wu, Azaiez, Bragazzi","https://doi.org/10.2196/27280","20210522","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-23","",13979,""
"Sustained poor mental health among healthcare workers in COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal analysis of the four-wave panel survey over 8 months in Japan","This study aimed to compare the longitudinal change of the psychological distress of healthcare workers (HCWs) with non-HCWs during the repeated outbreaks of the COVID-19 in Japan. The data were retrieved from the Employee Cohort Study in the Covid-19 pandemic in Japan study. An online survey was conducted on March 2020 (T1), on May 2020 (T2), on August 2020 (T3), and on November 2020 (T4). Psychological distress was measured by the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire. A mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted as an indicator of the group differences. A total sample of analysis was nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 996 (HCWs, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 111; non-HCWs, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 885). HCWs consisted of physicians/nurses/midwives and other HCWs (eg, pharmacists, clinical laboratory technicians) in the clinical settings (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 19; 17% and nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 61; 55%, respectively), and HCWs not working in the clinical settings (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 31; 28%).

"The social impact of COVID-19 as perceived by the employees of a UK mental health service","This study explored the perceptions of NHS employees working within a UK mental health trust in relation to the social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Questioning focussed on social isolation and desire to interact with others before and since COVID-19; effects of safety measures including personal protective equipment and social distancing; and perceived influences of the pandemic on service users and social aspects of service delivery. All employees at an English NHS mental health service were invited to complete an anonymous online questionnaire (July-September 2020), resulting in 464 completed questionnaires. Response frequencies were summed across the total sample, and the influence of patient contact, age, and vulnerability to COVID-19 were explored using pairwise comparisons. Approximately two thirds of employees felt there had been a fundamental change in how they felt about interacting with others, and many had lost confidence in their ability to relate emotionally to others. Respondents were keen to adhere to safety guidance, but the majority believed that face masks and social distancing could have a detrimental effect on communication and rapport within the workplace. Other concerns included passing on the virus, social isolation of employees and service users, and a reduction in community services. COVID-19 safety measures may impact morale, communication, empathy, and the provision of client-centred care. More generally, the pandemic has changed the attitudes of mental health workers towards social interaction, with younger employees reporting more mental health difficulties that may be linked to concerns about longer term social change.","Eddy","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12883","20210522","coronavirus; interpersonal relations; nurse-patient relations; personal protective equipment; physician-patient relations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-23","",13981,""
"Preparedness for viral respiratory infection pandemic in residential aged care facilities: A review of the literature to inform post-COVID-19 response","To examine what was known about disaster preparedness in residential care and to consider this in the light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Care homes provide long-term care to vulnerable, frail older people, as well as to young people with profound disabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the residential care sector has been seriously affected in many parts of the world and has exposed major flaws and vulnerabilities in infection control and other processes that have resulted in considerable loss of life of residents of these facilities. Discursive paper informed by a systematic literature. Review was carried out in line with PRISMA reporting guidelines. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO on 2020 [CRD42020211847]. The review identified six papers meeting inclusion criteria across care residential facilities in different countries. Several prevention and mitigation strategies were identified to manage and reduce the spread and severity of viral respiratory infection pandemics. These strategies include isolation, restriction of movement, personal protective and hygienic measures, health education and information sharing, monitoring and coordination, and screening and treatment. Preparedness strategies identified were contingency planning such as reporting/communication, leadership, human resource, insurance, occupational health and resource availability. The prevention/mitigation and preparedness strategies helped to achieve decline in disease severity, reduced prevalence, reduced spread of the disease, improved readiness criteria, resource usefulness and increased intervention acceptability. This paper presents a conceptual framework exploring the interconnectedness of preparedness and prevention/ mitigation strategies and associated outcomes. We discuss areas of concern in the context of workforce employment patterns in the sector. Concerns related to the unintended consequences of strategies placed on aged care facilities, which may worsen mental health outcomes for residents, are discussed. Persons in residential care settings are at greater risk of infection during a pandemic, and therefore, strict measures to protect their safety are warranted. However, they are also a group who already experience social isolation and so any measures involving restrictions to visiting and social interaction, particularly over the longer term, must be accompanied by strategies to mitigate potential loneliness and mental health sequelae arising from long-term pandemic restrictions. Though there was evidence of activity in preparedness for disasters within the residential care sector, various contextual factors affecting the sector were clearly not adequately considered or addressed in pre-pandemic disaster planning, particularly in the areas of staff movements between care homes and the length of time that social isolation and restriction measures would need to be in place. Future pandemic planning should consider the nature of the workforce model in the care home sector, and factor in strategies to better support the mobile and highly casualised workforce.","Usher, Durkin, Gyamfi, Warsini, Jackson","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15863","20210522","aged care facilities; infection control; literature review; nursing home care; nursing homes; pandemics; residential care; review disaster nursing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-23","",13982,""
"Characteristics of mental health implications and plasma metabolomics in patients recently recovered from COVID-19","This study aimed to explore the associations between cerebral white matter (WM) alterations, mental health status, and metabolism in recovered COVID-19 patients. We included 28 recovered COVID-19 patients and 27 healthy controls between April 2020 and June 2020. Demographic data, the mental health scores, diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) data, and plasma metabolomics were collected and compared between the two groups. Tract-based spatial statistics and graph theory approaches were used for DTI data analysis. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of the plasma was performed. Correlation analyses were performed between these characteristics. Recovered COVID-19 patients showed decreased fractional anisotropy, increased mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity values in widespread brain regions, and significantly lower global efficiency, longer shortest path length, and less nodal local efficiency in superior occipital gyrus (all, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05, Bonferroni corrected). Our results also demonstrated significantly different plasma metabolic profiling in recovered COVID-19 patients even at 3 months after their hospital discharge, which was mainly related to purine pathways, amino acids, lipids, and amine metabolism. Certain regions with cerebral WM alterations in the recovered patients showed significant correlations with different metabolites and the mental health scores. We observed multiple alterations in both WM integrity and plasma metabolomics that may explain the deteriorated mental health of recovered COVID-19 patients. These findings may provide potential biomarkers for the mental health evaluation for the recovered COVID-19 patients and potential targets for novel therapeutics.","Yang, Zhou, Li, Luo, Fan, Xu, Chen, Pan, Lei, Zheng, Jin","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01426-3","20210522","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-23","",13983,""
"Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and information seeking during the Covid-19 pandemic","Increased mental-health symptoms as a reaction to stressful life events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, are common. Critically, successful adaptation helps to reduce such symptoms to baseline, preventing long-term psychiatric disorders. It is thus important to understand whether and which psychiatric symptoms show transient elevations, and which persist long-term and become chronically heightened. At particular risk for the latter trajectory are symptom dimensions directly affected by the pandemic, such as obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. In this longitudinal large-scale study (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°406), we assessed how OC, anxiety and depression symptoms changed throughout the first pandemic wave in a sample of the general UK public. We further examined how these symptoms affected pandemic-related information seeking and adherence to governmental guidelines. We show that scores in all psychiatric domains were initially elevated, but showed distinct longitudinal change patterns. Depression scores decreased, and anxiety plateaued during the first pandemic wave, while OC symptoms further increased, even after the ease of Covid-19 restrictions. These OC symptoms were directly linked to Covid-related information seeking, which gave rise to higher adherence to government guidelines. This increase of OC symptoms in this non-clinical sample shows that the domain is disproportionately affected by the pandemic. We discuss the long-term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on public mental health, which calls for continued close observation of symptom development.","Loosen, Skvortsova, Hauser","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01410-x","20210522","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-23","",13984,""

"Women's postpartum experiences in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study","The mental health of postpartum women has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the experiences that underlie this remain unexplored. The purpose of this study was to examine how people in Canada who gave birth during the pandemic were affected by policies aimed at limiting interpersonal contact to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in hospital and during the early weeks postpartum. We took a social constructionist approach and used a qualitative descriptive methodology. Sampling methods were purposive and involved a mix of convenience and snowball sampling via social media and email. Study inclusion was extended to anyone aged 18 years or more who was located in Canada and was pregnant or had given birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were obtained via semistructured qualitative telephone interviews conducted between June 2020 and January 2021, and were analyzed through thematic analysis. Sixty-five interviews were conducted; data from 57 women who had already delivered were included in our analysis. We identified the following 4 themes: negative postpartum experience in hospital owing to the absence of a support person(s); poor postpartum mental health, especially in women with preexisting mental health conditions and those who had had medically complicated deliveries; asking for help despite public health regulations that prohibited doing so; and problems with breastfeeding owing to limited in-person follow-up care and lack of in-person breastfeeding support. Policies that restrict the presence of support persons in hospital and at home during the postpartum period appear to be causing harm. Measures to mitigate the consequences of these policies could include encouraging pregnant people to plan for additional postpartum support, allowing a support person to remain for the entire hospital stay and offering additional breastfeeding support.","Rice, Williams","https://doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20210008","20210522","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-23","",13986,""
"Addressing the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers: learning from a systematic review of early interventions for frontline responders","Protecting healthcare workers from psychological harm is an urgent clinical issue within the current COVID-19 pandemic. Research on early psychological programmes that aim to prevent or reduce mental health symptoms and that have been tested in frontline responders may assist service providers with choosing a suitable intervention for rapid dissemination in healthcare settings. First, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were searched through a systematic literature review of early psychological interventions administered to frontline responders in the last 15 years. Interventions were included if they were designed to prevent or reduce psychological impact and had outcome measures of psychological distress (eg, general psychopathology, post-traumatic stress disorder and stress) and/or positive mental health domains (eg, resilience, self-efficacy and life satisfaction). Second, the suitability of these programmes for the healthcare workforce was evaluated according to the criteria of effectiveness, content applicability and feasibility. Of 320 articles retrieved, 12 relevant studies were included that described six early psychological interventions. Although the evidence base is limited, psychological first aid, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing, and trauma risk management showed effectiveness across at least two studies each with frontline workers. Resilience and coping for the healthcare community; anticipate, plan, and deter; and resilience at work programmes found promising results in single studies. Concerning other suitability criteria, all programmes appear applicable to healthcare settings and have acceptable feasibility for rapid implementation. Despite the limited evidence, several interventions were identified as potentially suitable and useful for improving psychological functioning of healthcare workers across a variety of disaster situations. Service providers should continue to implement and evaluate early psychological interventions in frontline workers in order to refine best practices for managing the psychological impact of future disasters.","Hooper, Saulsman, Hall, Waters","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044134","20210522","COVID-19; health policy; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-23","",13987,""
"Trends in visits to substance use disorder treatment facilities in 2020","Objective To describe weekly changes in the number of substance use disorder treatment (SUDT) facility visits in 2020 compared to 2019 using cell phone location data. Methods We calculated the percentage weekly change in visits to SUDT facilities from the week of January 5 through the week of October 11, 2020, relative to the week of January 6 through the week of October 13, 2019. We stratified facilities by county COVID-19 incidence per 10,000 residents in each week and by 2018 fatal drug overdose rate. Finally, we conducted a multivariable linear regression analysis examining percent change in visits per week as a function of county-level COVID-19 tercile, a series of calendar month indicators, and the interaction of county-level COVID-19 tercile and month. We repeated the regression analysis replacing COVID-19 tercile with overdose tercile. Results Beginning the eleventh week of 2020, the number of visits to SUDT facilities declined substantially, reaching a nadir of 48% of 2019 visits in early July. In contrast to January, there were significantly fewer visits in 2020 compared to 2019 in all subsequent months (pÂ <Â 0.01 in all months). Multivariable regression results found that facilities in the tercile of counties experiencing the most COVID-19 cases had a significantly greater reduction in the number of SUDT visits in 2020 for the months of June through August than facilities in counties with the fewest COVID-19 rates (pÂ <Â 0.05). The study found no statistically significant difference in the change in the number of visits by facilities in counties with historically different overdose rates. Discussion Our findings support the hypothesis that a reduction has occurred in the average weekly number of visits to SUDT facilities. The size of the effect differs based on the number of COVID-19 cases but not on historical overdose rate.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108462","20210801","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-23","",13988,""
