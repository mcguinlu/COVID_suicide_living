"Single-Molecule Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Plasmonic Sensing of Isothermally Amplified Nucleic Acids","Single-molecule detection of pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 is key to combat infectious diseases outbreak and pandemic. Currently colorimetric sensing with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) provides simple readouts but suffers from intrinsic non-template amplification. Herein, we report that plasmonic sensing of LAMP amplicons via DNA hybridization allows highly specific and single-molecule detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our work has two important advances. First, we develop gold and silver alloy (Au-Ag) nanoshells as plasmonic sensors that have 4-times stronger extinction in the visible wavelengths and give 20-times lower detection limit for oligonucleotides than Au nanoparticles. Second, we demonstrate that the diagnostic method allows cutting the complex LAMP amplicons into short repeats that are amendable for hybridization with oligonucleotide-functionalized nanoshells. This additional sequence identification eliminates the contamination from non-template amplification. The detection method is a simple and single-molecule diagnostic platform for virus testing at its early representation.","Haihang Ye; Chance Nowak; Yaning Liu; Yi Li; Tingting Zhang; Leonidas Bleris; Zhenpeng Qin","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.05.21264561","20211007","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18631,""
"Prenatal maternal distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the infant brain","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused elevated distress in pregnant individuals, which has the potential to impact the developing infant. In this study, we examined anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic in a large sample of pregnant individuals (n=8602). For a sub-sample of participants, their infants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3-months of age to examine whether this prenatal maternal distress was associated with infant brain changes. We found significantly elevated prenatal maternal distress compared to pre-pandemic rates, with 47% and 33% of participants reporting clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Importantly, we identified social support as a protective factor for clinically elevated prenatal maternal distress. We found significant relationships between prenatal maternal distress and infant amygdala-prefrontal microstructural and functional connectivity and demonstrate for the first time that social support moderates this relationship. Our findings suggest a potentially long-lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and show that social support acts as a protective factor not just for pregnant individuals, but also for their developing infants. These findings provide timely evidence to inform clinical practice and policy surrounding the care of pregnant individuals and highlight the importance of social support.","Kathryn Y Manning; Xiangyu Long; Dana Watts; Lianne Tomfohr-Madsen; Gerald F Giesbrecht; Catherine Lebel","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.04.21264536","20211007","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18632,""
"Internalizing Problems Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Dutch Children and Adolescents with and without Pre-Existing Mental Health Problems","The aim of the study was to assess internalizing problems before and during the pandemic with data from Dutch consortium Child and adolescent mental health and wellbeing in times of the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting of two Dutch general population samples (GS) and two clinical samples (CS) referred to youth/psychiatric care. In each sample, measures of internalizing problems were obtained from ongoing data collections pre-pandemic (NGS= 35,357; NCS= 4,487) and twice during the pandemic, in Apr.-May 2020 (NGS= 3,938; clinical: NCS= 1,008) and in Nov.-Dec. 2020 (NGS= 1,489; NCS= 1,536), in children and adolescents (8-18 years) with parent- (Brief Problem Monitor) and/or child reports (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System). Results show significantly greater proportions of worrisome internalizing problems (based on validated cut-offs) and significantly higher internalizing problems mean levels from pre-pandemic to pandemic measurements in the general population. These levels stabilized or decreased over the course of the pandemic. In the clinical sample, we found an increase in child-reported internalizing problems measures over the course of the pandemic, but parents reported no differences in internalizing problems measures over the course of the pandemic, nor from pre-pandemic to during the pandemic. Overall, the findings indicate that children and adolescents of both the general and clinical population were affected negatively by the pandemic in terms of their internalizing problems. Attention is therefore warranted to investigate what long-term effects this may cause and to monitor if internalizing problems return back to pre-pandemic levels or if they remain elevated post-pandemic.","Karen Fischer; Jacintha Tieskens; Michiel Luijten; Josjan Zijlmans; Hedy van Oers; Rowdy de Groot; Daniel van der Doelen; Hanneke van Ewijk; Helen Klip; Rikkert van der Lans; Ronald de Meyer; Malindi van der Mheen; Maud van Muilekom; Hyun Ruisch; Lorynn Teela; Germie van den Berg; Hilgo Bruining; Rachel van der Rijken; Jan Buitelaar; Pieter Hoekstra; Ramon Lindauer; Kim Oostrom; Wouter Staal; Robert Vermeiren; Ronald Cornet; Lotte Haverman; Meike Bartels; Tinca Polderman; Arne Popma","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.05.21264160","20211007","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18633,""
"The consequences of a year of the COVID-19 pandemic for the mental health of young adult twins in England and Wales","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all our lives, not only through the infection itself, but also through the measures taken to control the virus spread (e.g., lockdown). Here we investigated how the COVID-19 pandemic and unprecedented lockdown affected the mental health of young adults in England and Wales. We compared the mental health symptoms of up to 4,000 twins in their mid-twenties in 2018 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (T1) to those in a four-wave longitudinal data collection during the pandemic in April, July, and October 2020, and in March 2021 (T2-T5). The average changes in mental health were small-to-medium and mainly occurred from 2018 (T1) to March 2020 (T2, one month following the start of lockdown; average Cohen d=0.14). Despite the expectation of catastrophic effects on the pandemic on the mental health of our young adults, we did not observe trends in worsening mental health during the pandemic (T3-T5). Young people with pre-existing mental health problems were adversely affected at the beginning of the pandemic, but their increased problems largely subsided as the pandemic persisted. Twin analyses indicated that the aetiology of individual differences did not change during the lockdown. The average heritability of mental health symptoms was 33% across 5 waves of assessment, and the average genetic correlation between T1 and T2-T5 was .95, indicating that genetic effects before the pandemic (T1) are substantially correlated with genetic effects up to a year later (T2-T5). We conclude that on average the mental health of young adults in England and Wales has been remarkably resilient to the effects of the pandemic and associated lockdown.","Kaili Rimfeld; Margherita Malanchini; Ryan Arathimos; Agnieszka Gidziela; Oliver Pain; Andrew McMillan; Rachel Ogden; Louise Webster; Amy E Packer; Nicholas G Shakeshaft; Kerry L Schofield; Jean-Baptiste Pingault; Andrea G Allegrini; Argyris Stringaris; Sophie von Stumm; Cathryn M Lewis; Robert Plomin","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.07.21264655","20211007","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18634,""
"Effect of workplace infection control practices on workers' psychological distress: a large-scale cohort study during the COVID-19 second state of emergency in Japan","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically transformed the work environment and work practices worldwide. Long-term infection control practices may increase the psychological stress on workers, and conversely, inadequate infection control practices at the working place may increase the fear of infection. This study aimed to determine the relationship between infection control practices at the workplace and employee mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Methods: This study was conducted in December 2020 and February 2021. The participants had undergone a preliminary survey, which revealed that they were in good mental health. Their psychological distress was investigated via a second survey, and the factors associated with distress were studied using a logistic model. Results: The results of the second survey indicated that 15.1% of participants demonstrated psychological distress. This was associated with leave-of-absence instructions, instructions for shortening business hours, and requests to avoid the workplace in case of any symptoms. Conclusion: The study found that while some infection control practices reduce workers' distress, others worsen it. Employers need to consider infection control practices as well as the worsening mental health of employees following a decrease in income caused by such measures. Follow-up studies may be necessary to clarify the long-term effects on workers' mental health.","Toyohiko Kodama; Tomohiro Ishimaru; Seiichiro Tateishi; Ayako Hino; Mayumi Tsuji; Akira OGami; Tomohisa Nagata; Shinya Matsuda; Yoshihisa Fujino","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.05.21264597","20211007","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18635,""
"Power, paradox and pessimism: On the unintended consequences of digital health technologies in primary care","We consider what might be learned from the unintended, apparently unanticipated, consequences of the use of digital health (including alternatives to face to face consultations, electronic medical records, use of apps and online monitoring) in primary care. We chose a conceptual literature review method, to seek a higher order understanding of the nuanced patterning of unintended consequences of digital health technologies (for people, relationships, organisations and ways of working) which are rarely simply positive or negative. The approach is informed by realist review, which recognises that experiences and outcomes of interventions work (or fail) in different ways in particular contexts. We present three higher order themes to illuminate underpinning mechanisms for unintended consequences in digital health technologies in primary care. These themes are illustrated by case examples, with particular focus on those that have been little discussed in the literature. Following Merton's (1936) differentiation between consequences for the actor(s) and others, which are mediated through the culture and social structure, we discuss consequences that i) disrupt power relations between patients and health professionals or between different groups of health professions, ii) contribute to paradoxical outcomes and iii) result in a potentially corrosive sub-culture of pessimism about digital health. We conclude that when implementing or evaluating digital technologies in primary care, it is wise to consider the 'dark logic' of the intervention (Bonell et al., 2015). Attention to issues of power relations, the potential for paradoxical outcomes, and impacts on the expectations of staff in relation to digital innovation are particularly salient in relation to the dramatic changes in primary care delivery initiated during the Covid-19 pandemic. Fostering a sense of ownership and interest in monitoring the effects that matter to the organisation will likely help counter pessimism and renew interest in deploying those digital innovations that show promise.","Ziebland, Hyde, Powell","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114419","20211007","Conceptual literature review; Dark logic; Digital health; Primary care; Unintended consequences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18636,""
"Depression and anxiety among individuals with medical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from a nationwide survey in Bangladesh","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disproportionately impacts individuals with medical conditions, including with respect to their mental health. The present study investigated depression and anxiety and their correlates among individuals with medical conditions in Bangladesh. Subjects were recruited to participate in an internet-based survey. Data were collected from November 2020 to January 2021 using convenience sampling by a semi-structured questionnaire through online platforms. Multiple regression analyses were performed to determine associations applying Bonferroni correction (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.004). The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) measured depression and anxiety, respectively. Nine-hundred-and-seventy-one participants (50.1% male; mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 42.29Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 15.86Ã‚Â years; age rangeÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 18-80Ã‚Â years) with medical conditions were included in final analyses. The most frequently reported conditions were diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart disease, asthma, and anemia. Estimates of moderate to severe depression and anxiety were 38.9% and 35.2%, respectively. The mean depression and anxiety scores were significantly higher among participants who reported having hypertension, obesity, heart disease, asthma, anemia, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Using Bonferroni correction (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.004), depression was associated with being female and a student, having poorer quality of life, poorer health status and greater numbers of co-morbidities, not engaging in physical exercise and tobacco smoking. Anxiety was associated with being female and a student, having lower socioeconomic status, poorer quality of life, poorer health status and greater numbers of co-morbidities, less sleep and tobacco smoking. Depression and anxiety are prevalent among individuals with medical conditions and correlate with sociodemographic, quality-of-life and smoking measures. Interventions targeting vulnerable groups should be employed and investigated.","Tasnim, Sujan, Islam, Ferdous, Hasan, Koly, Potenza","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2021.103426","20211007","Addictive behaviors; Anxiety; COVID-19; Co-morbidities; Depression; Psychological conditions; Substance-related disorders; Tobacco use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18637,""
"Stress, anxiety, depression and burnout in frontline healthcare workers during two peaks of COVID-19 pandemic in Russia","In this study we aimed to assess the range of psychopathological symptoms (anxiety, stress, depression, burnout) and risk factors in frontline HCWs during spring and autumn outbreaks of the new coronavirus infection in Russian Federation. We conducted two independent, cross-sectional hospital-based online surveys. Data of 2195 HCWs were collected between May 19th and May 26th 2020 and between October 10th and October 17th 2020. Stress, anxiety, depression, burnout and perceived stress were assessed using the Russian versions of SAVE-9 and GAD-7, PHQ-9, MBI and PSS-10 scales. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the influence of different variables. The study revealed the rates of anxiety, stress, depression, emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and perceived stress as 32.3%, 31.1%, 45.5%, 74.2%, 37.7%,67.8%, respectively. Moreover, 2.4% of HCWs reported suicidal thoughts. The rate of anxiety was higher in October 2020 compared with May 2020. Revealed risk factors included: female gender, younger age, being a physician, working for over a week, living outside of Moscow or Saint Petersburg, being vaccinated against COVID-19. These results demonstrate the need for urgent supportive programs for HCWs fighting COVID-19 that fall into higher risk factors groups and its increasing importance over time.","Mosolova, Sosin, Mosolov","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114226","20211007","Anxiety; Burnout; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare workers; Stress; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18638,""
"Onset and frequency of depression in post-COVID-19 syndrome: A systematic review","Following recovery from COVID-19, an increasing proportion of individuals have reported the persistence and/or new onset of symptoms which collectively have been identified as post-COVID-19 syndrome by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Although depressive symptoms in the acute phase of COVID-19 have been well characterized, the frequency of depression following recovery of the acute phase remains unknown. Herein, we sought to determine the frequency of depressive symptoms and clinically-significant depression more than 12 weeks following SARS-CoV-2 infection. A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid Medline and Google Scholar for studies published between January 1, 2020 and June 5, 2021 was conducted. Frequency and factors associated with depression in post-COVID-19 syndrome were recorded and qualitatively assessed through narrative synthesis. Methodological quality and risk of bias was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for prospective cohort studies. Of 316 articles identified through our systematic search, eight studies were included. The frequency of depressive symptoms +12 weeks following SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 11 to 28%. The frequency of clinically-significant depression and/or severe depressive symptoms ranged from 3 to 12%. The severity of acute COVID-19 was not associated with the frequency of depressive symptoms. However, the component studies were highly heterogeneous with respect to mode of ascertainment, time of assessment, and location and age of patients. The majority of studies did not include an unexposed control group. Future research should endeavour to produce a standardized classification of post-COVID-19 syndrome, and as well as include unexposed control groups.","Renaud-Charest, Lui, Eskander, Ceban, Ho, Di Vincenzo, Rosenblat, Lee, Subramaniapillai, McIntyre","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.09.054","20211007","COVID-19; Depression; Population health; Post-COVID-19 syndrome; Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18639,""
"Depression pandemic and cardiovascular risk in the COVID-19 era and long COVID syndrome: gender makes a difference","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlighted a significant interplay between cardiovascular disease (CVD), COVID-19 related inflammatory status, and depression. Cardiovascular (CV) injury is responsible for a substantial percentage of COVID-19 deaths while COVID-19 social restrictions emerged as a non-negligible risk factor for CVD as well as a variety of mental health issues, and in particular, depression. Inflammation seems to be a shared condition between these two disorders. Gender represents a potential modifying factor both in CVD and depression, as well as in COVID-19 short- and long-term outcomes, particularly in cases involving long-term COVID complications. Results from emerging studies indicate that COVID-19 pandemic affected male and female populations in different ways. Women seem to experience less severe short-term complications but suffer worse long-term COVID complications, including depression, reduced physical activity, and deteriorating lifestyle habits, all of which may impact CV risk. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge about the interplay between COVID-19, depression, and CV risk in women.","Bucciarelli, Nasi, Bianco, Seferovic, Ivkovic, Gallina, Mattioli","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcm.2021.09.009","20211007","COVID-19; Gender medicine; cardiovascular disease; depression; inflammation; long COVID","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18640,""
"Effect of cigarette smoke on the lifetime of electret air filters","The role of air filters is becoming increasingly important due to the threat of air pollution to public health. Understanding the lifetime of air filters is essential for assessing air pollution exposure. However, the effects of common environmental chemicals on filter performance have not been explored. Air filters in ventilation systems and air purifiers are commonly exposed to cigarette smoke aerosols. Moreover, due to the coronavirus pandemic, people are more likely to be in close proximity with smokers while wearing face masks, such that their masks will be exposed to cigarette aerosols. In this study, we applied a stepwise approach to analyze the effects of cigarette smoke on the filtration performance of electret melt-blown filter media that are commonly used to create face masks. We found that cigarette aerosols dramatically reduced filtration efficiency, while standard test particles of a similar loading weight did not affect filtration efficiency. After loading up to 204Ã¢â‚¬Â¯ÃŽÂ¼g/cm<sup>2</sup> of cigarette smoke on 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯cm<sup>2</sup> of electret filter medium, the filtration efficiency of some filters decreased from 92.5% to 33.3% (-ÃŽâ€59.2%). Interestingly, we founded no changes in pressure drop following cigarette smoke exposure despite the reduction in filtration efficiency, suggesting that cigarette smoke aerosols significantly impact the electrostatic charge properties of the filters. Our results indicate that the lifetime of commonly-used air filters may be much shorter than expected and that people may unknowingly be directly exposed to airborne pollutants.","Heo, Lee, Doh, Jung","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150754","20211007","Air filter; Cigarette; Indoor air quality; Lifetime; Smoking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18641,""
"Increasing Acceptability and Outcome Expectancy for Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> e-Health interventions for mental health have the potential to reduce burdens on health care systems, but large survey studies find low acceptability for these interventions. The COVID-19 pandemic may make attitudes toward e-health more malleable.

"National and State Trends in Anxiety and Depression Severity Scores Among Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic - United States, 2020-2021","Recent studies indicate an increase in the percentage of adults who reported clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic (1-3). For example, based on U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey (HPS) data, CDC reported significant increases in symptoms of anxiety and depressive disorders among adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years during August 19, 2020-February 1, 2021, with the largest increases among adults aged 18-29 years and among those with less than a high school education (1). To assess more recent national trends, as well as state-specific trends, CDC used HPS data (4) to assess trends in reported anxiety and depression among U.S. adults in all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) during August 19, 2020-June 7, 2021 (1). Nationally, the average anxiety severity score increased 13% from August 19-31, 2020, to December 9-21, 2020 (average percent change [APC] per survey waveÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.5%) and then decreased 26.8% from December 9-21, 2020, to May 26-June 7, 2021 (APCÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -3.1%). The average depression severity score increased 14.8% from August 19-31, 2020, to December 9-21, 2020 (APCÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.7%) and then decreased 24.8% from December 9-21, 2020, to May 26-June 7, 2021 (APCÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -2.8%). State-specific trends were generally similar to national trends, with both anxiety and depression scores for most states peaking during the December 9-21, 2020, or January 6-18, 2021, survey waves. Across the entire study period, the frequency of anxiety and depression symptoms was positively correlated with the average number of daily COVID-19 cases.

"The O-SEA approach: A model to increase local impact in response to national co-occurring trauma","The presence of the COVID-19 and racism pandemics underscored the need for a basic model of advocacy for psychologists and budding psychologists. We offer a new model of action to be easily replicated, particularly during times of crisis, with aims to impact change locally and beyond the therapeutic space. The D.C. Psychological Association (DCPA) actively responded to the double pandemics of COVID-19. Using a posthoc qualitative analysis four steps were identified: organizing, providing support and education, and engaging in advocacy (O-SEA Approach), which all centered the specific skill set of psychologists and psychologists-in-training. Measures of success included the following: increased membership and engagement of members, development of relevant programming to providers and the community, community attendance of events, statements indicating knowledge gained by providers, new connections with local organizations and officials, and local legislative change. The O-SEA Approach provides a framework for local advocacy that can empower psychologists to contribute their expertise in tangible and impactful ways. This model seeks justice for all people through elevating the voices of the unjustly marginalized, providing support and education to mental health providers and the community, and advocating for policy that is grounded in culturally relevant research. The O-SEA Approach can be successful in these aspirations and be applied in communities across the nation. Clinical Impact Statement: The permanence of racism in the United States is evident throughout history when examining America's social, economic, and political systems. Racism's reverberations are present locally, in the nation's capital, through its policing techniques and gentrification, among other insidious manifestations. COVID-19's global impact has been reported to have particularly deleterious effects on Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) through impacting housing, food, and income security while simultaneously underscoring the lack of access to health resources. This demanded a response by mental health professionals. Consequently, the D.C. Psychological Association made efforts to organize, support, educate, and advocate for the local community through what is called the O-SEA Approach.

"The association of social factors and COVID-19-related resource loss with depression and anxiety among Arabs in Israel","Arabs in Israel have been found to experience higher levels of mental distress compared to Jews due to COVID-19. However, the social mechanisms underlying mental health vulnerability in the context of mass crisis have been understudied. Based on the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, the aim of the current study was to examine experiences of resource loss, social exclusion, ethnic discrimination, and social support and their association with depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak among Arabs in Israel. The sample included 665 adult Arabs in Israel who completed an online self-report questionnaire regarding background variables, resource loss due to COVID-19, social exclusion, ethnic discrimination, social support, and depression and anxiety symptoms. Participants reported on average mild depression and anxiety severity scores, and 15.2% met criteria for major depressive disorder. Many (43.1%) reported experiencing more than 1 loss due to COVID-19 in health, finances or occupation, and interpersonal relationships. Path analyses show that cumulative losses due to COVID-19 and social exclusion were directly associated with depression and anxiety symptom levels. Discrimination moderated the association between losses and both depression and anxiety symptom levels. Mental health is embedded in dynamic sociopolitical contexts. Arabs as a national minority in Israel have a perceived sense of social exclusion and discrimination and social and material resource deprivation, which relates to their vulnerability, especially in the face of crisis. It is our obligation as researchers and practitioners to illuminate the centrality of these oppressive mechanisms in shaping mental health vulnerability. Clinical Impact Statement: The present study suggests that social exclusion and cumulative resource losses due to COVID-19 in areas of health, occupation, finances, and social connections predict depression and anxiety among Arabs in Israel. In addition, ethnic discrimination moderates the relationship between cumulative losses and mental health outcomes. These results highlight the importance of developing and implementing context-informed health and social care policies and practices, especially in this time of crisis.

"The Psychiatric Burden on Medical Students in New York City Entering Clinical Clerkships During the COVID-19 Pandemic","For medical students first entering the clinical space in July 2020, the unique challenges related to the coronavirus pandemic threatened to amplify the psychological distress associated with clerkship rotations. This study aimed to characterize the mental health of third-year medical students starting clinical clerkships in the midst of a pandemic by assessing symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as risk, coping, and protective factors associated with psychological outcomes. Of 147 third-year medical students at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, 110 (75%) participated in this prospective survey-based study with 108 included in the final analysis. 43 (39.8%) respondents screened positive for symptoms of either MDD, GAD, or PTSD. Multiple regression analyses revealed that greater overall symptom severity was associated with more avoidant coping, more traumatic events witnessed, poorer student and leisure functioning, lower trait emotional stability, and lower social support. Worries related to COVID-19 did not significantly influence outcome variables. To better understand the role of the pandemic on psychological outcomes in third-year medical students, additional research should focus on the trajectory of these outcomes over the year during the coronavirus pandemic.","Saali, Stanislawski, Kumar, Chan, Hurtado, Pietrzak, Charney, Ripp, Katz","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-021-09955-2","20211007","Anxiety; Coronavirus; Depression; Medical education; Psychological resilience; Ptsd","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18647,""

"Virtual Education Program to Support Providers Caring for People With Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Rapid Development and Evaluation Study","People with intellectual and developmental disabilities are at increased health-related risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual training programs that support providers in caring for the physical and mental health needs of this population, as well provide psychological support to the providers themselves, are needed during the pandemic. This paper describes the design, delivery, and evaluation of a virtual educational COVID-19-focused Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes program to support providers during the COVID-19 pandemic in caring for the mental health of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. A rapid design thinking approach was used to develop a 6-session program that incorporates mindfulness practice, a wellness check, COVID-19-related research and policy updates, a didactic presentation on a combination mental health and COVID-19 related topic, and a case-based discussion to encourage practical learning. We used the first 5 outcome levels of Moore's evaluation framework-focusing on participation, satisfaction, learning, self-efficacy, and change in practice-which were rated (out of 5) by care providers from health and disability service sectors, as well as additional reflection measures about innovations to the program. Qualitative feedback from open-text responses from participants were analyzed using modified manifest content analysis. A total of 104 care providers from health and disability service sectors participated in the program. High levels of engagement (81 participants per session on average) and satisfaction (overall satisfaction score: mean 4.31, SD 0.17) were observed. Self-efficacy (score improvement: 19.8%), support, and coping improved. Participants also rated the newly developed COVID-19 program and its innovative components highly. Open text feedback showed participants felt that the Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes program expanded their knowledge and competency and created a sense of being part of a community of practice; provided value for the COVID-19 innovations; supported resource-sharing within and beyond program participants; and facilitated changes to participants' approaches to client care in practice and increased participants' confidence in supporting clients and families. The Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes program is an effective model for capacity-building programs with a shared-learning approach. Future iterations should include targeted evaluation of long-term outcomes such as staff burnout.","Thakur, Pereira, Hardy, Bobbette, Sockalingam, Lunsky","https://doi.org/10.2196/28933","20211007","COVID-19; ECHO, virtual; capacity-building; community of practice; coronavirus; intellectual disability; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18649,""
"Food Insecurity, Well-being, and Academic Success among College Students: Implications for Post COVID-19 Pandemic Programming","College students experience food insecurity at higher rates than the general population, which has been found to be directly and indirectly associated with poor mental and physical health in addition to academic success. Since the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, mounting evidence has demonstrated an increase in food insecurity rates in the U.S. The current study assessed food insecurity and its associated impacts on health and academic success among college students at a large urban university (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1743). Results revealed 46.8% of students as food insecure with statistically significant differences in race/ethnicity, GPA, and hours worked per week. Students who were observed with any level of food insecurity were more likely to also experience challenges with academics, careers, procrastination, and faculty as compared to their food secure counterparts. Analysis of differences in well-being indicators by food insecurity status revealed that students with any level of food insecurity were observed with statistically significantly higher mean scores for psychological distress, loneliness, and suicide behavior, with reduced scores for flourishing and resiliency as compared to their food secure counterparts. Implications for post-COVID-19 programming to mitigate food insecurity and associated public health issues associated with the COVID-19 and future pandemics are discussed.","DeBate, Himmelgreen, Gupton, Heuer","https://doi.org/10.1080/03670244.2021.1954511","20211007","COVID-19; college students; food insecurity; student success; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18650,""

"""We All Held Our Own"": Job Demands and Resources at Individual, Leader, Group, and Organizational Levels During COVID-19 Outbreak in Health Care A Multi-Source Qualitative Study","Interventions tackling COVID-19 impact on health care workers' mental health would benefit from being informed by validated and integrated assessment frameworks. This study aimed to explore the fitness of integrating the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model and the Individual-Group-Leader-Organization (IGLO) framework to investigate the pandemic's impact on health care workers' mental health. Qualitative data were collected via 21 semi-structured interviews with senior and middle managers and four focus groups with employees (doctors, nurses, health care assistants) from three areas (Department of Emergency, Department of Medicine, Research Institute of Neuroscience) of a large health care institution facing the first wave of COVID-19. NVivo deductive content analysis of text data was performed. Several COVID-19-related job demands and resources were found at IGLO levels. Individual-level demands included emotional load, while resources included resilience and motivation. Group-level demands included social distancing, while resources included team support and cohesion. Leader-level demands included managers' workload, while resources included leader support. Organizational-level demands included work reorganization, while resources included mental health initiatives. Integrating JD-R and IGLO proved feasible, as job demands and resources could be categorized according to the individual, group, leader, and organization framework. The findings expand previous studies by filling the lack of knowledge on how job demands and resources might unfold at different workplace levels during a pandemic. Results provide unit-level evidence for designing and implementing multilevel interventions to manage health care workers' mental health during COVID-19 and future pandemics.

"Telehealth genetic services during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implementation and patient experiences across multiple specialties in Nebraska","The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the delivery of genetics services. In response to the pandemic, our genetics department offered telehealth visits to all outpatients, regardless of their physical proximity to Omaha, Nebraska. Traditionally, our department did not offer telehealth visits to patient's homes or to patients who lived in close proximity to a genetics clinic. Therefore, we designed a survey to gain insight into the patient experience with remote genetic counseling appointments during the pandemic. Any patient referred to see a genetics provider in pediatrics, prenatal, adult, or cancer between March 16, 2020 and October 28, 2020 was eligible for the study. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative measures to assess patient demographics, patient experience, stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic, and anxiety and depression. We hypothesized that patients would report they received quality care by telehealth despite the presence of COVID-19-related stressors or anxiety/depression. From the 143 survey participants, 80% had their first telehealth appointment during the pandemic. The vast majority (96%) reported that they felt like they received quality care by telehealth. Additionally, more than 93% of participants strongly or somewhat agreed that their genetic providers were attentive to their emotional needs, medical needs, and privacy. Since March 2020, participants reported experiencing several COVID-19-related stressors including fear of illness (86%), feelings of isolation (45%), and safety concerns (33%). Relatively low levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms were recorded using the HADS questionnaire. Despite the prevalence of COVID-19 stressors, depression, and/or anxiety, our participants felt they received quality care via telehealth. In fact, 51% agree that they prefer to receive future genetics services virtually. These results suggest the value of telehealth as an alternative service delivery model, even for local patients, and should be offered for future appointments, beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rezich, Malone, Reiser, Zimmerman, Blase, Fishler","https://doi.org/10.1002/jgc4.1507","20211007","COVID-19; genetic counseling; genetics services; program evaluation; public health; service delivery models; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18653,""
"Anxiety and psychosocial impact during coronavirus disease 2019 in home dialysis patients","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) resulting in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is documented to have a negative psychosocial impact on patients. Home dialysis patients may be at risk of additional isolating factors affecting their mental health. The aim of this study is to describe levels of anxiety and quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic among home dialysis patients. This is a single-centre survey of home dialysis patients in Toronto, Ontario. Surveys were sent to 98 home haemodialysis and 43 peritoneal dialysis patients. Validated instruments (Haemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 Item [GAD7] Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], Illness Intrusiveness Ratings Scale, Family APGAR Questionnaire and The Self Perceived Burden Scale) assessing well-being were used.

"Association between COVID-19 and anxiety during social isolation: A systematic review","The uncertainties about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the change in routine, lifestyles and the reduction of physical contact can cause stress, anxiety, emotional overload, poor sleep and even physical health complications. To evaluate the scientific publications available on the relationship between COVID-19 and anxiety experienced in the general population, during the period of social isolation, adopted by governmental organizations and public health policymakers as a measure to contain the spread of cases. A literature search was performed systematically exploring the PubMed and Medline databases using the following terms classified as MeSH descriptors: (""anxiety"" AND ""pandemic"" AND ""COVID-19""). For the search, in the <i>Biblioteca Virtual em SaÃƒÂºde</i> - BVS, Science.gov, Web of Science and National Library platforms, the following keywords were used: (""anxiety"" AND ""coronavirus"" AND ""social isolation""). Thirty-seven peer-reviewed articles were found. PRISMA and the Downs &amp; Black checklist were used for qualitative evaluation. After applying the inclusion criteria, seven (<i>n</i> = 7) original scientific articles were selected. The collated evidence demonstrated increased levels of symptoms of anxiety and depression during the period of social isolation. The population between 21 to 40 years was most affected. The risk of severe depression was twice as high at the epicenter of the pandemic. Sleep quality was significantly impaired. Questions about politics, religion, and consumption of products from China were found to generate fear and anticipate probable changes in the pattern of post-pandemic consumption. Social isolation exacerbated feelings of extreme hopelessness, sadness, loneliness and suicidal ideation. We conclude that there is a potential relationship between social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and symptoms of anxiety. It is important to note that the direct and indirect costs of not identifying the detrimental effects of this phenomenon and neglecting strategies for intervention could lead to a significant psychological burden on society in several aspects after social isolation.","Dos Santos, Silva de Paula, Tardieux, Costa-E-Silva, Lal, Leite","https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i25.7433","20211007","Anxiety; COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Public health; Social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18655,""

"Brief Report: A Cross-Sectional Study of Anxiety Levels and Concerns of Chinese Families of Children With Special Educational Needs and Disabilities Post-first-wave of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has a multifaceted impact on mental health due to ill health, restrictions and lockdowns, and loss of employment and institutional support. COVID-19 may disproportionally impact families with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) due to the already higher prevalence of mental health conditions in children with SEND and their parents. Therefore, it is essential to determine the short-term impact of the pandemic on the mental health of families with SEND in order to identify their ongoing health support needs. The current study aims to examine the anxiety level and concerns of children with SEND and their parents living in China. The sample consisted of 271 parents of children with SEND aged between 6 and 17 years (<i>M</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> = 8.37; <i>SD</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> = 2.76). Parents completed an online survey between 10 April to 8 June 2020. Both child and parental anxiety levels and various concerns increased after the initial wave of COVID-19 when compared with retrospective pre-COVID-19 levels. Parental anxiety and concern levels were significantly higher for those living in rural areas compared to urban areas. In addition, parental and child anxiety and concern levels were significantly correlated with each other. Parental anxiety at the lowest level made a unique and significant statistical contribution to children's anxiety levels.

"Suicidality in Bangladeshi Young Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Behavioral Factors, COVID-19 Risk and Fear, and Mental Health Problems","It is said that psychological stressors have risen during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may contribute to suicidality. A fewÃ‚Â studies were conducted investigating suicidality amid the first wave of the pandemic in Bangladesh, but none of these studies explored the predictive role of the suicidality-related factors (eg, behavior and health-related variables, COVID-19 risk, fear of COVID-19). Thus, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of suicidality and the predictive models explaining suicidality variance among Bangladeshi young adults during the second wave of the pandemic. An online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted during the second wave of the pandemic (between 1 and 13 April 2021; a year after the pandemic's inception in the country). The survey questionnaire collected information on socio-demographics, behavior and health-related variables, COVID-19 risk, fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, and suicidality. A total of 756 data were analyzed (male 59%; mean age 22.24 Ã‚Â±4.39 years), and hierarchical regression was performed considering suicidality as the dependent variable. A <i>p</i>-value &lt;0.05 was set to be statistically significant with a 95%Ã‚Â of confidence interval. About 8.2% reported having at least suicidal thoughts within the pandemic inception to survey time (one-year suicidal ideation). More specifically, 7.40% had only suicidal ideation, whereas 0.10% planned for suicide, 0.70% attempted suicide. None of the socio-demographic variables was significantly associated with suicidality. Taking drugs, performing less physical activity, poor self-reporting health condition, being comorbid, being at higher COVID-19 risk, having fear of COVID-19 infection, and suffering from depression and anxiety were significantly associated with a higher risk of suicidality. However, the final model including all of the studied variables explained a 17.1% (F=8.245, <i>p</i>&lt;0.001) variance in terms of suicidality. Although this study reported a lower severity of suicidality than prior Bangladeshi studies conducted during the first wave of the pandemic, a portion of people are still at risk of suicide and they should be given attention.","Mamun, Al Mamun, Hosen, Hasan, Rahman, Jubayar, Maliha, Abdullah, Sarker, Kabir, Jyoti, Kaggwa, Sikder","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S330282","20211007","Bangladeshi youths; COVID-19 suicide; depression; fear of COVID-19; psychological impact; self-harm; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18659,""

"Resilience, coping, and distress among healthcare service personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has a detrimental effect on the health and well-being of health care workers (HCWs). The extent to which HCWs may differ in their experience of depression and anxiety is unclear, and longitudinal studies are lacking. The present study examined theorized differences in distress between resilient and non-resilient HCWs over time, as reported in a national online survey. We also examined possible differences in distress as a function of sex and doctoral-level status. A national sample responded to an online survey data that included the study measures. Of the HCWs who responded, 666 had useable data at the two time points. A longitudinal structural equation model tested an a priori model that specified the relationship of a resilient personality prototype to self-reported resilience, coping, depression and anxiety at both measurement occasions. Additional invariance models examined possible differences by sex and doctoral-level status. The final model explained 46.4% of the variance in psychological distress at Time 1 and 69.1% at Time 2. A non-resilient personality prototype predicted greater depression and anxiety. A resilient personality prototype was predictive of and operated through self-reported resilience and less disengaged coping to effect lower distress. No effects were found for active coping, however. The final model was generallyÃ‚Â invariant by sex and HCWs status. Additional analyses revealed that non-doctoral level HCWs had significantly higher depression and anxiety than doctoral-level HCWs on both occasions. HCWs differ in their susceptibility to distress imposed by COVID-19. Those who are particularly vulnerable may have characteristics that contribute to a lower sense of confidence and efficacy in stressful situations, and more likely to rely on ineffective, disengaged coping behaviors that can exacerbate stress levels. Individual interventions and institutional policies may be implemented to support HCWs at risk.","Elliott, Perrin, Bell, Powers, Warren","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03506-6","20211007","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coping; Depression; Healthcare workers; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18661,""
"Metaphoric Perceptions of Covid-19 Patients Related to the Disease","This study aimed to explore metaphoric perceptions of patients with COVID-19 including treatment process, family relationships, and mental health via using metaphors. Purposive sampling was used to include participants. Totally 46 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. The metaphor-based data collection process was carried out with three open-ended questions. The metaphors compiled according to questions and grouped by 13 themes according to analysis. Patients explained to COVID-19 process by using 91 different metaphors. Most frequently used metaphors by patients; black hole/dark for the treatment process of COVID-19, steel for family relationships, sea metaphor for mental health. This study, it was determined that individuals are afraid of death, have a serious perception of uncertainty, and their family relationships and this process negatively affected their family relationships and mental states. Nurses have important responsibilities to increase the quality of patient care.","Cakmak, Calik, Inkaya","https://doi.org/10.1177/10547738211048312","20211007","COVID-19; family; mental health; metaphor; nursing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-08","",18662,""
"The COVID-19 Study of Healthcare and Support Personnel (CHAMPS): Protocol for a Longitudinal Observational Study","Early in the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was evident that health care workers, first responders, and other essential workers would face significant stress and workplace demands related to equipment shortages and rapidly growing infections in the general population. Although the effects of other sources of stress on health have been documented, the effects of these unique conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the long-term health and well-being of the health care workforce are not known. The COVID-19 Study of Healthcare and Support Personnel (CHAMPS) was designed to document early and longitudinal effects of the pandemic on the mental and physical health of essential workers engaged in health care. We will investigate mediators and moderators of these effects and evaluate the influence of exposure to stress, including morbidity and mortality, over time. We will also examine the effect of protective factors and resilience on health outcomes. The study cohort is a convenience sample recruited nationally through communities, professional organizations, networks, social media, and snowball sampling. Recruitment took place for 13 months to obtain an estimated sample of 2762 adults who provided self-reported information administered on the web through structured questionnaires about their work environment, mental and physical health, and psychosocial factors. Follow-up questionnaires will be administered after 6 months and annually thereafter to ascertain changes in health, well-being, and lifestyle. Participants who consented to be recontacted form the longitudinal cohort and the CHAMPS Registry may be contacted to ascertain their interest in ancillary studies for which they may be eligible. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and launched in May 2020, with grants from Travere Therapeutics Inc, McKesson Corporation, anonymous donors, and internal funding from the M. Louise Fitzpatrick College of Nursing at Villanova University. Recruitment ended in June 2021 after enrolling 2762 participants, 1534 of whom agreed to participate in the longitudinal study and the registry as well as to be contacted about eligibility for future studies. The CHAMPS Study and Registry will enable the acquisition of detailed data on the effects of extended psychosocial and workplace stress on morbidity and mortality and serve as a platform for ancillary studies related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
