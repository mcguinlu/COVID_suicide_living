"A state level analyses of suicide and the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico","While suicide rates in high- and middle-income countries appeared stable in the early stages of the pandemic, we know little about within-country variations. We sought to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on suicide in Mexico's 32 states and to identify factors that may have contributed to observed variations between states. Interrupted time-series analysis to model the trend in monthly suicides before COVID-19 (from Jan 1, 2010, to March 31, 2020), comparing the expected number of suicides derived from the model with the observed number for the remainder of the year (April 1 to December 31, 2020) for each of Mexico's 32 states. Next, we modeled state-level trends using linear regression to study likely contributing factors at ecological level. Suicide increased slightlyÃ‚Â across Mexico during the first nine months of the pandemic (RR 1.03; 95%CI 1.01-1.05). Suicides remained stable in 19 states, increase in seven states (RR range: 1.12-2.04) and a decrease in six states (RR range: 0.46-0.88). Suicide RR at the state level was positively associated with population density in 2020 and state level suicide death rate in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic had a differential effect on suicide death within the 32 states of Mexico. Higher population density and higher suicide rates in 2019 were associated with increased suicide. As the country struggles to cope with the ongoing pandemic, efforts to improve access to primary care and mental health care services (including suicide crisis intervention services) in these settings should be given priority.","Borges, Garcia, Pirkis, Spittal, Gunnell, Sinyor, John","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04095-8","20220709","COVID-19; Epidemiology; Mexico; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-11","",34012,""
"Evaluating a Telehealth Single-Session Consultation Service for Clients on Psychotherapy Wait-Lists","Outpatient mental health clinics across the country are struggling to meet acute demand for mental health services, resulting in months-long waitlists for people seeking care. Providing evidence-based, single session interventions to treatment-seeking individuals while they are waiting for treatment may help address this crisis. One such intervention, the Single-Session Consultation (SSC), was found to be an effective, acceptable, and feasible low-intensity treatment option when delivered in person. The current study evaluates the telehealth delivered SSC during the COVID-19 pandemic to individuals waiting to access mental health care. Of the 147 people offered an SSC, 95 (64.63%) accepted the invitation, 74 (77.89%) scheduled with a clinician, and 65 (87.84%) attended the session, surpassing feasibility benchmarks. Participants saw pre-to-post intervention improvements in hopelessness (dz = .91, p < .001) and readiness for change (dz = -0.49, p < .001). At 2-weeks follow-up, anxiety symptoms reduced significantly (dz = .40, p = .04) but depression symptoms did not decrease significantly (dz = .21). Participants rated telehealth-SSC sessions as highly acceptable and developed a close therapeutic alliance (M = 6.13, SD = 0.76). The telehealth-SSC was acceptable, feasible, and effective in the short-term, suggesting its utility as a low-intensity, scalable interventions for people on waiting lists for outpatient mental health care.","Jenna Sung et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00CB-960-786","20220710","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; access to care; telehealth; single session interventions; low intensity interventions; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-11","",34013,""
"Teacher Morale and Mental Health Following the COVID-19 Pandemic","As teachers entered the 2021-2022 school year, schools tasked teachers with the challenge of closing the learning loss gap, maintaining the same standards as a typical school year, implementing COVID-19 safety protocols, and teaching to grade-level grades standards. The current study used the theoretical framework of teacher demoralization to explore teacher morale and mental health at the end of the 2021-2022 school year. The sample included 830 PK-12 individual teachers from across the United States. Analysis used Pearsonâ€™s correlations and the hierarchical multiple regression model to determine predictor variables. The results found significant predictors for both teacher morale and mental health. Implications focus on steps school leaders can take to support teacher well-being.","Tim Pressley et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0040-4DE-8B6","20220711","SocArXiv|Education|Educational Administration and Supervision; SocArXiv|Education|Elementary Education; SocArXiv|Education|Educational Leadership; SocArXiv|Education; SocArXiv|Education|Educational Administration and Supervision|Elementary and Middle and Secondary Education Administration; SocArXiv|Education|Secondary Education; SocArXiv|Education|Educational Psychology; teacher morale; teacher well-being; pandemic; covid-19; teacher mental health","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-11","",34014,""
