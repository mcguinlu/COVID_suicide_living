"Suicide rates in Ecuador: A nationwide study from 2011 until 2020","Suicide, suicide ideations, and psychiatric disorder rates tend to increase after natural disasters such as earthquake. In 2016 Ecuador experienced a 7.8Mw earthquake and, more recently, the Covid-19 confinement. Both events may have negatively affected the mental health of the Ecuadorian population. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the suicide rates and choice of suicide method in the Ecuadorian population between January 2011 and December 2020. The dataset used is publicly available on the Ecuadorian National Institute of Statistics and Censuses. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) for potential sociodemographic factors associated with each suicide method compared to other reported suicide methods. There were 10,380 registered cases of suicide in Ecuador between 2011 and 2020. Significant suicide rates per provinces were seen in Napo with 12.63 and Azuay with 12.52, followed by BolÃƒÂ­var with 12.30, and Orellana with 11.36 suicides/100,000 habitants. Hanging accounted for 7082 cases (68.2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%). The mestizos (82Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%) were the most prevalent ethnicity of all suicide cases. School-age children with 6-12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years (OR 8.83, 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI 5.34-14.59) and adolescents with 13-19Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years (OR 1.46, 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI 1.29-1.66) were more likely to use hanging as method of suicide. In conclusion, we observed an increase of suicide rates from 8.15 per 100,000 in 2011 to 8.81 in 2020. The confinement of COVID-19 pandemic in the period evaluated did not significantly affect the suicide rates. An increased suicide rate was observed in the province hardest hit by the 2016 earthquake.","Lapo-Talledo, Talledo-Delgado, Portalanza, Rodrigues, Siteneski","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.09.167","20221008","COVID-19; Earthquake; Ecuador; Hanging; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-09","",38852,""
"Mood and activity changes during the COVID-19 pandemic in rural and urban Veterans and their cohabitants","We aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic-related stay-at-home orders on weekly reports of mood and activity before and during COVID-19 in a sample of older Veterans and their cohabitants. Urban and rural Veterans and their cohabitants living in the Pacific Northwest Ã¢â€°Â¥62Ã‚Â years old were enrolled as part of the Collaborative Aging Research Using Technology initiative (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 100, ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 71.2Ã‚Â Ã‚Â± 6.5, 41% women). Participants reported frequency of social activities (e.g., travel away), physical illness, and mood (blue mood and loneliness) via weekly online health forms. A total of 2,441 weekly online health forms (OHFs) were collected from 100 participants. During the COVID-19 pandemic, blue mood (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.4, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .0001) and loneliness (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7.2, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .0001) were significantly higher than before the pandemic, and travel away from home was significantly lower (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.5, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .0001). Prevalence of blue mood and loneliness were not associated with rurality. The current study established that blue mood and loneliness were significantly more prevalent in older Veterans following COVID-19 stay-at-home orders regardless of rurality. The COVID-19 pandemic associated health precautions, while necessary to curb acute health risks, have created a unique situation that places vulnerable populations at increased risk of low mood.","Lennon, Hantke, Mattek, Wu, Dodge, Wall, Beattie, Kaye, Silbert","https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2022.2130123","20221008","COVID-19; Depression; military personnel; remote monitoring; rural; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-09","",38853,""
"Relationship between children with neurodevelopmental disorders and their caregivers and friends during early phase of COVID-19 school closure in Japan: Association with difficulty in implementing infection prevention measures","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic people had to implement various infection prevention measures. Researchers have reported the difficulties experienced by children with neurodevelopmental disorders in implementing these measures and their caregivers' resultant anxiety and stress. This study examined the relationship between these difficulties and the deterioration of the children's relationships with their caregivers and friends during school closure and after school reopened. A total of 150 caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders answered a questionnaire asking about parentÃ¢â‚¬â€™child relationships, their child's friendships, and the presence or absence of difficulty in implementing infection prevention measures at three time points: before the pandemic, while schools were closed, and after school reopened. The frequency and percentages of the child's behavioral problems, deterioration in their relationships, and difficulty implementing infection control measures were calculated. Using the relationship deterioration scores, independent and multiple regression analyses were performed for the presence or absence of difficulty implementing infection control measures, presence or absence of caregivers' mental health concerns, and the presence or absence of deterioration of one or more problematic behaviors. Overall, 84.1% of the children displayed difficulties implementing infection prevention measures. No relationship was observed between difficulty with infection prevention measures and deterioration in their relationships with parents and friends when schools were closed. After school reopened, however, deterioration in parentÃ¢â‚¬â€™child relationships correlated positively with difficulty in hand-washing, and deterioration of friendships correlated positively with the maintenance of social distancing and difficulty in hand-washing. Deterioration of friendships correlated negatively with difficulty in voluntarily complying with stay-at-home requests. Difficulty in implementing infection prevention measures was related to deterioration in social relationships with parents and friends of children with neurodevelopmental disorders during the school reopening period, following COVID-19 school closure in Japan. Under a condition requiring heightened infection control, close monitoring may be necessary for the social relationships in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.","Yamamoto, Tanaka, Yoshizaki, Yoshimura, Fauzi, Syarinaz, Adlan, Jayanath, Hamzah, Fujino, Tachibana","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-022-00513-7","20221007","Children with neurodevelopmental disorders; Infection prevention measures; Relationship deterioration; School reopening","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-09","",38854,""
"Contribution of perceived loneliness to suicidal thoughts among French university students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Restrictive measures during the COVID-19 epidemic have led to increased levels of loneliness, especially among university students, although the influence on suicidal thoughts remains unclear. In this cross-sectional study of 1913 French university students, those with the highest level of loneliness had a fourfold increased risk of suicidal thoughts. Perceived loneliness should be incorporated into suicide risk assessment, and assistance in coping with loneliness should be considered as a means of reducing suicidal risk in vulnerable groups, like university students.","Macalli, Kinouani, Texier, SchÃƒÂ¼ck, Tzourio","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-21288-z","20221007","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-09","",38855,""
