"Health care worker burnout after the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Japan","To determine the prevalence of burnout according to job category after the first wave of COVID-19 in Japan and to explore its association with certain factors. An online cross-sectional survey of health care workers (HCWs) from June 15 to July 6, 2020, was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Tokyo, Japan. Demographic characteristics, results of the Japanese version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey, types of anxiety and stress, changes in life and work after the peak of the pandemic, and types of support aimed at reducing the physical or mental burden, were determined. Of 672 HCWs, 149 (22.6%) met the overall burnout criteria. Burnout was more prevalent in women (OR, 3.11; 95% CI, 1.45-6.67, P = .003), anxiety due to unfamiliarity with personal protective equipment (PPE) (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.20-3.27, P = .007), and decreased sleep duration (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.20-3.20, P = .008). Conversely, participants who felt that the delivery of COVID-19-related information (OR, .608; 95% CI, .371-.996, P = .048) and PPE education opportunities (OR, .484; 95% CI, .236-.993, P = .048) and messages of encouragement at the workplace (OR, .584; 95% CI, .352-.969; p = .037) was helpful experienced less burnout. There is a need to focus on the above factors to maintain the mental health of HCWs. The delivery of COVID-19-related information and educational interventions for PPE and messages of encouragement at the workplace may be needed to reduce the mental burden.","Matsuo, Taki, Kobayashi, Jinta, Suzuki, Ayabe, Sakamoto, Kitaoka, Uehara, Mori, Fukui","https://doi.org/10.1002/1348-9585.12247","20210810","COVID-19; Maslach burnout inventory; burnout","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-11","",16989,""
"Rates of assessment of social media use in the psychiatric Interview, prior to and during COVID-19: A needs assessment survey","Current research suggests that there is a nuanced relationship between mental well-being and social media. Social media offers opportunities for empowerment, information and connection while also showing links to depression, high risk behavior and harassment. As this medium rapidly integrates into interpersonal interactions, incorporation of social media assessment into the psychiatric evaluation warrants attention. Furthermore, The COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures (i.e., social distancing) led to increased dependence on social media, allowing an opportunity to assess adaptation of the psychiatric interview in response to socio-cultural changes. The first aim of this study was to evaluate if general psychiatry residents and child and adolescent psychiatry fellows assessed social media use as part of the clinical interview. Second, the study examined whether changes were made to the social media assessment in response to known increase of social media use secondary to social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of a quality improvement project, the authors surveyed general psychiatry residents and child psychiatry fellows in a university-based training program about their assessment of social media use in patient evaluations (n = 21). Soon after the survey closed, ""stay at home"" orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic began. A subsequent survey was sent out with the same questions to evaluate if residents and fellows altered their interview practices in response to the dramatic socio-cultural changes (n =20). Pre-COVID-19 pandemic survey results found that 10% (2/21) of respondents incorporated social media questions in patient evaluations. In a follow-up survey after the onset of the pandemic, 20% (4/20) of respondents included any assessment of social media use. Among the 15 participants who completed both surveys, there was a non-significant increase in likelihood of asking about social media use (13% vs. 27%, for pre- and during-COVID-19, respectively, McNemar's Ã¯ÂÂ£2 [1] = 0.25, p = .617, Cohen's d = 0.33). These small survey results raise important questions relevant to the training of residents and fellows in psychiatry. Findings suggest that the assessment of social media use is a neglected component of the psychiatric interview in trainees. The burgeoning use and diversity of social media engagement warrants scrutiny with respect to how this is addressed in interview training. Additionally, given minimal adaptation of the interview in the midst of a pandemic, these findings imply an opportunity for improving psychiatric training that incorporates adapting clinical interviews to socio-cultural change.","Raphaely, Goldberg, Moreno, Stowe","https://doi.org/10.2196/28495","20210810","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-11","",16990,""
"Distress in the time of COVID-19: Understanding the distinction between COVID-19 specific mental distress and depression among United States adults","During the COVID-19 pandemic, many Americans have experienced mental distress, which may be partially characterized by a rise in mental illnesses. However, COVID-19 specific psychological distress may also be separate from diagnosable conditions, a distinction that has not been well established in the context of the pandemic. Data came from an online survey of US adults collected in March 2020. We used factor analysis to assess the relationship between COVID-19 related mental distress and depressive symptoms. Using four questions on psychological distress modified for COVID-19 and eight depressive symptoms, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to identify the factor structure and then estimated a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The EFA model indicated a two-factor solution, where the COVID-19 distress items loaded onto the first factor and depression items loaded onto the second. Only two items cross-loaded between factors: feeling fearful and being bothered by things that do not usually bother the participant. The CFA indicated that this factor structure fit the data adequately (RMSEA=0.106, SRMR=0.046, CFI=0.915, TLI=0.890). It is possible that there are additional important symptoms of COVID-19 distress that were not included. Depression symptoms were measured via the CES-D-10, which while validated is not equivalent to a clinician diagnosis. As COVID-19 related mental distress appears to be distinct from, though related to, depression, public health responses must consider what aspects of depression treatment may apply to this phenomenon. For COVID-related distress, it may be more appropriate to treat symptomatically and with supportive psychotherapy.","Schneider, Dayton, Wilson, Nestadt, Latkin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.07.095","20210810","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-11","",16991,""
"Factors related to perceived stress during the COVID-19 epidemic context among the general population in China: A cross-sectional nationwide study","This study aimed to investigate factors related to high stress levels among the general population in China during the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic when its containment measures were in place and to identify the most stressed populations. A nationwide study was conducted online among 5,039 adults in all 31 provinces in mainland China between March 1 and March 16, 2020. Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to explore the related factors of high perceived stress. Among all respondents, 36.0% reported a high level of stress. Respondents in Hubei province (the epicenter) were more likely to report high stress levels than those in low epidemic areas. Respondents who went outside every day or every other day reported greater odds of experiencing a high level of stress than those who went outside every 8-14 days. People with higher risk perceptions were more prone to report high stress levels. Respondents aged 16-35 were more likely to report high stress than respondents aged 46 or older. Lower household income and lower health literacy were related to increased odds of reporting high stress levels. We used a convenience sample and self-reported survey data. We identified risk factors for high stress levels related to the epidemic (epidemic intensity in residential areas, risk perception, and frequency of going outside) and other vulnerabilities (younger age, low household income, low health literacy). Our findings can directly inform interventions and policies for mitigating stress among the general populationÃ‚Â for this or future epidemics.","Xu, Wang, Xuan, Lin, Sun, Zhou, Jiang, Han, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.07.097","20210810","COVID-19; China; General population; Mental health; Risk factors; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-11","",16992,""
"Longitudinal associations between internalizing symptoms, social behavior, and social perceptions in the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from a transdiagnostic community sample","Burgeoning evidence suggests that loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic is tied to high levels of depression and anxiety. The current study is unique, though, in examining which facets of social behavior and perceived social quality are most tied to internalizing symptoms using longitudinal data, including a pre-pandemic baseline, collected from a community sample of adults with pre-existing mental health concerns (analyzed nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 144). Participants completed measures of depressive and anxious symptoms pre-pandemic, followed by three weekly surveys during the pandemic. We distinguished four social variables: in-person social engagement, remote social engagement, social disruption, and social distress. OLS and mixed-effects regression models examined 1) pre-pandemic baseline symptoms as predictors of social functioning during the pandemic and 2) time-lagged associations between symptoms and social functioning during the pandemic. Social behavior and social perceptions were dissociable. Baseline depressive, but not anxious, symptoms predicted greater social distress during the pandemic. Both anxious and depressive symptoms were predicted by social variables, but the specific associations differed: depressive symptoms were related to perceived social quality, whereas anxious symptoms were more tied to reported social behavior. We relied on self-report indices, and causality should not be inferred directly from these correlational data. Overall, our results indicate that it is possible to follow social guidelines and even to spend relatively few hours socializing with close others, while still feeling connected and rewarded; however, people who struggle with depression and anhedonia were particularly vulnerable to distressing feelings of social disconnection amid the pandemic.","Swerdlow, Johnson, Timpano, Porter, Dev","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.07.093","20210810","COVID-19; Internalizing symptoms; Social functioning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-11","",16993,""

"Perceived COVID-19-associated discrimination, mental health and professional-turnover intention among frontline clinical nurses: The mediating role of resilience","COVID-19-associated discrimination (CAD) is an important issue that may adversely affect frontline nurses' work effectiveness and well-being. This study examined the relationships between frontline nurses' perceptions of COVID-19-associated discrimination and their resilience, mental health, and professional-turnover intention. This cross-sectional descriptive study involved 259 frontline nurses in the Central Philippines and used four online self-report measures. The results revealed that frontline nurses perceived a moderate level of COVID-19-associated discrimination. Frontline nurses who perceived a higher level of discrimination during the coronavirus pandemic reported poorer mental health and higher professional-turnover intention. Resilience acted as a mediator and reduced the effects of COVID-19-associated discrimination on nurses' mental health and their professional-turnover intention. Proactive measures to reduce the negative consequences of discrimination during the pandemic, and efforts to foster resilience in nurses who are in the forefront of the fight against the highly transmissible virus, should be given high priority by hospital and nursing administrators to better support nurses' mental health and foster retention.","Labrague, De Los Santos, Fronda","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12920","20210810","COVID-19; discrimination; mental health; nursing; resilience; turnover intention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-11","",16995,""
"Risk Factors for Death Among Hospitalized Patients Aged 21-64 Years Diagnosed with COVID-19-New York City, March 13-April 9, 2020","COVID-19 mortality studies have primarily focused on persons aged Ã¢â€°Â¥ 65 years; less is known about decedents aged &lt;65 years. We conducted a case-control study among NYC residents aged 21-64 years hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosed March 13-April 9, 2020, to determine risk factors for death. Case-patients (n=343) were hospitalized decedents with COVID-19 and control-patients (n=686) were discharged from hospitalization with COVID-19 and matched 2:1 to case-patients on age and residential neighborhood. Conditional logistic regression models were adjusted for patient sex, insurance status, and marital status. Matched adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated for selected underlying conditions, combinations of conditions, and race/ethnic group. Median age of both case-patients and control-patients was 56 years (range: 23-64 years). Having Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1 selected underlying condition increased odds of death 4.45-fold (95% CI: 2.33-8.49). Patients with diabetes; morbid obesity; heart, kidney, or lung disease; cancer; neurologic/neurodevelopmental conditions; mental health conditions; or HIV had significantly increased odds of death. Compared with having neither condition, having both diabetes and obesity or diabetes and heart disease was associated with approximately threefold odds of death. Five select underlying conditions were more prevalent among non-Hispanic Black control-patients than among control-patients of other races/ethnicities. Selected underlying conditions were risk factors for death, and most prevalent among racial/ethnic minorities. Social services; health care resources, including vaccination; and tailored public health messaging are important for COVID-19 prevention.

"Colorectal Cancer Care and Patients' Perceptions Before and During COVID-19: Implications for Subsequent SARS-CoV-2 Infection Waves","Changes in colorectal cancer (CRC) care planning because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and well-being of patients with CRC are unknown. We report changes in CRC care and patient-reported outcomes including HRQoL, distress, and loneliness during the first wave of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In April 2020, 4984 patients included in the nationwide Prospective Dutch Colorectal Cancer cohort were invited to complete a COVID-19-specific questionnaire, together with the validated European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30), De Jong Gierveld, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Clinical data were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Scores were compared with the year prior to COVID-19 and with an age- and sex-matched control population during COVID-19. In total, 3247 (65.1%) patients responded between April and June 2020. Of the patients, 17% had canceled, postponed, or changed hospital visits to a telephone or video consult, and 5.3% had adjusted, postponed, or canceled treatment. Compared with controls, patients reported worse HRQoL but comparable distress and less social loneliness (patients = 21.2%; controls = 32.9%). Compared with pre-COVID-19, clinically meaningful deterioration of HRQoL was more prevalent in patients with changes in cancer care planning than in patients without changes. Prior to undergoing or currently undergoing treatment and infection worries were associated with lower HRQoL. CRC patients reported equal anxiety and depression but worse HRQoL than the control population. Changes in care planning were associated with deterioration of HRQoL and increased anxiety. In case of 1 or more risk factors, health-care specialists should discuss (mental) health status and possible support during future SARS-CoV-2 infection waves or comparable pandemics.","Derksen, May, van de Poll-Franse, de Rooij, Hafkenscheid, Verkooijen, Koopman, Vink","https://doi.org/10.1093/jncics/pkab047","20210810","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-11","",16997,""
"Feature Augmented Hybrid CNN for Stress Recognition Using Wrist-based Photoplethysmography Sensor","Stress is a physiological state that hampers mental health and has serious consequences to physical health. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress levels among people across the globe. Therefore, continuous monitoring and detection of stress are necessary. The recent advances in wearable devices have allowed the monitoring of several physiological signals related to stress. Among them, wrist-worn wearable devices like smartwatches are most popular due to their convenient usage. And the photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is the most prevalent sensor in almost all consumer-grade wrist-worn smartwatches. Therefore, this paper focuses on using a wrist-based PPG sensor that collects Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals to detect stress which may be applicable for consumer-grade wristwatches. Moreover, state-of-the-art works have used either classical machine learning algorithms to detect stress using hand-crafted features or have used deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which automatically extracts features. This paper proposes a novel hybrid CNN (H-CNN) classifier that uses both the hand-crafted features and the automatically extracted features by CNN to detect stress using the BVP signal. Evaluation on the benchmark WESAD dataset shows that, for 3-class classification (Baseline vs. Stress vs. Amusement), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 5% and 7% accuracy, and 10% and 7% macro F1 score, respectively. Also for 2-class classification (Stress vs. Non-stress), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 3% and ~5% accuracy, and ~3% and ~7% macro F1 score, respectively.","Rashid, Chen, Dautta, Jimenez, Tseng, Faruque","https://www.google.com/search?q=Feature+Augmented+Hybrid+CNN+for+Stress+Recognition+Using+Wrist-based+Photoplethysmography+Sensor.","20210810","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-11","",16998,""
"The Psychosocial Burden on Liver Transplant Recipients during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Due to the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, multiple measures have been implemented including social distancing and curfews. Both the disease and measures might cause stress, particularly in persons at risk, such as liver transplant (LT) recipients. Here, we evaluated the impact on psychosocial well-being of LT recipients. Seventy-nine LT recipients and 83 nontransplanted controls participated in this study. Questionnaires comprising the WHO-five well-being index (WHO-5), the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale, and the preliminary COVID-19 Pandemic Mental Health Questionnaire (CoPaQ) were distributed among them. For the WHO-5 and UCLA Loneliness Scale, means of sum scores were compared between both groups, while a comparison on item level was conducted for the CoPaQ. The general well-being was similar in LT recipients and controls (WHO-5: 64.0 Ã‚Â± 20.5% vs. 66.4 Ã‚Â± 17.3%), while the UCLA Loneliness Scale indicated a higher level of perceived social isolation (1.90 Ã‚Â± 0.51 vs. 1.65 Ã‚Â± 0.53, <i>p</i> = 0.001). The CoPaQ indicated higher risk perception regarding health issues, in particular concerning the fear of having severe consequences in case of a COVID-19 infection (3.1 Ã‚Â± 1.1 vs. 2.2 Ã‚Â± 1.3, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), higher risk-avoiding behavior and stronger adherence to pandemic measures in LT recipients.

"Effect of Using Personal Protective Equipment during the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Quality Indicators of Screening Colonoscopies","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected many facets of the practice of medicine including screening colonoscopies. Our study looks to observe if there has been an effect on the quality of colonoscopies, as indicated by quality measures such as the cecal intubation rate (CIR), cecal intubation time (CIT), scope withdrawal time (SWT), and adenoma detection rate (ADR) with the adoption of standard COVID-19 precautions. We conducted a retrospective chart review to analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on screening colonoscopies. The study utilized data on CIR, CIT, SWT, and ADR from outpatient, nonemergent procedures conducted at 3 endoscopy suites of St. Luke's University Health Network. All inpatient and emergent procedures were excluded. Our study demonstrated that the total number of screening colonoscopies was decreased between 2019 and 2020 (318 in 2019 vs. 157 in 2020, <i>p</i> = 0.005). CIT (320 Ã‚Â± 105 seconds in 2019 vs. 392 Ã‚Â± 107 seconds in 2020, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and SWT (706 Ã‚Â± 232 seconds in 2019 vs. 830 Ã‚Â± 241 seconds in 2020, <i>p</i> = 0.001) were increased while CIR (98.2% in 2019 vs. 96.6% in 2020, <i>p</i> = 0.04) was decreased between 2019 and 2020 likely due to PPE introduction. ADR was similar between the two groups (38.23 (12.50-66.66) in 2019 vs. 38.18 (16.66-66.00) in 2020, <i>p</i> = 0.8). Our study showed that quality indices for screening colonoscopies like CIR, CIT, and SWT were negatively impacted during the COVID-19 time period. ADR, however, was similar.

AmeriSpeak is a probability-based panel designed to be representative of households in the USA. Prevalence of probable generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) using the GAD-7 and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) using the four-item PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) checklist. Both outcomes were stratified by demographics and COVID-19-related stressors. The majority of participants were female (51.8%), non-Hispanic white (62.9%) and reported a household saving of $5000 or more. Those between 18 and 29 years old were the largest age group (38.1%) compared with 40-59 years (32.0%) and 60 years or more (29.9%). The prevalence of probable GAD was 10.9% (95% CI 9.1% to 13.2%) and the prevalence of PTSS was 21.7% (95% CI 19.1% to 24.6%). Among participants reporting five or more COVID-19-related stressors, the prevalence of probable GAD was 20.5% (95% CI 16.1% to 25.8%) and the prevalence of PTSS was 35.7% (95% CI 30.2% to 41.6%). Experiencing five or more COVID-19-related stressors was a predictor of both probable GAD (OR=4.5, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 2.3 to 8.8) and PTSS (OR=3.3, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 2.1 to 5.1). The prevalence of probable anxiety disorders in the USA, as the COVID-19 pandemic and policies implemented to tackle it unfolded, is higher than estimates reported prior to the pandemic and estimates reported following other mass traumatic events. Exposure to COVID-19-related stressors is associated with higher prevalence of both probable GAD and PTSS, highlighting the role these stressors play in increasing the risk of developing anxiety disorders in the USA. Mitigation and recovery policies should take into account the mental health toll the pandemic had on the USA population.","Abdalla, Ettman, Cohen, Galea","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044125","20210810","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-11","",17002,""

Twenty-one peer researchers collected narratives from members of ethnocultural communities and self-interpreted them as they entered the narratives into the SenseMaker platform, a mixed-method data collection tool. The entire research team analyzed real-time, aggregate, quantitative and qualitative data to identify emerging thematic domains, then visualized these domains with social network analysis. Brokers serving diverse communities collected 773 narratives. Identified domains illuminate the evolving and entangled impacts of COVID-19 including the following: COVID-19 prevention and management; care of acute, chronic and serious illnesses other than COVID-19; maternal care; mental health and triggers of past trauma; financial insecurity; impact on children and youth and seniors; and legal concerns. We identified that community social capital and cultural brokering are key assets that facilitate access to formal health and social system supports. The Illuminate Project has illustrated the entangled, systemic issues that result in poor health among vulnerable members of ethnocultural communities, and the exacerbating effects of COVID-19, which also increased barriers to mitigation. Cultural brokering and community social capital are key supports for people during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings can inform policy to reduce harm and support community resiliency.","Campbell-Scherer, Chiu, Ofosu, Luig, Hunter, Jabbour, Farooq, Mahdi, Gayawira, Awasis, Olokude, Goa, Syed, Sillito, Yip, Belle, Akot, Nutter, Farhat, Wang, Jalal, Khalif, Chapagain, Fernandez, Azarcon, Hama","https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.210131","20210810","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-11","",17003,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on healthcare delivery for people who use opioids: a scoping review","The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare delivery worldwide with likely negative effects on people who use opioids (PWUO). This scoping review of the original research literature describes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery for PWUO and identifies gaps in the literature. This scoping review of the original research literature maps the available knowledge regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery for PWUO. We utilized the methodology developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute for scoping reviews, and content analyses methodology to characterize the current state of the literature. Of the 14 included studies, administrative database (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°11), cross-sectional (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1) or qualitative (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2) studies demonstrated service gaps (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7), patient/provider experiences (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3), and patient outcomes for PWUO (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4). In March 2020, healthcare utilization dropped quickly, sharply increasing only for reasons of opioid overdose by May 2020. Service gaps existed in accessing treatment for new patients during the pandemic due to capacity and infrastructure limits. Physicians reported difficulty referring patients to begin an outpatient opioid treatment program due to increased restrictions in capacity and infrastructure. Patients also reported uncertainty about accessing outpatient treatment, but that telehealth initiation of buprenorphine increased access to treatment from home. Disproportionate increases in overdose rates among African Americans were reported in two studies, with differences by race and gender not examined in most studies. Fatal overdoses increased 60% in African Americans during the pandemic, while fatal overdoses in Non-Hispanic White individuals decreased. In summary, this beginning evidence demonstrates that despite early reluctance to use the healthcare system, opioid overdose-related use of healthcare increased throughout the pandemic. Service delivery for medications to treat OUD remained at or above pre-pandemic levels, indicating the ability of telehealth to meet demand. Yet, racial disparities that existed pre-pandemic for PWUO are intensifying, and targeted intervention for high-risk groups is warranted to prevent further mortality. As the pandemic progresses, future research must focus on identifying and supporting subgroups of PWUO who are at heightened risk for experiencing negative outcomes and lack of access to care.","Alexander, Pogorzelska-Maziarz, Gerolamo, Hassen, Kelly, Rising","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13011-021-00395-6","20210810","Healthcare delivery; Opioid use; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-11","",17004,""
"Increased occurrence of PTSD symptoms in adolescents with major depressive disorder soon after the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a cross-sectional survey","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to threaten the physical and mental health of people across the world. This study aimed to understand the psychological impact of this disease on adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) at 1 month after the start of the outbreak in China. Using the Children's Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-13) questionnaire, we investigated the occurrence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in two groups of adolescents: MDD patients who were in continuous antidepressant therapy and healthy controls. Total scores and factor subscores were compared between the two groups and subgroups stratified by sex and school grade. Logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with high total CRIES-13 scores. Compared to controls (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°107), the MDD group (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°90) had higher total CRIES-13 scores and a higher proportion with a total scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°30. They also had a lower intrusion subscore and a higher arousal subscore. In the MDD group, males and females did not differ significantly in total CRIES-13 scores or factor subscores, but junior high school students had higher avoidance subscores than senior high school students. Logistic regression showed high total CRIES-13 scores to be associated with MDD and the experience of ""flashbacks"" or avoidance of traumatic memories associated with COVID-19. It is crucial to understand the psychological impact of COVID-19 on adolescents with MDD in China, especially females and junior high school students. Long-term monitoring of adolescents with a history of mental illness is required to further understand these impacts.

"Federated Semi-Supervised Multi-Task Learning to Detect COVID-19 and Lungs Segmentation Marking Using Chest Radiography Images and Raspberry Pi Devices: An Internet of Medical Things Application","Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) provides an excellent opportunity to investigate better automatic medical decision support tools with the effective integration of various medical equipment and associated data. This study explores two such medical decision-making tasks, namely COVID-19 detection and lung area segmentation detection, using chest radiography images. We also explore different cutting-edge machine learning techniques, such as federated learning, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning to explore the issue. To analyze the applicability of computationally less capable edge devices in the IoMT system, we report the results using Raspberry Pi devices as accuracy, precision, recall, Fscore for COVID-19 detection, and average dice score for lung segmentation detection tasks. We also publish the results obtained through server-centric simulation for comparison. The results show that Raspberry Pi-centric devices provide better performance in lung segmentation detection, and server-centric experiments provide better results in COVID-19 detection. We also discuss the IoMT application-centric settings, utilizing medical data and decision support systems, and posit that such a system could benefit all the stakeholders in the IoMT domain.","Alam, Rahmani","https://doi.org/10.3390/s21155025","20210810","federated learning; internet of medical things; multi-task learning; semi-supervised machine learning; transfer learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-11","",17006,""
"The Impact of a Culinary Coaching Telemedicine Program on Home Cooking and Emotional Well-Being during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus pandemic enforced social restrictions with abrupt impacts on mental health and changes to health behaviors. From a randomized clinical trial, we assessed the impact of culinary education on home cooking practices, coping strategies and resiliency during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March/April 2020). Participants (<i>n</i> = 28) were aged 25-70 years with a BMI of 27.5-35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The intervention consisted of 12 weekly 30-min one-on-one telemedicine culinary coaching sessions. Coping strategies were assessed through the Brief Coping with Problems Experienced Inventory, and resiliency using the Brief Resilient Coping Scale. Home cooking practices were assessed through qualitative analysis. The average use of self-care as a coping strategy by the intervention group was 6.14 (1.66), compared to the control with 4.64 (1.69); <i>p</i> = 0.03. While more intervention participants had high (<i>n</i> = 5) and medium (<i>n</i> = 8) resiliency compared to controls (<i>n</i> = 4, <i>n</i> = 6, respectively), this difference was not significant (<i>p</i> = 0.33). Intervention participants reported using home cooking skills such as meal planning and time saving techniques during the pandemic. The key findings were that culinary coaching via telemedicine may be an effective intervention for teaching home cooking skills and promoting the use of self-care as a coping strategy during times of stress, including the COVID-19 pandemic.","Silver, Finkelstein, Minezaki, Parks, Budd, Tello, Paganoni, Tirosh, Polak","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13072311","20210810","COVID-19; coronavirus; culinary coaching; culinary medicine; pandemic; rehabilitation; telehealth; telemedicine; virtual visit","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-11","",17007,""
