"Global burden of mental health problems among children and adolescents during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic umbrella review","Mental health problems among children and adolescents are increasingly reported amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. In this umbrella review, we aimed to synthesize global evidence on the epidemiologic burden and correlates of child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) problems during this pandemic from existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We evaluated 422 citations and identified 17 eligible reviews on the epidemiology of CAMH in the context of COVID-19. Most of the reviews reported a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, suicidal behavior, stress-related disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and other mental health problems. Also, factors associated with CAMH such as age, gender, place of residence, educational attainment, household income, sedentary lifestyle, social media and internet use, comorbidities, family relationships, parents' psychosocial conditions, COVID-19 related experiences, closure of schools, online learning, and social support were reported across reviews. As most studies were cross-sectional and used nonrepresentative samples, future research on representative samples adopting longitudinal and intervention designs is needed. Lastly, multipronged psychosocial care services, policies, and programs are needed to alleviate the burden of CAMH problems during and after this pandemic.","Md Mahbub Hossain; Fazilatun Nesa; Jyoti Das; Roaa Aggad; Samia Tasnim; Mohan Bairwa; Ping Ma; Gilbert Ramirez","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.22.22274169","20220426","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30579,""
"Media portrayal of mental health at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic games","Introduction: The media coverage of high-profile sporting events can bring increased pressure to athletes' psychological wellbeing. There may be speculation regarding athletes' mental state before, during and after competition potentially impacting on both the athlete's wellbeing and public perception of the individual if a negative tone is attached to an article. As mental health understanding and literacy develop, media reporting of elite athlete mental health may contribute to shaping of opinions and help seeking behaviour. Thus, we have aimed to understand and analyse the tone and content of media reporting on a high-profile sporting event using qualitative methods to explore key aspects of the articles sampled. Methods: We selected two UK broadsheet newspapers available online (The Guardian and The Telegraph) and identified all text articles including the terms ""Mental Health"" and ""Olympics"" or ""Paralympics"" published between 23rd July 2019 and 30th November 2021. We selected articles relevant to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games and including mental health as a subject. Relevant articles were read in full, and we conducted a thematic analysis to explore how mental health was portrayed. Results: 581 results were generated from our initial search. Following screening and removal of irrelevant articles, we had 95 articles for analysis. We identified four themes relating to portrayal of mental health: Pressure, impact of COVID, Lack of specific diagnostic terms, and athletes as humans. Conclusion: Media portrayal of mental health at the Tokyo Games was generally positive and portrayed athletes as relatable, inspiring, and ""human"" rather than superhuman. Reporting particularly focused on athlete-specific factors in mental health conditions and the pressures of high-level competition.

"Coping strategies as moderators of COVID-19 racial discrimination in Filipino Americans","The present study examined the extent to which coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) racial discrimination related to life satisfaction, depression, and anxiety in 246 Filipino Americans. The extent to which coping strategy moderated the mediated relationship of COVID-19 racial discrimination via depression and anxiety on life satisfaction was also explored. Findings indicated that Filipino Americans who experienced or witnessed COVID-19 racial discrimination were significantly more likely to experience decreased levels of life satisfaction and increased levels of depression and anxiety. Higher levels of discrimination were significantly related to higher levels of depression which were linked to poorer life satisfaction. Coping strategy moderated the mediated relationship of COVID-19 racial discrimination via depression with life satisfaction. Engagement and disengagement coping responses significantly moderated the link between COVID-19 discrimination with anxiety and depression, respectively. Implications for mental health professionals, study limitations, and future areas of research are additionally provided.

"Anti-Asian Microaggressions in the Time of COVID-19: Impact on Coping, Stress, and Well-Being","What is the public significance of this article? East Asian Americans confronted with anti-Asian microaggressions during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic who engaged with the aggressor had more stress, but better mental health outcomes compared to participants who ignored microaggressions. An unanticipated outcome of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been increased Sinophobia directed toward Asian Americans. The present study used a mixed-methods design and investigated how 345 East Asian Americans responded to COVID-19-related microaggressions and how their responses affected stress and well-being. The qualitative data included 196 narratives describing anti-Asian microaggressions experienced by participants during COVID-19. Four themes emerged from narratives including nonverbal rejection responses, verbal rejection, physical assault, and exposure to aggression on the social media. Additionally, quantitative data collected participants' responses to scales measuring microaggressions, personal resilience, social support, coping strategies (engagement and disengagement coping), stress, and psychological well-being. Path analysis showed that participants who reported more microaggressions experienced significantly more stress. Participants with more social support had better psychological well-being. Those with stronger personal resilience were more likely to use engagement coping. Even though engagement coping was associated with more stress, confronting aggressors was also associated with better psychological well-being compared to ignoring the threat (disengagement coping). Implications of these findings are discussed.","Yan, X. D.; Zhu, Y.; Hussain, S.

"Black lives matter, Black stories matter, Black voices matter: Black lives matter protests, COVID-19, and streaming services","Previous research has demonstrated a number of potential benefits from attending peaceful protests, including low levels of depression and a perceived sense of community among protesters. Over the summer of 2020, the nation erupted with Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests following the highly publicized murders of George Floyd and other unarmed Black individuals at the hands of police. Although these protests could have served as a cathartic outlet for those outraged by police brutality and racial injustice, the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic forced many people to stay home. Because participating in online forms of activism is becoming increasingly common, and turning to media is a common response when faced with trauma and threats to belonging, the current research examined streaming behavior as activism. Participants (n = 128) completed an online survey assessing their desire and ability to protest, streaming habits, belonging, and depressive symptoms. It was found that viewing BLM media was negatively associated with belonging and positively associated with desire to protest and depressive symptoms. It was also found that participants higher in desire to protest consumed more BLM titles, and people higher in ability to protest consumed fewer BLM titles. These findings could have implications for media's role in social justice and collective action. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement During periods of racial turmoil, people with a high desire to protest are likely to turn to forms of online activism, such as viewing antiracist media. Viewing this media is associated with low levels of belonging but high levels of depressive symptoms. This demonstrates the importance of developing and promoting diverse media.

"Guest editorial","The need for age-tailored, holistic and integrated support for older adults with dual diagnosis In our second Older Adultsâ€™ Themed Issue of Advances in Dual Diagnosis, we present the yearâ€™s progression in our understanding of co-occurring substance use and mental health problems/cognitive impairment in older people and how these can be best addressed in practice. Since our first annual themed issue last year, we have seen the topic of dual diagnosis in older people come ever more to the forefront. Older populations were already hit by the highest rates of alcohol-related harm of all age groups (NHS Digital, 2020);with rates higher still amongst those with co-occurring mental health problems, where alcohol-related death rates are 2.5 times higher than for those without dual diagnosis (Reininghaus et al., 2015). Whilst such exclusion from services is common across the patient population with co-occurring alcohol and mental health problems, older people with dual diagnosis face additional, age-related barriers.","Bareham, Beth, Rahul, Rao","https://doi.org/10.1108/ADD-05-2022-047","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Advances in Dual Diagnosis; 15(2):69-72, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30587,""
"Mental health of business academics within the COVID-19 era: can meaningful work help? AÂ qualitative study","Purpose&gt;Through addressing academics in four public business schools in Egypt, the authors of this paper aim to uncover how meaningful work might shape the mental health of the addressed academics post COVID-19.Design/methodology/approach&gt;The author employed a qualitative research method through semi-structured interviews with 44 academics from four business schools selected from among 25 public institutions of higher education in Egypt. The author subsequently used thematic analysis to determine the main ideas in the transcripts.Findings&gt;The authorsâ€™ findings show that business academics usually consider meaningful work as playing a major role in shaping their mental health, especially after a crisis. This indicates that the more they perceive their jobs as valuable and worthwhile, the more they can deal with limitations and mental health issues (e.g. anxiety, stress, inadequate sleep, etc.) that accompany crisis. The findings also show that during the time of the COVID-19 crisis, employees (business academics in this case) have not placed so much importance to their autonomy (ability to choose and/or participate in decision-making processes) in the workplace. Instead, they care more about their relatedness (sense of belongingness) and their level of competence (sense of capability). Accordingly, the authors show that having academics that develop a sense of purpose for their academic duties in a time of crisis has less mental health disorders. Subsequently, post crisis, business academics can feel a continuous sense of relatedness and find ongoing opportunities to work and learn.Originality/value&gt;This paper contributes by filling a gap in HR management, in which empirical studies on the relationship between mental health and meaningful work have been limited so far.","Mousa, Mohamed, Samara, Georges","https://doi.org/10.1108/ER-04-2021-0170","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Employee Relations; 44(4):764-784, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30588,""
"Psychological impact of domestic violence on women in India due to COVID-19","Purpose The COVID-19 outbreak has significant psychological effects because of reduced support system and social quarantine, making women the worst-hit population of shadow pandemic, i.e. domestic violence. While food shortages, unemployment and increased domestic-work burdens are the immediate effects of the lockdown, women at home have to bear its far-reaching impacts in the long term in the form of domestic abuse, making the study of the psychological impact of domestic violence against women imperative. This paper aims to identify the factors and causes responsible for domestic violence and its psychological impacts on women in different aspects. This paper further focuses on the reasons behind an escalation in psychological violence against women. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on extrapolating data from various journal articles, Indian Government reports, newspaper articles and other printed materials that are recent, relevant and discuss domestic violence and mental stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers use Indian National Commission for Women's (NCW) data on complaints received regarding violence against women and domestic abuse in the year 2020 and 15 journal articles that discuss domestic violence against women during the COVID-19 period in different countries to discuss social inequalities and power relations impact on women' mental health. Findings The findings suggest that economic instability during the pandemic and social and cultural norms of India ignited psychological abuse against women during the pandemic. The number of monthly complaints of dowry death, dowry harassment and protection of women against domestic violence reflect on increased registered complaints in the postlockdown period in the year 2020. The number of monthly complaints received by the NCW from January 2020 to December 2020 in India represents that WhatsApp chat is a powerful tool for reporting domestic violence. Originality/value The pandemic lockdown has an adverse psychological impact on women, making them suffer from posttraumatic symptoms, substance abuse, panic attacks, depressions, hallucinations, eating disorders, self-harm, etc. This paper strives to reflect upon mitigation strategies to curb domestic violence in India.","Tripathi, P.; Dwivedi, P.

"Social isolation and loneliness in older immigrants during COVID-19: a scoping review","Purpose The stay-at-home orders were necessary to contain the spread of COVID-19 but have worsened social isolation and loneliness among older persons. Strategies to maintain social connections have been proposed. It is unclear if the reported experiences of social isolation and loneliness are comparable for older immigrants and if the proposed strategies are relevant to this vulnerable population. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap. Design/methodology/approach This scoping review addressed two questions: What evidence exists on the experience of social isolation and loneliness in older immigrants? What strategies can be beneficial to keep older immigrants socially connected during the COVID-19 pandemic? The search for relevant articles was done in several databases covering the scientific and gray literature, using keywords that reflect the diversity of terminology referring to the main concepts (isolation and loneliness) and target population (older immigrants). Discussion papers and research studies were reviewed, and the main points or findings were documented on data ion forms and summarized in a table. The information in the table was compared and contrasted to identify common themes. Findings Only six articles (four discussion papers and two studies) met the scoping review's eligibility criteria. Concerns about interruptions of older immigrants' social connection during the pandemic were partially corroborated with the studies' results. Most participants shifted the medium of their contacts from in-person to telephone or social media, and perceived no change in the experience of loneliness. Those with high levels of loneliness reported heightened anxiety and depression. The proposed strategies entailed the use of technology to connect with others and to deliver services, outdoor group activities within the constraints of containment measures and provision of culturally tailored social programs or services. Research limitations/implications The acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategies should be examined to determine the best practices aimed to promote social connection among older immigrants within and outside the context of the pandemic. Originality/value The scoping review identified strategies that can be used to address social isolation and loneliness among older immigrants during the pandemic.","Sidani, S.; Northwood, M.; Sethi, B.; Zhuang, Z.

"The risk of risk management: adopting critical theories to explore clinical risk concerns in mental health care","Purpose&gt;The purpose of this paper is to outline several critical risk theories and explore their application to risk concerns in mental health care. This will contribute to the on-going debate about risk management practices and the impact these might have on recovery and social inclusion. Notably, while risks like suicide can be therapeutically addressed, risk management may involve paternalistic practices that exclude the participation needed for recovery.Design/methodology/approach&gt;A viewpoint of key risk theories will be presented to provide a critical eye about some clinical risk concerns in mental health care. Implications for recovery and social inclusion will then be discussed alongside direction for practice and research.Findings&gt;Clinical concerns seemed to involve difficulties with uncertainty, holding onto expertise, and the othering of patients through risk. These concerns suggest the patient voice might become lost, particularly within the backdrop of clinical fears about blame. Alternatively, a relational approach to risk management could have merit, while patient expertise may develop understanding in how to improve risk management practices.Originality/value&gt;Clinical concerns appear more than managing potential harms;it can involve appraising behaviours around societal norms, explaining to an extent why mental illness might be addressed in terms of risks. While the points raised in the paper support existing findings about risk management, the underlying reasons drawing on the critical risk theories are less explored.","Deering, Kris, Williams, Jo, Williams, Rob","https://doi.org/10.1108/MHSI-09-2021-0061","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Mental Health and Social Inclusion; 26(2):124-133, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30594,""
"Social determinants of mental well-being: senses of powerlessness and empowerment among Romani in Ukraine","Purpose&gt;The purpose of this paper is to explore senses of powerlessness and empowerment among Romani in Ukraine in relation to such social circles as the extended family, the Romani local community and the whole Ukrainian society.

"Understanding the multifaceted impact of COVID-19 on migrants in Kerala, India","Summary Motivation COVID-19 has disrupted the lives of millions of people worldwide. Migrants in developing economies have been among the most affected. This vulnerable population faces a threat to their livelihood and way of life. Hence, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of pandemic on their lives to be able to tackle subsequent waves of the pandemic or similar exogenous shocks in future. Purpose We delve into the economic and social disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on employment, sources of income, and lives of different categories of migrant labourers in the Indian state of Kerala. Methods and approach Using the livelihood portfolio theory, we dissect this impact in relation to a wide range of issues. This was corroborated by the in-depth semi-structured interviews with three categories of respondents. The interview data was analysed by using the directed qualitative content analysis method. We created themes from the data and juxtaposed them with the livelihood portfolio theory in addressing the research objectives. Findings Results highlight the impact on livelihood, lifestyles, migration prospects and gender aspects. First, the households dependent on international migrants were more severely affected than those with family members who were internal migrants. Second, a considerable lifestyle change (more reliance on a plant-based diet) and borrowing patterns (more reliance on informal money lending) was reported. Third, opinions on future migration prospects were pessimistic, and a trend in favour of reverse migration was noted. We also captured the resilience measures for each of the themes. Policy implications We find that blanket responses to mitigate migrants' hardships could be counterproductive. Policy-makers ought to implement tailor-made policies keeping in mind the migrants? classification and socio-economic demographics. Further, we recommend specific measures to address challenges that women face, to ease their workload and mitigate the loss of income. Specific measures aimed at initiating attitudinal change such as creating mental health awareness, curbing misinformation and providing counselling services could also add immense value in tackling the pandemic.","Irudaya Rajan, S.; Batra, Pooja, Sai Shiva Jayanth, R.; Sivadasan, T.

"Common Sense as a Political Weapon: Populism, Science Skepticism, and Global Crisis-Solving Motivations","This research examines the relationship between populist thinking and global crisis-solving motivations concerning climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from five European countries (Switzerland, France, Finland, Greece, and Italy), we test a model where crisis-related science skepticism-understood as the defense of commonsense knowledge against scientific expertise-mediates the association between populist thinking and crisis-mitigation attitudes. The results show considerable convergence across national contexts. Relative deprivation predicts endorsement of two core components of populism's thin ideology, people sovereignty and antielitism. These subdimensions of populism are linked to science skepticism, although variably across contexts. Science skepticism then leads to a lower sense of personal responsibility for climate change mitigation and to negative attitudes towards a governmental measure to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings further show that under specific conditions, the populist request for greater democratic participation may mobilize individuals to get involved in crisis mitigation. Overall, our results highlight the role of politicized common sense in motivating and justifying opposition to measures and policies based on scientific expertise. We conclude that science skepticism, rather than populism per se, explains cynical and dismissive attitudes towards global crises.","Staerkle, C.; Cavallaro, M.; Cortijos-Bernabeu, A.; Bonny, S.","https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.12823","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Polit.

"Cost-effectiveness of a mental health drop-in centre for young people with long-term physical conditions","Background Paediatric patients being treated for long-term physical health conditions (LTCs) have elevated mental health needs. However, mental health services in the community are difficult to access in the usual course of care for these patients. The Lucy Project â€“ a self-referral drop-in access pointâ€”was a program to address this gap by enrolling patients for low-intensity psychological interventions during their treatment for LTCs. In this paper, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Lucy Project. Methods Using a pre-post design, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention by calculating the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) using outcomes data and expenses recorded by project staff. The target population was paediatric patients enrolled in the program with an average age of 9 years, treated over a time horizon of 6 months. Outcome data were collected via the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory, which was converted to health utility scores using an instrument found in the literature. The QALYs were estimated using these health utility scores and the length of the intervention. We calculate a second, practical-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using streamlined costing figures with maximum capacity patient enrolment within a one-year time horizon, and capturing lessons learned post-trial. Results The base-case model showed an ICER of Â£21,220/Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) gained, while the practical model showed an ICER of Â£4,359/QALY gained. The practical model suggests the intervention garners significant gains in quality of life at an average cost of Â£309 per patient. Sensitivity analyses reveal use of staff time was the greatest determinant of the ICER, and the intervention is cost-effective 75% of the time in the base-case model, and 94% of the time in the practical-case model at a cost-effectiveness threshold of Â£20,000/QALY gained. Conclusions We find the base-case intervention improves patient outcomes and can be considered cost-effective according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) threshold of Â£20,000â€”Â£30,000/QALY gained, and the practical-case intervention is roughly four times as cost-effective as the base-case. We recommend future studies incorporate a control group to corroborate the effect size of the intervention.","Clarke, Harrison, Morris, Walter, Catanzano, Matteo, Bennett, Sophie, Coughtrey, Anna E.; Heyman, Isobel, Holan, Liang, Shafran, Roz, Batura, Neha","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-07901-x","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMC Health Services Research; 22:1-12, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30599,""
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic assessed among emergency department consultants","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic, declared in March 2020, had a significant impact on the well-being of the general population around the world. The quarantine, isolation, restriction of activities and the economic crisis were at the origin of these mental health disorders. The aim of our study was to assess the COVID-19 pandemic psychological impact. Methods: This was a cross-sectional prospective that lasted one month starting from October 1, 2021. we interviewed the emergency department consultants and their companions. The Form included 23 items assessing the anxious and depressive symptoms by a score validated by the High Authority for Health. Results: We included 190 adults, the average age was 30 Â± 10 years with a sex-ratio of 1.5, the majority (78%) were of university education, 17% had a secondary level of education. In our sample, 14.7% had a pathological history, 12.1% were on symptomatic treatment for psychiatric disorders, 10% were already followed by a psychiatrist. Half of the population had a COVID-19 infection, 77.4% had a parent or family member who was infected with COVID-19. Concerning the psychological impact 48.9% had signs of definite depression and 50.5% had signs of anxiety. A significantly higher level of anxiety in people who have had a member of the family infected with COVID-19 ( OR 2.99, IC 95% [1.44;6.19];p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: In this context of COVID-19 pandemic the psychological impact is almost inevitable and the fear of infecting and losing a loved one remains the most dreadful event.","Jlidi, A.; Borji, S.; Farhat, W.; Walha, Y.; Ben Othmane, E.

"Neoliberal social work and COVID-19","28 April 2020 was International Workers Memorial Day (IWM). It's an annual event organised by trade unions to commemorate the many thousands of workers who have died unnecessarily and too young as a result of government or employer negligence, through industrial accidents or through avoidable industrial diseases like asbestosis. In 2020, IWM Day was a bit different. For this year we observed a minute's silence for all the frontline workers-health workers, care workers, bus drivers, shop workers and social workers-who have lost their lives due to COVID-19. In Part II of this book, contributors report on the new and imaginative ways that social workers are developing practice to keep in touch with service users during the crisis, to reduce social isolation and protect mental health. There have also been accounts of social workers making links with the new mutual aid organisations that are springing up everywhere. Working under the occupation, the community health workers in Aida and Azza have produced a video and pamphlets detailing ways to minimise the risk of contracting COVID-19. They call their patients daily and arrange for the safe delivery of life-saving diabetes medication.

"Editorial: Hot Topics in Cellular Neuropathology","The authors discuss how this persistent immune activation contributes to long-term neuropsychiatric disorders, cognitive impairment, motor dysfunctions, and neurodegenerative states via mechanisms including microglial overactivation, synaptic degeneration, neuronal apoptosis, and reactive astrogliosis. Interestingly, while only low (or undetectable) levels of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in human post mortem brain specimens, the S1 spike protein located on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 can be released from viral membranes and cross the BBB and may cause CNS damage (Matschke et al., 2020;Meinhardt et al., 2021;Song et al., 2021). [...]in their original manuscript Datta et al. investigated the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein can directly induce neuronal injury. The authors suggest that microglia (and specifically dark microglia) may participate in mechanisms that control suicide resistance and susceptibility. [...]the selective modulation of processes that boost microglial resistance and homeostasis might be a new target to treat depression and ultimately prevent suicide deaths. The similarities of pathophysiological processes in the above studies are intriguing regarding the diversity of disease states, prompting the question that the prevention of inflammatory processes might offer huge potential for stabilizing physical, cognitive and mental health.","Hermann, Dirk M.; Popa-Wagner, Aurel, Peruzzotti-Jametti, Luca, Gunzer, Matthias","https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2022.895861","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30602,""
"The Role of Acetyl-Carnitine and Rehabilitation in the Management of Patients with Post-COVID Syndrome: Case-Control Study","Post-COVID syndrome is characterized by the persistence of nonspecific disabling symptoms, even several months after the resolution of the infection, with clinical characteristics similar to fibromyalgia (FM) and a prevalence of 31%. We evaluated the effectiveness of physical exercise, in association with L-acetyl-carnitine (ALC) therapy, in patients with Post-COVID syndrome, on musculoskeletal pain, dyspnea, functional capacity, quality of life, and depression. We conducted an observational case-control study on patients with Post-COVID syndrome. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: a treatment group that received rehabilitation treatment in combination with ALC 500 mg therapy;a control group that received only rehabilitation treatment. Patients were assessed at the time of recruitment (T0) and one month after the end of therapy (T1), with the administration of rating scales: NRS, Barthel Dyspnea Index (NPI), 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) scale, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The treatment group showed statistically higher variations in pain scores, quality of life, and depression. No statistically significant differences between the two groups emerged regarding changes in dyspnea and functional capacity scores. Combining exercise with ALC is a promising and effective treatment in the management of Post-COVID syndrome, especially for musculoskeletal pain, depression, and quality of life.","Scaturro, Dalila, Vitagliani, Fabio, Di Bella, Vito Emanuele, Falco, Vincenzo, Tomasello, Sofia, Lauricella, Lorenza, Letizia Mauro, Giulia","https://doi.org/10.3390/app12084084","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Applied Sciences; 12(8):4084, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30603,""
"Impacts of COVID-19 on the Use of Digital Technology in Construction Projects in the UAE","The construction industry has been incorporating digital technology over the last two decades, albeit gradually, as 'technology-push';continues to overcome customary and traditional passivity typical in the sector. The objective of the study presented in this paper is to investigate how digital technology is making a headway in the construction industry as a consequence of COVID-19. For the purpose of this paper, digital technology applications are divided into three groups: data acquisition, processing, and communication. The methodology involved conducting a questionnaire survey among the construction professionals in the UAE. The survey included questions on the extent of use and level of investment on the three types of technology in three periods-pre-COVID, during COVID, and post-COVID. The results clearly show the increasing level of usage of digital technology in the construction industry from pre-COVID to during COVID and post-COVID periods. Among the three categories, communication technology indicated higher extent of use as compared to the other two. In addition, a marked difference was observed between the 'small';project organizations and the 'large';ones. Unsurprisingly, both usage and investment in digital technology, in smaller organizations, indicated higher extent of increase in during and post-pandemic periods when compared to the larger organizations.","Elrefaey, Omar, Ahmed, Salma, Ahmad, Irtishad, El-Sayegh, Sameh","https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings12040489","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Buildings; 12(4):489, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30604,""
"State Anxiety in People Living with Disability and Visual Impairment during the COVID-19 Pandemic","There has been growing recognition of the impact of COVID-19 and the restrictions implemented to contain the virus on mental health. This study provides a preliminary assessment of the longitudinal impact on state anxiety in individuals with disabilities and a subsample of individuals with visual impairment (VI). Two surveys were conducted in April&ndash;May 2020 (T1) and March 2021 (T2) to explore state anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). Participants who consented to being re-contacted were invited to take part in T2. A total of 160 participants completed T1 and T2. There were no significant group differences in median anxiety at T1;however, at T2 anxiety was significantly higher in those with disabilities and there was a trend towards being higher in participants with VI compared to those with no disabilities. While not statistically significant within any of the three subgroups, state anxiety decreased slightly in those with no disabilities. The absence of a disability affecting mobility, experiencing loneliness, and poorer sleep quality predicted state anxiety at both timepoints. While anxiety appeared to decrease in individuals with no disabilities, it remained comparatively stable, and higher in those with disabilities. Loneliness and poor sleep may need to be addressed to alleviate feelings of anxiety.","Heinze, Nikki, Castle, Claire L.; Hussain, Syeda F.; Godier-McBard, Lauren R.; Kempapidis, Theofilos, Gomes, Renata S.

"Consumption of Psychiatric Drugs in Primary Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The main objective of this research was to analyze whether there were changes in the use of antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotic-sedative drugs, in the context of primary health care, during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. We further sought to study consumption in vulnerable population groups. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was performed in a primary health district of Spain. The data were obtained from the Andalusian Public Health System database, for the pre-COVID-19 period, from March 2019 to February 2020, and for the COVID-19 period, from March 2020 to February 2021. Univariant and bivariant analyses were performed. The effect size was measured using the Rosenthal test. Results: While the total number of medical prescriptions decreased by 2.5% in the COVID-19 period, the prescriptions of psychiatric drugs increased by 6.1%. The increase in the dose consumption per 1000 inhabitants (DHD) was highest for anxiolytics (7.2%), followed by hypnotic-sedatives (5.6%) and antidepressants (3.7%). The consumption of antidepressants, anxiolytics, and sedative-hypnotic drugs was higher in women, older people, and rural areas and lower in areas with social transformation needs, with these differences being statistically significant. Conclusions: The consumption of psychiatric drugs has increased over the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in women, older people, and rural areas. Thus, we should reflect on the adequate use of these drugs.","GonzÃ¡lez-LÃ³pez, MarÃ­a del Carmen, DÃ­az-Calvo, Virginia, RuÃ­z-GonzÃ¡lez, Carlos, Nievas-Soriano, Bruno JosÃ©, Rebollo-Lavado, BelÃ©n, ParrÃ³n-CarreÃ±o, TesifÃ³n","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084782","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(8):4782, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30606,""
"Fit for Purpose-Re-Designing Australia's Mental Health Information System","Background: Monitoring and reporting mental health is complex. Australia's first National Mental Health Strategy in 1992 included a new national commitment to accountability and data collection in mental health. This article provides a narrative review of thirty years of experience. Materials and Methods: This review considers key documents, policies, plans and strategies in relation to the evolution of mental health data and reporting. Documents produced by the Federal and the eight state and territory governments are considered, as well as publications produced by key information agencies, statutory authorities and others. A review of this literature demonstrates both its abundance and limitations. Results: Australia's approach to mental health reporting is characterised by duplication and a lack of clarity. The data available fail to do justice to the mental health services provided in Australia. Mental health data collection and reporting processes are centrally driven, top&ndash;down and activity-focused, largely eschewing actual health outcomes, the social determinants of mental health. There is little, if any, link to clearly identifiable service user or carer priorities. Consequently, it is difficult to link this process longitudinally to clinical or systemic quality improvement. Initial links between the focus of national reform efforts and mental health data collection were evident, but these links have weakened over time. Changes to governance and reporting, including under COVID, have made the task of delivering accountability for mental health more difficult. Conclusion: Australia's current approach is not fit for purpose. It is at a pivotal point in mental health reform, with new capacity to use modelled data to simulate prospective mental health reform options. By drawing on these new techniques and learning the lessons of the past, Australia (and other nations) can design and implement more effective systems of planning, reporting and accountability for mental health.","Rosenberg, Sebastian, Salvador-Carulla, Luis, Meadows, Graham, Hickie, Ian","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084808","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(8):4808, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30607,""
"The Developmental Trajectory of a Decade of Research on Mental Health and Well-Being amongst Graduate Students: A Bibliometric Analysis","The journey of graduate students through academia can be a difficult road plagued with several roadblocks due to several intersectional factors. These difficulties often impact the students' mental health with severe consequences on their well-being and personal and academic achievements. There is a critical need for researchers to conduct studies in response to the positive mental well-being for this group of trainees, considering their peculiar role in the scholarly environment. This study aimed to explore the scientific research on the health and well-being of graduate students;typify the scientific landscape and development trajectory, cooperation networks, and fundamental research areas;and identify areas of needed research in this field. A bibliometric analysis of articles indexed in Scopus and published in the past decade (2012 to 2021) was undertaken. The results revealed that the research on graduate students' mental health and well-being has increased over the years, significantly in the past two years, probably owing to the incidence of the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns around remote learning. The highest number of publications was from the United Kingdom (U.K.) and United States (U.S.), while the organizational affiliations were mainly from universities. The most prominent source type of publications was journal articles. The result also shows a weak collaboration across countries and organizations. The study identifies other areas of useful research, collaboration, intervention strategies, and policy review.","Okoro, Chioma, Owojori, Oluwatobi Mary, Umeokafor, Nnedinma","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19094929","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):4929, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30608,""
"The COVID-19 Lockdown and Mental Wellbeing of Females in China","Most studies consider that COVID-19 lockdowns lead to mental health problems for females, while the effect of role change on female mental health has been overlooked. This study aimed to explore multiple facets of the risk of mental distress in a sample of Chinese married females aged 21&ndash;50 during the COVID-19 lockdowns. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 613 valid responses from married females in the Guangdong province. Our primary tool was a questionnaire using a Kessler-10 scale to detect the probability of mental distress based on the level of nervousness, tiredness, restlessness, and depression. Eighty-eight point three percent of married females possessed a high risk of psychological distress because they frequently felt tired out, hopeless, and restless. The evidence suggests that the lockdown has caused a conflict in the female role to maintain a balance between family and career. Increasing family care responsibilities are positively associated with nervousness, tiredness, and mental disorder. The heterogeneity of the social role in mental wellbeing is explored. Married females whose income was worse off during the lockdown are negatively associated with mental wellbeing. Married females who are employed are found to be less mentally healthy than the self-employed.","Xia, Chang-Lan, Wei, An-Pin, Huang, Yu-Ting","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19094960","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):4960, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30609,""
"Pharmacological Treatment of Acute Psychiatric Symptoms in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and a Case Series","Delirium and psychomotor agitation are relevant clinical conditions that may develop during COVID-19 infection, especially in intensive care unit (ICU) settings. The psychopharmacological management of these conditions is receiving increasing interest in psychiatry, considering hyperkinetic delirium as one of the most common neuropsychiatries acute consequences in COVID-19 recovery patients. However, there are no actual internationally validated guidelines about this topic, due to the relatively newly introduced clinical condition;in addition, a standardized psychopharmacologic treatment of these cases is a complex goal to achieve due to the risk of both drug&ndash;drug interactions and the vulnerable conditions of those patients. The aim of this systematic review and case series is to evaluate and gather the scientific evidence on pharmacologic handling during delirium in COVID-19 patients to provide practical recommendations on the optimal management of psychotropic medication in these kinds of patients. The electronic databases PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were reviewed to identify studies, in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. At the end of the selection process, a total of 21 studies (n = 2063) were included. We also collected a case series of acute psychomotor agitation in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in ICU.

"Assessing Virtual Mental Health Access for Refugees during the COVID-19 Pandemic Using the Levesque Client-Centered Framework: What Have We Learned and How Will We Plan for the Future?","During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health services rapidly transitioned to virtual care. Although such services can improve access for underserved populations, they may also present unique challenges, especially for refugee newcomers. This study examined the multidimensional nature of access to virtual mental health (VMH) care for refugee newcomers during the COVID-19 pandemic, using Levesque et al.'s Client-Centered Framework for Assessing Access to Health Care. One hundred and eight structured and semi structured interviews were conducted in four Canadian provinces (8 community leaders, 37 newcomer clients, 63 mental health or service providers or managers). Deductive qualitative analysis, based on the Client-Centered Framework, identified several overarching themes: challenges due to the cost and complexity of using technology;comfort for VMH outside clinical settings;sustainability post-COVID-19;and communication and the therapeutic alliance. Mental health organizations, community organizations, and service providers can improve access to (virtual) mental health care for refugee newcomers by addressing cultural and structural barriers, tailoring services, and offering choice and flexibility to newcomers.","Hynie, Michaela, Jaimes, Annie, Oda, Anna, Rivest-Beauregard, Marjolaine, Perez Gonzalez, Laura, Ives, Nicole, Ahmad, Farah, Kuo, Ben C.

"Hope and Resilience Related to Fear of COVID-19 in Young People","In the face of the psychological crisis of fear caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is relevant to know the positive impact of hope and resilience during this context. The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation between hope and resilience with fear of COVID-19 in young people. The design was non-experimental, cross-sectional, and correlational. The sample consisted of 192 young people living in Metropolitan Lima, Peru. We used the Hope-Despair Questionnaire, the Resilience Scale, and the COVID-19 Fear Questionnaire. The results show that there is a significant correlation between hope, resilience, and fear of COVID-19 in young people. On the other hand, a significant difference was found in resilience according to gender. Likewise, it was found that the variables hope and resilience explain 81% (R2 adjusted) of the fear of COVID-19 (F test = 21.53;p &lt; 0.01). Hope and resilience are protective factors that have a positive impact when facing the fear of COVID-19. Thus, policies, programs, and public health strategies related to positive mental health should be promoted, with emphasis on hope and resilience.","Javier-Aliaga, David J.; Quispe, Gluder, Quinteros-ZuÃ±iga, DÃ¡maris, Adriano-Rengifo, Cristian E.; White, Michael","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095004","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5004, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30612,""
"Aspects of Psychiatric Comorbidities in Breast Cancer Patients in Tertiary Hospitals Due to COVID-19 Outbreak in South Korea: A Single Center Longitudinal Cohort Study","Background and Objectives: This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of mental disorders in patients with breast cancer at Ajou University Hospital. In addition, the patterns and prevalence of mental disorders according to the occurrence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were analyzed. Materials and Methods: From 1 January 2008 to 30 June 2021, psychiatric disorders were identified in 5174 female patients diagnosed with breast cancer at Ajou University Hospital. Based on the time when COVID-19 occurred, the pattern of onset of mental disorders in patients with breast cancer was analyzed. In addition, the prevalence of mental disorders according to the time of breast cancer diagnosis and age was evaluated. Results: A year before the diagnosis of breast cancer, 371 patients were diagnosed with a mental disorder. Of these, 201 patients were diagnosed with stress and adjustment disorders, and 97 patients had anxiety disorders. The overall frequency of psychiatric disorders after breast cancer diagnosis peaked two months later. Among psychiatric disorders reported before the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of stress/adaptation disorders was 52%, and among psychiatric disorders reported after the pandemic, it was significantly higher at 94.7%. Anxiety was found to be high in the elderly group aged &ge;60 years, and the prevalence of stress and adjustment disorders tended to increase in the non-elderly group. Conclusions: Breast cancer patients showed different patterns of psychiatric disorders according to age, time of breast cancer diagnosis, and the occurrence of COVID-19. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, delays in treatment and anxiety about infection have increased the rate of stress and adjustment disorders in cancer patients. Mental health management during the pandemic and after cancer diagnosis can improve the quality of life of patients with cancer.","Park, Jeongmin, Kim, Seonhwa, Heo, Jaesung","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58050560","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medicina; 58(5):560, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30613,""
"The Concept of Intrauterine Programming and the Development of the Neonatal Microbiome in the Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 Infection","The process of intrauterine programming is related to the quality of the microbiome formed in the fetus and the newborn. The implementation of probiotics, prebiotics, and psychobiotics shows immunomodulatory potential towards the organism, especially the microbiome of the pregnant woman and her child. Nutrigenomics, based on the observation of pregnant women and the developing fetus, makes it possible to estimate the biological effects of active dietary components on gene expression or silencing. Nutritional intervention for pregnant women should consider the nutritional status of the patient, biological markers, and the potential impact of dietary intervention on fetal physiology. The use of a holistic model of nutrition allows for appropriately targeted and effective dietary prophylaxis that can impact the physical and mental health of both the mother and the newborn. This model targets the regulation of the immune response of the pregnant woman and the newborn, considering the clinical state of the microbiota and the pathomechanism of the nervous system. Current scientific reports indicate the protective properties of immunobiotics (probiotics) about the reduction of the frequency of infections and the severity of the course of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that intrauterine programming influences the development of the microbiome for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on a review of research studies.","Grot, Martina, Krupa-Kotara, Karolina, Wypych-Slusarska, Agata, Grajek, Mateusz, Bialek-Dratwa, Agnieszka","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14091702","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Nutrients; 14(9):1702, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30614,""
"Sustaining the Benefits of Social Media on Users' Health Beliefs Regarding COVID-19 Prevention","During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media has facilitated the efficient and effective dissemination of healthcare information and helped governments keep in touch with their citizens. Research has indicated that social media can exert negative and positive influences on users' mental health. One negative effect is social media fatigue caused by information overload. However, under the current pandemic, comprehensive research has yet to be executed on the effect exerted by social media on users' health beliefs and subjective well-being (SWB). Consequently, we conducted our research to probe the influence of social media on users' perceptions of COVID-19 prevention. This study established a research model based on 340 valid responses to an online questionnaire survey from Taiwan. SmartPLS 3.0 was used to verify the developed measurement and structural models. We found social media users' incidental and focused knowledge gain positively related to their social media intensity. In addition, social media intensity positively correlated with health beliefs and SWB. Accordingly, we can determine that proper social media use can enhance health beliefs. Based on our derived findings, we propose a set of practical recommendations to leverage social media effectively and sustainably during, and after, the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chuang, Huan-Ming, Liao, Yi-Deng","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14084809","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(8):4809, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30615,""
"How Do Different Types of University Academics Perceive Work from Home Amidst COVID-19 and Beyond?","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a massive and unintentional shift to work from home (WFH) or working remotely, as well as broad adoption of web-based platforms. The goal of this research is to uncover the attitudes to WFH among different types of academics in the Sri Lankan higher education sector. An online questionnaire survey was conducted amidst a severe COVID-19 wave during June&ndash;September 2021, and 337 valid responses were received. The questionnaire contained 49 questions under four sections excluding demographic questions. The gathered data were analysed using multiple regression models. Results of the study ascertained a significant (p &lt; 0.01) positive attitude among academics towards online teaching (academic orientation), other than academics who from disciplines with more practical components, and there was a significant (p &lt; 0.01) positive attitude among academics to conducting research (research orientation) while WFH. Further, the findings indicate a significant (p &lt; 0.01) negative attitude to WFH when disseminating knowledge and engaging in community services with various stakeholders. When considering the criticality of demographics variables in the new normal, a hybrid working model can be introduced by reaping the benefits of WFH based on different types of academic orientations and their favourability towards the WFH model, rather than reverting to a full physical academic working environment. As a developing country, Sri Lanka can formulate policies on effective hybrid working models for academics to realise the potential from the lessons learned. This experience will enable the country to accomplish or move towards accomplishing the fourth goal of SDGs, quality education by 2030.","Rathnayake, Nilmini M.; Kumarasinghe, Pivithuru J.; Kumara, Ajantha S.","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14094868","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(9):4868, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30616,""
"Gender and Age Influence in Pre-Competitive and Post-Competitive Anxiety in Young Tennis Players","To study the influence of age and gender on pre-competitive and post-competitive anxiety and self-confidence in young tennis players. A total of 42 U'12 to U'18 category tennis players, 12 females and 30 males, participated in this cross-sectional study. The players had a mean age of 13.74 (2.07) years old and a national competitive experience of 4.00 (2.14) years. The pre-competitive anxiety of the participants was assessed using the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory&ndash;2R (CSAI-2R) and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-E) before and after an official tournament's match. Results showed that younger players showed lower trait anxiety (r = 0.333;p &lt; 0.05), lower pre-match state anxiety (r = 0.501;p &lt; 0.01) and lower pre-match somatic anxiety (r = 0.313;p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, girls exhibited higher values of state anxiety (r = 0.445;p &lt; 0.01) and somatic anxiety (r = 0.440;p &lt; 0.01) than boys before the match. However, differences were not observed in the trait anxiety measured by STAI-E (r = 0.203;p = 0.213), cognitive anxiety (r = 0.140;p = 0.363), and self-confidence measured by the CSAI questionnaire (r = 0.150;p = 0.333), before the match. Therefore, coaches and sport psychologists should implement adequate on- and off-court individualized interventions to manage anxiety, specifically in girls and players over 14 years old. Although anxiety levels were similar to those before the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the influence of the pandemic on mental health, results might be taken with caution.","MartÃ­nez-Gallego, Rafael, Villafaina, Santos, Crespo, Miguel, Fuentes-GarcÃ­a, Juan Pedro","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14094966","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(9):4966, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30617,""
"Identification of Barriers Limiting the Use of Preventive Vaccinations against Influenza among the Elderly Population: A Cross-Sectional Analysis","Older adults are at a high risk of experiencing severe complications of influenza. Receiving a vaccination is a beneficial strategy to prevent the disease and reduce the severity of influenza illnesses. This cross-sectional questionnaire-based study aimed to evaluate the influence of sociodemographic, clinical, and mental parameters as well as other potential risk factors on refusal to vaccinate against influenza among the elderly population in Poland. Furthermore, due to the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic, we put efforts into finding any statistical correlations between the fear of COVID-19 infection in patients and their attitudes toward receiving an influenza vaccination. The study was conducted in November&ndash;December 2020 in Poland on a representative nationwide sample of 500 individuals aged &gt; 60. Of the respondents, 62 (12.4%) and 51 (10.2%) underwent influenza vaccination in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Out of ten different factors analyzed in this study, three were significantly associated with attitudes towards influenza vaccination. Participants with net income below the national average of PLN 3000 (OR = 2.37, CI 95% [1.26&ndash;4.47]), compared to those earning more than PLN 3000, had significantly higher odds of having a negative attitude towards influenza vaccination. Furthermore, respondents with &lt;174 cm height (OR = 2.56, CI 95% [1.51&ndash;4.33]) and those with strong fear of COVID-19 infection (OR = 1.65, CI95% [1.02&ndash;2.66]) were also more likely to refrain from influenza vaccination. We believe the identification of factors limiting the willingness to receive influenza vaccination is an effective way to help clinicians focus their efforts on educating the groups of patients with the highest odds of refusing to receive the vaccine. Moreover, it may aid the design and enforcement of national solutions or the implementation of novel legislative measures and preventive programs, increasing public confidence and promoting vaccination, especially among groups at high risk of developing this disease.","Pietraszek, Alicja, Sobieszczanska, Malgorzata, Makuch, Sebastian, DrÃ³zdz, Mateusz, Mazur, Grzegorz, Agrawal, Siddarth","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10050651","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Vaccines; 10(5):651, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30618,""

"A Cross-Sectional Study Investigating Mental Health Among Turkish Citizens During The COVID-19 Pandemic: The Importance of Perceived Social Support","Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the stress burden and related mental problems all over the world. The changes in social life required the examination of psychosocial variables in this period. This study aimed to investigate the levels of depression, anxiety, stress, poor sleep quality, and insomnia in Turkish society during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine the relationship between those and perceived social support. Methods: A total number of 1032 participants completed the online survey form consisting of sociodemographic data form, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-42 (DASS-42), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). A series of univariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine the association of perceived social support with depression, anxiety, stress, poor sleep quality, and insomnia. All tests of associations were carried out at a level of significance of &lt;0.05 and a 95% confidence interval. Results: The proportion of the participants having low perceived social support was 11.2% (n=116), having moderate perceived social support was 27.6% (n=285), having high perceived social support was 61.2 % (n=632). Based on the cut-off values of the relevant scales, the rates of depression, anxiety, high stress, poor sleep quality, and insomnia were found to be 54.6%, 47.6%, 47.8%, 58.8%, and 42.2%, respectively. According to multivariate linear regression analyses, MSPSS scores significantly predicted DASS-depression (p&lt;0.001), DASS-anxiety (p&lt;0.001), DASS-stress (p&lt;0.001), PSQI (p&lt;0.001), and ISI scores (p&lt;0.001). Besides, being aged 18-30, female sex, being unemployed, COVID-19 history, having a chronic disease, and current psychiatric treatment were associated with at least one of the symptom clusters of depression, anxiety, stress, poor sleep quality, and insomnia. Conclusion: The current study indicated that depression, anxiety, high stress, poor sleep quality, and insomnia were prevalent among the participants at the end of the first year of the pandemic.

"Physical Activity Levels and Self-perception of Fitness in COVID-19-Recovered Individuals","Background: The preventative measures to reduce the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have reduced the physical activity level (PAL) that might also affect physical and mental health. The present study investigated the relationship between self-perception of fitness (SPF) and PAL in COVID-19-recovered individuals (CRI). Methods: The population of this descriptive-analytical study included all CRI (men and women, in the age range of 20 to 70 years) in Kermanshah. In the present study, 890 volunteers (438 men and 452 women) were sampled using a multistage cluster sampling method. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF) was used to assess the PAL and the Delignieres et al. questionnaire to assess the SPF. The Pearson correlation coefficient test and independent t-test were used to analyze the data using SPSS version 24 software. Results: The results showed low PAL (men: 876.11 +/- 40.23;women: 739.27 +/- 8.02) and poor SPF (men: 6.64 +/- 1.62;women: 5.27 +/- 1.39) in CRI. Also, there was a significant positive relationship between high and moderate PAL and SPF in men (r = 0.67, P = 0.032;r = 0.77, P = 0.018, respectively) and women (R= 0.56, P = 0.041;r = 0.66, P = 0.035, respectively), while there was a significant inverse relationship between low PAL and SPF among men (r = -0.85, P= 0.001) and women (r = -0.89, P= 0.001). Conclusions: Based on the results, wrong SPF in individuals with low PAL might be one reason for being insufficiently active. Thus, a proper understanding of PAL could be the first step of a regular physical activity schedule to enhance the immune system.","Azmodeh, M.; Hoseini, R.; Amiri, E.","https://doi.org/10.5812/ijpbs.115038","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Iran.

"The Therapeutic Effects of Ketamine in Mental Health Disorders: A Narrative Review","Ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, is commonly used as an anesthetic and analgesic but has recently shown promising research in treating certain psychiatric conditions such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, and substance use disorder. Due to its euphoric, dissociative, and hallucinogenic properties, ketamine has been abused as a recreational drug, which has led to rigid regulation of medication. The COVID-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge for the American population which was reflected in increased reports of problems regarding their mental health. Mood disorders have dramatically increased in the past two years. Approximately one in ten people stated that they had started or increased substance use because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, rates of suicidal ideation have significantly increased when compared to pre-pandemic levels, with more than twice the number of adults surveyed in 2018 indicating suicidal thoughts ""within the last 30 days"" at the time they were surveyed. Moreover, many responders indicated they had symptoms of PTSD. The PubMed database was searched using the keyword ""ketamine,"" in conjunction with ""depression,"" ""suicidal ideation,"" ""substance use disorder,"" and ""post-traumatic stress disorder."" The inclusion criteria encompassed articles from 2017 to 2022 published in the English language that addressed the relationship between ketamine and mental health disorders. With this sharp increase in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and an increased public interest in mental health combined with the promise of the therapeutic value of ketamine for certain mental health conditions, including suicidal ideation, this narrative review sought to identify recently published studies that describe the therapeutic uses of ketamine for mental health. Results of this review indicate that ketamine's therapeutic effects offer a potential alternative treatment for depression, suicidal ideation, substance use disorders, and PTSD.","Ramos, C.

"Impact of Cognitive Behavioural Intervention for Tic Disorders in Children","Tic disorders are one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders and if unattended, can have other psychological impact. It can present as poor academic performance, poor concentration, low confidence, anxiety, depression and many others. This case series is about seven children diagnosed with tic disorder, as per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) 5 criteria. These children underwent standard behavioural training module comprising of behavioural rewards, Habit Reversal Training (HRT), relaxation training, identification and management of emotions and social skills training;which was planned following case conceptualisation. Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) was used before starting therapy and while completing the therapy. Considering the severity of symptoms and distress caused by them, three children were started on medicine (clonidine) along with therapy. Same therapy module was provided online for those children (three) who were not able to come for direct training due to geographic distance and Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic restrictions. All the seven children showed favourable improvement in terms of severity and improvement in the co-morbid conditions. All of them responded to the individualised treatment protocol and showed difference in pre (mean=38) and post (mean=12) total tic severity score suggesting response to treatment. Among them, two children scored zero. This case series demonstrates the application of behavioural therapy including varied strategies as per the individual case conceptualisation.","Hegde, S.; Shah, H.; Shettigar, C.; Mehandale, B.","https://doi.org/10.7860/jcdr/2022/51371.16170","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: J.

"Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health of Children and Adolescents: A Narrative Review","Coronavirus pandemic created havoc on our planet, affecting all aspects of human life. It has resulted in human mortality and morbidity worldwide. It did not spare social and economic fabric of societies. It has resulted in huge psychosocial impact on human race. Various disease containment measures such as quarantine, physical distancing, complete lockdowns imposed by governments across the globe has severely affected mental health of children and adolescents. This paper is aimed at reviewing various articles published regarding the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic impact on mental health of children with or without previous mental health problems. Different electronic databases, such as Science Direct, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for articles describing impact on mental health of children and adolescents with/without previous mental health problems due to COVID-19. Search strategies included terms such as: â€œCOVID-19â€, â€œSARS-CoV-2â€, â€œmental healthâ€, â€œchildrenâ€, â€œadolescentâ€, â€œbehavioural impactâ€, â€œdepressionâ€ and â€œanxiety.â€ The majority of children and adolescents experienced deterioration in their mental health as emergency measures were implemented throughout the world. Children diagnosed with preexisting mental health problems or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experienced more negative changes compared with children/ adolescents without pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses. There is increased anxiety, depression, irritability, sleep disorders, lethargy, dissatisfaction and fear of death. There is need to plan and implement strategies to provide easy and early access to mental health services for which various stakeholders should come together.","Ashraf, S.; Yaqoob, A.","https://doi.org/10.7860/JCDR/2022/52034.16176","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research; 16(4):VE01-VE03, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30625,""
"The effect of exercise and affect regulation skills on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey","COVID-19-related confinements pose a threat to mental health. We investigated prevalence rates of symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety and insomnia in German adults. Furthermore, we explored associations of exercise behavior with disorder-specific symptoms and assessed whether specific affect regulation skills enhance the effect of exercise on symptom alleviation. Cross-sectional survey-based data collected during the first lockdown is presented: 4268 adults completed questionnaires on mental health, exercise behavior and Covid-related lifestyle factors. Primary outcome was depression (PHQ-9), secondary outcomes generalized anxiety (PHQ-D) and sleep quality (PSQI). Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to examine the association of exercise behavior with the outcomes. Analyses resulted in elevated symptoms of psychological distress (probable cases of depressive disorder: 31.2%, anxiety disorder: 7.5%, sleeping disorder: 43.0%). A change towards less exercise during the lockdown was significantly associated with higher levels of depression (t=5.269; ÃŽÂ²=0.077, p&lt;.001), anxiety (t=3.397; ÃŽÂ²=0.055, p&lt;.001) and insomnia (t=3.466; ÃŽÂ²=0.058; p&lt;.001). Physical activity (PA)-related affect regulation enhanced the effect of exercise on mental health. Results suggest a demand for measures which promote the maintenance of exercise during a pandemic and improve PA-related affect regulation to optimize effects of exercise on mental health.","RÃƒÂ¶sel, Bauer, Seiffer, Deinhart, Atrott, Sudeck, Hautzinger, Wolf","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114559","20220426","COVID-19; Exercise; Mental health; PA-related affect regulation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30626,""

"E-learning intention of students with anxiety: Evidence from the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in China","The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the need to address the mental health issues for the future adoption of e-learning among massive students in higher education. This study takes a lead to investigate whether and how general anxiety will influence college students' e-learning intention to provide knowledge to better improve the e-learning technology. We adopted the Technology acceptance model (TAM) to examine the difference between students with and without general anxiety in the e-learning intention where the students are classified based on the General Anxiety Disorder-2 scale. The model is empirically analyzed based on a survey of 512 college students in China regarding their e-learning experience in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results demonstrate that the TAM is powerful in explaining the e-learning intention among college students with general anxiety. Besides, all effects associated with perceived usefulness (PU) are reinforced while those associated with perceived ease of use (PEOU) are attenuated in the anxiety group. The results suggest that instructors and higher education institutions should take advantage of the significant PU-intention relationship by providing quality e-learning, which is paramount to coping with the general anxiety among students. This study provides a prototype attempt to investigate the influence of anxiety on e-learning where the different types of anxiety sources are synthesized. However, anxiety can stem from internal sources (computer anxiety, academic stress) and external sources (fear of the virus, lack of social interaction), which requires further investigations.","Hu, Zhang, Shuang, Zhu, Shen, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.121","20220426","Anxiety; COVID-19; E-learning; GAD; TAM","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30628,""
"The relationship between family functioning and non-suicidal self-injury in adolescents: A structural equation modeling analysis","Research suggested that depressive symptoms, emotional competence, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) might mediate the association between family functioning and NSSI. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the mediation effect of depressive symptoms, emotional competence, and PTSS related to COVID-19 on the relationship between family functioning and NSSI in adolescents. A sample of 5854 adolescents was recruited from June 16 to July 8, 2020. The data for family functioning, depressive symptoms, emotional competence, PTSS related to COVID-19, and NSSI behavior of adolescents were collected via self-reported questionnaires. A structural equation model was constructed to examine the relationship, and a bootstrap analysis was conducted to evaluate the mediation effects. The reporting rate of adolescent NSSI was 30.2%. The poor family functioning was positively associated with adolescent NSSI (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.130, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.093-0.182), which was mediated by depression with effect size of 0.231 (95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.201-0.257). The pathway coefficients between emotional competence and NSSI, and depression, PTSS related to COVID-19 and NSSI, though statistically significant were unlikely to be clinically meaning with values of 0.057 and 0.015. There was no mediating effect by PTSS related to COVID-19. The pathways initially constructed between family functioning and PTSS, emotional capacity and PTSS related to COVID-19 were not been verified. It was unclear whether this mediational effect would be supported in a longitudinal design. The application and extension of this model toward other regions and countries, and different ages need to be further explored. The interventions of adolescent NSSI should focus on both the family level and individual levels. Improving family environment, screening depressive symptoms, enhancing emotional competence and lessening PTSS related to COVID-19 might reduce NSSI.","Wang, Luo, Hong, Yang, Zhao, Jia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.124","20220426","Adolescence; Depression; Family functioning; Multiple mediation; Non-suicidal self-injury; Structural equation model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30629,""
"Depressive symptoms among adults in 2018-2019 and during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in Italy","Restrictions due to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has produced a large number of effects on mental health, which are expected to endure over time. In this study, we assessed depressive symptom levels before the COVID-19 pandemic, from January 2018 to December 2019, and during the pandemic in Italy in 2020. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), which is a screening instrument devised to detect probable depression and which has been annually administered in the framework of the Italian Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System since 2008. Depressive symptoms were assessed in a sample of 41,362 18-64-year-old adults surveyed in 2018-2019 and in a sample of 14,612 adults surveyed in 2020. The prevalence of depressive symptoms increased from 6.1% (95% CI 5.8%-6.4%) in 2018-2019 to 7.1% (95% CI 5.6%-8.6%) in March-April 2020. It then declined in May-June to 4.4% (95% CI 3.2%-5.5%) but in July-August it once again increased to 8.2% (95% CI 6.0%-10.4%) and, finally, gradually returned above the pre-lockdown level by November-December 2020 (5.9%; 95% CI 4.7%-7.1%). Compared to before the health crisis, during the pandemic, women and individuals with financial difficulties were found to have a significantly higher risk of depressive symptoms while younger, individuals with a higher education and those living in South Italy became increasingly vulnerable. While the average response to the pandemic was one of resilience over time, women and younger individuals were found to be particularly prone to the risk of depressive symptoms, as a result of the pandemic. In future investigations, the risk of individuals living in the South of Italy should also be taken into consideration.","Gigantesco, Minardi, Contoli, Masocco","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.131","20220426","Covid-19; Depression; Longitudinal evaluation; Nationally representative study; Post-lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30630,""
"Clinical characteristics with inflammation profiling of long COVID and association with 1-year recovery following hospitalisation in the UK: a prospective observational study","No effective pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions exist for patients with long COVID. We aimed to describe recovery 1 year after hospital discharge for COVID-19, identify factors associated with patient-perceived recovery, and identify potential therapeutic targets by describing the underlying inflammatory profiles of the previously described recovery clusters at 5 months after hospital discharge. The Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study recruiting adults (aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years) discharged from hospital with COVID-19 across the UK. Recovery was assessed using patient-reported outcome measures, physical performance, and organ function at 5 months and 1 year after hospital discharge, and stratified by both patient-perceived recovery and recovery cluster. Hierarchical logistic regression modelling was performed for patient-perceived recovery at 1 year. Cluster analysis was done using the clustering large applications k-medoids approach using clinical outcomes at 5 months. Inflammatory protein profiling was analysed from plasma at the 5-month visit. This study is registered on the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN10980107, and recruitment is ongoing. 2320 participants discharged from hospital between March 7, 2020, and April 18, 2021, were assessed at 5 months after discharge and 807 (32Ã‚Â·7%) participants completed both the 5-month and 1-year visits. 279 (35Ã‚Â·6%) of these 807 patients were women and 505 (64Ã‚Â·4%) were men, with a mean age of 58Ã‚Â·7 (SD 12Ã‚Â·5) years, and 224 (27Ã‚Â·8%) had received invasive mechanical ventilation (WHO class 7-9). The proportion of patients reporting full recovery was unchanged between 5 months (501 [25Ã‚Â·5%] of 1965) and 1 year (232 [28Ã‚Â·9%] of 804). Factors associated with being less likely to report full recovery at 1 year were female sex (odds ratio 0Ã‚Â·68 [95% CI 0Ã‚Â·46-0Ã‚Â·99]), obesity (0Ã‚Â·50 [0Ã‚Â·34-0Ã‚Â·74]) and invasive mechanical ventilation (0Ã‚Â·42 [0Ã‚Â·23-0Ã‚Â·76]). Cluster analysis (n=1636) corroborated the previously reported four clusters: very severe, severe, moderate with cognitive impairment, and mild, relating to the severity of physical health, mental health, and cognitive impairment at 5 months. We found increased inflammatory mediators of tissue damage and repair in both the very severe and the moderate with cognitive impairment clusters compared with the mild cluster, including IL-6 concentration, which was increased in both comparisons (n=626 participants). We found a substantial deficit in median EQ-5D-5L utility index from before COVID-19 (retrospective assessment; 0Ã‚Â·88 [IQR 0Ã‚Â·74-1Ã‚Â·00]), at 5 months (0Ã‚Â·74 [0Ã‚Â·64-0Ã‚Â·88]) to 1 year (0Ã‚Â·75 [0Ã‚Â·62-0Ã‚Â·88]), with minimal improvements across all outcome measures at 1 year after discharge in the whole cohort and within each of the four clusters. The sequelae of a hospital admission with COVID-19 were substantial 1 year after discharge across a range of health domains, with the minority in our cohort feeling fully recovered. Patient-perceived health-related quality of life was reduced at 1 year compared with before hospital admission. Systematic inflammation and obesity are potential treatable traits that warrant further investigation in clinical trials.

"COVID-19 stressful life events and mental health: Personality and coping styles as moderators","To examine the role of COVID-19-specific stressful life events (SLE) in predicting depression, anxiety, and life satisfaction, and if personality traits (extraversion and neuroticism), and coping styles (problem-focused coping and avoidance coping) moderated these relations. Data were collected from 371 college students (<i>M<sub>ag</sub></i><sub>e</sub> = 20.59; <i>SD</i><sub>age</sub> = 2.58) from one large university of the Mid-Atlantic region in the U.S. Participants completed an online survey measuring COVID-19 related stressful life events (adapted from a tool developed to measure stressful life events during the SARS pandemic; Costa et al., 2001; Main et al., 2011), personality (the Mini-Markers; Saucier, 1994), coping styles (by using a measure developed by Aldrige-Gerry et al., 2011), depression (PHQ-9; Kroenke et al., 2011), anxiety (GAD-7; Spitzer et al., 2006), and life satisfaction (Student's Life Satisfaction Scale, Huebner, 1996) between March 27<sup>th</sup> and April 27<sup>th</sup>, 2020. Path analysis results showed that extraversion and avoidance coping style moderated the effects of SLE on depression and anxiety symptoms; neuroticism and avoidance coping style moderated the relation between SLE and life satisfaction. The moderation results also differed by gender. These findings indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic had deleterious effects on college students' mental health, where extraversion emerged as a protective factor, while neuroticism and avoidance coping style were risk factors. These findings underscore the importance of paying special attention to college students' mental health needs and promoting appropriate coping strategies in the light of the current pandemic.","Wang, Havewala, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2022.2066977","20220426","COVID-19; Coping styles; Mental health; personality; stressful life events","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30632,""

"Family Caregivers of Veterans Experience Clinically Significant Levels of Distress Prepandemic and During Pandemic: Implications for Caregiver Support Services","Of the 26.4 million family caregivers in the United States, nearly 40% report high levels of emotional strain and subjective burden. However, for the 5 million caregivers of Veterans, little is known about the experiences of caregivers of Veterans during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim was to examine pandemic-related changes of caregiver well-being outcomes. Using a pre/post design and longitudinal data of individual caregivers captured pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19, we use multilevel generalized linear mixed models to examine pandemic-related changes to caregiver well-being (n=903). The primary outcome measures include Zarit Subjective Burden, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale, perceived financial strain, life chaos, and loneliness. During the pandemic, we observe slight improvements for caregivers across well-being measures except for perceived financial strain. Before the pandemic, we observed that caregivers screened positive for clinically significant caregiver burden and probable depression. While we do not observe worsening indicators of caregiver well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, the average predicted values of indicators of caregiver well-being remain clinically significant for caregiving subjective burden and depression. These findings illuminate pandemic-related impacts of caregivers receiving support through the Veterans Affairs (VA) pre-COVID and during the COVID-19 pandemic while caring for a population of frail, older care-recipients with a high burden of mental illness and other chronic conditions. Considering the long-term impacts of the pandemic to increase morbidity and the expected increased demand for caregivers in an aging population, these consistently high levels of distress despite receiving support highlight the need for interventions and policy reform to systematically support caregivers more broadly.","Miller, Van Houtven, Smith, Lindquist, Gray, Richardson, Shepherd-Banigan","https://doi.org/10.1097/MLR.0000000000001726","20220426","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30635,""
"A Group-Facilitated, Internet-based Intervention to Promote Mental Health and Well-being in a Vulnerable Population of University Students: Randomized Controlled Trial of the Be Well Plan Program","A growing literature supports the use of internet-based interventions to improve mental health outcomes. However, most programs target specific symptoms or participant groups and are not tailored to facilitate improvements in mental health and well-being or do not allow for needs and preferences of individual participants. The Be Well Plan, a 5-week group-facilitated, internet-based mental health and well-being group intervention addresses these gaps, allowing participants to select a range of activities that they can tailor to their specific characteristics, needs, and preferences. This study aims to test whether the Be Well Plan program was effective in improving primary outcomes of mental well-being, resilience, anxiety, and depression compared to a waitlist control group during the COVID-19 pandemic; secondary outcomes included self-efficacy, a sense of control, and cognitive flexibility. The study further seeks to examine participants' engagement and satisfaction with the program. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 2 parallel arms, an intervention and a waitlist control group. The intervention involved 5 weekly 2-hour sessions, which were facilitated in group format using Zoom videoconferencing software. University students were recruited via social media posts, lectures, emails, flyers, and posters. Using an intentional randomization 2:1 allocation strategy, we recruited 215 participants to the trial (n=126, 58.6%, intervention group; n=89, 41.4%, waitlist control group). Of the 126 participants assigned to the intervention group, 75 (59.5%) commenced the program and were included in modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analyses. mITT intervention participants attended, on average, 3.41 sessions (SD 1.56, median 4); 55 (73.3%) attended at least 4 sessions, and 25 (33.3%) attended all 5 sessions. Of the 49 intervention group participants who completed the postintervention assessment, 47 (95.9%) were either very satisfied (n=31, 66%) or satisfied (n=16, 34%). The mITT analysis for well-being (F1,162=9.65, P=.002, Cohen d=0.48) and resilience (F1,162=7.85, P=.006, Cohen d=0.44) showed significant time Ãƒâ€” group interaction effects, suggesting that both groups improved over time, but the Be Well Plan (intervention) group showed significantly greater improvement compared to the waitlist control group. A similar pattern of results was observed for depression and anxiety (Cohen d=0.32 and 0.37, respectively), as well as the secondary outcomes (self-efficacy, Cohen d=0.50; sense of control, Cohen d=0.42; cognitive flexibility, Cohen d=0.65). Larger effect sizes were observed in the completer analyses. Reliable change analysis showed that the majority of mITT participants (58/75, 77.3%) demonstrated a significant reliable improvement in at least 1 of the primary outcomes. The Be Well Plan program was effective in improving mental health and well-being, including mental well-being, resilience, depression, and anxiety. Participant satisfaction scores and attendance indicated a high degree of engagement and satisfaction with the program.

"Black and Waiting: Bioethics and Care during the Covid-19 Pandemic","In this essay, a Black scholar of the cultural histories of Black women's reproductive lives launches a discussion of generations of racism, health inequities, and violence against Black bodies by looking at Black poet and essayist Dionne Brand's critique of the notion of returning to ""the normal"" after the Covid-19 pandemic. To what, the essay asks, is everyone so eager to return? The intergenerational wait for Black people's moment of racial reckoning is its own unique biomedical warfare, which cannot end with the end of a pandemic. This warfare undercuts Black people's daily health with anxiety and depression, altering the very chromosomes passed down to their children. To health care providers, bioethicists, and those who practice antiracist health work the author poses these questions: How will you confront anti-Black racism within every formulation of ""treatment""-diagnosis, care, medication distribution, physical therapy? How long will the violence against Black lives be dissolved into talking points about our bodies? How can one listen, ethically, to Black people? These, she asserts, are questions of practice, of politics, and of care.","Collins","https://doi.org/10.1002/hast.1374","20220426","Anti-Black racism; Black health; Covid-19; bioethics; equity in health care; health inequities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30637,""
"Nanovectorization of Ivermectin to avoid overdose of drugs","Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug that results in the death of the targeted parasites using several mechanical actions. While very well supported, it can induce in rare cases, adverse effects including coma and respiratory failure in case of overdose. This problem should be solved especially in an emergency situation. For instance, the first pandemic of the 21th century was officially declared in early 2020, and while several vaccines around the worlds have been used, an effective treatment against this new strain of coronavirus, better known as SARS-CoV-2, should also be considered, especially given the massive appearance of variants. From all the tested therapies, Ivermectin showed a potential reduction of the viral portability, but sparked significant debate around the dose needed to achieve these positive results. To answer this general question, we propose, using simulations, to show that the nanovectorization of Ivermectin on BN oxide nanosheets can increase the transfer of the drug to its target and thus decrease the quantity of drug necessary to cope with the disease. This first application could help science to develop such nanocargo to avoid adverse effects.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

"Psychological Distress in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease Over the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background This study sought to better understand the experiences of adults with congenital heart disease throughout the pandemic. Objectives were to determine (1) psychological distress before and throughout the pandemic; (2) changes in day-to-day functioning; and (3) the percentage of adults with congenital heart disease who experienced COVID-19 related symptoms, underwent testing, and tested positive. Methods and Results This was a cross-sectional study paired with retrospective chart review. A web-based survey was distributed to patients between December 2020 and January 2021. Patients reported on psychological distress across 5 categories (Screening Tool for Psychological Distress; depression, anxiety, stress, anger, and lack of social support), whether they experienced symptoms of COVID-19 and/or sought testing, and changes to their work and social behavior. Five hundred seventy-nine survey responses were received, of which 555 were linked to clinical data. Patients were aged 45Ã‚Â±15Ã‚Â years. The proportion of patients reporting above-threshold values for all Screening Tool for Psychological Distress items significantly increased during the early pandemic compared with before the pandemic. Stress returned to baseline in December 2020/January 2021, whereas all others remained elevated. Psychological distress decreased with age, and women reported persistently elevated stress and anxiety compared with men during the pandemic. A consistent trend was not observed with regard to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association anatomic and physiologic classification. Fifty (9%) patients lost employment because of a COVID-19-related reason. COVID-19 symptoms were reported by 145 (25%) patients, 182 (31%) sought testing, and 10 (2%) tested positive. Conclusions A substantial proportion of adults with congenital heart disease reported clinically significant psychological distress during the pandemic.","Janzen, LeComte, Sathananthan, Wang, Kiess, Chakrabarti, Grewal","https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.121.023516","20220426","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; congenital heart disease; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30639,""
"Impact of population mixing between vaccinated and unvaccinated subpopulations on infectious disease dynamics: implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission","The speed of vaccine development has been a singular achievement during the COVID-19 pandemic, although uptake has not been universal. Vaccine opponents often frame their opposition in terms of the rights of the unvaccinated. We sought to explore the impact of mixing of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated people. We constructed a simple susceptible-infectious-recovered compartmental model of a respiratory infectious disease with 2 connected subpopulations: people who were vaccinated and those who were unvaccinated. We simulated a spectrum of patterns of mixing between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups that ranged from random mixing to complete like-with-like mixing (complete assortativity), in which people have contact exclusively with others with the same vaccination status. We evaluated the dynamics of an epidemic within each subgroup and in the population as a whole. We found that the risk of infection was markedly higher among unvaccinated people than among vaccinated people under all mixing assumptions. The contact-adjusted contribution of unvaccinated people to infection risk was disproportionate, with unvaccinated people contributing to infections among those who were vaccinated at a rate higher than would have been expected based on contact numbers alone. We found that as like-with-like mixing increased, attack rates among vaccinated people decreased from 15% to 10% (and increased from 62% to 79% among unvaccinated people), but the contact-adjusted contribution to risk among vaccinated people derived from contact with unvaccinated people increased. Although risk associated with avoiding vaccination during a virulent pandemic accrues chiefly to people who are unvaccinated, their choices affect risk of viral infection among those who are vaccinated in a manner that is disproportionate to the portion of unvaccinated people in the population.","Fisman, Amoako, Tuite","https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.212105","20220426","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30640,""
"Protecting the mental and physical well-being of frontline health care workers during COVID-19: Study protocol of a cluster randomized controlled trial","The COVID-19 pandemic has placed health care workers at unprecedented risk of stress, burnout, and moral injury. This paper describes the design of an ongoing cluster randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of Stress First Aid (SFA) to Usual Care (UC) in protecting the well-being of frontline health care workers. We plan to recruit a diverse set of hospitals and health centers (eight matched pairs of hospitals and six pairs of centers), with a goal of approximately 50 HCW per health center and 170 per hospital. Participating sites in each pair are randomly assigned to SFA or UC (i.e., whatever psychosocial support is currently being received by HCW). Each site identified a leader to provide organizational support of the study; SFA sites also identified at least one champion to be trained in the intervention. Using a ""train the trainer"" model, champions in turn trained their peers in selected HCW teams or units to implement SFA over an eight-week period. We surveyed HCW before and after the implementation period. The primary outcomes are posttraumatic stress disorder and general psychological distress; secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety symptoms, sleep problems, social functioning problems, burnout, moral distress, and resilience. In addition, through in-depth qualitative interviews with leaders, champions, and HCW, we assessed the implementation of SFA, including acceptability, feasibility, and uptake. Results from this study will provide initial evidence for the application of SFA to support HCW well-being during a pandemic.

"COVID-19 Pandemic Associated With Increased Self-reported Depressive Symptoms in Patients With Congenital Craniofacial Diagnoses","The current study investigated the influence of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on patients with congenital craniofacial diagnoses. Patients (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°66) with craniofacial diagnoses aged between 8 and 17 were prospectively evaluated with longitudinal psychosocial assessments using the anger, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and peer relationships instruments within the pediatric Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). The COVID-19 cohort (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°33) included patients with assessments within 2 years prior to the pandemic (t0) and during the pandemic (t1; March 2020 to March 2021). An age-matched comparison cohort (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°33) with similar demographics and diagnoses included patients assessed twice over 3 years prior to the pandemic. All PROMIS measures were in the average range clinically for both groups across time points.

"Modification of the association between experience of economic distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and behavioral health outcomes by availability of emergency cash reserves: findings from a nationally-representative survey in Thailand","Studies have suggested that economic distress is associated with behavioral health outcomes, while availability of cash reserves for emergencies is associated with a reduction in economic distress. The objective of this study was to assess the extent that the availability of emergency cash reserves modified the association between experience of economic distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and behavioral health outcomes in the general adult population of Thailand. We conducted a nationally-representative phone-based survey in late April 2021. Survey questions included questions on experience of economic distress, and a question on what participants would do to cover a 5,000 Thai Bahts (THB) emergency expense within one week, anxiety and depression screening questions, and questions regarding sleep, exercise, gambling, smoking, and drinking behaviors. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses with adjustment for complex survey designs, and stratified analyses with assessment of heterogeneity of odds ratios between strata and assessment of additive and multiplicative interactions. A total of 1,555 individuals from 15 provinces participated in the survey (participation rate = 68.3%). Approximately 19.6% Ã‚Â± 1.0% of the participants reported that they would cover the 5,000 THB emergency expense only with cash or cash equivalent without resorting to other means. Experience of economic distress was associated with anxiety disorder after adjusting for covariables (Adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.47; 95% CI [1.45-4.19]). There was no evidence that availability of emergency cash reserves significantly modified the stated association, nor the association between experience of economic distress and other outcomes. However, with regard to anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and history of gambling in past 30 days, the p-for-trend values (p-for-trend &lt; 0.001) suggested that those with emergency cash reserves had lower prevalence of these outcomes than those without emergency cash reserves. The study findings did not support our hypothesis that availability of emergency cash reserves modified the association between experience of economic distress and behavioral health outcomes. Nonetheless, the study findings can serve as potentially useful basic information for relevant stakeholders. Future studies should consider qualitative data collection and longitudinal study design in order to explore these associations at greater depths.","Wichaidit, Prommanee, Choocham, Chotipanvithayakul, Assanangkornchai","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13307","20220426","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Economic distress; Emergency savings","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30644,""
"Physical Activity and Exercise Addiction During the Covid-19 Pandemic in Italy","Severe restrictive measures were implemented globally to limit the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic leading to significant lifestyle changes and impacting on both the physical and the mental health of citizens. Caught by the fear of getting sick, some individuals have adopted behaviors which favored the development of exercise addiction (EA). Our aim was to evaluate physical activity habits and the risk of EA in the general Italian population during phase 1 of the lockdown. The role of appearance anxiety (AA), self-compassion, and use of performance and image enhancing drugs (PIEDs) as predictors of EA development were investigated. A comparison between physically active subjects with the inactive ones was also included. Between April and May 2020, an online survey was conducted across Italy. Nine hundred thirty-six answers were collected. The rate of EA in the physically active sample (782 subjects) was 4.1%. The physically active group showed higher SCS scores and a greater use of PIEDs. Of the physically active participants, 84.2% reported variations in their fitness routine. Perceived benefit of exercising resulted significantly higher in those with EA. Subjects with EA reported stronger motivation in engaging in physical activity as for ""physical wellness,"" ""psychological well-being,"" and ""sexual attractiveness and confidence in relationship."" A higher level of AA, a lower level of self-compassion, and a higher perceived benefit of exercising during lockdown were all significant predictors for the presence of EA. Our findings suggest that the fear of getting sick from Covid-19, combined with radical changes in the lifestyles induced by the lockdown and individual personological characteristics, can favor the development of EA and related phenomena in the general population.","Ceci, Di Carlo, Burkauskas, Salone, De Luca, Cicconcelli, Giorgetti, La Fratta, Todaro, Simonato, Martinotti, di Giannantonio, Corazza","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-022-00815-z","20220426","Appearance anxiety; Covid-19; Exercise addiction; Performance and image enhancing drugs; Self-compassion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30645,""
"Suicide and Suicide Attempts Among Patients Attending Primary Health Care Facilities in Uganda: A Medical Records Review","Suicide is one of the leading causes of death globally, accounting for about 800,000 deaths annually. The suicide burden drastically increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Uganda, no known study has determined the suicide rate since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. To determine the suicide mortality rate and describe the characteristics of victims of suicide attempts from January to December 2020 in south western Uganda. This study was based on the health management information systems (HMIS) of patients' registered data for the year 2020 at 15 selected primary health care facilities in four districts in south-western Uganda. We used a data extraction tool to capture demographic and clinical characteristics of the individuals who had attempted or completed suicide. We estimated yearly incidence rates of fatal and non-fatal suicide attempts, and used chi-square and <i>t</i>-test to determine the statistical difference between suicide attempt outcomes. A total of 130 non-fatal suicide attempts and 26 suicides were identified. Majority were male 69.87% (n = 109/156) and the mean age was 27.16 (SD = 14.71) years. The overall incidence of suicide attempts was about 60 attempts per 100,000 people, while that of completed suicide was about three deaths per 100,000 people. The suicide attempts increased following the first month of COVID-19 lockdown in the country (March 2020) and most individuals attempted suicide by poisoning (n = 144). Suicide is a common occurrence in primary health care settings of Uganda and there has been a rapid increase in suicide attempts since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. With suicide by poisoning being common, there is need for proactive interventions, such as the control of pesticides and herbicides, to prevent suicide among members of this community, especially during pandemic conditions.","Kaggwa, Rukundo, Wakida, Maling, Sserumaga, Atim, Obua","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S358187","20220426","COVID-19; Uganda; non-fatal suicide attempt; pandemic; primary health care; suicide; suicide attempt","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30646,""
"How Do Happiness at Work and Perceived Organizational Support Affect Teachers' Mental Health Through Job Satisfaction During the COVID-19 Pandemic?","The role of happiness at work (HW) on mental health (MH) in the education sector in Indonesia has not been widely examined. Additionally, the inconsistent results of previous studies on the relationship between job satisfaction (JS) and MH have led to the uncertainty of JS being a mediator. This study aims to fill the gap in knowledge by examining the effect of HW and perceived organizational support (POS) on teachers' MH, with JS as a mediator. This research employed a quantitative approach with a cross-sectional study design, using partial least squares structural equation modeling with SmartPLS software. The research participants included 490 teachers in the Special Capital Region of Jakarta province. The results indicate that HW is the highest predictor of teachers' MH, and POS is the highest predictor of JS. Another notable finding is that JS was found to have a positive but not significant effect on teachers' MH. However, it did impact the failure of the mediation relationship of this research model, which did not align with previous studies' findings. Schools must pay attention to HW to improve teachers' MH. Additionally, they should provide support to teachers to increase their JS, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sudibjo, Manihuruk","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S361881","20220426","happiness at work; job satisfaction; mental health; perceived organizational support; teacher","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30647,""
"Emotional Functioning in the Context of Health Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Health Sciences Students: The Polish Case","The fear for health, uncertainty, loss of freedom, boredom, and frustration accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic caused mental health burdens. Young people are particularly at a risk of emotional functioning problems. The aim of this manuscript was to verify the relationships between health behaviors and emotional functioning in health sciences students during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. The study group comprised 493 Polish health sciences students (314 women, 179 men) aged 21.5 Ã‚Â± 2.25 years. The intensity of health behaviors was examined using the Health Behavior Inventory (HBI). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was carried out to assess symptoms of anxiety and depression. Stress levels were examined with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). The online versions of psychological scales were created using Google Forms software. Mild anxiety symptoms were observed in 21% of examined students and moderate-to-severe in 28%. Mild depressive symptoms were observed in 14% of the study group, and 8% of the examined students suffered from moderate-to-severe depression. The mean perceived stress result was high (22.2 Ã‚Â± 4.1 pts.). The overall intensity of health behavior was, at the mean level, significantly higher in females compared to males. The odds of developing severe symptoms in terms of anxiety, depression, and stress in students with high levels of health-related behaviors were respectively: four times, more than seven times, and nine times lower compared to students with lower levels of these behaviors. Undertaking regular pro-health behavior decreased the odds of developing severe symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress in health sciences students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","DÃ„â„¢bska-Janus, DÃ„â„¢bski, GÃ…â€šÃƒÂ³wczyÃ…â€žski, Rozpara, Badura-Brzoza","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S352279","20220426","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; depression; health behaviors; stress; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30648,""

The study included a quantitative survey focused on COVID-19 administered to 50 people who use drugs and semi-structured qualitative interviews with 17 people who use drugs, 12 of whom also participated in the quantitative survey. Descriptive statistics were run for the quantitative data. Qualitative coding was line-by-line then grouped thematically. Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated during analysis. Findings demonstrate how COVID-19 disruptions at the structural and community level affected outcomes related to mental health and drug use at the individual level. Themes that emerged from the qualitative interviews were (1) lack of employment opportunities, (2) food and housing insecurity, (3) community stigma impacting health service use, (4) mental health strains, and (5) drug market disruptions. Structural and community changes increased anxiety, depression, and loneliness on the individual level, as well as changes in drug use patterns, all of which are likely to increase overdose risk. The COVID-19 pandemic, and mitigation strategies aimed at curbing infection, disrupted communities and lives of people who use drugs. These disruptions altered individual drug use and mental health outcomes, which could increase risk for overdose. We recommend addressing structural and community factors, including developing multi-level interventions, to combat overdose. Trial registration Clinicaltrails.gov: NCT04427202.

"Experiences of parents and patients hospitalised in a child psychiatric unit for anorexia nervosa after reorganisation of care imposed by the COVID-19 Pandemic in France: a qualitative study-The QUALICOVID study","Anorexia nervosa is a serious, albeit common mental illness that generally occurs during adolescence. Although outpatient care is recommended, hospitalisation is sometimes required. There is a dedicated hospitalisation unit caring for children and adolescents presenting with anorexia nervosa in Nancy, France. However, on 16 March 2020, a national lockdown was declared by the French government as the COVID-19 pandemic escalated in France. This resulted in the adjustment of hospital admissions accompanied by premature discharge and an intensive outpatient care programme. In the light of such changes, consideration should be given to the potential impact of changes in the care pattern for anorexic patients and their parents. The purpose of our study was to explore the experiences of anorexia nervosa patients hospitalised in the unit, and their parents, following changes in the care strategy. The study was conducted between weeks four and eight after lockdown was announced. The study cohort included all the patients treated for anorexia nervosa and hospitalised in the treatment unit before 16 March 2020 and their parents. A qualitative method was used and every subject was offered a semi-structured interview. Data were analysed by means of inductive thematic analysis. Seven superordinate themes were identified: positive aspects, concerns, preparation, loss of landmarks and hospital security, gradual return to a ""normal"" life, relational aspects and the likelihood of disease progression. Moreover, all the parents and patients were satisfied with the intensive outpatient care offered on discharge. Despite initial ambivalence, all patients and their parents viewed this unexpected hospital discharge positively in these exceptional conditions. This suggests that restructuring the care programme could prove beneficial with increasing use of outpatient management, thereby reducing the length of the hospital stay and adjusting the return to school. ID-RCB 2020-A01101-38-This project was approved by the ComitÃƒÂ© de Protection des Personnes (CPP) Sud MÃƒÂ©diterranÃƒÂ©e IV [South Mediterranean IV Ethics Committee (EC)] on 5 May 2020. Anorexia nervosa is a common mental health condition in the adolescent population. A set care protocol is in place and patients presenting this condition experience difficulty in adapting to change. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was escalating in France and a national lockdown was declared by the French government on 16 March. In Nancy, France, we opted for premature discharge where possible and an intensive outpatient care programme in accordance with government recommendations. The purpose of our study was to investigate the experiences of patients and their parents regarding changes in the care strategy following lockdown. We found that patients and parents viewed the reorganisation of care in a positive light, particularly in terms of absence from school and intensive outpatient care. Our research could also benefit adolescents presenting with anorexia nervosa and undergoing restructuring of their care programme.","Sourlier, Bozzi, Kabuth, Lamourette, Ligier","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-022-00579-w","20220426","Adolescent psychiatry; Anorexia nervosa; COVID-19 pandemic; Care reorganisation; Hospitalisation; Qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30650,""
"The effect of exercise on resilience, its mediators and moderators, in a general population during the UK COVID-19 pandemic in 2020: a cross-sectional online study","Resilience is central to positive mental health and well-being especially when faced with adverse events. Factors such as exercise, location, sleep, mental health, and personality are moderators and mediators of resilience. However, the impact of these factors on resilience during severe adverse events are unknown. The present study examined how the COVID-19 pandemic affected resilience and its moderators and mediators by investigating whether there was a difference in resilience and quality of life between people with varying levels of exercise, including those who changed their exercise levels pre and during a COVID-19-related lockdown, and whether location affected the relationship between levels of exercise and resilience and quality of life. Following ethical approval, a cross-sectional online survey capturing data on self-reported key moderators and mediators of resilience before and during the COVID-19 lockdown imposed on the 23rd March 2020 in the UK was distributed via social media and completed over a three week time period during July 2020 via a self-selecting sample of the general population (NÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°85). The key moderators and mediators of resilience the survey assessed were exercise, location, life-orientation, mental health, and sleep quality. All data were self-reported. Participants' exercise intensity level increased as resilience increased (F(2,82)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.22, pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°.003: Wilks' lambdaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.82, partial n<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.09). The relationship between exercise, and resilience and quality of life was independent of sleep and mental health status pre-lockdown (pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°.013, pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°.027 respectively). In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, this relationship was dependent on mental health but not sleep quality (pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;.001 for resilience pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°.010 for quality of life). There were no statistically significant differences between participants living in urban or rural locations. Exercise is strongly correlated to resilience and during a pandemic such as COVID-19 it becomes a mechanism in which to moderate resilience. The relationship between exercise and resilience is supported by this study. The influence that a pandemic had on mental health is mediated by its effect on quality of life.","Lancaster, Callaghan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13070-7","20220426","Exercise; Mental health; Quality of life; Resilience; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-27","",30651,""
