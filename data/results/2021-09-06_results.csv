"COVID-19 vaccination did not improve employee mental health: A prospective study in an early phase of vaccination in Japan","The effect of the COVID-19 vaccination as an individual-based preventive measure on mental health is largely unclear in the literature. The authors report a preliminary finding on whether vaccination effectively improves mental health among employees in Japan based on a prospective study (E-COCO-J). Of the total sample (N=948), 105 (11.1%) were vaccinated at least once at the follow-up survey (June 2021). There was no significant effect of vaccination on the change of psychological distress at baseline (February 2021) and follow-up (June 2021), after adjusting for gender, age, marital status, education, chronic disease, company size, industry, and occupation (healthcare workers or non-HCWs). Providing continuous mental health care for employees is important in an early vaccination phase.","Natsu Sasaki; Reiko Kuroda; Kanami Tsuno; Kotaro Imamura; Norito Kawakami","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.02.21262808","20210905","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-06","",17683,""
"Using multivariate models to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and gender differences on health and health care","Objective: To examine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effect of sex, and the joint effect of sex and the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to health communication, physical activity, mental health, and behavioral health. Methods: We drew data from the National Cancer Institute's 2020 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS). We described and compared the characteristics of social determinants of health, physical activity, mental health, alcohol use, patterns of social networking service use, and health information data sharing. Analyses were weighted to provide nationally representative estimates. Multivariate models (multiple linear regression, multiple logistic regression, and multinomial logistic model) were used to assess the sole and joint effect of sex and pandemic. In addition, we applied the Bonferroni correction to adjust p-values to decrease the risks of type I errors when making multiple statistical tests. Results: Women are more likely to use mobile health and health communication technologies. The effect of sex after the COVID-19 pandemic is significant on mental health, and women are more possible to have depression or anxiety disorders. The effect of sex is also significant before and after the pandemic regarding seeking health or medical information. Women have a smaller quantity and intensity of physical activity, which has a negative effect on health. Conclusion: Gender differences exist regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic and the pandemic amplifies the differences in some health and health care domains. Intersectional gender analyses are integral to addressing issues that arise and mitigating the exacerbation of inequities. Responses to the pandemic should consider diverse perspectives, including sex and gender.","Jiancheng Ye; Zhimei Ren","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.02.21263055","20210905","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-06","",17684,""
"Monthly suicide rates during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from Japan","This paper uses 2018â€“2020 prefectureâ€“monthâ€“year, genderâ€“monthâ€“year, and age groupâ€“monthâ€“year level data on suicide rates in Japan to document how suicide rates are evolving during the COVID-19 pandemic. I use a monthly event study design to study changes in suicide rates surrounding Japanâ€™s COVID-19 state of emergency and to trace out monthly changes in suicide rates during the first 11 months of 2020 relative to 2018â€“2019. I find that monthly suicide rates during the pandemic started increasing meaningfully in Juneâ€“July 2020. I find that women experienced greater increases in suicide rates than men, relative to their 2018â€“2019 average suicide rate, and that women experienced the largest increase in suicide rates in October 2020. I also find descriptive evidence that in terms of suicide, individuals under 30 years old were faring worse during the pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2021.110014","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-06","",17685,""

"Association between dietary satisfaction and depression, anxiety and stress in obese and overweight patients during the coronavirus pandemic","Background & aim The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health threat. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between D-Sat and depression, anxiety and stress in obese patients during the coronavirus pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional study in 228 obese and overweight women on a weight loss diet was conducted through the use of two questionnaires. General characteristics, anthropometric indices, D-Sat and mental status were assessed in these patients. Results The greatest weight loss (WL) and waist circumference (WC) change was associated with the highest tertile of the D-Sat score in the first four months of the coronavirus pandemic (PÂ <Â 0.05). Participants with the highest tertile of all D-sat score compared to those with the lowest had an 84% decrease in odds of depression. The highest tertile was also associated with decreased odds of anxiety (OR: 0.32 95%CI: 0.14; 0.68) The adjusted odds of stress score were negatively associated to the highest tertile of the D-Sat score (OR: 0.09, 95%CI (0.03, 0.23). WL was inversely related to stress (PÂ <Â 0.05). Participants with higher WL and WC reduction had fewer depressive symptoms (PÂ <Â 0.05). Sleep time and family income were associated with obesity. Conclusions D-Sat and positive personal and family dynamics can improve the mental status of obese and overweight patients during quarantine.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.07.013","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-06","",17689,""
