"Addressing pediatric mental health using telehealth during COVID-19 and beyond: A narrative review","The pediatrician continues to serve as a frontline provider addressing patients' medical and mental health needs, yet COVID-19 is reshaping the way physicians deliver such care. Pediatricians are increasingly faced with the challenge of delivering healthcare, including mental health care, remotely. Given the rapidly evolving literature, we performed a narrative review of the use of telehealth for mental health care for pediatric populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Areas of focus included 1) pediatric primary care settings, 2) special pediatric populations (e.g., eating disorders, autism), 3) access and engagement in telehealth care, and 4) training opportunities available for mental health providers. Themes that emerged across studies included the importance of meeting patients' needs (e.g., access to technological resources) to optimize success in using telehealth tools and challenges around provider access to evidence-based tools for use during telehealth. Thus, we offered evidence-based tools (including COVID-19 specific resources) for improving the delivery of mental health care by pediatricians via telehealth. We also reviewed future directions including trials currently underway that will enhance understanding of future telehealth applications for pediatric mental health care.","Cunningham, Ely, Garcia, Bowden","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2021.06.002","20210612","COVID-19; Mental Health; Pediatric; Primary Care; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-13","",14803,""
"Global survey on disruption and mitigation of neurological services during COVID-19: the perspective of global international neurological patients and scientific associations","The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has dramatically disrupted healthcare systems. Two rapid WHO pulse surveys studied disruptions in mental health services, but did not particularly focus on neurology. Here, a global survey was conducted and addresses the impact of the pandemic on neurology services. A cross-sectional study was carried out in which 34 international neurological associations were asked to distribute the survey to national associations. The responses represented the national situation, in November-December 2020, with regard to the main disrupted neurological services, reasons and the mitigation strategies implemented as well as the disruption on training of residents and on neurological research. A comparison with the situation in February-April 2020, first pandemic wave, was also requested. 54 completed surveys came from 43 countries covering all the 6 WHO regions. Overall, neurological services disruption was reported as mild by 26%, moderate by 30%, complete by 13% of associations. The most affected services were cross-sectoral neurological services (57%) and neurorehabilitation (56%). The second wave of the pandemic, however, was associated with the improvement of service provision for diagnostics services (44%) and for neurorehabilitation (41%). Governmental directives were the major cause of services' disruption (56%). Mitigation strategies were mostly established through telemedicine (48%). Almost half of respondents reported a significant impact on neurological research (48%) and educational activities (60%). Most associations (67%) were not involved in decision making for neurological patients' issues by their national government. The COVID-19 pandemic affects neurological services and raises the universal need for the development of neurological health care at the policy, systems and services levels. A global national plan on mitigation strategies for disruption of neurological services during pandemic situations should be established and neurological scientific and patients associations should get involved in decision making.","Triki, Leonardi, Mallouli, Cacciatore, Karlshoej, Magnani, Newton, Pilotto, Saylor, Westenberg, Walsh, Winkler, Thakur, Okubadejo, Garcia-Azorin","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-021-10641-3","20210612","COVID-19; Health services administration; Neurological services; Neurology; Policies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-13","",14804,""
"Cross-national comparison of psychosocial well-being and diabetes outcomes in adults with type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic in US, Brazil, and Iran","The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health emergency, which presents wide-ranging negative impacts on individuals with diabetes. To examine psychosocial well-being and diabetes outcomes in individuals with type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic, and investigate how these factors vary in different countries. Between April and June 2020 we employed a cross national comparative research study in the United States (US), Brazil, and Iran to collect data from 1788 adults with type 1 diabetes using web-based survey. Study participants answered questions relevant to diabetes distress, diabetes burnout, depressive symptoms, COVID-19 related changes, and socio-demographic characteristics. They also reported their last Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and daily Time-in-Range (TiR) blood glucose. We analyzed data using comparative tests (Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis and McNemar test), logistic and linear regression adjusted for fixed effects. There were significant changes prior and during the pandemic regarding access to diabetes care, diabetes supplies and medications, healthy food and safe places to exercise in all countries (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Participants in Iran experienced higher levels of diabetes distress (57.1%), diabetes burnout (50%), and depressive symptoms (60.9%), followed by Brazil and US (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). US participants reported better glycemic control (HbA1cÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.97%, T1RÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°69.64%) compared to Brazil (HbA1cÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.94%, T1RÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°51.95%) and Iran (HbA1cÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.47%, T1RÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°51.53%) (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). There were also significant relationships between psychosocial well-being, diabetes outcomes, socio-demographic data, and COVID-19 related challenges in overall sample (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Regardless of differences among US, Brazil, and Iran, our findings revealed that different countries may experience similar challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic which can impact negatively diabetes outcomes and psychosocial well-being in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Countries need to consider modifiable variables associated with poor diabetes outcomes and sub optimal psychosocial well-being and target vulnerable population using significant socio-demographic variables.","Abdoli, Silveira, Doosti-Irani, Fanti, Miller-Bains, Pavin, Cardoso, Vardanjani, Noorjan, Hessler","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13098-021-00681-0","20210612","Burnout; COVID-19; Depression; Diabetes; Distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-13","",14805,""
