"Social Capital-Accrual, Escape-From-Self, and Time-Displacement Effects of Internet Use During the COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Period: Prospective, Quantitative Survey Study","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread like wildfire across the globe, prompting many governments to impose unprecedented stay-at-home orders to limit its transmission. During an extended stay-at-home period, individuals may engage in more online leisure activities. Internet use is a double-edged sword that may have both desirable and undesirable effects on psychological well-being, and this study sought to disentangle adaptive from maladaptive internet use amidst this unusual health crisis. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of probable depression during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period and to test three hypothesized risk reduction or risk elevation mechanisms, namely social capital-accrual, escape-from-self, and time-displacement effects. METHODS: This study took place from March to May 2020 at the early stage of the pandemic. The study adopted a prospective design, with an online survey administered to 573 UK and 474 US adult residents at two assessment points 2 months apart. RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate to severe depression was 36% (bootstrap bias-corrected and accelerated [BCa] 95% CI 33%-39%) at Time 1 (ie, initial time point) and 27% (bootstrap BCa 95% CI 25%-30%) at Time 2 (ie, follow-up time point). The results supported the social capital-accrual hypothesis by showing that the approach coping style was inversely associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both social networking and perceived family support. The results also supported the escape-from-self hypothesis by revealing that the avoidant coping style was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both gaming and cyberbullying victimization, but the serial mediation model was no longer significant after Time 1 depression and some demographic risk factors had been controlled for. Finally, the results supported the time-displacement hypothesis by showing that gaming was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its inverse associations with social networking and perceived family support. CONCLUSIONS: During the extended stay-at-home period in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of probable depression during the 2-month study period was high among the UK and US residents. Individuals with distinct coping styles may engage in different types of online leisure activities and perceive varying levels of social support, which are associated with risks of probable depression.","Cheng, Cecilia; Lau, Yan-Ching; Luk, Jeremy W","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/22740","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e22740, 2020 Dec 24.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e22740, 2020 Dec 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-30","",8634,""
"Anxiety and Suicidal Thoughts During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Country Comparative Study Among Indonesian, Taiwanese, and Thai University Students","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of university students. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the psychological responses toward COVID-19 among university students from 3 countries-Indonesia, Taiwan, and Thailand. METHODS: We used a web-based, cross-sectional survey to recruit 1985 university students from 5 public universities (2 in Indonesia, 1 in Thailand, and 1 in Taiwan) via popular social media platforms such as Facebook, LINE, WhatsApp, and broadcast. All students (n=938 in Indonesia, n=734 in Thailand, and n=313 in Taiwan) answered questions concerning their anxiety, suicidal thoughts (or sadness), confidence in pandemic control, risk perception of susceptibility to infection, perceived support, resources for fighting infection, and sources of information in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Among the 3 student groups, Thai students had the highest levels of anxiety but the lowest levels of confidence in pandemic control and available resources for fighting COVID-19. Factors associated with higher anxiety differed across countries. Less perceived satisfactory support was associated with more suicidal thoughts among Indonesian students. On the other hand, Taiwanese students were more negatively affected by information gathered from the internet and from medical staff than were Indonesian or Thai students. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that health care providers in Thailand may need to pay special attention to Thai university students given that high levels of anxiety were observed in this study population. In addition, health care providers should establish a good support system for university students, as the results of this study indicate a negative association between support and suicidal thoughts.","Pramukti, Iqbal; Strong, Carol; Sitthimongkol, Yajai; Setiawan, Agus; Pandin, Moses Glorino Rumambo; Yen, Cheng-Fang; Lin, Chung-Ying; Griffiths, Mark D; Ko, Nai-Ying","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24487","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e24487, 2020 Dec 24.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(12): e24487, 2020 Dec 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-30","",8635,""
"Psychological Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Hungarian Adults","We aimed to explore psychological effects of the coronavirus pandemic on Hungarian adults in the time of the national quarantine situation in May 2020.We conducted a cross-sectional observational study with the use of an anonymous online questionnaire that consisted of 65 items. The following measuring instruments were used: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10); The General Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD)-2; The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2; European Quality of Life Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS); Self-administered inventory of complaints (Hungarian questionnaire); Shortened (Hungarian) version of the Ways of Coping Questionnaire; 2 open-ended questions to examine the participants' mood and ways of coping during the pandemic. The data of 431 participants were analyzed, their average age was 47.53 Ã‚Â± 11.66 years, and the percentage of females was 90%. The mean of participants' scores were the following: 19.34 Ã‚Â± 7.97 for perceived stress, 73.05 Ã‚Â± 21.73 for health status, and 8.68 Ã‚Â± 4.65 for neurotic complaints. Thirty-four and one-tenth percent of participants were depressed, 36.2% were anxious, and they tended to use problem-focused coping strategies more frequently than emotion-focused ones. We found significant correlations between all of the seven examined psychological variables. Our results highlight the importance of stress management in the psychological support of healthy adults in quarantine situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic.","SzabÃƒÂ³, PukÃƒÂ¡nszky, KemÃƒÂ©ny","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249565","20201229","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; coping skills; depression; health status; psychological stress; questionnaire design","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-30","",8636,""
"Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) combined with Chinese and Western medicine based on &quot;Internal and External Relieving -Truncated Torsion&quot; strategy","The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic since December 2020. It has not only associated with physiological disorder but also with psychological distress and symptoms of mental illness. Whether the vaccines and antivirals can provide protects remains unknown. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is recommended as an alternative and significant way of preventing and treating COVID-19 in China. However, few studies have assessed the benefits of this treatment and mental health after they recover. Our study is designed to investigate effects and safety when using TCM on the course of this disease and the impact of COVID-19 on pandemic-related anxiety. For this prospective cohort study, we will enroll 300 COVID-19 patients aged 18 to 80 years at 4 centers. We divide them into 2 groups, according to whether they use Baidu Jieduan Granule at a ratio of 1:1. We will compare treatments combined Baidu Jieduan Granule with conventional Western medicine (experimental group) vs treatment of conventional Western medicine only (control group). The basic information of patients including demographic, general condition, primary diseases, and complications will be assessed. Related examines will be conducted at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days. The primary outcomes are clinical outcome. A follow-up time of 1 year (to June 30, 2021) allow us to evaluate the psychiatric disorder after recovery. We will monitor adverse events throughout the trial. It will be the first prospective cohort study which uses Baidu Jieduan Granule, based on the innovation traditional Chinese medicine strategy of &quot; Internal and External Relieving -Truncated Torsion &quot; to treat the common type of COVID-19. The result of this study may provide evidence-based recommendations of TCM for treatment and psychological distress or symptoms of mental illness of the common type of COVID-19.","Wu, Lu, Guo, Cao, Zhang, Liu, Qu, Peng, Che, Fang, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000023874","20201229","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-30","",8637,""
"Psychosocial and health behavioural impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on adults in the USA: protocol for a longitudinal cohort study","Although social distancing may help contain the spread of COVID-19, the social isolation and loneliness it causes can heighten stress, contribute to unhealthy lifestyle behaviours and have deleterious effects on social relationships. This ongoing longitudinal cohort study aims to (1) characterise the psychological, social and health behavioural impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic over a 12-month period in the USA; (2) determine whether these impacts differ for certain subgroups based on sociodemographics and other individual-level factors; and (3) explore whether there are modifiable factors (eg, coping, social support) that moderate the effects of the pandemic over time. Adults (aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years) who were fluent in either English or Spanish were recruited via social media and invited to complete an online survey during the 8-week period from 13 April to 8 June 2020 (baseline). Follow-up surveys will be conducted 6 and 12 months after baseline. Data transformations, non-parametric tests or other alternative methods will be used when appropriate. Descriptive statistics and cross-sectional analyses will be performed. Longitudinal associations will be analysed using multilevel modelling with time-variant and time-invariant predictors of change in trajectory over the study period. Research ethics approval was received from the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board (H-47505). Overall, this study will provide timely information that can be used to inform public health messaging strategies and guide development of assessment tools and interventions to support vulnerable individuals dealing with the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Badr, Oluyomi, Adel Fahmideh, Raza, Zhang, El-Mubasher, Amos","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044642","20201229","COVID-19; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-30","",8638,""
"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers at acute hospital settings in the South-East of Ireland: an observational cohort multicentre study","Our study aims to understand the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers (HCWs) at acute hospital settings in the South-East of Ireland, as a crucial step in guiding policies and interventions to maintain their psychological well-being. Observational cohort study. 472 HCWs participated from two distinct acute hospital settings, A and B, in the South-East of Ireland. Measures of psychological distress-depression, anxiety, acute and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-as dictated by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). An independent sample t-test and a Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine significance of difference in continuous variables between groups. Categorical variables were assessed for significance with a Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> test for independence. The DASS-21 provided independent measures of depression (mean 4.57, IQR 2-7), anxiety (mean 3.87, IQR 1-6) and stress (mean 7.41, IQR 4-10). Positive scores were reflected in 201 workers (42.6%) for depression and 213 (45.1%) for both anxiety and stress. The IES-R measured subjective distress on three subscales: intrusion (mean 1.085, IQR 0.375-1.72), avoidance (mean 1.008, IQR 0.375-1.5) and hyperarousal (mean 1.084, IQR 0.5-1.667). Overall, 195 cases (41.3%) were concerning for PTSD. Site B scored significantly higher across all parameters of depression (5.24 vs 4.08, p&lt;0.01), anxiety (4.66 vs 3.3, p&lt;0.01), stress (8.91 vs 6.33, p&lt;0.01) and PTSD (0.058 vs 0.043, p&lt;0.01). Worse outcomes were also noted in HCWs with underlying medical ailments. Psychological distress is prevalent among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic; screening for adverse mental and emotional outcomes and developing timely tailored preventative measures with effective feedback are vital to protect their psychological well-being, both in the immediate and long-term.","Ali, Maguire, Marks, Doyle, Sheehy","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042930","20201229","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; health policy; psychiatry; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-30","",8639,""
"Anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with poor sleep health during a period of COVID-19-induced nationwide lockdown: a cross-sectional analysis of adults in Jordan","Jordan, a Middle Eastern country, declared a state of national emergency due to COVID-19 and a strict nationwide lockdown on 17 March 2020, banning all travel and movement around the country, potentially impacting mental health. This study sought to investigate the association between mental health (eg, anxiety and depressive symptoms) and sleep health among a sample of Jordanians living through a state of COVID-19-induced nationwide lockdown. Using Facebook, participants (n=1240) in Jordan in March 2020 were recruited and direct to a web-based survey measuring anxiety (items from General Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale instrument), depressive symptoms (items from Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), sleep health (items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and sociodemographic. A modified Poisson regression model with robust error variance. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% CIs were estimated to examine how anxiety and depressive symptoms may affect different dimensions of sleep health: (1) poor sleep quality, (2) short sleep duration, (3) encountering sleep problems. The majority of participants reported having experienced mild (33.8%), moderate (12.9%) or severe (6.3%) levels of anxiety during lockdown, and nearly half of respondents reported depressive symptoms during lockdown. Similarly, over 60% of participants reported having experienced at least one sleep problem in the last week, and nearly half reported having had short sleep duration. Importantly, anxiety was associated with poor sleep health outcomes. For example, corresponding to the dose-response relationship between anxiety and sleep health outcomes, those reporting severe anxiety were the most likely to experience poor sleep quality (aPRÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=8.95; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI=6.12 to 13.08), short sleep duration (aPRÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=2.23; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI=1.91 to 2.61) and at least one problem sleep problem (aPR=1.73; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI=1.54 to 1.95). Moreover, depressive symptoms were also associated with poor sleep health outcomes. As compared with scoring in the first quartile, scoring fourth quartile was associated with poor sleep quality (aPR=11.82; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI=6.64 to 21.04), short sleep duration (aPR=1.87; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI=1.58 to 2.22), and experiencing at least one sleep problem (aPR=1.90; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI=1.66 to 2.18). Increased levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms can negatively influence sleep health among a sample of Jordanian adults living in a state of COVID-19-induced nationwide lockdown.","Al-Ajlouni, Park, Alawa, Shamaileh, Bawab, El-Sadr, Duncan","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041995","20201229","infectious diseases; mental health; public health; sleep medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-30","",8640,""

"Mechanisms of Parental Stress During and After the COVID-19 Lockdown: A two-wave longitudinal study","Background: In the unpredictable times of the ongoing global coronavirus disease (COVID-19), parents worldwide are affected by stressors and strains that follow in the wake of the government-initiated distancing protocols. Objective: In a two-wave longitudinal survey, we examined levels of parental perceived stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression among a sample of parents at two time points; in the midst of the strictest government-initiated physical distancing protocols following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (T1, N = 2868) and three months after the protocols discontinued (T2, n = 1489). Further, we investigated the levels of parental stress, anxiety, and depression relative to perceived relationship quality and anger aimed at child(ren) at the two time points, including subgroups based on age, sex, cultural background, civil status, education level, number of children in household, employment status, and pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis. Methods and findings: Parents were asked to fill out a set of validated questionnaires on the two measurement occasions. As expected, the findings indicate that the high levels of parental stress significantly decreased from T1 to T2, indicating that the cumulative stressors that parentâ€™s experiences during distancing protocols declined as a function of the phaseout of the protocols. The decrease of perceived parental stress at the two time points, was accompanied by a significant decrease in symptoms of both depression and anxiety among the participating parents. Symptoms meeting the clinical cut-off for depression (23.0%) and generalized anxiety disorder (23.3%) were reported among participating parents at T1, compared to 16.8% and 13.8% respectively at T2. Reduction in depression and angry at child(ren) from T1 to T2 were further associated with a reduction in perceived parental stress. In addition, relationship quality and angry at child(ren) at T1 predicted change in parental stress. Conclusions: The findings underline some of the negative psychological impact of physical distancing protocols on parentâ€™s health and well-being. Parents who are facing physical distancing and remaining at home with their children may be particularly vulnerable to parental stress, anxiety and depression. Uncovering the nature of how these constructs are associated to parents and families facing social crisis, such as the ongoing pandemic, can contribute to design relevant interventions to reduce parental stress and strengthen parental coping and resilience.
