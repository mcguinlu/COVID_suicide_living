"Disruption of long-term psychological distress trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from three British birth cohorts","Importance. Mental health disorders were among the leading global contributors to years lived with disability prior to the COVID-19 pandemic onset, and growing evidence suggests that population mental health outcomes have worsened since the pandemic started. The extent that these changes have altered common age-related trends in psychological distress, where distress typically rises until mid-life and then falls in both sexes, is unknown. Objective. To analyse whether long-term pre-pandemic psychological distress trajectories have altered during the pandemic, and whether these changes have been different across generations and by sex. Design. Cross-cohort study with prospective data collection over a 40-year period (earliest time point: 1981; latest time point: February/March 2021). Setting. Population-based (adult general population), Great Britain. Participants. Members of three nationally representative birth cohorts which comprised all people born in Great Britain in a single week of 1946, 1958, or 1970, and who participated in at least one of the data collection waves conducted after the start of the pandemic (40.6%, 42.8%, 39.4%, respectively). Exposure(s). Time, COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s). Psychological distress factor scores, as measured by validated self-reported questionnaires. Results. 16,389 participants (2,175 from the 1946 birth cohort, 52.8% women; 7,446 from the 1958 birth cohort, 52.4% women; and 6,768 from the 1970 birth cohort, 56.2% women) participated in the study. By September/October 2020, psychological distress levels had reached or exceeded the levels of the peak in the pre-pandemic life-course trajectories, with larger increases in younger cohorts: Standardised Mean Differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of -0.02 [-0.07, 0.04], 0.05 [0.02, 0.07], and 0.09 [0.07, 0.12] for the 1946, 1958, and 1970 birth cohorts, respectively. Increases in distress were larger among women than men, widening the pre-existing inequalities observed in the pre-pandemic peak and in the most recent pre-pandemic assessment. Conclusions and Relevance. Pre-existing long-term psychological distress trajectories of adults born between 1946 and 1970 were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among women, who reached the highest levels ever recorded in up to 40 years of follow-up data. This may impact future trends of morbidity, disability, and mortality due to common mental health problems.","DarÃ­o Moreno-Agostino; Helen L. Fisher; Alissa Goodman; Stephani L.

"Nursing student attitudes toward nursing profession and their state anxiety level during COVID-19 outbreak","Objectives: This study was designed to investigate nursing students' attitudes toward the nursing profession and examine their state anxiety level during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: The population for this descriptive research was Turkish university nursing students. The study sample consisted of 1653 nursing students who participated in the study between April 25 and May 10, 2020. The Attitude Scale for Nursing Profession (ASNP) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used to collect the study data. The Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and the Spearman correlation test were used to evaluate the findings. Results: The mean score of the preference for the nursing profession (PNP) subscale of the ASNP was 51.13 +/- 8.61 and the mean score of the general attitude toward the nursing profession (GATNP) subscale score was 34.82 +/- 2.80. The mean STAI mean score was 43.95 +/- 11.17. There was a weak, negative relationship between the STAI and the PNP (r=-0.279) and the GATNP (r=-0.140) (p&lt;0.05).The 2 most important predictors of state anxiety level were motivation to join the nursing profession and being a female (p&lt;0.01). Conclusion: The students who participated in the study reported a moderate state anxiety level. Mental health assessments of student nurses are recommended, as well as efforts to increase their psychological resilience and ability to cope with stress.","Yuksel, A.; Yilmaz, E.

"Municipal workers' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives: The ongoing coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has a documented, continuing, adverse effect on mental health. The aim of this study was to evaluate aspects of the mental health of municipal employees who, like healthcare professionals, provide necessary services and have to work despite pandemic conditions. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in June 2020 with Istanbul district municipality employees who continued to work during the initial pandemic period of March-May 2020. The data were collected using a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item scale (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale via online survey. Results: The average age of the 775 participants was 40.2 +/- 8.0 years and 75.7% of the group was male. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was observed in 18.5% of the participants, and moderate-severe depression was recorded in 16.1%. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed a greater risk for depression and GAD, respectively, among those in the 30-39 age group (odds ratio [OR]: 2.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-5.79, p=0.027;OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.07-2.78, p=0.025), interacting with 20 people a day at work (OR: 2.73, 95% CI: 1.30-5.74, p=0.008;OR: 2.72, 95% CI: 1.32-5.60, p=.006). In addition, female participants (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.07-2.86, p=0.026) and those with a shortened work schedule (OR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.43-3.68, p=0.001) were at greater risk for anxiety, and those who had shift work (OR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.21-3.56, p=0.007) were at greater risk for depression. Conclusion: Among the municipal employees studied, women, those under the age of 40, those who worked a shorter schedule or alternating shifts, those who considered the physical workload to be heavy, those who interacted with the public during the course of their work, those who had a diagnosis of COVID-19 in their immediate circle, and those who had been in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 were at risk for GAD and depression. A multi-sectoral approach is required for successful epidemic control. Continuity of community mental health services that include primary, secondary, and tertiary protection should be ensured, employees at risk should be identified, and appropriate support provided for psychological treatment.","Ikiisik, H.; Turan, G.; Yilmaz, F.

"COVID-19 pandemic-related stress level and coping strategies in healthcare professionals from the designated referral hospital in Warsaw, Poland","Objective: Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, many healthcare workers had to face challenging and stressful situations. High-stress levels caused by the expected risk of contracting the disease can lead to severe mental disorders. We aimed to identify the stress level caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and coping strategies among staff from the designated referral hospital in Warsaw, Poland. Materials and methods: Data collected from 189 participants (152 females) including physicians, nurses, orderlies, and other medical and non-medical staff from various departments. Detailed analyses were performed based on the data of 54 physicians and 54 nurses with a mean age of 43.81 years (standard deviation, SD 11.57). The Perceived Stress Scale-10 was used to measure the stress levels, and the Brief COPE Inventory was employed to assess coping strategies. Results: Most participants experienced medium stress levels (57.4%), and one-third were severely stressed. In general, obtaining emotional support and acceptance was linked to lower stress levels. Behavioural disengagement and venting increased stress levels, mainly in nurses, who failed to implement any positive strategy, unlike doctors who used positive refraining, acceptance, and self-blame. Conclusions: Perceived stress levels depend on the occupation of healthcare professionals. An acceptance and positive refraining help cope with stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing emotional support and encouraging the implementation of other effective strategies is of key importance, as using non-adaptive strategies is a risk factor for mental health issues.","Barczak, A.; Bulinska-Stangrecka, H.; Hintze, B.; Lankiewicz-Serafin, M.; Kosior, D.

"COVID-19 and role of pharmacists: Knowledge and perceptions of pharmacists from Iraq and Syria","Objectives: To assess pharmacists from Syria and Iraq on their knowledge, readiness, and perspectives on their roles during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to investigate pharmacists' perceived barriers towards delivering their emergency roles during the COVID-19 pandemic and perceived policymakers' responsibilities. Methods: This cross-sectional study design was conducted in Iraq and Syria during COVID-19 outbreak over one month (April 2020). The study objectives were addressed through a validated online questionnaire. Data was analyzed using statistical package for social science (SPSS). Results: A total of 916 individuals participated in this study (447 from Iraq and 439 from Syria). Most of Iraqi participants were students while most of Syrian participants were graduates and technicians. The mean age for the Iraqi participants was 22.5 (SD= 4.1) while the mean age for the Syrian participants was 28.7 (SD= 9.1). A significant difference (p&lt; 0.001) was found in following the latest coronavirus updates on management among pharmacy graduates and technicians and undergraduate students. Media was reported as the most used source for knowledge about epidemics/pandemics among the Iraqi and the Syrian participants. Around 72% strongly agreed/agreed that the faculties of pharmacy have a role in preparing them to deal with epidemics/pandemics. In addition, 64.3% strongly agreed/agreed that pharmacist associations and societies have a role in preparing them to deal with epidemics/pandemics such as the coronavirus. Moreover, 82.9% believed that pharmacists should receive training programs on how to provide mental health support for people during epidemic and pandemic outbreaks. Conclusion: Tertiary pharmacy education providers and pharmacy professional bodies have a strong role in preparing pharmacists to deal with pandemics. Therefore, the importance of providing beforehand training programs on epidemics/pandemics management, workshops, lectures, and online information resources for such circumstances is crucial for pharmacists.","Basheti, I.

"Challenges facing Members of Canada's Defense Team at the Start of the Pandemic: Key Findings from the Defense Team COVID-19 Survey","Introduction: Due to the unprecedented impact of COVID-19, there is a need for research assessing pandemic-related challenges and stressors. The current study aimed to assess key concerns and general well-being among members of Canada's Defence Team, including Canadian Armed Forces personnel and members of the Department of National Defence (DND) Public Service. Methods: The COVID-19 Defence Team Survey was administered electronically to Defence Team staff in April and May of 2020 and was completed by 13 688 Regular Force, 5985 Reserve Force and 7487 civilian DND Public Service personnel. Along with demographic information, the survey included assessments of work arrangement, pandemic-related concerns, general well-being and social and organizational support. Weighted data (to ensure representation) were used in all analyses. Results: The majority of respondents were working from home, with a small minority unable to work due to restrictions. Though many concerns were endorsed by a substantial proportion of respondents, the most prevalent concerns were related to the health and well-being of loved ones. The majority of respondents reported their partner, family, supervisors, friends, colleagues and children provided general support. Half of the civilian defence staff and one-third of military respondents reported a decline in mental health. Women, younger respondents, those with dependents and, in some cases, those who were single without children were at risk of lower well-being. Conclusion: The pandemic has negatively impacted a substantial portion of the Defence Team. When responding to future crises, it is recommended that leaders of organizations provide additional supports to higher-risk groups and to supervisors who are ideally positioned to support employees during challenging times.","Lee, J.

"Well-being of Canadian Armed Forces members during the COVID-19 pandemic: Influence of health-promoting behaviors","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has been linked to increased depression, anxiety and other adverse mental health outcomes. Understanding the behaviours that positively influence health is important for the development of strategies to maintain andimprove well-being during the pandemic. Methods: This study focussed on Canadian Armed Forces Regular Force members (N = 13 668) who participated in the COVID-19 Defence Team Survey, administered between April and May 2020. The use of positive health behaviours and the extent to which such behaviours were associated with anxiety, depression and self-reported change in health and stress levels compared to before the pandemic were examined. Results: Depression and anxiety were experienced by 14% and 15% of the sample, respectively, while 36% reported that their mental health had gotten worse since the pandemic started, and close to half reported worse physical health and stress levels. The most common behaviours respondents reported engaging in to maintain or improve their health were exercising outdoors, healthy eating and connecting with loved ones. Although most behaviours were associated with better health outcomes, meditation and connecting with loved ones showed associations with worse health. Conclusion: Engaging in behaviours such as exercise and healthy eating was generally associated with better health outcomes. Unexpected relationships of meditation and connecting with loved ones are discussed in terms of their use in stressful times among those with mental health issues, past research on coping strategies and impacts of the pandemic and physical distancing on social connections. The findings may have implications for strategies to promote healthy behaviours during the remainder of the pandemic and similar crises in the future.","Sudom, K. A.; Lee, J. E.

"Locked-down!: how children's access and use of urban green spaces and playgrounds changed after COVID 19 outbreak","Slight more than a year ago, our lives have completely changed with a newly discovered virus. This new strain of Coronavirus family has rapidly infected many people in china. The virus, now commonly called COVID-19, has also transferred to almost every part of our world with international flights, causing a global pandemic. This new situation has changed many children's daily lives. During the first months of COVID-19 pandemics, almost 99.5% of all children in the world lived with movement restrictions and 60% lived under full or partial lockdowns. In Turkey, children locked down for over 2 months with no outside permission. This study aimed to understand effect of lockdown process on children's daily lives, physical activity patterns, and visits urban green spaces and playgrounds. The emerging findings illustrate that children's daily habits have changed during the lockdown. Many children showed symptoms of boredom, loneliness, lack of communication, anxiety and even depression. Children invested more time in watching TV. Slightly more than half of the children spent only around an hour for physical activity every day, and a third of children have spent no time on any physical activity. Percentage of children visiting urban green spaces and playgrounds declined rapidly. On average, children payed 27 minutes shorter visits to urban green spaces than they visited before COVID-19.","Bozkurt, M.","https://doi.org/10.25308/aduziraat.1007588","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Adnan Menderes Universitesi Ziraat Fakultesi Dergisi; 18(2):303-310, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30420,""

"COVID-19 and Redesign of the Late Modern Society","The article supports the hypothesis that the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 pandemic accelerated and legitimized societal change associated with the decline of representative democracy, mass employment and economic growth. The ideological coordinates of the society of mass labor are becoming obsolete as a relevant model of description. As a result, a decrease in the military, economic and civil-political significance of the majority is observed. The request of precariat groups to restore their usefulness in alternative criteria is expanding, which will eventually bring about a new political and economic normality. Civil protest intensified by the pandemic and the radical practices of minorities are part of the process of a critical revision of the consolidating values in the labor society and transition to a new normality. The conclusion is argued that the growth of ""unnecessary people"" actualizes demand for non-economic communitarian values and resources provided mainly by the state. The revision of the usual market and labor hierarchies of society is empirically confirmed by the value gap between generations. First, the pessimism in rising generation regarding the prospects of improving standard of living compared to previous generations. Second, the life strategies of generation Z prefer adaptive practices associated with rent-oriented behavior and loyalty to the generation of parents. Third, late modern society is characterized by a decline of political subjectivity. All this limits potential scope of future transformations, mainly related to basic unconditional income and selective expansion of rental access.Alternate :Ãâ€™ Ã‘ÂÃ‘â€šÃÂ°Ã‘â€šÃ‘Å’ÃÂµ ÃÂ¾ÃÂ±ÃÂ¾Ã‘ÂÃÂ½ÃÂ¾ÃÂ²Ã‘â€¹ÃÂ²ÃÂ°ÃÂµÃ‘â€šÃ‘ÂÃ‘Â ÃÂ³ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¿ÃÂ¾Ã‘â€šÃÂµÃÂ·ÃÂ°, Ã‘â€¡Ã‘â€šÃÂ¾ ÃÂ¿ÃÂ°ÃÂ½ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂ¼ÃÂ¸Ã‘Â COVID-19 Ã‘Æ’Ã‘ÂÃÂºÃÂ¾Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ¸ÃÂ»ÃÂ° ÃÂ¸ ÃÂ»ÃÂµÃÂ³ÃÂ¸Ã‘â€šÃÂ¸ÃÂ¼ÃÂ¸Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ¾ÃÂ²ÃÂ°ÃÂ»ÃÂ° Ã‘ÂÃÂ¾Ã‘â€ ÃÂ¸ÃÂ°ÃÂ»Ã‘Å’ÃÂ½Ã‘â€¹ÃÂµ ÃÂ¸ÃÂ·ÃÂ¼ÃÂµÃÂ½ÃÂµÃÂ½ÃÂ¸Ã‘Â, Ã‘ÂÃÂ²Ã‘ÂÃÂ·ÃÂ°ÃÂ½ÃÂ½Ã‘â€¹ÃÂµ Ã‘Â Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ¿ÃÂ°ÃÂ´ÃÂºÃÂ¾ÃÂ¼ ÃÂ¿Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂµÃÂ´Ã‘ÂÃ‘â€šÃÂ°ÃÂ²ÃÂ¸Ã‘â€šÃÂµÃÂ»Ã‘Å’ÃÂ½ÃÂ¾ÃÂ¹ ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂ¼ÃÂ¾ÃÂºÃ‘â‚¬ÃÂ°Ã‘â€šÃÂ¸ÃÂ¸, ÃÂ¼ÃÂ°Ã‘ÂÃ‘ÂÃÂ¾ÃÂ²ÃÂ¾ÃÂ¹ ÃÂ·ÃÂ°ÃÂ½Ã‘ÂÃ‘â€šÃÂ¾Ã‘ÂÃ‘â€šÃÂ¸ ÃÂ¸ Ã‘ÂÃÂºÃÂ¾ÃÂ½ÃÂ¾ÃÂ¼ÃÂ¸Ã‘â€¡ÃÂµÃ‘ÂÃÂºÃÂ¾ÃÂ³ÃÂ¾ Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ¾Ã‘ÂÃ‘â€šÃÂ°.

"Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health of Medical Students of Karachi, Pakistan","Background: The biggest dilemma of today's world is COVID-19. This pandemic situation has completely engulfed the globe with a rapidly increasing number of cases and has affected a great number of lives along with their lifestyle including the educational sector. Objective: This study explores the impact of COVID-19, how frequent lockdown, and online learning have affected the mental health of the students of medical college. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among the medical students of Karachi, in September 2021, in Jinnah Medical and Dental College. A total of 312 medical students were enrolled in the study. Out of which 208 were females and 104 were males. Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used to assess the mental health of students of medical college. Results: The results of the study revealed that a total of 312 medical students were enrolled in the study;belonging to the age group of (18-25) years. Approximately 104 (66 %) of female students experienced depression, 44 (21%) anxiety, and 60 (28%) stress. Hence gender and year of study of the participants were found to be significant (p-value&lt;0.05). The odds of first-year students showed high levels of anxiety as compared to final-year students (OR = 1.679, 95% CI [1.202-2.634], P = 0.002). Conclusion: This study will help in making relevant policies, mental health strategies and providing a better framework for the medical colleges and universities which is essential for the mental health of students.","Ahmed, F.

"Traumatic stress and positive growth amidst the COVID-19 pandemic","It is important to understand how people respond to catastrophic events and crises. The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak introduced widespread concern for impacts on mental health and wellbeing during and beyond the pandemic. Traumatic experiences result in numerous outcomes for people, including potential, positive changes in development and functioning. However, extant literature has not examined the relationship between indicators of negative and positive adaptation following trauma, nor has the literature delineated the mechanisms of action that drive these changes in people during chronic, traumatic events. This observational, cross-sectional study included a sample recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and the University of Kansas psychology subject pool. Retrospective data were available for 166 participants who completed a one-time, online survey for monetary compensation or course credit. Participants reporting higher levels of externally oriented (e.g., chance, powerful others) and spiritually oriented (e.g., God, higher power) control beliefs experienced more traumatic stress symptoms when thinking about their COVID-19 experiences. Traumatic stress symptoms and rumination were associated with positive growth scores in the expected directions. Interaction terms investigating health-related control beliefs as buffering effects on the relationships between rumination and positive psychological adaptation were non-significant. Results of these analyses are presented with conclusions, limitations, and recommendations for future investigations and clinical support.

"Experiences of pandemic coping during the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak and among college students in the United States","Over the past year, the novel coronavirus disease, also called SARS-COV-2 or COVID-19, has plunged the world into a period of upheaval and tragedy. Throughout the uncertainty, psychologists have attempted to stay abreast of the tidal wave of potential psychological impacts of the pandemic. Some scholars contributed predictions of what mental health consequences we might expect based on learnings from past viral outbreaks or on understandings of human sensibilities and behavior. Others studied the psychological outcomes in real time, allowing people to share their experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic as it unfolded. This dissertation contributes two texts to our growing base of pandemic knowledge.Part I includes a longitudinal study with surveys sent on March 18 and April 15 of 2020, two of the very first months of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. During this unique period of time, participants offered insight into their experiences of psychological distress and pandemic coping. Descriptive analyses showed widespread disruption to participants' lives and high rates of distress. Hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed reported use of Socially Supported Coping strategies was related to less loneliness, while use of Avoidant Coping strategies was associated with more loneliness and greater psychological distress overall.Methodological limitations - including use of a non-representative sample and adapted measures - are considered and implications for pandemic coping and adjustment are discussed. This study is one of relatively few conducted during this unique time period and holds both empirical and historical value as a look at the coping experiences of a subset of Americans during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.Part II includes a review of the current literature regarding the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students in the United States. Also discussed are empirically based recommendations for coping, including helping students cultivate social support, locate identity affirming spaces, build healthy routines, hold flexible mindsets and engage in positive coping, utilize psychotherapy, and access instrumental support.Together, these two texts comprise novel research findings, synthesis of scholarship, and clinical recommendations that may be useful to researchers, clinicians, historians, or any human interested in better understanding and navigating the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cognitive health","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has presented an extraordinary and unprecedented challenge to individuals, society and governments. Aside from the direct clinical impacts of COVID-19, the social restrictions are likely to have had considerable impacts on cognitive and mental health. Understanding these trends will be critical to improve future responses to outbreaks and to improve the treatment and care provided to individuals affected. Method PROTECT is an innovative online study (www.protect.org.uk) in adults aged 50 and over in the UK, Participants complete annual cognitive assessment and health measures including the PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Participants were divided into three cohorts (Normal Cognition, Stage 2 Early AD and Stage 3 Early AD, based on the FDA framework) using baseline data from the cognitive assessment battery. This analysis utilised data from a total of 5301 participants followed annually over the last 5 years, including the year of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also utilises the newly published FLAME composite cognitive measure that has shown sensitivity to cognitive decline. Result In the participants with worsening PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores between 2019 and 2020 (63%), composite measures of Speed [Stage 2: p=0.008, d=0.27;Stage 3: p=0.0006, d=0.17], and accuracy of Attention [Stage 2: p=0.004, d=0.11;Stage 3: p=0.0016, d=0.21], Memory [Stage 2: p=0.0011, d=0.3;Stage 3: p=0.0009, d=0.22] and Executive Function [p=0.08], as well as the composite FLAME measure [p=0.0014, d=0.28], showed a larger decline over the last 12 months compared to the prior assessment period. Whilst no significant increase in the rate of decline was seen in people without worsening of depression or anxiety. Conclusion The pandemic has had a detectable and significant detrimental impact on key aspects of cognitive health in adults over 50, including adults with early cognitive impairment (stage 2 and 3 pre-clinical AD in the FDA framework) mediated predominantly through worsening of mental health.","Brooker, Helen, Hayman, Vincent, Aarsland, Dag, Creese, Byron, Ballard, Clive, Corbett, Anne","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+impact+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic+on+cognitive+health","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association; 17(Suppl 10), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30430,""
"Attitude and behavior toward bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation during COVID-19 outbreak","Background: Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, have negative impacts on bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (BCPR) for fear of transmission while breaking social distancing rules. The latest guidelines recommend hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and facemask use. However, public willingness in this setup remains unknown. Methods: A cross-sectional, unrestricted volunteer Internet survey was conducted to assess individuals' attitudes and behaviors toward performing BCPR, pre-existing CPR training, occupational identity, age group, and gender. The raking method for weights and a regression analysis for the predictors of willingness were performed. Results: Among 1,347 eligible respondents, 822 (61%) had negative attitudes toward performing BCPR. Healthcare providers (HCPs) and those with pre-existing CPR training had fewer negative attitudes (p &lt; 0.001);HCPs and those with pre-existing CPR training and unchanged attitude showed more positive behaviors toward BCPR (p &lt; 0.001). Further, 9.7% of the respondents would absolutely refuse to perform BCPR. In contrast, 16.9% would perform BCPR directly despite the outbreak. Approximately 9.9% would perform it if they were instructed, 23.5%, if they wore facemasks, and 40.1%, if they were to perform hands-only CPR. Interestingly, among the 822 respondents with negative attitudes, over 85% still tended to perform BCPR in the abovementioned situations. The weighted analysis showed similar results. The adjusted predictors for lower negative attitudes toward BCPR were younger age, being a man, and being an HCP;those for more positive behaviors were younger age and being an HCP. Conclusions: Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, have negative impacts on attitudes and behaviors toward BCPR. Younger individuals, men, HCPs, and those with pre-existing CPR training tended to show fewer negative attitudes and behaviors. Meanwhile, most individuals with negative attitudes still expressed positive behaviors under safer measures such as facemask protection, hands-only CPR, and available dispatch instructions.

"Latinx adults and the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States: Evaluating a COVID-19 Knowledge Test -And identifying predictors of high knowledge and self-efficacy for COVID-19 risk reduction behaviors","Latinx communities in the United States made up 18% of the total population, yet accounted for 33% of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. This supported the study aim to increase Latinx COVID-19 knowledge and self-efficacy for performing COVID-19 risk reduction mitigation behaviors via dissemination of the new online e-health intervention of the ""Our COVID-19 Knowledge Test."" The study recruited online a largely female Latinx adult sample (N=118) with 68.6% born in the U.S. that was well-educated, given a mean education level of a bachelor's degree;and, a mean annual household income of $50,000 to $99,000. During the pandemic year of 2020, 46.5% of the survey participants experienced moderate to maximum/extreme cultural stress, and moderately high COVID-19 related stress-while 66.9% reported depression, 78.8% anxiety, and 45.2% trauma. Their high rates of COVID-19 depression and anxiety were more than double those rates reported across samples identified globally during the pandemic. They experienced significant declines in their self-rated mental health status and physical health status from pre-pandemic to during the pandemic, high social support, and closest to a good quality of life.Supporting the value of the new ""Our COVID-19 Knowledge Test"" as a brief online e-health intervention, paired t-tests showed statistically significant increases in self-ratings for both COVID-19 knowledge and self-efficacy for COVID-19 risk reduction behaviors after taking the True-False test. Participants endorsed the dissemination of the new True-False ""Our COVID-19 Knowledge Test"" with all True answers as a brief online e-health intervention they would recommend to others as a way to learn about COVID-19. Meanwhile, on this True-False test, the sample evidenced very high knowledge of COVID-19. The sample also had a high intention to vaccinate or already vaccinated at 87%.Findings from independent t-tests, Pearson correlations, and regression analyses collectively affirmed the critical importance of having both high knowledge and high self-efficacy for performing preventive behaviors for reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission, implementing mitigation strategies, and reducing mortality. Implications and recommendations focused on the value of the genre of a True-False test, with all True answers, for disseminating evidence-based information, and countering misinformation during pandemics and public health crises. Finally, the short tools used in this study were recommended for application in future research and as screening tools.

"Pandemic impact in care homes: Care homes perspectives","Background Care Homes (CH) are a vital resource in the health and social care system to support elderly people who may be unable to live at home independently. Older adults and carers have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus (COVID-19). With 410 00 people living in CH, we lack data of how these major changes have impacted CH, and how CH are managing during the pandemic outbreak. We require knowledge, including what policies and procedures CH currently have;how they are mitigating risks;and how current experiences and guidance can improve care of CH residents during the current pandemic and future crises. Method CH members of the Care Home Research Network (CHRN) were invited to take part on an online anonymous survey. An email invitation was sent to 225 CH, with surveys completed between August to October 2020. The questionnaire comprised of 49 questions, focusing on CH details, their views of the impact on the CH, staff and residents, and questions exploring strategies, ideas, and guidelines that the CH followed. Result Fifty care homes completed the survey. With 60% of the CH having between 10-40 beds, and 40% between 50 to more than 100 beds. 76% of the respondents felt that their institution had been affected by the pandemic, with 52% having residents dying due to COVID-19 and 68% had staff absent due to COVID-19. 94% of respondents felt an increased level of stress in their role due to COVID-19, with 22% saying that they could not cope with the increase in the workload and 52% hiring staff to cope with the workload. 70% of respondents felt that residents were feeling lonelier and 56% that residents were more depressed. Conclusion CH have been greatly impacted by the Pandemic, with increased anxieties and stress in staff, they lacked the support and resources needed to better overcome the challenges caused by this Pandemic. Moreover, residents were lonelier and more depressed, and their family members were more anxious/worried, requiring more resources from CH to support residents and family members. CH had to adapt, be innovative, find new working ways and using technology to meet residents and family needs.","Da Silva, Miguel Vasconcelos, Khan, Zunera, Comber, Tara, Aarsland, Dag, Testad, Ingelin, Ballard, Clive","https://www.google.com/search?q=Pandemic+impact+in+care+homes:+Care+homes+perspectives","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association; 17(Suppl 10), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30433,""

"Appreciative inquiry of a non-profit organization transitioning to teletherapy","Mental health professionals have been required to make a transition to delivering services using technology during the COVID-19 pandemic. The non-profit agency participating in this study had already listed on its strategic plan the delivery of teletherapy. In 2020, due to the pandemic, the agency decided to expedite the delivery of teletherapy services. This study explored the experiences of the agency's team, to determine what worked well while making this transition, as well as future dreams regarding the delivery of teletherapy. Appreciative inquiry was used as the method of data collection. Findings indicated the agency's clinicians found keeping a positive attitude themselves, receiving support from clients, and equal funding for teletherapy as for in person services on the part of the funders, were key to making the initial transition (Discovery phase);that agency clinicians considered that sustained outreach to both publicize and educate about teletherapy to clients and other community agencies had already proved helpful and is in need of more expansion (Dream phase);and that long term, agency clinicians would like to keep using teletherapy even after the pandemic (Design phase), with improved technology and additional training about teletherapy for both clients and clinicians (Destiny phase). The findings of this study may provide a foundation for other agencies that are in the process of transitioning from in person to virtual services.

"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Individuals with Pre-existing Mental Illnesses in India","One of the most important aspects of life that have been impacted by the pandemic is mental health. The lack of already existing mental health services, especially in India has been a very hard path to walk on for a long time as the expenditure on the mental health sector is close to negligible, in India. This study aimed to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of individuals who were already suffering from different disorders, whether it has exacerbated their condition or helped in any way. Phenomenological approach was taken up in order to assess 5 different individuals with pre-existing, diagnosed mental disorders on their experiences and issues during the pandemic and the lockdown. A semi-structured virtual interview took place via zoom and informed consent was taken beforehand. A thematic analysis was done in order to assess the recorded data into 4 themes- 1. Lack of motivation and productivity 2. The inconvenience of mental health services 3. Impact of physical confinement 4. Self and disorder awareness. Further research in this area will help us understand the need for accessible mental health services and how to tackle these issues.","Joshi, Aditi","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+COVID-19+Pandemic+on+Individuals+with+Pre-existing+Mental+Illnesses+in+India","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian Journal of Health and Wellbeing; 13(1):43-47, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30436,""
"Control and suicidality: Associations among perceived control, desire for control, causal uncertainty, and suicidal ideation","Background: Previous research shows that feeling in control over the environment is adaptive and may promote psychological well-being. The current study examined the unique and conjoint effects of control-related constructs (e.g., perceived control, primary and secondary control, desire for control) and causal uncertainty on suicidal ideation (SI). Method: Two hundred seventy-one adults (54% female;M = 23.81, SD = 5.76) were recruited online through Reddit.com. Participants completed an online survey of self-report measures assessing perceived control, desire for control, primary control, secondary control, causal uncertainty, and current SI. Participants were also asked about the impact of COVID-19 on their current circumstances, level of distress, and perceived control. Simple and multiple linear regressions were performed using SPSS. Moderation and exploratory moderated moderation analyses were conducted using PROCESS macro. The False Discovery Rate procedure was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Results: Perceived control, primary control, and secondary control statistically predicted decreased SI, while causal uncertainty predicted increased SI. Desire for control neither predicted SI nor significantly moderated the association between perceived control and current SI. However, primary control significantly moderated the association between causal uncertainty and SI, while secondary control did not. Thus, among individuals with medium and high levels of primary control, increasing causal uncertainty was associated with increased SI. Exploratory analyses revealed that the moderation results for primary and secondary control did not vary by age or gender. Finally, there was a significant interaction between causal uncertainty and pandemic-related perceived control in predicting SI, showing that at medium and high levels of COVID-19-related perceived control, the association between causal uncertainty and SI was stronger. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the suicide literature may be enriched by examining constructs related to individuals' perceptions and preferences for control. The results also highlighted that chronic doubts about one's understanding of the social world may contribute to SI. Further, although a strong sense of primary control may be associated with decreased SI, it may enhance risk for suicide among adults who struggle with chronic causal uncertainty. Clinical implications and future research directions are discussed.

The numerous data all over the world claim that people need for support during the ongoing crisis. Therefore, there is an increasing need for rapid identification of individuals suffering psychologically for more effective and purposeful interventions and systematic assistance to the patients without psychiatric disorders. A similar tool for identifying and monitoring the assessment of the level of distress specific to Covid-19 is the Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) developed by researchers at the Shanghai Mental Health Center (Qiu et al, 2020), It was also tested in Iran, Italy, India, Germany, Spain.

"IMPAK PERINTAH KAWALAN PERGERAKAN (PKP) TERHADAP KESIHATAN MENTAL WANITA: SATU TINJAUAN AWAL DI KALANGAN WANITA DI SELANGOR","Masalah kesihatan mental merupakan masalah kesihatan kedua yang menyerang rakyat Malaysia selepas penyakit jantung. Masalah kesihatan mental ini menjadi semakin serius sejak kerajaan melaksanakan perintah kawalan pergerakan (PKP) di seluruh Malaysia. Hal yang demikian telah memberikan impak yang sangat besar terhadap kelangsungan hidup semua peringkat masyarakat terutamanya golongan wanita. Golongan wanita adalah golongan yang amat terkesan dengan pelaksanaan PKP kerana mereka perlu memegang dan memainkan pelbagai peranan ketika di rumah seperti ibu, isteri, pekerja, suri rumah dan guru. Hal ini telah menjadikan kehidupan mereka lebih mencabar dan ini telah memberikan kesan kepada kesihatan mental mereka. Justeru, kajian ini bertujuan untuk mengkaji impak PKP semasa pandemik COVID-19 terhadap kesihatan mental wanita dari segi tekanan psikologi iaitu kemurungan (depression) dan kebimbangan (anxiety). Kaedah kaji selidik secara atas talian dijalankan bersama 100 orang responden wanita. Instrumentasi kajian ini telah diadaptasikan daripada Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). Hasil dapatan kajian mendapati bahawa PKP memberikan impak kepada kesihatan mental wanita dari segi tekanan psikologi, kebimbangan dan kemurungan. Selain itu, faktor sosioekonomi juga mempengaruhi kesihatan mental wanita. Kajian ini memberikan kefahaman kepada masyarakat bahawa kesihatan mental wanita adalah isu yang sangat penting dan perlu dititikberatkan oleh semua lapisan masyarakat. Oleh itu, masalah kesihatan mental wanita perlulah menjadi agenda utama dalam pembangunan kesihatan mental wanita dan dalam memperkasakan peranan wanita di Malaysia. Intervensi yang bersesuaian juga perlu dilaksanakan oleh kerajaan dan pemegang taruh seperti menyediakan akses dan peluang interaksi sosial untuk membantu wanita mengekalkan kesihatan mental dan kualiti hidup.Alternate :Mental health problems are the second health problem that strikes Malaysians after the heart disease. This mental health problem has become more serious since the government implemented the movement control order (MCO) throughout Malaysia. This has had a great impact on the survival of all levels of society, especially women. Women are the ones who are deeply affected by the MCO because they have to hold and play various roles at home such as mothers, wives, workers, housewives and teachers. This has made their lives more challenging, and this has had an impact on their mental health. Hence, this study aims to study the impact of MCO during the COVID-19 pandemic on women's mental health in terms of psychological stress i.e. depression and anxiety. The online survey was conducted with 100 female respondents. Instrumentation of this study was adapted from patient health questionnaire (PHQ-4).The findings showed that MCO had an impact on women's mental health in terms of psychological stress, anxiety and depression. In addition, socioeconomic factors also affect women's mental health. This study provides an understanding to the community that women's mental health is a very important issue and should be emphasized by all levels of society. Therefore, women's mental health problems should be the main agenda in the development of women's mental health and in empowering the role of women in Malaysia.

"Understanding the Changed Lives of the College Youth through the COVID Lens","The COVID-19 pandemic has sent the life of today's youth into a tailspin. This change has a significant impact on their higher education, learning styles, career planning, mental health, and daily lives. Since the beginning of the pandemic, it has appeared that the youth's attitudes towards their future and career choices has shifted significantly. The global human psyche has also suffered Ã­rom a variety of anxiety-related difficulties. According to UNICEF (2020), approximately ten million youth around the world suffer from COVID-19. In India, over 32 crore students have ceased attending school and college, and all educational activities in the physical mode have come to a halt. In order to reduce the spread of infection of the deadly virus, offline classes have to be closed and the youth confined to their homes with online classes for learning. COVID-19 has shifted the focus of teachers to e-Learning technologies and platforms for effective student participation which has not only highlighted the fact that they may be out of reach for students and in worst case scenario, even out of budget. The psychosocial aspect of learning associated with these academic inputs has been severely hampered. The pandemic has undoubtedly uncovered the issues present in our education system, which have now become a necessity for the virtual-era-schooling for teachers to evolve to the world's fast converting academic atmosphere. The usage of e-learning and digital schooling can also emerge as a critical part for the betterment of education within the post-pandemic era.

"Self-care strategies for COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has likely brought many changes to how you live your life, and with it uncertainty, altered daily routines, financial pressures and social isolation. You may worry about getting sick, how long the pandemic will last, whether you'll lose your job, and what the future will bring. Information overload, rumors and misinformation can make your life feel out of control and make it unclear what to do. During the COVID-19 pandemic, you may experience stress, anxiety, fear, sadness and loneliness. And mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression, can worsen. Surveys show a major increase in the number of U.S. adults who report symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression during the pandemic, compared with surveys before the pandemic. Some people have increased their use of alcohol or drugs, thinking that can help them cope with their fears about the pandemic. In reality, using these substances can worsen anxiety and depression. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic recession have negatively affected many people's mental health and created new barriers for people already suffering from mental illness and substance use disorders. During the pandemic, about 4 in 10 adults in the U.S. have reported symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder, a share that has been largely consistent, up from one in ten adults who reported these symptoms from January to June 2019 (Figure 1). A KFF Health Tracking Poll from July 2020 also found that many adults are reporting specific negative impacts on their mental health and well-being, such as difficulty sleeping (36%) or eating (32%), increases in alcohol consumption or substance use (12%), and worsening chronic conditions (12%), due to worry and stress over the corona virus. As the pandemic wears on, ongoing and necessary public health measures expose many people to experiencing situations linked to poor mental health outcomes, such as isolation and job loss. People with substance use disorders, notably those addicted to tobacco or opioids, are likely to have worse outcomes if they get COVID-19. That's because these addictions can harm lung function and weaken the immune system, causing chronic conditions such as heart disease and lung disease, which increase the risk of serious complications from COVID-19. For all of these reasons, it's important to learn self-care strategies and get the care you need to help you cope.","Selvanayaki, V.; Sasikala, K.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Self-care+strategies+for+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Natural Volatiles & Essential Oils; 8(4):1455-1461, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30443,""
"Conductas de cuidado y cocuidado en masculinidades en contexto de pandemia desde una perspectiva de gÃ©nero","El artÃ­culo tiene como propÃ³sito problematizar el gÃ©nero en tiempos de pandemia, reconociendo las conductas de autocuidado, emociones y percepciones de cambios de rutina en la vida diaria desde la perspectiva de los hombres. Desde un diseÃ±o mixto se accede a hombres y mujeres de diversas edades y territorios quienes responden, en el segundo semestre de 2020, un cuestionario semiestructurado que busca recoger sus experiencias en tiempos de pandemia. Los supuestos de trabajo se fundamentan en una visiÃ³n de masculinidades hegemÃ³nicas donde los hombres cuidan menos de su salud, no expresan sus emociones y desarrollan menos tareas domÃ©sticas, volcando su vida hacia el trabajo. Se plantea el supuesto que los hombres mÃ¡s jÃ³venes tienden a alejarse de estas conductas y estarÃ­an desarrollando de forma tÃ¡cita masculinidades contra hegemÃ³nicas, pues estÃ¡n compartiendo diariamente con mujeres de una nueva generaciÃ³n que en el discurso y en sus acciones buscan dar un vuelco al patriarcado. Los resultados dan cuenta que en algunos aspectos los supuestos se relacionan con los datos obtenidos en lo que refiere, principalmente, a las labores domÃ©sticas, gestiÃ³n de las emociones y cuidado de la salud mental donde mayormente se establece la diferencia entre hombres y mujeres. Entre los mismos hombres no se observan diferencias importantes entre jÃ³venes y adultos, por lo que se hace necesario continuar educando a las nuevas generaciones sobre relaciones de convivencia mÃ¡s amigables y equitativa entre los gÃ©neros.Alternate : The article aims to problematize gender in times of pandemic, recognizing self-care behaviors, emotions, and perceptions of routine changes in daily life from the perspective of men. From a quantitative design, men and women of different ages and territories are accessed who respond in the second semester of 2020 to a semi-structured questionnaire that seeks to collect their experiences in times of pandemic. The research assumption is based on a vision of hegemonic masculinities where men take less care of their health, do not express their emotions, and carry out fewer domestic tasks, turning their lives towards work. The idea is put forward those younger men tend to move away from these behaviors and are tacitly developing counter-hegemonic masculinities, since they are sharing daily with women of a new generation who in their discourse and in their actions seek to overturn patriarchy. The results show that in some aspects the assumptions are related to the data obtained with regard, mainly, to housework, emotional management, and mental health care where the difference between men and women is mostly established. Among men themselves, there are no significant differences between young people and adults, so it is necessary to continue educating the new generations about more friendly and equitable coexistence relationships between the genders.","Sonia Brito, RodrÃ­guez, Porra, Lorena Basualto, Rodrigo AzÃ³car, GonzÃ¡lez, Claudia Flores, Rivas","https://www.google.com/search?q=Conductas+de+cuidado+y+cocuidado+en+masculinidades+en+contexto+de+pandemia+desde+una+perspectiva+de+gÃ©nero","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cuaderno de Trabajo Social; - (16):86-114, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30444,""
"Prevalence of Mental Health Issues Faced by the Persons Recovered from COVID-19: A Review","The COVID-19 is the biggest public health challenge experienced by human beings in the recent past across the world. It affected the physical and mental health of people. Most COVID-19 survivors have experienced symptoms such as prolonged distress of the illness, worry about the future, and stigma. The prevalence of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety among COVID -19 victims is the main focus of the study. From April 2020 to June 2021, an evaluation of several papers based on mental health difficulties among COVID-19 survivors was conducted. To better understand the prevalence rate of mental health concerns among COVID-19 survivors, eleven papers were chosen following the PRISMA principles. The studies show the significant prevalence rate of psychopathology among COVID-19 survivors. Disproportionately increased levels of anxiety and depression can be found in geriatric people. Several investigations have found that female sufferers have higher frequency of psychiatric problems than male survivors. There is a lack of attention in the area of mental health difficulties of COVID survivors. Depression, post-traumatic stress disorders, and anxiety cause high-burden among the vulnerable population and that need to be addressed properly like the physical illness.","Tom, Annmary, Gopika, G.

"Bridging skin, brain, and behavior to understand pleasurable social touch","Social touch-the affiliative skin-to-skin contact between individuals-can rapidly evoke emotions of comfort, pleasure, or calm, and is essential for mental and physical well-being. Physical isolation from social support can be devastating. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a global increase in suicidal ideation, anxiety, domestic violence, and worsening of pre-existing physical conditions, alerting society to our need to understand the neurobiology of social touch and how it promotes normal health. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how sensory neuron stimulation induces pleasure, calm, and analgesia may reveal untapped therapeutic targets in the periphery for treatment of anxiety and depression, as well as social disorders and traumas in which social touch becomes aversive. Bridging the gap between stimulation in the skin and positive affect in the brain-especially during naturally occurring social touch behaviors-remains a challenge to the field. However, with advances in mouse genetics, behavioral quantification, and brain imaging approaches to measure neuronal firing and neurochemical release, completing this mechanistic picture may be on the horizon. Here, we summarize some exciting new findings about social touch in mammals, emphasizing both the peripheral and central nervous systems, with attempts to bridge the gap between external stimulation and internal representations in the brain.","Elias, Abdus-Saboor","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2022.102527","20220422","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30446,""
"Mood and Behaviors of Adolescents With Depression in a Longitudinal Study Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","To investigate whether, compared to pre-pandemic levels, depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescents with depression increased during the pandemic. We utilized data from National Institute of Mental Health Characterization and Treatment of Depression (NIMH CAT-D) cohort, a longitudinal case control study that started pre-pandemic. Most of the participants are from the states of Maryland and Virginia in the United States. We compared depressive symptoms (1820 measurements; 519 measurements pre-pandemic and 1302 during the pandemic) and anxiety symptoms (1800 measurements; 508 measurements pre-pandemic and 1292 ratings during the pandemic) of 166 adolescents (109 girls, 96 adolescents with depression) before and during the pandemic. Data was collected during yearly clinical visits, interim four-months follow-up visits, inpatient stays, and weekly outpatient sessions, and additional data collection during the pandemic. Pre-pandemic, healthy volunteers (HVs) had a median of one depressive and anxiety rating (range: 1-3) and adolescents with depression had a median of two ratings (anxiety rating range: 1-25, depressive rating range: 1-26). During the pandemic HVs had a median of eight anxiety ratings and nine depressive ratings (range: 1-13) and adolescents with depression had a median of seven anxiety and depressive ratings (range: 1-29). We also analyzed adolescent- and parent-reported behaviors in the CoRonavIruS Health Impact Survey (CRISIS), totaling 920 self-reported measures for 164 adolescents (112 girls, 92 adolescents with depression). HVs had a median of seven surveys (range: 1-8), and adolescents with depression had a median of five surveys (range: 1-8). Pre-pandemic, adolescents with depression had a mean depressive score of 11.16 (95% CI [10.10, 12.22]) and HVs had a mean depressive score of 1.76 (95% CI [0.40, 3.13]), a difference of 9.40 points (95% CI [7.78, 11.01]). During the pandemic, this difference decreased by 22.6% (2.05 points, 95% CI [0.71, 3.40], P=0.003) due to 0.89 points decrease in severity of scores in adolescents with depression (95% CI [0.08, 1.70], P = 0.032) and 1.16 points increase in healthy individuals' depressive symptoms (95% CI [0.10 - 2.23], P = 0.032). Compared to their pre-pandemic levels, adolescents with depression reported overall lower anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. Parent-on-child reports also were consistent with these results. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that both depressive and anxiety symptoms were lower for adolescents with depression during the pandemic compared to before. In contrast, the depression scores for the HVs were higher during the pandemic relative to their pre-pandemic ratings; these scores remained much lower than those of adolescents with depression.

"Mental and physical health among the French population before and during the first and second COVID-19 lockdowns: Latent class trajectory analyses using longitudinal data","The French government issued national COVID-19-related confinement and stay-at-home orders depending on different epidemic levels in a bid to stem the coronavirus pandemic and its resurgence. The long-term impact of lockdown measures on the general population may vary. We aimed to identify and characterize self-reported mental and physical health trajectories in the French population from pre-lockdown to the first and second COVID-19 lockdowns and to identify factors associated with health status variation patterns. We did a secondary analysis of the MAVIE cohort in France. Volunteers of this national cohort were recruited between November 2014 and December 2019, and information was collected at recruitment (pre-lockdown), April-May 2020 (the first lockdown), and October-December 2020 (the second lockdown). Latent class mixed models were built to identify distinct anxiety (as measured by GAD-7) and depressive (as measured by PHQ-9) symptoms, and self-perceived mental and physical health trajectories. Factors associated with status variation were identified by multinomial regression. A total of 613 participants with data in all three data collection waves were included. Respondents spent almost half as much time on traditional media, websites and social media during the second lockdown as during the first. Mean anxiety scores were 1.96, 2.37 and 2.82 at pre-lockdown, and the first and second lockdowns, respectively. Mean depressive scores were 3.12, 3.36 and 3.95, respectively. Latent class mixed models fitted two and three distinct trajectory classes respectively for anxiety symptoms ('no pre-pandemic anxiety, slightly increase', 58.9%; 'consistently fair', 41.1%) and depressive symptoms ('consistently very low', 34.6%; 'consistently low', 56.1%; 'increasing and clinically significant at the second lockdown', 9.3%), and four classes for self-perceived mental and physical health. Females were more likely to belong to trajectories of the most vulnerable one as regard to the symptoms of anxiety and depression, and self-perceived mental health. The younger participants were also more vulnerable to anxiety symptoms and those with a clinical diagnosis or a positive COVID-19 test for the participant or relatives were more likely to belong to vulnerable trajectories for depressive symptoms and self-perceived mental health. Females were more likely to present the deteriorating self-perceived physical health trajectory. A continuing increase in the mean scores of anxiety and depression symptoms was observed throughout the two lockdown periods in France. Further analyses revealed distinct patterns with a small fraction of volunteers experiencing worsening mental and health symptoms. This vulnerable small part of the population requires targeted support.","Lu, Contrand, Dupuy, Ramiz, Sztal-Kutas, Lagarde","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.095","20220422","Anxiety symptoms; COVID-19 lockdown; Depression symptoms; Latent trajectory class; Mental health; Physical health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30448,""

"Changing relationships between social contact, social support and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","Given the longstanding consensus that social contact can promote older adult well-being, many have focused on how social contact changed during the pandemic. Less is known, however, about whether the link between social contact and health changed during the pandemic. This study sought to understand how associations between social contact, social support, and depressive symptoms changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from two waves of the Health and Retirement Study were used. Respondents reported both virtual and in-person social contact, as well as perceived positive and negative social support. I use path models to estimate relationships between social contact, social support, and depressive symptoms. Bootstrapping was used to estimate the change in associations between 2016 and 2020. Estimates show that associations between positive social support and depressive symptoms, as well as between in-person social contact and depressive symptoms, attenuated during the pandemic. Virtual social contact played a relatively minor role in determining outcomes such as social support and depressive symptoms, compared to in-person social contact. Findings suggest that researchers and policymakers should not only focus on the changing quantity of social interactions when events such as the COVID-19 pandemic happen, but also the changing content and efficacy of the social interactions that remain.","Ang","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbac063","20220422","COVID-19; informal social participation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30450,""

"Psychological Distress Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Adults in the United Kingdom Based on Coordinated Analyses of 11 Longitudinal Studies","How population mental health has evolved across the COVID-19 pandemic under varied lockdown measures is poorly understood, and the consequences for health inequalities are unclear. To investigate changes in mental health and sociodemographic inequalities from before and across the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in 11 longitudinal studies. This cohort study included adult participants from 11 UK longitudinal population-based studies with prepandemic measures of psychological distress. Analyses were coordinated across these studies, and estimates were pooled. Data were collected from 2006 to 2021. Trends in the prevalence of poor mental health were assessed in the prepandemic period (time period 0 [TP 0]) and at 3 pandemic TPs: 1, initial lockdown (March to June 2020); 2, easing of restrictions (July to October 2020); and 3, a subsequent lockdown (November 2020 to March 2021). Analyses were stratified by sex, race and ethnicity, education, age, and UK country. Multilevel regression was used to examine changes in psychological distress from the prepandemic period across the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological distress was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, the Kessler 6, the 9-item Malaise Inventory, the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, the 8-item or 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression across different studies. In total, 49Ã¢â‚¬Â¯993 adult participants (12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯323 [24.6%] aged 55-64 years; 32Ã¢â‚¬Â¯741 [61.2%] women; 4960 [8.7%] racial and ethnic minority) were analyzed. Across the 11 studies, mental health deteriorated from prepandemic scores across all 3 pandemic periods, but there was considerable heterogeneity across the study-specific estimated effect sizes (pooled estimate for TP 1: standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.15; 95% CI, 0.06-0.25; TP 2: SMD, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.09-0.27; TP 3: SMD, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.10-0.32). Changes in psychological distress across the pandemic were higher in women (TP 3: SMD, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11, 0.35) than men (TP 3: SMD, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.06-0.26) and lower in individuals with below-degree level education at TP 3 (SMD, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06-0.30) compared with those who held degrees (SMD, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14-0.38). Increased psychological distress was most prominent among adults aged 25 to 34 years (SMD, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.14-0.84) and 35 to 44 years (SMD, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.10-0.60) compared with other age groups. No evidence of changes in distress differing by race and ethnicity or UK country were observed. In this study, the substantial deterioration in mental health seen in the UK during the first lockdown did not reverse when lockdown lifted, and a sustained worsening was observed across the pandemic period. Mental health declines have been unequal across the population, with women, those with higher degrees, and those aged 25 to 44 years more affected than other groups.","Patel, Robertson, Kwong, Griffith, Willan, Green, Di Gessa, Huggins, McElroy, Thompson, Maddock, Niedzwiedz, Henderson, Richards, Steptoe, Ploubidis, Moltrecht, Booth, Fitzsimons, Silverwood, Patalay, Porteous, Katikireddi","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.7629","20220422","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30452,""
"A Web-Based Well-being Program for Health Care Workers (Thrive): Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","Mental health has come to be understood as not merely the absence of mental illness but also the presence of mental well-being, and recent interventions have sought to increase well-being in various populations. A population that deserves particular attention is that of health care workers, whose occupations entail high levels of stress, especially given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A neuroscience-based web-based well-being program for health care workers-the Thrive program-has been newly developed to promote habits and activities that contribute to brain health and overall mental well-being. This paper describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial whose objective is to evaluate the Thrive program in comparison with an active control condition to measure whether the program is effective at increasing well-being and decreasing symptoms of psychological distress in health care workers at a designated Australian hospital. The trial will comprise two groups (intervention vs active control) and 4 measurement occasions over a 12-week period. A survey will be administered in each of weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12, and the well-being program will be delivered in weeks 1-7 (via web-based video presentations or digital pamphlets). Each of the 4 surveys will comprise a range of questionnaires to measure well-being, psychological distress, and other key variables. The planned analyses will estimate group-by-time interaction effects to test the hypothesis that mental health will increase over time in the intervention condition relative to the active control condition. The Thrive program was delivered to a small number of wards at the hospital between February 2021 and July 2021, and it will be delivered to the remaining wards from October 2021 to December 2021. A power calculation has recommended a sample size of at least 200 participants in total. A linear mixed model will be used to estimate the interaction effects. This trial seeks to evaluate a new web-based well-being program for health care workers at a major public hospital. It will contribute to the growing body of research on mental well-being and ways to promote it. Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12621000027819; https://tinyurl.com/58wwjut9.

"Clustering analysis reveals different profiles associating long-term post-COVID symptoms, COVID-19 symptoms at hospital admission and previous medical co-morbidities in previously hospitalized COVID-19 survivors","To identify subgroups of COVID-19 survivors exhibiting long-term post-COVID symptoms according to clinical/hospitalization data by using cluster analysis in order to foresee the illness progress and facilitate subsequent prognosis. Age, gender, height, weight, pre-existing medical comorbidities, Internal Care Unit (ICU) admission, days at hospital, and presence of COVID-19 symptoms at hospital admission were collected from hospital records in a sample of patients recovered from COVID-19 at five hospitals in Madrid (Spain). A predefined list of post-COVID symptoms was systematically assessed a mean of 8.4Ã‚Â months (SD 15.5) after hospital discharge. Anxiety/depressive levels and sleep quality were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. Cluster analysis was used to identify groupings of COVID-19 patients without introducing any previous assumptions, yielding three different clusters associating post-COVID symptoms with acute COVID-19 symptoms at hospital admission. Cluster 2 grouped subjects with lower prevalence of medical co-morbidities, lower number of COVID-19 symptoms at hospital admission, lower number of post-COVID symptoms, and almost no limitations with daily living activities when compared to the others. In contrast, individuals in cluster 0 and 1 exhibited higher number of pre-existing medical co-morbidities, higher number of COVID-19 symptoms at hospital admission, higher number of long-term post-COVID symptoms (particularly fatigue, dyspnea and pain), more limitations on daily living activities, higher anxiety and depressive levels, and worse sleep quality than those in cluster 2.

"What you see is what you get? Association of belief in conspiracy theories and mental health during COVID-19","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic brought about great uncertainty and significant changes in our people's everyday lives. In times of such crises, it is natural to seek explanations to overcome our fears and uncertainties, contributing to an increase to believe in conspiracy theories which, by yielding explanations, decrease uncertainty and ambiguity and may thus have an effect on mental well-being. In spite of this, the majority of research on conspiracy theories focused on their social effects with little attention to psychological effects. Thus, the aim of our present study was to examine the association between belief in conspiracy theories and different aspects of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in a general population sample. Methods: Our analyses included data from the Hungarian leg of the COMET-G (COVID-19 MEntal health international for the General population) study. The Hungarian sample included participants who completed a detailed questionnaire assessing belief in seven conspiracy theory items, as well as STAI-S and CES-D to measure state anxiety and depression, respectively, and answered questions related to their change in depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts during the pandemic. Association between the individual beliefs as well as a composite Conspiracy Theory Belief Score (CTBS) and mental health measures was analysed using linear regression models. Results: Overall, belief in conspiracy theories was relatively moderate in our sample. Sex and age appeared to have a significant effect on the Overall Conspiracy Theory Belief Score (CTBS), with women having a higher score and scores increasing with age. Some of the individual beliefs also showed associations with age and sex. State anxiety and depression was not significantly associated with CTBS, however in case of depression some individual items were, and symptom clusters within CES-D also showed a pattern of association with some of the individual items. As far as changes in mental health during the pandemic is concerned, no association between overall beliefs and changes in anxiety or depression was found. However, higher overall belief in conspiracy theories was associated with a decrease in suicidal thoughts. Discussion: In our study, we explored the association between conspiracy theories and mental well-being as well as its changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found a specific pattern of association between belief in distinct theories and some aspects of depression, as well as lower increase in suicidal ideation in association with increased belief in conspiracy theories. Understanding the role of belief in theories can be key to designing mental health interventions when reacting to unforeseen events in the future.

"Burnout syndrome in intensive care physicians in time of the COVID-19: a cross-sectional study","To assess the prevalence of burnout syndrome among intensive care physicians working in a tertiary private hospital as well as their perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their life. A cross-sectional study. Intensive care units dedicated to the care of COVID-19 in Hospital Sirio-Libanes, Sao Paulo, Southeastern part of Brazil. Intensive care physicians. Each participant received an envelope with a questionnaire composed of demographic and occupational variables, information related to their personal and professional experiences facing the COVID-19 pandemic and the Maslach Burnout Inventory questionnaire. The primary outcome was to assess the prevalence of burnout syndrome among physicians working in an intensive care unit dedicated to the care of COVID-19. A total of 51 from the universe of 63 (82%) intensive care physicians participated in the study. Nineteen (37.2%) met the criteria for burnout syndrome. In the three domains that characterise burnout syndrome, we found a low level of personal achievement in 96.1% of physicians interviewed, a high level of depersonalisation in 51.0% and 51.0% with a high level of emotional exhaustion. Decision-making conflicts between the intensive care unit team and other attending physicians were frequent (50% of all conflicts). A third of the participants had been diagnosed with COVID-19, 22 (43.1%) reported having a family member infected and 8 (15.7%) lost someone close to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants felt that fear of infecting their loved ones was the aspect of their lives that changed most as compared with the prepandemic period. Burnout syndrome was frequent among intensive care unit physicians treating patients with COVID-19 in a large tertiary private hospital. Future studies should expand our results to other private and public hospitals and test strategies to promote intensive care unit physicians' mental health.","Fumis, Costa, Dal'Col, Azevedo, Pastore Junior","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057272","20220422","COVID-19; adult intensive &amp; critical care; depression &amp; mood disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30457,""
"Association between work situation and life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic: prospective cohort study in Norway","To estimate the impact of being laid off from work, having to work from home or having been diagnosed with COVID-19 on self-reported satisfaction with life. Nationwide population-based cohort study. Norway. We followed more than 80Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 participants in an ongoing cohort study, the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed current life satisfaction in April and again in September/October 2020 for subjects whose work situation and infection status had changed. Self-reported satisfaction with life, using a scale from 0 (worst) to 10 (best). We analysed the scale both continuously and as a binary variable (&lt;or Ã¢â€°Â¥6). Temporary and permanent layoffs, working from a home-based office, and getting a COVID-19 diagnosis were all associated with modestly, but significantly lower concurrent life satisfaction, both in the total on a population level and for subjects experiencing a change in job status between spring and autumn. The associations with change in work situation were stronger for men. For men with permanent job loss, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for low life satisfaction (&lt;6) was 3.2 (95% CI 2.4 to 4.2) in April and 4.9 (95% CI 3.5 to 6.9) in autumn. Among all, a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with an adjusted OR for low life satisfaction of 1.9 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.3) in spring. The strength of associations between work situation and life satisfaction did not vary much across socio-economic strata, but layoffs were more common among those with low education. Layoffs, home office and infection status had clear impact on the quality of life as measured with a global life satisfaction scale.

"COVID-19: Detecting depression signals during stay-at-home period","The new coronavirus outbreak has been officially declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. To grapple with the rapid spread of this ongoing pandemic, most countries have banned indoor and outdoor gatherings and ordered their residents to stay home. Given the developing situation with coronavirus, mental health is an important challenge in our society today. In this paper, we discuss the investigation of social media postings to detect signals relevant to depression. To this end, we utilize topic modeling features and a collection of psycholinguistic and mental-well-being attributes to develop statistical models to characterize and facilitate representation of the more subtle aspects of depression. Furthermore, we predict whether signals relevant to depression are likely to grow significantly as time moves forward. Our best classifier yields F-1 scores as high as 0.8 and surpasses the utilized baseline by a considerable margin, 0.173. In closing, we propose several future research avenues.","Tshimula, Chikhaoui, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1177/14604582221094931","20220422","Coronavirus; depression; overlapping behavior; similarity; stay home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30459,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of First-Year Undergraduate Students Studying at a Major Canadian University: A Successive Cohort Study","To examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on first year undergraduate student mental health. As part of the Queen's University <i>U-Flourish Student Well-Being and Academic Success</i> study, three successive cohorts of students entering undergraduate studies in 2018 (pre-pandemic), 2019 (transitional), and 2020 (during pandemic) completed electronic surveys at entry and completion of first year. Validated self-report measures were used to assess mental health status including symptom levels of anxiety, depression, and insomnia, self-harm and frequency of substance use. Propensity matching and multivariable log-binomial regression were used in comparisons of mental health indicators across the cohorts. Clinically significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and self-harm were reported more frequently in the 2020-2021 cohort, coincident with remote learning and pandemic restrictions. In female students, screen positive rates for anxiety and depression, and suicidal ideation increased from about one-third to just under one-half in association with the pandemic (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01), while increases in mental health concerns were less pronounced among males. Among females, increases in clinically significant symptoms over first year appeared greatest during the pandemic year, while striking decreases in alcohol consumption in both females and males were reported in that same year. Studying under pandemic conditions had a negative impact on student well-being, social relationships and school connectedness, quality of learning experience, leisure activities, and optimism about future prospects. Mental health concerns including anxiety, depression and sleep problems increased in first year students during the pandemic, especially among females, while alcohol use declined. These findings highlight the negative mental health impact associated with studying under pandemic restrictions involving remote learning and social distancing.","King, Pickett, Rivera, Byun, Li, Cunningham, Duffy","https://doi.org/10.1177/07067437221094549","20220422","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; post-secondary; self-harm; substance use; university student; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30460,""
"The Burden of the Pain: Adverse Mental Health Outcomes of COVID-19 in Women With and Without Cancer","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a negative psychological impact on the population at scale, yet it is possible that vulnerable patient populations may experience a heavier burden with increased feelings of anxiety and distress. Cancer patients have to trade-off between the fear of exposing themselves to the virus and the need to continue life-saving medical procedures. The present study investigated the prevalence of generalized anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in a population of Italian cancer patients and healthy participants in the months following the COVID-19 outbreak. Using standardized measures of PTSS (impact of event scale revised; IES-R) and generalized anxiety (generalized anxiety scale; GAD-7), we found that patients experienced higher levels of adverse mental health outcomes. Several variables were found to negatively affect PTSS and anxiety in this population, including the younger age of respondents, having children, and the impossibility to attend regular medical check-ups. These findings stress the importance of maintaining a clear and regular communication with patients throughout future waves of the pandemic and ensure continuity of care in this vulnerable population. Furthermore, this study indicates the need to establish psychological interventions aimed at patients with cancer, targeting especially younger generations who are more likely to experience adverse psychological outcomes.","Lanzoni, Brivio, Oliveri, Guiddi, Chichua, Mazzocco, Pravettoni","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.772128","20220422","COVID-19; cancer; female health; generalized anxiety; post-traumatic stress; psychological outcomes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30461,""
"Mental Health Impact of Mass Depopulation of Swine on Veterinarians During COVID-19 Infrastructure Breakdown","This study was designed to assess the mental health of swine veterinarians involved with mass depopulation events related to COVID-19 and compare them to swine veterinarians not involved in mass depopulation. Additionally, we assessed the well being, quality of life, psychological distress, burnout, and resilience in veterinarians who conducted depopulation events and the potential impact of depopulation methods on these factors. Finally, we identified coping methods utilized by swine veterinarians for improved well being. The study involved the distribution of an anonymous online survey, available December 2020 to January 2021, to swine veterinarians practicing in the United States. A total of 134 responses were analyzed. Stress related to the depopulation effort was predominantly an outcome of two factors: ethics of care (people and pigs) and perception of others (public, colleagues, family, friends, neighbors). Depopulation involvement was associated with burnout (p = 0.001). The depopulation method utilized significantly impacted depopulation distress (p = 0.007), perception of others (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and burnout (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Nearly one-third (29%) of all participants reported moderate levels of burnout. Based on these results, the call to action is to enhance the availability and visibility of existing mental health services and take necessary steps to destigmatize mental health. Additionally, it is critical to support the development of mental health programs for swine veterinarians through education, training, research, and transparent communication.","Baysinger, Kogan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2022.842585","20220422","COVID-19; depopulation; mental health; psychological distress; swine; well being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30462,""
"Mutational Pattern, Impacts and Potential Preventive Strategies of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 Variant Infection","Since the emergence of COVID 19, the authentic SARS-CoV-2 has evolved into a range of novel variants that are of more global concern. In late November 2021, the Omicron (lineage B.1.1.529) variant was identified as a new variant and considered as the fifth variant of concern. Omicron harbors a genetic profile that is exceedingly unusual, with a huge number of mutations. Above thirty mutations are localized in the S protein, while some are found in other structural and non-structural proteins. Half of the mutations in the S protein are in the RBD, which is a major target of antibodies, showing that Omicron mutations may affect antibody binding affinity to the S protein. The Omicron variant has been found to result in immune escape, therapeutic or vaccine escape, as well as increased transmissibility and reinfection risk, explaining its rapid international spread that sparks a global alarm even more serious than the previously reported variants. Omicron has the capability to bypass at least some of the multi-faceted immune responses induced by prior infection or vaccination. It is shown to extensively escape neutralizing antibodies while evading cell mediated immune defense to a lesser extent. The efficacy of COVID 19 vaccines against Omicron variant is decreased with primary vaccination, showing that the vaccine is less efficient in preventing Omicron infections. However, after receiving a booster vaccine dose, the immunological response to Omicron significantly improved and hold promising results. Despite the mild nature of the disease in most vaccinated people, the rapid spread of Omicron, as well as the increased risk of re-infection, poses yet another major public health concern. Therefore, effort should be devoted to maintaining the existing COVID 19 preventive measures as well as developing new vaccination strategies in order to control the fast dissemination of Omicron.","Chekol Abebe, Tiruneh G/Medhin, Behaile T/Mariam, Asmamaw Dejenie, Mengie Ayele, Tadele Admasu, Tilahun Muche, Asmare Adela","https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S360103","20220422","COVID 19 vaccine efficacy; Omicron variant; VOC; impact; preventive strategies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30463,""
"An online survey data in senior high school students and their parents in China during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019","The dataset presents the raw data collected through an online survey of senior high school students and their parents from 24 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions (96 cities) of China. We conducted the online survey using electronic self-administered questionnaires designed as student-version and parent-version during 26th February and 4th March of 2020. The questionnaire was designed using the online survey tool Sojump (Shanghai Information Co.), and released through WeChat platform (Tencent Corp) following principals-head teachers-students/parents approach. All the students and the parents were asked to answer the questions voluntarily and anonymously after reading informed consent at the forepage of the questionnaires. The information collected from students included: 1) demographic characteristics, including sex, date of birth, name of high school, academic year, and self-evaluated performance level; 2) education levels and occupations of parents; 3) degree preferences, including the willingness to learn medicine (prior and post COVID-19 outbreak), preferred medical career (clinician, public health practitioner, pharmacist, nurse or others), and main motivations for selecting or unselecting medical study; 4) infection of COVID-19 in acquaintances; 5) health literacy level on infectious diseases assessed using the Infectious Disease-specific Health Literacy Scale (IDSHL), and 6) anxiety level evaluated using the Chinese version of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7). Information collected from parents included sex of their children and name of high school attended by their children, as well as their own educational level, occupation, anxiety symptoms, attitude toward their children's studying medicine, and main reasons for supportive or unsupportive attitudes, which were similar to the main motivations or de-motivations for medical study listed in the student-version questionnaire. Date and time for completion of the questionnaire were auto-recorded by the Sojump system. The dataset was established at an early stage of pandemic of COVID-19, and is valuable for understanding the instant psychological impacts of the outbreak of an emerging fatal infectious disease on senior high school students and their patents, and can provide evidence for policy makers on mental health intervention and medical education in China.

"Construction and Validation of a Scale to Measure Loneliness and Isolation During Social Distancing and Its Effect on Mental Health","A variety of factors contribute to the degree to which a person feels lonely and socially isolated. These factors may be particularly relevant in contexts requiring social distancing, e.g., during the COVID-19 pandemic or in states of immunodeficiency. We present the Loneliness and Isolation during Social Distancing (LISD) Scale. Extending existing measures, the LISD scale measures both state and trait aspects of loneliness and isolation, including indicators of social connectedness and support. In addition, it reliably predicts individual differences in anxiety and depression. Data were collected online from two independent samples in a social distancing context (the COVID-19 pandemic). Factorial validation was based on exploratory factor analysis (EFA; Sample 1, <i>N</i> = 244) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; Sample 2, <i>N</i> = 304). Multiple regression analyses were used to assess how the LISD scale predicts state anxiety and depression. The LISD scale showed satisfactory fit in both samples. Its two state factors indicate being <i>lonely and isolated</i> as well as <i>connected and supported</i>, while its three trait factors reflect general <i>loneliness and isolation, sociability and sense of belonging</i>, and <i>social closeness and support</i>. Our results imply strong predictive power of the LISD scale for state anxiety and depression, explaining 33 and 51% of variance, respectively. Anxiety and depression scores were particularly predicted by low dispositional <i>sociability and sense of belonging</i> and by currently being more <i>lonely and isolated</i>. In turn, being <i>lonely and isolated</i> was related to being less <i>connected and supported</i> (state) as well as having lower <i>social closeness and support</i> in general (trait). We provide a novel scale which distinguishes between acute and general dimensions of loneliness and social isolation while also predicting mental health. The LISD scale could be a valuable and economic addition to the assessment of mental health factors impacted by social distancing.","GrÃƒÂ¼ndahl, WeiÃƒÅ¸, Maier, Hewig, Deckert, Hein","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.798596","20220422","anxiety; depression; loneliness; social distancing; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30465,""
"Park access and mental health among parents and children during the COVID-19 pandemic","Time spent outdoors and in nature has been associated with numerous benefits to health and well-being. We examined relationships between park access and mental health for children and parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also explored associations between park access and co-participation of parent and child in time outdoors, and child and parent physical activity. We used data from 1,000 respondents to a nationally representative U.S. survey of parent-child dyads during October-November 2020. Park access was defined as an affirmative response to: ""do you have a park that you can safely walk to within 10Ã‚Â min of your home?"" Child mental health was operationalized as the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) total difficulties score. The Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) total score assessed parent mental health and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) assessed parent physical activity. Child physical activity and co-participation in outdoor activity were reported as number of days in the prior week. Linear regression was used to examine relationships between park access and health outcomes in models adjusted for child and parent characteristics and COVID-19 impact. Our sample included 500 parents of children ages 6-10Ã‚Â years, and 500 parent-child dyads of children ages 11-17Ã‚Â years. Park access was associated with a lower SDQ total score among children (ÃŽÂ²: -1.26, 95% CI: -2.25, -0.27) and a lower PHQ-4 total score among parents (ÃŽÂ²: -0.89, 95% CI: -1.39, -0.40). In models stratified by child age, these associations were observed for SDQ scores among adolescents ages 11-17 and for PHQ-4 scores among parents of children ages 6-10Ã‚Â years. Park access was also associated with 0.50 more days/week of co-participation in outdoor time (95% CI: 0.16, 0.84), and higher levels of parent physical activity (ÃŽÂ²: 1009 MET-min/week, 95% CI: 301, 1717), but not child physical activity (ÃŽÂ²: 0.31Ã‚Â days/week, 95% CI: -0.03, 0.66). Park access was associated with better mental health among children and parents, and more parent physical activity and parent-child co-participation in outdooractivity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Factors associated with the mental health of back-to-Wuhan university students based on quantile regression model during the COVID-19 period","The COVID-19 pandemic had brought the increased levels of depression and anxiety on people. Our study investigated the levels of mental health and influencing factors among back-to-Wuhan university students. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted from 31 August 2020, to 14 September 2020 by convenience sampling on the back-to-Wuhan university students, which included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Insomnia Severity Index-7 (ISI-7), the revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R) scales, and the basic demographic characteristics. Moreover, quantile regression analysis was used to identify the key factors related to the mental health variables of the back-to-Wuhan university students during the COVID-19 period. The results from 1017 participants suggested that the prevalence rates of the anxiety, depression, insomnia, and distress were 44%, 47.5%, 37.7%, 57.7%, respectively. Quantile regression showed that mental health scores were negatively associated to age, years from graduation, being discriminated against owing to the experience in Wuhan, and the attitude on the future of COVID-19, while was positively related to the education level (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Especially, the education level was highly related with anxiety (25thÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.64, 50thÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.54).

Rates of health care disruptions (eg, missing/canceling appointments, experiencing delays) and telehealth use for MS and non-MS medical care and mental health care. In this U.S. majority, predominantly White, and high socioeconomic status sample, 38% to 50% of pwMS reported experiencing disruptions in their MS and non-MS medical care and 20% to 33% reported disruptions in their mental health care; this was significantly lower than the rates observed among HCs. Compared with HCs, pwMS were more likely to use telehealth than in-person services, especially for mental health care. The majority of pwMS and HCs reported being satisfied with telehealth services. Individuals with higher degrees of functional limitation experienced more health care disruptions and were more likely to use telehealth services than individuals with lower degrees of functional limitation. Despite high health care disruption rates, pwMS frequently used and were highly satisfied with telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to physical limitations commonly observed in the MS population that may preclude travel, telehealth services should be continued even after resolution of the pandemic to expand access and reduce health care disparities.","Chen, Goverover, Botticello, DeLuca, Genova","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2021.12.028","20220422","COVID-19; Delivery of health care; Multiple sclerosis; Rehabilitation; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30468,""

"The impact of labour market shocks on mental health: evidence from the COVID-19 first wave","In this study, we estimate the effect of a negative labour market shock on individualsâ€™ levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. We use a dataset collected during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, on a representative sample of citizens from Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, interviewed on three occasions. We measure stress, anxiety and depression and labour shocks using validated scales. Our research design is a standard differences-in-differences model: we leverage the differential timing of shocks to identify the impact on mental health. In our estimations, a negative labour shock increases the measure of stress, anxiety, and depression by 16% of a standard deviation computed from the baseline.","Francesco Bogliacino et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0009-FEE-2F5","20220423","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; depression; covid-19; negative economic shocks; stress; anxiety","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30477,""
"EXPLORING SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC AND MENTAL HEALTH DIFFERENCES AMONG CONSTRUCTED MALE VICTIM SEVERITY PROFILES","Background. Stigmas and taboos surrounding male sexual violence, stating that men cannot be sexually victimized and would not experience many adverse effect as a result, continue to shroud the issue of male sexual victimization (SV). Male victims, therefore, remain under recognized in research, policy and treatment provisions. Furthermore, knowledge regarding male SV is severely compromised by studying male victims in convenience samples with a focus on hands-on forms of sexual violence. Finally, severity of SV is often described using a one-dimensional approach based on presumed severity leading to an oversimplified image. This study addresses these various gaps in scientific research by constructing severity profiles of male SV based on self-reported consequences, prevalence and co-occurrence of SV. Methods. A total of 1,078 male victims were selected from a Belgian nationally representative sample collected between October 2019 and January 2021. Profiles are constructed using latent class analysis. Socio-demographic differences across the profiles are examined through multinomial regression analysis. Finally, differences in current mental health problems across the profiles are assessed. Results. Four distinct male victim profiles are detected: (1) low severity â€“ low victimization (58.3%), (2) medium severity â€“ hands-off victimization (21.4%), (3) medium severity â€“ poly-victimization (13.3%), and (4) high severity â€“ poly-victimization(7.0%). Group comparisons show how male victims in the high severity class report significantly higher rates of mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and suicide and/or self-harm. Significant differences in class membership were found for age, occupational status, relationship status, sexual orientation and financial status. Conclusion. This study provides new insights in the patterns of male SV and highlights the presence of poly-victimization among male victims. Additionally, we point out how so-called minor forms of SV (i.e. hands-off SV) can have a large effect on male victims. The study ends with suggestions for care and future research.","Joke Depraetere et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E013C-BC2-288","20220423","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Criminology and Criminal Justice; male victims; sexual assault; sexual harassment; prevention; revictimization","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","",30478,""
