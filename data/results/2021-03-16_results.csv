"SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk of clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase: a retrospective cohort study","ObjectiveClinical sequelae have not been well characterized during the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 among adults 18 to 65 years old, and this study sought to fill that gap by evaluating excess risk and relative hazards for developing incident clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase.

DesignRetrospective cohort study including three propensity-matched groups.

SettingThis study merged three data sources from a large United States health plan: a large national administrative claims database, an outpatient lab testing database, and an inpatient hospital admissions database.

ParticipantsIndividuals 18 to 65 years old with continuous health plan enrollment from January 2019 to date of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Three comparator groups were identified and propensity-score matched to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2: a 2020 comparator group, a historical 2019 comparator group and a historical comparator group with viral lower respiratory tract illness (vLRTI).

Main outcome measuresOver 50 clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase (index date + 21 days) were ascertained using ICD-10 codes. Excess risk due to SARS-CoV-2 during the 4 months following the acute phase of illness and hazard ratios with 95% Bonferroni-corrected confidence intervals were calculated.

ResultsThis study found 14% of adults [&le;]65 years of age who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=193113) had at least one new clinical sequelae that required medical attention during the post-acute phase of illness. When considering risk for specific sequelae attributable to SARS-Cov-2 infection during the post-acute phase, clinical outcomes including chronic respiratory failure, cardiac arrythmia, hypercoagulability, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, amnesia (memory difficulty), diabetes, liver test abnormalities, myocarditis, anxiety and fatigue were significantly elevated compared to the three propensity-matched comparator groups (2020, 2019, vLRTI). Significant risk differences due to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 0.02 to 2.26 per 100 people and hazard ratios ranged from 1.24 to 25.65 when compared to the 2020 comparator group.

ConclusionsOur results confirm excess risk for developing clinical sequelae due to SARS-CoV-2 during the post-acute phase, including specific types of sequelae less commonly seen among other viral illnesses. Although individuals who were older, had pre-existing conditions, and were hospitalized due to COVID-19 were at greatest excess risk, younger adults ([&le;]50 years), adults who did not have pre-existing conditions or adults who were not hospitalized due to COVID-19 were still at elevated risk for developing new clinical sequelae. The elevated risk for incident sequelae during the post-acute phase is relevant for healthcare planning.

Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSSmall observational studies and case reports of hospitalized patients have shown some COVID-19 survivors suffer from short- and long-term sequelae. Few studies have characterized the excess risk of clinical sequelae attributable to SARS-CoV-2 during the post-acute phase among adults [&le;]65 years of age in a large generalizable sample.

What this study addsThis study found 14% of individuals [&le;]65 years of age who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=193113) had a diagnosis of at least one new sequelae that required medical attention during the post-acute phase of illness. Elevated risk for specific clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase of illness was noted across a range of organ systems including cardiovascular, neurologic, kidney, respiratory, and mental health complications. The risk for incident sequelae increases with age, pre-existing conditions, and hospitalization for COVID-19; however, even among adults [&le;] 50 years of age and individuals without pre-existing conditions or hospitalization due to COVID-19, risk for some clinical sequelae is still elevated. These results indicate where additional diagnostic follow-up, rehabilitation, and symptom management may be warranted among younger adults with milder infection.","Sarah E Daugherty; Yinglong Guo; Kevin Heath; Micah C Dasmarinas; Karol G Jubilo; Jirapat Samranvedhya; Marc Lipsitch; Ken Cohen","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253448","20210312","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11904,""
"Mental health issues among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic - A study from India","Mental health issues among health care workers (HCWs) in treatment settings during COVID-19 remains understudied in India. This study examines its prevalence and correlates among HCWs in Karnataka State, India. HCWs who attended a workshop to improve mental health well-being during COVID-19 completed an anonymous online questionnaire. In addition to socio-demographics, domains assessed include occupational characteristics, COVID-19 related concerns, anxiety/depression, substance use, suicidality, lifestyle and family functioning. Of the 3083 HCWs who completed the survey (response rate-51.4 %), anxiety disorder and depression was highest among those with frontline COVID-19 responsibilities (anxiety disorder-26.6 %, depression-23.8 %). Prevalence was significantly higher among those with clinical responsibilities compared to those with supportive responsibilities (anxiety disorder: 23.9 % vs 15.5 %), (depression: 20.0 % vs 14.2 %). In the backward step-wise logistic regression analysis, HCWs with anxiety disorder were more likely to be doctors/nurses/hospital assistants, older, female, unmarried, without a leisure activity, report increased alcohol use and suicidal thoughts after pandemic onset, and having a history of receiving mental health interventions. Participants with depression additionally had family distress and hardly ever exercised. To conclude, mental health issues are common among HCWs in India. Interventions need to ensure that HCWs are protected from mental health consequences of working in COVID-19 treatment settings.","Parthasarathy, Ts, K, Murthy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102626","20210315","COVID-19; Correlates; Health care workers; India; Mental health issues","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11905,""
"Stay Home, Stay Connected: A virtual model for enhanced prenatal support during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond","Pregnant patients during the COVID-19 pandemic experienced an increase in clinically significant anxiety and depression compared with pre-pandemic peers, [1] while social distancing simultaneously created barriers to social support and mental health services. To address this gap, we created a virtual prenatal support program, Stay Home, Stay Connected (SHSC). SHSC complements prenatal care by: 1) facilitating patient education opportunities; 2) fostering a supportive community of pregnant patients; and 3) connecting patients with mental health experts for coping strategies and care escalation as needed.","Ramirez Biermann, Choo, Carman, Siden, Minns, Peahl","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13676","20210315","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; prenatal care; prenatal education; social determinants of health; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11906,""
"Household- and employment-related risk factors for depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has generated multiple psychological stressors, which may increase the prevalence of depressive symptoms. Utilizing Canadian survey data, this study assessed household- and employment-related risk factors for depressive symptoms during the pandemic. A sample of 1005 English-speaking Canadian adults aged 18+ years completed a web-based survey after physical distancing measures were implemented across Canada. Hierarchical binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations of depressive symptoms with household- (household size, presence of children, residence locale) and employment-related (job with high risk of COVID-19 exposure, working from home, laid off/not working, financial worry)Ã‚Â risk factors, controlling for demographic factors (gender, age, education, income). About 20.4% of the sample reported depressive symptoms at least 3Ã‚Â days per week. The odds of experiencing depressive symptoms 3+ days in the past week were higher among women (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.67, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002) and younger adults (18-29Ã‚Â years AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.62, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). After adjusting for demographic variables, the odds of experiencing depressive symptoms were higher in households with 4+ persons (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.88, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), in households with children aged 6 to 12Ã‚Â years (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.98, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02), among those with a job at high risk for exposure to COVID-19 (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.82, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), and those experiencing financial worry due to COVID-19 ('very worried' AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.00, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Pandemic responses must include resources for mental health interventions. Additionally, further research is needed to track mental health trajectories and inform the development, targeting, and implementation of appropriate mental health prevention and treatment interventions.

"Impact of COVID-19 on Older Adults: A Rapid Review","The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the lives of countless members of the general population. Older adults are known to experience loneliness, age discrimination, and excessive worrying. It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that they would experience greater negative outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased isolation and risk for complications. This paper aims to synthesize the existing research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults. The secondary objective is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. A rapid review of the published literature was conducted on October 6, 2020, through a search in six online databases to synthesize results from published original studies regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults. The Human Development Model conceptual framework - Disability Creation Process (HDM-DCP) was used to describe and understand interactions between personal factors, environmental factors, and life habits. Methods and results are reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement. 135 records were included from the initial search strategy of 13,452 individual papers. One hundred and thirteen of 135 studies were determined to be level 4 according to the CEBM levels of evidence. The presence of psychological symptoms, the exacerbation of ageism, and the physical deterioration of aged populations have been noted. Decreased social life and fewer in-person social interactions reported during the pandemic were occasionally associated with reduced quality of life and increased depression. Difficulties accessing services, sleep disturbances and a reduction of physical activity were also noted. Our results highlight the need for adequate isolation and protective measures. Older adults represent a heterogeneous group, which could explain the contradictory results found in the literature. Individual, organizational, and institutional strategies should be put in place to assure that older adults are able to maintain social contacts, preserve family ties, and maintain the ability to give or receive help during this pandemic. Future studies should focus on specific consequences and needs of more at-risk older adults to ensure their inclusion, both in public health recommendations and consideration by policy makers.","Lebrasseur, Fortin-BÃƒÂ©dard, Lettre, Raymond, BussiÃƒÂ¨res, Lapierre, Faieta, Vincent, Duchesne, Ouellet, Gagnon, Tourigny, Lamontagne, Routhier","https://doi.org/10.2196/26474","20210315","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11908,""
"Public Funding of Evidence-Based Psychotherapy for Common Mental Disorders: Increasing Calls for Action in Canadian Provinces","Canada's provinces are without a publicly funded psychotherapy program for common mental disorders despite evidence that psychological services help reduce the length and number of depressive episodes, symptoms of post-traumatic stress and associated negative outcomes (hospitalizations and suicide attempts). Studies also show that including psychological services as part of the service package offered under the public health plan for those without access pays for itself. We posit that a publicly funded psychotherapy program in Canada, including digitized self-guided psychotherapy platforms for common mental disorders, will lead to improved population health useful in the COVID-19 context and beyond.","Vasiliadis, Spagnolo, Lesage","https://doi.org/10.12927/hcpol.2021.26437","20210315","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11909,""
"Measuring dysfunctional grief due to a COVID-19 loss: A Turkish validation study of the Pandemic Grief Scale","The global death toll to date of the COVID-19 pandemic has been enormous, and millions of people are grieving these losses. The aim of the current study is to validate a Turkish version of the Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS), which is a brief English-language mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional grief associated with a COVID-19 death. Participants were assessed using the PGS, Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). We surveyed 758 Turkish native speakers who participated online. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the factor structure of the PGS was satisfactory. The scale was internally consistent with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.77 and a composite reliability of 0.90. The PGS demonstrated construct validity with strong correlations with suicidal ideation and substance use coping. Positive correlations of the PGS with the PHQ-4 and the WSAS demonstrated adequate convergent validity. The PGS discriminates well between persons with and without dysfunctional grief using an optimized cut score of Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3 (89% sensitivity and 72% specificity). The PGS also demonstrates incremental validity by explaining most of the variance (43%) in functional impairment due to a COVID-19 loss beyond measures of depression and generalized anxiety. These findings closely replicate the original validation study on the PGS in English and suggest that the current Turkish version of the PGS is a valid and reliable measure to assess the severity of dysfunctional grief associated with a COVID-19 death.","Evren, Evren, Dalbudak, Topcu, Kutlu","https://doi.org/10.1080/07481187.2021.1897179","20210315","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11910,""
"BMI status and associations between affect, physical activity and anxiety among US children during COVID-19","There is concern regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the psychological and physical health of children, but to date, studies on mental health during the pandemic in children are limited. Furthermore, unprecedented lifestyle stressors associated with the pandemic may aggravate the childhood obesity epidemic, but the role of BMI on child activity levels and psychological outcomes during COVID-19 is unknown. We investigated how emotional responses (positive/negative affect), physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviours related to anxiety among U.S. children with healthy weight and overweight/obesity during the pandemic. Sixty-four typically developing children (63% girls, 53% healthy weight) aged 9 to 15Ã¢â‚¬â€°years completed two virtual visits during the height of 'stay-at-home' measures from April 22 to July 29, 2020. Children completed 24-hours PA recalls, state portion of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children and the 10-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children. Independent of child BMI status, child anxiety scores were over five standard deviations greater than normative values from paediatric populations prior to the pandemic. Higher positive affect and PA were each associated with reduced anxiety levels in children with overweight/obesity, whereas higher positive affect was associated with reduced anxiety in children with healthy weight. Greater leisure screen time was associated with higher negative affect irrespective of child BMI status. These associations highlight the potential mental health benefits of maintaining positive affect, engaging in PA and limiting leisure screen time for children during the pandemic and suggest that these associations may be particularly relevant for children with overweight/obesity.","Alves, Yunker, DeFendis, Xiang, Page","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijpo.12786","20210315","COVID-19; U.S. children; affect; leisure screen time; obesity; physical activity; state anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11911,""

There was no significant difference between the genders in terms of feeling depressed and feeling of lack of joy in life (p = 0.066, p = 0.308, respectively). Participants with chronic diseases stated that they felt more depressed and hopeless and a lack of joy in life more frequently (p &lt;0.001).

"Disordered eating in a population-based sample of young adults during the COVID-19 outbreak","The present study aimed to describe the experience of, and factors associated with, disordered eating in a population-based sample of emerging adults during the COVID-19 outbreak. Participants in the EAT 2010-2018 (Eating and Activity over Time) study were invited to complete the C-EAT (COVID-19 EAT) survey in April-May 2020. There were 720 respondents to the survey (age: 24.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.0Ã¢â‚¬â€°years). Psychological distress, stress, stress management, financial difficulties, and food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic were examined as cross-sectional correlates of disordered eating in 2020. Open-ended questions assessed the perceived impact of the pandemic on eating behaviors. Low stress management was significantly associated with a higher count of extreme unhealthy weight control behaviors (UWCBs). Food insecurity, higher depressive symptoms, and financial difficulties were significantly associated with a higher count of less extreme UWCBs. Higher stress and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with greater odds of binge eating. Six themes pertaining to disordered eating during the pandemic emerged: (a) mindless eating and snacking; (b) increased food consumption; (c) generalized decrease in appetite or dietary intake; (d) eating to cope; (e) pandemic-related reductions in dietary intake; and (f) re-emergence or marked increase in eating disorder symptoms. Psychological distress, stress management, financial difficulties, and abrupt schedule changes may have contributed to disordered eating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions that target stress management, depressive symptoms, and financial strain and provide tools to develop a routine may be particularly effective for emerging adults at risk of developing disordered eating during public health crises.","Simone, Emery, Hazzard, Eisenberg, Larson, Neumark-Sztainer","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23505","20210315","COVID-19; binge eating; financial difficulty; psychological distress; unhealthy weight control; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11913,""
"The Stress of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Beyond the Data","The year 2020 will go down in modern history as the one ravaged by a pandemic, the one which humbled the entire world.

Rapid online survey. Participants completed a series of online questionnaires regarding hearing ability, socialisation (pre- and during-pandemic), loneliness, anxiety, depression and cognitive function. A total of 80 participants over the age of 70 with access to the internet. There was a significant reduction in socialisation levels from pre-pandemic in this population. Hearing difficulties were significantly associated with greater levels of loneliness, depression and self-perceived cognitive dysfunction after controlling for age, gender, and level of education. Additionally, compared to pre-pandemic, people with hearing difficulties had increased odds of reporting worsened anxiety, depression, and memory during the COVID-19 pandemic, although only the effect of hearing difficulties on the change in memory reached statistical significance after controlling for age, gender, and level of education.

"Increased COVID-19-related fear and subjective risk perception regarding COVID-19 affects behavior in individuals with internal high-risk diseases","Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been keeping the world in suspense. Proven risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19 are common diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular or respiratory disorders. Until today, little is known about the psychological burden of individuals suffering from these high-risk diseases regard to COVID-19. The aim of the study was to define the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on behavior and mental health in individuals at high risk for developing a severe COVID-19 course. Items assessed generalized anxiety (GAD-7), COVID-19-related fear, adherent/dysfunctional safety behavior, and the subjective risk perception of regarding symptoms, having a severe course and dying because of COVID-19. Data were compared between participants with the high risk diseases and individuals without any of those diseases. 16,983 respondents completed the study. Generalized anxiety, COVID-19-related fear, adherent/dysfunctional safety behavior and subjective risk perception were elevated in participants with high-risk diseases. The increased COVID-19-related fear as a functional concern is a conclusion on the increased risk of a severe course. The functionality of the fear is reflected in people's increased need for security and includes an increase in both adherent and dysfunctional safety behavior that underlines the need for psychological support strategies.","Kohler, BÃƒÂ¤uerle, Schweda, WeismÃƒÂ¼ller, Fink, Musche, Robitzsch, Pfeiffer, Benecke, DÃƒÂ¶rrie, FÃƒÂ¼hrer, Taube, Rassaf, Teufel, Skoda","https://doi.org/10.1177/2150132721996898","20210315","COVID-19; anxiety; comorbidities; mental health; multimorbidity; safety behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11916,""

"COVID-19 and the Opioid Epidemic: Two Public Health Emergencies That Intersect With Chronic Pain","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world and catapulted the United States into one of the deepest recessions in history. While this pandemic rages, the opioid crisis worsens. During this period, the pandemic has resulted in the decimation of most conventional medical services, including those of chronic pain management, with the exception of virtual care and telehealth. Many chronic pain patients have been impacted in numerous ways, with increases in cardiovascular disease, mental health problems, cognitive dysfunction, and early death. The epidemic has also resulted in severe economic and physiological consequences for providers. Drug deaths in America, which fell for the first time in 25Ã‚Â years in 2018, rose to record numbers in 2019 and are continuing to climb, worsened by the coronavirus pandemic. The opioid epidemic was already resurfacing with a 5% increase in overall deaths from 2018; however, the preliminary data show that prescription opioid deaths continued to decline, while at the same time deaths due to fentanyl, methamphetamine, and cocaine climbed, with some reductions in heroin deaths. The health tracker data also showed that along with an almost 88% decline in elective surgeries, pain-related prescriptions declined 15.1%. Despite increases in telehealth, outpatient services declined and only began returning towards normal at an extremely slow pace, accompanied by reduced productivity and increased practice costs. This review, therefore, emphasizes the devastating consequences of concurrent epidemics on chronic pain management and the need to develop best practice efforts to preserve access to treatment for chronic pain.","Manchikanti, Vanaparthy, Atluri, Sachdeva, Kaye, Hirsch","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40122-021-00243-2","20210315","COVID-19; Chronic pain; Concurrent epidemic; Epidemics; Interventional techniques; Opioid epidemic; Opioid use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11918,""
"Usefulness of serial lung ultrasound for a severe COVID-19 patient on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","Computed tomography (CT) is the most reliable method to evaluate the progression of COVID-19 pneumonitis. However, in a pandemic, transportation of critically ill invasively ventilated patients to radiology facilities is challenging, especially for those on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Notably, lung ultrasound (LUS) is a favored alternative imaging modality due to its ease of use at the point of care, which reduces the infectious risk of exposure and transmission; repeatability; absence of radiation exposure; and low cost. We demonstrated that serial LUS compares favorably with other imaging modalities in terms of usefulness for evaluating lung aeration and recovery in an ECMO-managed COVID-19 patient.","Taniguchi, Ohta, Honzawa, Takahashi, Iwashita, Abe, Takeuchi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmcr.2021.101383","20210315","Coronavirus disease; Lung ultrasound; Patient self-inflicted lung injury; Point-of-care ultrasound; Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11919,""
"Improving Rehabilitation Information-Giving to Intensive Care Unit Survivors to Aid in Physical and Psychological Recovery","Intensive care unit (ICU) survivors have an increased mortality rate and reduced quality of life associated with post-ICU syndrome: a triad of physical, psychiatric and cognitive decline. Following evidence on the benefits of early rehabilitation, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) CG83 guidelines instruct the provision of rehabilitation information to ICU patients before discharge. Only 33% of UK trusts meet these guidelines. The aim of this project was to reach 100% patient and ICU therapist satisfaction with the rehabilitation information given before ICU discharge at Medway Maritime Hospital, within four months. Patient and therapist satisfaction was assessed using questionnaires at baseline and following each Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle. In PDSA1, a generalised rehabilitation information booklet was created and distributed to ICU survivors pre-discharge. For PDSA2, a personalised rehabilitation plan completed by therapists was added. During PDSA3, the booklet was enriched with mental health and speech and language therapy sections. Results showed a shift in patient satisfaction scores, indicating a significant change in the median from 20% at baseline to 87% after PDSA3. This was also reflected in the therapist satisfaction scores, which increased significantly from 60% at baseline to 100%. The introduction of a generalised information booklet, supplemented with a personalised recovery plan, is an effective way of increasing critical care patient and therapist satisfaction with post-discharge rehabilitation information provision. This should translate to greater patient engagement with rehabilitation and improved long-term outcomes.Ã‚Â This is ever more pertinent, as the COVID-19 pandemic will exponentially increase the numbers of ICU survivors at risk of long-term morbidity and mortality.","Fardanesh, Stavropoulou-Tatla, Grassby, Elliott","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13247","20210315","intensive care unit; nice guidelines; post-icu syndrome; rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11920,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on People With Epilepsy and Vagal Nerve Stimulation","<b>Objectives:</b> Restrictive measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to limit contagion, have had a severe impact on mental health. The burden of lockdown has been particularly heavy on patients with chronic neurologic diseases such as People with Epilepsy (PwE). Our survey aims to describe the struggles and needs of Drug-Resistant (DR) PwE with implanted Vagal Nerve Stimulator (VNS) during the first wave of the COVID-19 lockdown in order to find strategies that help patients cope with present or future periods of restriction. <b>Methods:</b> We collected answers from 30 respondents who underwent an online survey including socio-demographic and clinical information and COVID-19-related information. Depression, anxiety symptoms, and sleep quality were investigated in patients through BDI II, GAD-7, and the PSQI scale. <b>Results:</b> In all, 46% of our sample reported an increase in the number of seizures; the entire sample complained of epilepsy-related issues (medication availability, VSN adjustments, anxiety, sleep disturbance); one out of three participants reported major epilepsy issues felt urgent; 30% had to postpone scheduled examination. Significantly higher scores for depression and anxiety scales were found in patients who perceived seizure frequency worsening and reported major epilepsy-related issues. <b>Conclusion:</b> Preliminary findings showed that the first lockdown influenced the clinical and psychological status of PwE and was related to seizures worsening. The lack of medical assistance and control on VNS therapy left patients to cope with the situation without a chance to contact a specialist. We discuss how a wider implementation of telemedicine programs could facilitate remote assistance of PwE with a VNS implant.","Grande, Tufo, Ciavarro, Di Muccio, Fuggetta, Silvestri, Bevacqua, Lanzone, Assenza","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.640581","20210315","COVID-19; epilepsy; mental health; telemedicine; vagal nerve stimulator","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11921,""
"Effects of High-Intensity Interval Training and Moderate-Intensity Training on Stress, Depression, Anxiety, and Resilience in Healthy Adults During Coronavirus Disease 2019 Confinement: A Randomized Controlled Trial","<b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to compare the effects of two intervention programs, (1) high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and (2) moderate-intensity training (MIT), on anxiety, depression, stress, and resilience during the confinement caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in healthy adults. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 67 adults who participated were randomly assigned to two groups: HIIT and MIT groups. The MIT group had to perform a home-based intervention based on aerobic exercises, whereas the HIIT group had to perform a home-based intervention based on HIIT exercises. The two groups (HIIT and MIT) had to complete the same physical exercise volume, 40 min per session (6 days per week) during the confinement period (6 weeks). Depression, anxiety, stress, and resilience were assessed before and after the intervention. <b>Results:</b> Results showed that HIIT and MIT significantly reduced the stress, anxiety, and depression as well as increase the resilience (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the improvements obtained in the HIIT group seem to be greater than those of the MIT group in depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> HIIT and MIT decreased anxiety, stress, and depression as well as increased resilience during the COVID-19 confinement.

"The Influence of Personality, Resilience, and Alexithymia on Mental Health During COVID-19 Pandemic","Following the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries worldwide have put lockdowns in place to prevent the virus from spreading. Evidence shows that lockdown measures can affect mental health; it is, therefore, important to identify the psychological characteristics making individuals more vulnerable. The present study aimed, first, to identify, through a cluster analysis, the psychological attributes that characterize individuals with similar psychological responses to the COVID-19 home confinement; second, to investigate whether different psychological characteristics, such as personality traits, alexithymia, and resilience, specifically influence anxiety, stress, and depression, depending on the scope of the confinement. We analyzed data from 393 participants who completed an online survey on their experiences during two different phases of the Italian lockdown, characterized by more or less strict measures of confinement. Two clusters were identified which included participants reporting a better (+ER) and worse (-ER) emotional response to the lockdown, respectively. Individuals in the -ER group showed lower emotional stability, resilience, and higher alexithymia. Moreover, even if lifting part of the restrictions decreased psychological distress among all participants, a reduction in perceived stress was observed only among individuals with high resilience. Finally, personality traits, alexithymia, and resilience differently affected depression, anxiety, and stress. Our results suggest that different psychological interventions should be planned depending on the context: mental health professionals should focus on enhancing the individuals' coping strategies to alleviate stress in emergencies, while long-term intervention aiming at alleviating anxiety and depressive symptoms should focus on alexithymic tendencies and personality constructs.","Osimo, Aiello, Gentili, Ionta, Cecchetto","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.630751","20210315","COVID-19 pandemic; alexithymia (TAS-20); lockdown; mental health Ã¢â‚¬â€œ state of emotional and social well-being; personality; resilience (psychological)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11923,""
"Benefits of Expressive Writing on Healthcare Workers' Psychological Adjustment During the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and promptly became a pandemic worldwide, endangering health and life but also causing mild-to-severe psychological distress to lots of people, including healthcare workers (HCWs). Several studies have already showed a high prevalence of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms in HCWs but less is known about the efficacy of psychological interventions for relieving their mental distress. The aims of this study were: (1) to evaluate the psychological adjustment of Italian HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) to investigate the efficacy of an expressive writing (EW) intervention, based on Pennebaker's paradigmatic protocol, on their psychological adjustment; (3) to analyze if outcomes of EW vary in function of individual differences (age, gender, marital status, and baseline values of symptoms). Fifty-five HCWs were randomly assigned to one of two writing conditions: EW (<i>n</i> = 30) or neutral writing (NW; <i>n</i> = 25). Psychological adjustment (in terms of ptsd, depression and global psychopathology's symptoms, perceived social support, and resilience) was assessed before and after three writing sessions. Participants who received the EW intervention showed higher improvements in ptsd, depression, and global psychopathology symptoms. Improvements in EW group varied in function of age, gender, marital status, and baseline values: young, men, married participants and those who had higher baseline scores showed a higher reduction of psychological distress symptoms while women, single and those who had lower baseline value showed increased social support, and resilience. In conclusion, the EW intervention had positive effects which varied in function of individual differences on HCWs' psychological health.","Procaccia, Segre, Tamanza, Manzoni","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.624176","20210315","COVID-19; distress; expressive writing; healthcare workers; psychological adjustment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11924,""
"Dealing With COVID-19 Patients: A Moderated Mediation Model of Exposure to Patients' Death and Mental Health of Italian Health Care Workers","<b>Introduction:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic is asking health care workers (HCWs) to meet extraordinary challenges. In turn, HCWs were experiencing tremendous psycho-social crisis as they have had to deal with unexpected emotional requirements (ERs) arising from caring for suffering and dying patients on a daily basis. In that context, recent studies have highlighted how HCWs working during the COVID-19 outbreak manifested extreme emotional and behavioral reactions that may have impacted their mental health, increasing the risk for developing post-traumatic stress symptoms. <b>Purpose:</b> The aim of the study was to investigate post-traumatic stress symptoms, such as intrusion symptoms, as a potential mediator of the link between ERs and crying at work, and whether rumination moderates the relationship between ERs and intrusion-based PTS symptoms among HCWs who have had to deal with patients dying from COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> An online cross-sectional study design was performed. A total of 543 Italian HCWs (physicians and nurses) participated in the study. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. We used the SPSS version of bootstrap-based PROCESS macro for testing the moderated mediation model. <b>Results:</b> ERs had an indirect effect on crying at work through the mediating role of intrusion symptoms. Results from the moderated mediation model showed that rumination moderated the indirect effect of ERs on crying at work via intrusion symptoms, and this effect was significant only for high rumination. Furthermore, when we tested for an alternative model where rumination moderates the direct effect of ERs on crying at work, this moderation was not significant. <b>Conclusions:</b> As the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, there is an urgent need for decision-makers to rapidly implement interventions aimed at offering timely psychological support to HCWs, especially in those contexts where the risk of emotional labor associated to patients dying from COVID-19 is higher.","Portoghese, Galletta, Meloni, Piras, Finco, D'Aloja, Campagna","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.622415","20210315","COVID-19 pandemic; crying at work; emotional requirements; healthcare workers; intrusion symptoms; patients' deaths; rumination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11925,""
"Stress, Sleep and Psychological Impact in Healthcare Workers During the Early Phase of COVID-19 in India: A Factor Analysis","<b>Background:</b> Risks to healthcare workers have escalated during the pandemic and they are likely to experience a greater level of stress. This cross-sectional study investigated mental distress among healthcare workers during the early phase of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in India. <b>Method:</b> 140 healthcare workers of a tertiary care hospital in India were assessed for perceived stress and insomnia. A factor analysis with principal component method reduced these questions to four components which were categorized as insomnia, stress-related anxiety, stress-related irritability, and stress-related hopelessness. Further statistical analyses were done on these factor scores to identify the predictors and investigate the differences between the different categories of healthcare workers. <b>Result:</b> Doctors had the highest level of anxiety among the healthcare workers. Both doctors and nurses perceived a greater level of irritability than the other HCWs. Compared to doctors and nurses, other HCWs were more likely to experience insomnia. Lower age, higher education, female gender, and urban habitat were associated with greater perception of anxiety. Older age, being quarantined, and single marital status were the significant predictors of irritability. Female gender, single marital-status, and higher number of medical ailments contributed to perceived hopelessness. Quarantine significantly predicted insomnia. <b>Conclusion:</b> Different categories of healthcare workers are experiencing varied mental health problems owing to their heterogeneous socio-demographic backgrounds. Tailored and personalized care, as well as policies, might help in alleviating their problems. Further research is warranted to explore the psychological distress and remedies among these frontline workers during and after the ongoing pandemic crisis.","Chatterjee, Chakrabarty, Banerjee, Grover, Chatterjee, Dan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.611314","20210315","COVID-19; healthcare workers; perceived stress; physicians; psychological wellbeing; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11926,""
"In the Eye of the Covid-19 Storm: A Web-Based Survey of Psychological Distress Among People Living in Lombardy","In March 2020, the World Health Organization announced the Covid-19 outbreak a pandemic and restrictive measures were enacted by the Governments to fight the spread of the virus. In Italy, these measures included a nationwide lockdown, with limited exceptions including grocery shopping, certain work activities, and healthcare. Consistently with findings from previous studies investigating the psychological impact of similar pandemics [e.g., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)], there is evidence that Covid-19 is associated with negative mental health outcomes. Given this background, we conducted a cross-sectional study aimed at investigating the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent restrictive measures imposed by the Government on the psychological health of Italian men and women aged = 18 years and living in Lombardy, one of the worst-hit regions. The study also aimed at identifying what factors are associated with specific psychological outcomes. Thus, we developed an online survey that included a researcher-made questionnaire to collect sociodemographic, household, general health, and pandemic-related information. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Perceived Stress Scale were used to assess anxiety, depression, and perceived stress, respectively. We found that younger age, greater concerns about the pandemic, female gender, being unmarried, not having children, and being a student were associated with worse psychological health. These findings may provide further insight into the risk factors associated with negative psychological outcomes during the current pandemic, with identification of vulnerable groups. This body of evidence may help professionals implement targeted psychosocial treatment and prevention programs.","Saita, Facchin, Pagnini, Molgora","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.566753","20210315","COVID-19; Lombardy (Italy); anxiety; depression; online survey; perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11927,""
"Living With Bipolar Disorder in the Time of Covid-19: Biorhythms During the Severe Lockdown in Cagliari, Italy, and the Moderate Lockdown in Tunis, Tunisia","<b>Background:</b> Restrictions during Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, in which rhythms of life have been compromised, can influence the course of bipolar disorder (BD). This study follows patients with bipolar disorder living in two geographically close cities (Cagliari and Tunis), but with different lockdown conditions: less severe in Tunis. <b>Methods:</b> Two cohorts were evaluated during lockdown (April 2020, t0) and 2 months later with lockdown lifted for a month (t1). Individuals were: over 18 years old without gender exclusion, BD I or II, in care for at least 1 year, received a clinical interview in the month before the start of the lockdown, stable clinically before the lockdown. The assessment was conducted by telephone by a psychiatrist or psychologist with good knowledge of patients. Diagnoses were made according to DSM-5 criteria. Depressive symptoms were collected through the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; cut-off 14 indicative of depressive episode. Circadian rhythms were measured using the BRIAN scale. <b>Results:</b> Forty individuals in Cagliari (70%female, age 48.57 Ã‚Â± 11.64) and 30 in Tunis (53.3% Female, age 41.8 Ã‚Â± 13.22) were recruited. In Cagliari at t0 45% had depressive episodes against none in Tunis, a similar difference appeared at t1. At t0 and t1 the Cagliari sample had more dysfunctional scores in the overall BRIAN scale and in the areas of sleep, activities and social rhythms; no differences were found in nutrition, both samples had predominantly nocturnal rhythm. In Cagliari at t0 and t1, the depressive sub-group showed more dysfunctional scores in the BRIAN areas sleep, activity, and nutrition. However, the differences in biological rhythms resulted, through ANCOVA analysis, independent of the co-presence of depressive symptoms. <b>Discussion:</b> A rigid lockdown could expose people with BD to depressive relapse through dysregulation of biological rhythms. The return to more functional rhythms did not appear 1 month after lockdown. The rekindling of the pandemic and the restoration of new restrictive measures will prevent, at least in the short term, the beneficial effect of a return to normality of the two cohorts. This was a limited exploratory study; future studies with larger samples and longer observational time are needed to verify the hypothesis.","Carta, Ouali, Perra, Ben Cheikh Ahmed, Boe, Aissa, Lorrai, Cossu, Aresti, Preti, Nacef","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.634765","20210315","COVID-19; biorhythms; bipolar disorder; depressive episodes; lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11928,""

"The mediator role of the fear of COVID-19 in the relationship between psychological resilience and life satisfaction","COVID-19, which has recently affected the world, has caused serious adversities in many areas as well as on the mental health of individuals. People have had a serious fearful mood due to situations such as catching COVID-19, having health problems after catching the disease, and worrying about infecting someone else. This negative mood is discussed in the literature through the concept of the fear of COVID-19. Accordingly, the mediator role of the fear of COVID-19 in the relationship between psychological resilience and life satisfaction was examined in this study. This study was conducted with 430 Turkish university students, 279 women and 151 men, who are between the ages of 18 and 30. The data of the study were collected with the psychological resilience, the fear of COVID-19 and life satisfaction scales. As a result of the analysis, it was concluded that psychological resilience is a negative predictor of the fear of COVID-19 and a positive predictor of life satisfaction, and that the fear of COVID-19 is a negative predictor of life satisfaction.

A systematic review was made following the PRISMA protocol (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis). We included any type of study on health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, with results about their mental health. We were, therefore, interested in quantitative studies examining the prevalence of problems and effects of interventions, as well as qualitative studies examining experiences. We had no restrictions related to study design, methodological quality or language. Twenty-one studies reported on the urgent need for interventions to prevent or reduce mental health problems caused by COVID-19 among health professionals in ICU. Eleven studies demonstrated possibilities for interventions involving organizational adjustments in the ICU, particularly linked to emotional conflicts in the fight against COVID-19. The disproportion between the need for technological supplies of intensive care medicine and their scarcity promotes, among many factors, high rates of psychological distress. Anxiety, irritability, insomnia, fear and anguish were observed during the pandemic, probably related to extremely high workloads and the lack of personal protective equipment.","da Silva, Barbosa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2021.110299","20210315","COVID-19; Clinical and psychological aspects; Experiences and perceptions from health professionals in ICU; Health workers in ICU; Intensive Care Unit (ICU)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11933,""

We examine the time-course shift of psychological burden among suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. Participants with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were included in the cohort. Consecutive surveys were conducted upon hospital admission, discharge, and during outpatient follow-up by adapting the 5-item brief symptom rating scale (BSRS-5) assessing psychological symptoms including anxiety, depression, hostility, interpersonal sensitivity, and insomnia. The sixth measure to observe suicidal ideation was also included. A total of 109 eligible patients participated in the study, in which 83.49% reported no distress upon hospital admission, while 2.75%, 3.66%, and 10.1% patients were assessed as being with severe, moderate and mild psychological distress, respectively. Overall, age, sex, and history of contact did not significantly differ between patients with and without psychological distress.

"Experiences of lockdown during the Covid-19 pandemic: descriptive findings from a survey of families in the Born in Bradford study","<b>Background</b>: Lockdown measures implemented to contain the Covid-19 virus have increased health inequalities, with families from deprived and ethnically diverse backgrounds most likely to be adversely affected. This paper describes the experiences of families living in the multi-ethnic and deprived city of Bradford, England. <b>Methods</b>: A wave of survey data collection using a combination of email, text and phone with postal follow-up during the first Covid-19 UK lockdown (10th April to 30 <sup>th</sup> June 2020) with parents participating in two longitudinal studies. Cross tabulations explored variation by ethnicity and financial insecurity. Text from open questions was analysed using thematic analysis. <b>Results</b>: Of 7,652 families invited, 2,144 (28%) participated. The results presented are based on the 2,043 (95%) mothers' responses: 957 (47%) of whom were of Pakistani heritage, 715 (35%) White British and 356 (18%) other ethnicity 971 (46%) lived in the most deprived decile of material deprivation in England. and 738 (37%) were financially insecure. Many families lived in poor quality (N=574, 28%), overcrowded (N=364, 19%) housing. Food (N=396, 20%), employment (N=728, 37%) and housing (N=204, 10%) insecurities were common, particularly in those who were furloughed, self-employed not working or unemployed. Clinically important depression and anxiety were reported by 372 (19%) and 318 (16%) mothers. Ethnic minority and financially insecure families had a worse experience during the lockdown across all domains, with the exception of mental health which appeared worse in White British mothers. Ã‚Â Open text responses corroborated these findings and highlighted high levels of anxiety and fear about Covid-19. <b>Conclusions</b>: There is a need for policy makers and commissioners to better support vulnerable families during and after the pandemic. Future work will use longitudinal data from before the pandemic, and from future surveys during the pandemic, to describe trajectories and the long-term consequences of the pandemic on vulnerable populations.","Dickerson, Kelly, Lockyer, Bridges, Cartwright, Willan, Shire, Crossley, Bryant, Sheldon, Lawlor, Wright, McEachan, Pickett","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16317.2","20210315","Born in Bradford; Covid-19; cohorts; ethnicity; health inequalities; mental health; poverty; social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11935,""
"Surging trends in prescriptions and costs of antidepressants in England amid COVID-19","The social restrictions amid coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have posed a serious threat to mental health and have implications in the use of medications for mental health including antidepressants (ADs). This study investigated the trends in prescriptions and costs of various ADs in England during COVID-19 pandemic. National prescribing rates and net ingredient costs (NIC) of all ADs prescriptions during 2016 to 2020 were analyed. The total number of ADs prescriptionsÃ‚Â dispensed during COVID-19 pandemic (January to December 2020) were 78 million, 4 million more than in 2019 that costed NHS England Ã‚Â£ 139Ã‚Â million more than in 2019. Sertraline, an SSRI antidepressant drug,Ã‚Â alone accounted for an extra Ã‚Â£113 million during 2020 than in 2019.Ã‚Â The peak dispensing for ADs was observed in March 2020 while the total costs for AD drugs peaked in April 2020. The rising prescription costsÃ‚Â for ADs during COVID-19 pandemic is a potential cause of concern, inÃ‚Â particular the increasingÃ‚Â useÃ‚Â in adolescents and younger adultsÃ‚Â needs attention, who are at a higher risk of life-threatening adverse drug reactions.","Rabeea, Merchant, Khan, Kow, Hasan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40199-021-00390-z","20210314","Antidepressants; Anxiety; Cost; Depression; Interventions; Mental health; Prescribing trends; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11936,""
"New dimensions for hospital services and early detection of disease: a Review from the Lancet Commission into liver disease in the UK","This Review, in addressing the unacceptably high mortality of patients with liver disease admitted to acute hospitals, reinforces the need for integrated clinical services. The masterplan described is based on regional, geographically sited liver centres, each linked to four to six surrounding district general hospitals-a pattern of care similar to that successfully introduced for stroke services. The plan includes the establishment of a lead and deputy lead clinician in each acute hospital, preferably a hepatologist or gastroenterologist with a special interest in liver disease, who will have prime responsibility for organising the care of admitted patients with liver disease on a 24/7 basis. Essential for the plan is greater access to intensive care units and high-dependency units, in line with the reconfiguration of emergency care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This Review strongly recommends full implementation of alcohol care teams in hospitals and improved working links with acute medical services. We also endorse recommendations from paediatric liver services to improve overall survival figures by diagnosing biliary atresia earlier based on stool colour charts and better caring for patients with impaired cognitive ability and developmental mental health problems. Pilot studies of earlier diagnosis have shown encouraging progress, with 5-6% of previously undiagnosed cases of severe fibrosis or cirrhosis identified through use of a portable FibroScan in primary care. Similar approaches to the detection of early asymptomatic disease are described in accounts from the devolved nations, and the potential of digital technology in improving the value of clinical consultation and screening programmes in primary care is highlighted. The striking contribution of comorbidities, particularly obesity and diabetes (with excess alcohol consumption known to be a major factor in obesity), to mortality in COVID-19 reinforces the need for fiscal and other long delayed regulatory measures to reduce the prevalence of obesity. These measures include the food sugar levy and the introduction of the minimum unit price policy to reduce alcohol consumption. Improving public health, this Review emphasises, will not only mitigate the severity of further waves of COVID-19, but is crucial to reducing the unacceptable burden from liver disease in the UK.","Williams, Alessi, Alexander, Allison, Aspinall, Batterham, Bhala, Day, Dhawan, Drummond, Ferguson, Foster, Gilmore, Goldacre, Gordon, Henn, Kelly, MacGilchrist, McCorry, McDougall, Mirza, Moriarty, Newsome, Pinder, Roberts, Rutter, Ryder, Samyn, Severi, Sheron, Thorburn, Verne, Williams, Yeoman","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32396-5","20210314","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11937,""
"Editorial: Learning From the Pandemic: &quot;Building Back Better&quot; Through Research on Risk and Resilience With Diverse Populations","The COVID-19 pandemic is responsible for over 2 million deaths and unprecedented disruption in the daily lives of people in communities worldwide. Efforts to slow viral transmission including quarantine and school closures have introduced profound changes in children's lives. Decreased opportunities for social interaction and physical activity, reduced instruction time impacting academic progress, changing nutritional habits and soaring rates of hunger, and increasing digital media use are just several of the myriad ways in which young people's lives have been altered. Emerging studies suggest that health and emotional wellbeing has been negatively impacted across developmental. There are many reasons to suspect that minoritized communities are particularly vulnerable, given the disproportionate toll COVID-19 has taken on the physical health and economic stability of Black, Latinx/Hispanic, and Native American communities who have experienced generations of structural racism and related health disparities. These indications of a percolating national and global crisis in children's mental health occur against a pre-COVID backdrop of inadequate health care infrastructure to meet the needs of children and families requiring mental health support. With these deeply concerning trends in mind, this month's Journal features new research from Penner et al. in which investigators found a protective effect of stay-at-home regulations on the mental health of a cohort of middle school students in the United States early in the pandemic. This study deserves our attention as we seek to understand the complex and evolving impacts of the pandemic upon youth mental health, and raises important questions about cultural, biological, and social factors that might contribute to resilience in specific youth and communities.<sup>1</sup>.","Biel, Hamrah","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2021.02.001","20210315","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-16","",11938,""

"Sleeping for Two Structured Study Protocol","Insomnia and sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy and have potentially significant consequences for both maternal and infant health. There is limited research examining the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) during pregnancy. With increased distress and limited access to services during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is also an unprecedented need for telehealth delivery of treatment programs for pregnant women. The primary aim of the trial is to evaluate the impact of in-person or telehealth cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) versus a treatment as usual (TAU) control group in reducing symptoms of insomnia experienced in pregnancy. We hypothesize that participants who receive CBT-I delivered in person or via telehealth will report fewer insomnia symptoms. The secondary aims are to investigate if CBT-I versus TAU increases gestational length and reduces symptoms of depression. We hypothesize that receiving CBT-I will be associated with longer gestational length (as confirmed by public health records) and lower depressive symptoms.","Anna L.
