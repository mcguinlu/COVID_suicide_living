"Reorganization of Substance Use Treatment and Harm Reduction Services during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Global Survey","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people with substance use disorders (SUDs) worldwide, and healthcare systems have reorganized their services in response to the pandemic. Methods: One week after the announcement of the COVID-19 as a pandemic, in a global survey, 177 addiction medicine professionals described COVID-19-related health responses in their own 77 countries in terms of SUD treatment and harm reduction services. The health response is categorized around (1) managerial measures and systems, (2) logistics, (3) service providers, and (4) vulnerable groups. Results: Respondents from over 88% of countries reported that core medical and psychiatric care for SUDs had continued; however, only 56% of countries reported having had any business continuity plan, and 37.5% of countries reported shortages of methadone or buprenorphine supplies. Participants of 41% of countries reported partial discontinuation of harm-reduction services such as needle and syringe programs and condom distribution. 57% of overdose prevention interventions and 81% of outreach services also having been negatively impacted. Conclusions: Participants reported that SUD treatment and harm reduction services had been significantly impacted globally early during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our findings, we provide a series of recommendations to support countries to be prepared more efficiently for future waves or similar pandemics to 1) help policymakers generate business continuity plans, 2) maintain the use of evidence-based interventions for people with SUDs, 3) be prepared for adequate medication supplies, 4) integrate harm reduction programs with other treatment modalities and 5) have specific considerations for vulnerable groups such as immigrants and refugees.","Seyed Ramin Radfar; Cornelis A J De Jong; Ali Farhoudian; Mohsen Ebrahimi; Parnian Rafei; Mehrnoosh Vahidi; Masud Yunesian; Christos Kouimtsidis; Shalini Arunogiri; Omid Massah; Abbas Deylamizadeh; Kathleen T Brady; Anja Busse; - ISAM-PPIG Global Survey Consortium; Marc N Potenza; Hamed Ekhtiari; Alexander Mario Baldacchino","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.21.20199133","","Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-23","",5002,""

"Emergency department mental health presentations before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in Western Australia","Coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to high levels of psychological distress in the community. This study aimed to examine whether emergency departments (EDs) also recorded a rise in mental health presentations. Changes in the number, and type, of mental health presentations to Western Australia EDs were examined between January and May 2020, and compared to 2019. Data showed an unexpected decrease in the number of mental health presentations, compared to 2019, which was temporally coincident with the rise in local COVID-19 cases. Presentations for anxiety and panic symptoms, and social and behavioural issues, increased by 11.1% and 6.5%, respectively, but suicidal and self-harm behaviours decreased by 26%. A rise in local COVID-19 cases was associated with a decrease in mental health presentations to EDs. This has important implications for the planning and provision of healthcare services in the current pandemic.","Dragovic, Pascu, Hall, Ingram, Waters","https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856220960673","20200922","COVID-19; coronavirus; emergency department; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-23","",5004,""

"Toxicity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine following therapeutic use or overdose","While chloroquine, a derivative of quinine, has been used as an antimalarial for 70Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, hydroxychloroquine is now used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In 2020, hydroxychloroquine (and to a lesser extent chloroquine) also received attention as a possible treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During investigation for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, concerns for serious adverse events arose. We review the toxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine use both short-term and long-term and in overdose. Medline (<i>via</i> OVID) was searched from its inception through June 7 2020 using the following as either MeSH or keyword terms: (&quot;Chloroquine/&quot; or &quot;Hydroxychloroquine/&quot;) AND (&quot;Adverse Drug Event/&quot; or &quot;Toxicities, Drug/&quot; or &quot;Toxic.mp.&quot; or &quot;Toxicity.mp.&quot; or &quot;Overdose.mp.&quot;). We limited resultant articles to those published in English and reporting on Human subjects. This search yielded 330 articles, of which 57 were included. Articles were excluded due to lack of relevance, not reporting desired outcomes, or being duplicative in their content. Twenty-five additional articles were identified through screening references of included articles. To identify toxicities in individuals treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with COVID-19, we searched PubMed on June 10th, 2020: (&quot;Chloroquine&quot; or &quot;Hydroxychloroquine&quot;) AND (&quot;Coronavirus&quot; or &quot;COVID-19&quot; or &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot;). This search resulted in 638 articles. We reviewed articles for reporting of adverse events or toxicities. Most citations were excluded because they did not include original investigations or extrapolated data from subjects that did not have COVID-19; 34 citations were relevant. For the drug-interactions section, relevant classes and agents were identified through a screen of the https://www.covid19-druginteractions.org/ website. We then conducted targeted searches of PubMed up to June 7th 2020 combining &quot;chloroquine&quot; and &quot;hydroxychloroquine&quot; with terms for specific drug classes and drugs identified from the drug-interaction site as potentially relevant. We found 29 relevant articles. <i>Gastrointestinal</i>: Gastrointestinal toxicities are the most common to occur following initiation of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea account for most reported intolerances. <i>Glucose abnormalities</i>: Alterations in blood glucose concentrations may occur with hydroxychloroquine but are rare with standard therapeutic use. <i>Cardiotoxicity</i>: Short-term use can produce conduction abnormalities. Evidence from COVID-19 treatment suggests QT/QTc prolongation is of concern, particularly when used in combination with azithromycin, although disagreement exists across studies. <i>Dermatologic</i>: Drug eruptions or rashes, followed by cutaneous hyperpigmentation, pruritis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, may occur within days to weeks of exposure but usually resolve with the discontinuation of therapy. <i>Neuropsychiatric</i>: Reported symptoms include confusion, disorientation, and hallucination within 24-48Ã¢â‚¬â€°h of drug initiation. <i>Other toxicities:</i> Hemolysis and anemia may occur in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 was associated with elevation in creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB activities with more events in the higher-dose group. <i>Retinopathy</i>: Retinopathy is the major dose-limiting toxicity associated with long-term use; the risk is higher with increasing age, dose, and duration of usage. <i>Cardiotoxicity</i>: Long-term use has been associated with conduction abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and valvular disorders. <i>Neurotoxicity</i>: Rarely myositis and muscle weakness, extremity weakness, and pseudoparkinsonism have been reported. Symptoms in overdose manifest rapidly (minutes to hours) and cardiotoxicity such as cardiovascular shock and collapse are most prominent. Neurotoxic effects such as psychosis and seizure may also occur. Hydroxychloroquine is a generally well-tolerated medication. Short-term (days to weeks) toxicity includes gastrointestinal effects and rarely glucose abnormalities, dermatologic reactions, and neuropsychiatric events. Cardiotoxicity became of increased concern with its use in COVID-19 patients. Long-term (years) toxicities include retinopathy, neuromyotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity (conduction abnormalities, cardiomyopathy). Deaths from overdoses most often result from cardiovascular collapse.","Doyno, Sobieraj, Baker","https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2020.1817479","20200922","COVID-19; Coronavirus; chloroquine; hydroxychloroquine; toxicity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-23","",5006,""
"Is Physical Activity Associated with Mental Health among Chinese Adolescents during Isolation in COVID-19 Pandemic?","Restricted outdoor activities and online learning during COVID-19 pandemic may pose threats on the physical and mental health of Chinese adolescents in middle schools. The study was to explore the relationship of Physical Activity (PA) and Sedentary Time (SED) with mood states among Chinese adolescents during the pandemic. A total of 4898 adolescents (16.3 Ã‚Â± 1.3 years old) from 49 middle schools in 13 urban and rural areas in Yan'an, China volunteered to participate in this study and completed online questionnaires. International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) were used to measure PA and SED, and Profile of Mood States were used to evaluate mood states. We used Mann-Whitney <i>U</i>-test and Kruskal-Wallis test to assess differences in PA and SED in different sex and grade group, respectively. Mixed linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between PA/SED and mood states. Participants in our study accumulated 12.5 Ã‚Â± 26.0 min of moderate-to-vigorous PA and 363.6 Ã‚Â± 148.4 min of SED per day. The mood states of boys were better than that of girls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). The mood states of the students in Grade 3 Senior High School were at the highest level of mood disturbance. Higher levels of PA were significantly associated with lower levels of total mood disturbance in this population (High PA group according to IPAQ: <i>B</i> = -3.22, SE = 0.40, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; Moderate: <i>B</i> = -1.47, SE = 0.37, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, compared to Low PA group). Chinese adolescents maintained a sedentary lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic. Girls and students in Grade 3 Senior High School had higher level of mood disturbance. More PA was associate with improving mood state among adolescents in the pandemic. The present study may assist policymakers and healthcare professionals understand PA and mood states of Chinese adolescents during the epidemic and take targeted actions in case of emergencies in future.","Kang, Sun, Zhang, Sun, Wang, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.200908.001","20200922","COVID-19; Physical activity; adolescents; mood states","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-23","",5007,""

"The psychological impact of COVID-19 and other viral epidemics on frontline healthcare workers and ways to address it: A rapid systematic review","As the world is battling the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline health care workers (HCWs) are among the most vulnerable groups at risk of mental health problems. The many risks to the wellbeing of HCWs are not well understood. Of the literature, there is a paucity of information around how to best prevent psychological distress, and what steps are needed to mitigate harm to HCWs' wellbeing. A systematic review using PRISMA methodology was used to investigate the psychological impact on HCWs facing epidemics or pandemics, using three electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE and CINAHL), dating back to 2002 until the 21st of August 2020. The search strategy included terms for HCWs (e.g., nurse and doctor), mental health (e.g., wellbeing and psychological), and viral outbreaks (e.g., epidemic and pandemic). Only studies with greater than 100 frontline HCWs (i.e. doctors or nurses in close proximity to infected patients) were included. A total of 55 studies were included, with 53 using quantitative methodology and 2 were qualitative. 50 of the quantitative studies used validated measurement tools while 5 used novel questionnaires. The studies were conducted across various countries and included people with SARS (13 studies), Ebola (1), MERS (3) and COVID-19 (38). Findings suggest that the psychological implications to HCWs are variable with several studies demonstrating an increased risk of acquiring a trauma or stress-related disorders, depression and anxiety. Fear of the unknown or becoming infected were at the forefront of the mental challenges faced. Being a nurse and being female appeared to confer greater risk. In past epidemics, the perceived stigma from family members and society heightened negative implications; predominantly stress and isolation. Coping strategies varied amongst the contrasting sociocultural settings and appeared to differ amongst doctors, nurses and other HCWs. Implemented changes, and suggestions for prevention in the future consistently highlighted the need for greater psychosocial support and clearer dissemination of disease-related information. This review can inform current and future research priorities in the maintenance of wellbeing amongst frontline HCWs. Change needs to start at the level of policy-makers to offer an enhanced variety of supports to HCWs who play a critical role during largescale disease outbreaks. Psychological implications are largely negative and require greater attention to be mitigated, potentially through the involvement of psychologists, raised awareness and better education. The current knowledge of therapeutic interventions suggests they could be beneficial but more long-term follow-up is needed.","Cabarkapa, Nadjidai, Murgier, Ng","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100144","20200922","COVID-19; Epidemic; SARS; mental health; pandemic; psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-23","",5009,""
"Identification of Main Protease of Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro)Inhibitors from Melissa officinalis","The recent outbreak of Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) which has rapidly spread around the world in about three months with tens of thousands of deaths recorded so far is a global concern. An urgent need for potential therapeutic intervention is of necessity. Mpro is an attractive druggable target for the development of anti-COVID-19 drug development. Compounds previously characterized from Melissa officinalis were queried against main protease of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using computational approach. Melitric acid A and salvanolic acid A had higher affinity than lopinavir and ivermectin using both AutodockVina and XP docking algorithms. The computational approach was employed in the generation of QSAR model using automated QSAR, and in the docking of ligands from Melissa officinalis with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. The best model obtained was KPLS_Radial_28 (R2 = 0.8548 and Q2=0.6474, and was used in predicting the bioactivity of the lead compounds. Molecular mechanics based MM-GBSA confirmed salvanolic acid A as the compound with the highest free energy and predicted bioactivity of 4.777; it interacted with His-41 of the catalytic dyad (Cys145-His41) of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), as this may hinder the cutting of inactive viral protein into active ones capable of replication. Salvanolic acid A can be further evaluated as potential Mpro inhibitor.","Elekofehinti, Iwaloye, Famusiwa, Akinseye, Rocha","https://doi.org/10.2174/1570163817999200918103705","20200922","Covid-19; Melissa ; medicinal plants; natural compounds; pandemic; serine protease","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-23","",5010,""

A convenience-based internet survey of health-care workers in Canada was facilitated through various labor organizations between April 7 and May 13, 2020. A total of 7,298 respondents started the survey, of which 5,988 reported information on the main exposures and outcomes. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) screener, and depression symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) screener. We assessed the perceived need and adequacy of 8 types of PPE and 10 different ICP. Regression analyses examined the proportion of GAD-2 and PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher across levels of PPE and ICP, adjusted for a range of demographic, occupation, workplace, and COVID-19-specific measures. A total of 54.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53.5% to 56.1%) of the sample had GAD-2 scores of 3 and higher, and 42.3% (95% CI, 41.0% to 43.6%) of the sample had PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher. Absolute differences of 18% (95% CI, 12% to 23%) and 17% (95% CI, 12% to 22%) were observed in the prevalence of GAD-2 scores of 3 and higher between workers whose perceived PPE needs and ICP needs were met compared to those who needs were not met. Differences of between 11% (95% CI, 6% to 17%) and 19% (95% CI, 14% to 24%) were observed in PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher across these same PPE and ICP categories.

"Putative COVID- 19 Induction of Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) and Associated Behavioral Addictions with Potential Concomitant Dopamine Depletion: Is COVID-19 Social Distancing a Double Edged Sword?","The overwhelming fatalities of the global COVID-19 Pandemic will have daunting epigenetic sequala that can translate into an array of mental health issues, including panic, phobia, health anxiety, sleep disturbances to dissociative like symptoms including suicide. <i>Method:</i> We searched PUBMED for articles listed using the search terms &quot;COVID 19 Pandemic&quot;, COVID19 and genes,&quot; &quot;stress and COVID 19&quot;, Stress and Social distancing: <i>Results:</i> Long-term social distancing may be neurologically harmful, the consequence of epigenetic insults to the gene encoding the primary receptor for SARS-CoV2, and COVID 19. The gene is Angiotensin I Converting-Enzyme 2 (ACE2). According to the multi-experiment matrix (MEM), the gene exhibiting the most statistically significant co-expression link to ACE2 is Dopa Decarboxylase (DDC). DDC is a crucial enzyme that participates in the synthesis of both dopamine and serotonin. SARS-CoV2-induced downregulation of ACE2 expression might reduce dopamine and serotonin synthesis, causing hypodopaminergia. <i>Discussion:</i> Indeed, added to the known reduced dopamine function during periods of stress, including social distancing the consequence being both genetic and epigenetic vulnerability to all Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) addictive behaviors. Stress seen in PTSD can generate downstream alterations in immune functions by reducing methylation levels of immune-related genes. <i>Conclusion:</i> Mitigation of these effects by identifying subjects at risk and promoting dopaminergic homeostasis to help regulate stress-relative hypodopaminergia, attenuate fears, and prevent subsequent unwanted drug and non-drug RDS type addictive behaviors seems prudent.","Blum, Cadet, Baron, Badgaiyan, Brewer, Modestino, Gold","https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2020.1817086","20200922","COVID-19 pandemic; behavioral addiction; dopamine homeostasis; epigenetic insults; immunologic function; mental illness; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-23","",5012,""

This study aimed to describe the mental health status of the general adult population in Portugal and Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyze the differences between the two countries. A cross-sectional quantitative study was based on an online questionnaire. Socio-demographic data were collected in addition to four validated scales: CAGE (acronym cut-annoyed-guilty-eye) Questionnaire, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-2. For each outcome, a multiple linear regression was performed. Five hundred and fifty people answered the questionnaire (435 women). The median age was 38 (Q1, Q3: 30, 47) years, 52.5% resided in Brazil and 47.5% in Portugal. The prevalence of anxiety was 71.3% (mild anxiety was present in 43.1%), the prevalence of depression was 24.7% and 23.8% of the sample had both depression and anxiety.

"Investigation of the psychological status of suspected patients during the Coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic","We explored the psychological changes in suspected patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic and obtained evidence for early psychological guidance and intervention in this group. A total of 31 inpatients with suspected COVID-19 were identified at our hospital. The depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 scale, and the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) mental health self-assessment questionnaire were used to assess depression, anxiety, and overall mental health. Among the patients, 32.3% had symptoms of depression and 19.4% had symptoms of anxiety. Levels of anxiety and fear varied. In comparing the PHQ-9 and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale scores of suspected and confirmed patients, there was no significant difference in the distribution of severity of anxiety or depression in the 2 groups. The PHQ-9 scores indicated mild depression symptoms in 25.8% of suspected patients, moderate symptoms in 0%, and severe symptoms in 6.5%. Overall, 50% of confirmed patients had symptoms, with 30.8% classified as mild, 15.4% classified as moderate, and 3.8% classified as severe. The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale scores in the group of suspected patients showed that 9.7% had mild symptoms, 0% had moderate symptoms, and 9.7% had severe symptoms. In the group of confirmed patients, 38.4% had symptoms (34.6% mild, 0% moderate, and 3.8% severe). Diagnosed patients had more visible symptoms of depression and different total PHQ-9 scores. During the COVID-19 epidemic, suspected and diagnosed patients had different levels of mental health problems. Diagnosed patients had more visible symptoms. The performance of suspected patients was higher, but their mental state was more polarized. It may thus be important to monitor the psychological state of suspected patients as early as possible to enable timely interventions that promote psychological rehabilitation.","Chen, Wang, Zhu, Hu","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000022260","20200922","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-23","",5014,""

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and August 2020. A self-reported online questionnaire was utilized to collect data. The survey included questions concerning socio-demographic, lifestyle, and work setting and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: Data from 803 HCWs (50.7% male; mean age: 27.3 [SD=6.9]; age range: 18-58 years) were included in analyses. Prevalence estimates of anxiety and depression were, respectively, 69.5% and 39.5% for at least borderline abnormal, 41.2% and 15.7% for at least abnormal symptoms. Regression analyses with HADS-score as dependent variable revealed significant (p<0.05) associations with female sex, moderate and poor health status, irregular physical exercising, smoking, having had regrets about their profession because of the pandemic and many unexpected experiences, not updating on the latest COVID-19-related research, experiencing discrimination in the workplace, and facing social problems due to working in a lab or hospital. Conclusions: Symptoms of mental ill-health are prevalent among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The findings suggest a need for monitoring and early interventions to help these individuals.","Rafia Tasnim et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CF-004-65D","20200923","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; healthcare workers; anxiety; covid-19; bangladesh; depression","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-23","",5016,""
"Disordered Social Media Use Promotes Fear of COVID-19 Increasing Stress and Depression","The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global threat that has negative impacts on individualsâ€™ physical and mental health. Here, we explore if disordered social media use promotes fear of COVID-19, which in turn increases stress and depression in users. The study also explores several risk and protective factors that may affect the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and stress and depression. There were 174 participants that completed an online survey that measured disordered social media use, fear of COVID-19, perceived stress, and depression symptomatology. We found that disordered social media use predicts perceived stress indirectly through fear of COVID-19. Disordered social media use had a direct relationship with depression scores and this relationship is mediated by fear of COVID-19. We also found that the positive relationship between fear of COVID-19 and perceived stress is stronger for older people than younger people. The psychological impact of COVID-19 may be exacerbated by content promoting the fear of COVID-19 that users will be exposed to on social media.","Gabriel Tillman","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604E-981-0EB","20200923","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; stress; covid-19; social media; depression","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-23","",5017,""
