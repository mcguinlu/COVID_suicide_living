"Using robots to improve indoor air quality and reduce COVID-19 exposure","Air pollution is the worldâ€™s largest environmental health risk, accounting yearly for about 8 million deaths. Most of the people spend 80% to 90% of their time indoors. Therefore, Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) has a direct impact on overall health. In this paper, a robot, equipped with sensors for measuring IAQ parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, CO2, Particulate Matters and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) is used to measure these parameters and compare the measured values to the pre-set permissible levels of concentrations of such parameters. If one (or more) of the measured values exceed the pre-set threshold values, the measured values are communicated to the user via a mobile application and the robot will take a corrective action by disinfecting the place using a sterilizing solution. Validation of the methodology was verified at an educational institute in Alexandria, Egypt. Â© 2021 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

"Physical and psychological deconditioning of overweight middle-aged women caused by covid-19","The study was aimed at identifying the structure of relationships between the psychological and morphological state of overweight and obese women under conditions of quarantine restrictions related to COVID-19 pandemic. The following methods were used: anthropometric, to determine the body measurements;bioimpedance analysis, to assess the body composition;physiological, to study the cardiovascular and respiratory systems;psychological, to examine the psycho-emotional sphere;statistical analysis, to objectify the obtained results. The article presents a comparative analysis of the morpho-functional and psychological state of women aged 35-42 years over the seven months of quarantine restrictions caused by the spread of COVID-19. Analysis of the data revealed significant negative changes in the indicators of physique and psychological state of women over this period. In women, body weight increased on average by 10.2% (p&lt;0.05), and waist and abdomen circumferences increased by 9.9% (p&lt;0.05) and 12.5% (p&lt;0.05), respectively. A lack of regular physical activity was one of the factors increasing the fat mass by 22.7% (p&lt;0.05) and decreasing the muscle mass by 23.9% (p&lt;0.05). In women, the zest for life decreased by 37.0% (p&lt;0.05) and the congruence between desired and achieved goals decreased by 64.6% (p&lt;0.05). The overall psychological state of women deteriorated by 39.4% (p&lt;0.05) and began to indicate a high level of emotional stress, low emotional stability, high level of anxiety, and psychological discomfort. Correlation analysis revealed high negative correlations between psychological and morphological indicators, which ranged from r=-0.321 (at p&lt;0.05) to r=-0.683 (at p&lt;0.001). The findings of this study suggest that a sedentary lifestyle and low level of physical activity over the quarantine restrictions period had a negative impact on the morpho-functional state and quality of life of women. The fear of COVID-19 infection caused women to become depressed and anxious;whereas uncertainty about the future threatened the mental state of the subjects.

"Decreased anxiety in victims of bullying during confinement by COVID-19","The stressors generated by the COVID 19 pandemic have had important consequences on the mental health of many adolescents, however, it is possible that the suspension of in-person classes along with the digital media available for learning and social interaction have provided relief for those who were victims of bullying.. This research compares the scores obtained by 76 adolescents (94 victims of bullying and 182 not victims) between 12 and 14 years old, in anxiety, depression, academic performance and cyberbullying before and after confinement. Before confinement, the victims obtained significantly higher scores in anxiety, depression and cyberbullying and lower scores in academic performance. During confinement, the differences in anxiety were reversed, being significantly lower in the case of victims of bullying, who also obtained significantly lower scores in depression and cyberbullying than before confinement. However, academic performance decreased significantly in the non-victim group, while no significant changes in cyberbullying scores were observed. Â© 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

"Beyond the rhetoric of Genesis 34:1â€“28: Understanding the rape epidemic during the COVID-19 pandemic","This article explored the rape of Dinah in Genesis 34:1â€“28 and its implications to the escalating rape cases during the period of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Nigeria. By examining the rape in the pericope and other key passages in the Old Testament, this article argues that it points towards care and justice for victims of rape, and prosecution of rapists. These social ethics are analysed in relation to the contemporary rape epidemic during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Like the rape in Genesis, rape victims in Nigeria have little or no access to getting justice and counselling from society, non-government organisations and faith-based organisations, against their aggressors (the rapists). These problems highlight the relevance of this biblical narrative for the policyholders, the government and churches in Nigeria. Intra/interdisciplinary implications: This research is based on the impact of rape on the victim and the aggressor in Genesis 34:1â€“28. Similar to what is obtainable amongst Nigerians during the COVID-19 pandemic, Genesis 34:1â€“28 reveals that rape has far reaching implications on the victim and the aggressor. It leads to low self-esteem, hate, suicide as well as the death of the aggressor or victim. Disciplines implicated include Old Testament, Religion, Cultural Studies and Sociology.","Uroko, Favour, Enobong, Solomon","https://doi.org/10.4102/ve.v42i1.2211","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Verbum et Ecclesia; 42(1), 2021.; Publication details: Verbum et Ecclesia; 42(1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16108,""
"Case Report: Effects of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Convalescent Antibodies Obtained With Double Filtration Plasmapheresis","Passive antibody therapy has been used to treat outbreaks of viral disease, including the ongoing pandemic of severe respiratory acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19. However, the real benefits of the procedure are unclear. We infused a concentrated solution of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies obtained from a convalescent donor with a single session of double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) into a 56-year-old woman with long history of unremitting, severe COVID-19. She was unable to establish an adequate antiviral immune response because of previous chemotherapy, including the infusion of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, administered to treat a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The disease promptly recovered despite evidence of no endogenous anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody production. The observation that passive antibody therapy might prove particularly effective in immunodepressed COVID-19 patients requires evaluation in prospective randomized controlled trial.","Curto, D.; Tomatis, F.; Gastoldi, S.; Galbusera, M.; Noris, M.; Raimondi, F.; Lorini, F.

"Health Technology Assessment in High, Middle, and Low-income Countries: New Systematic and Interdisciplinary Approach For Sound Informed-policy Making: Research Protocole","Technological innovation has a significant role in improving health systems (HSs) and achieving universal health coverage (UHC). The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared resolutions on Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and other global organizations emphasized on HTA systems to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). HTA is a modern multidisciplinary decision-making framework linking knowledge and policymaking by assessing the medical, social, economic, organizational, and ethical effects, and/or impacts within health and social systems. The research significance lies in the growing need for HTA at these moments than ever as it is seen as an essential development approach to tackle the current global challenges and pandemics, particularly in developing countries. The research aims to comprehensively evaluate and understand HTA systems concerning the level of knowledge about HTA, current HTA structure, practices, application, capacity, gaps, and solutions. The project starts in January 2021 and ends in January 2022 and will be carried out in seven countries: Canada, Switzerland, Brazil, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, and Tanzania. A mixed-methods, quantitative and qualitative, along with a literature review will be applied. In each country, ten HTA-associated institutions will complete an adapted electronic survey, developed by the WHO, and ten key-informants selected purposively from the government, academia, NGOs, and private sectors to participate in ten individual in-depth interviews. One government representative from each country will participate in one expanded inter-country workshop. Excel, IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), and MAXQDA software programs will be used for data management and analysis. The research will form cutting-edge evidence not only for the seven countries, but also for the global, regional, and national endeavors with regards to opening a room for HTA best application and optimization. It will reveal lessons learned, determine gaps, and build a well-enabled and institutionalized HTA for better UHC, health systems, and multi-sectoral development.","Alkhaldi, Mohammed, Aisha Al, Basuoni, Matos, MÃ¡rcia, Tanner, Marcel, Ahmed, Sara","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S310215","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Risk Management and Healthcare Policy; 14:2757-2770, 2021.; Publication details: Risk Management and Healthcare Policy; 14:2757-2770, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16110,""
"COVID-19-Related Anxiety and the Coping Strategies in the Southeast Ethiopia","Background: The pandemic of coronavirus disease spreading is impacting mental health globally. Even though the pandemic is challenging for patients, the community, policymakers, as well as health organizations, and teams, the data on COVID-19 and its association with anxiety and coping mechanisms towards infection among community members are currently limited. Thus, the study is intended to assess COVID-19-related levels of anxiety and coping strategies among community members of Bale and East Bale Zones, Southeast Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based survey was carried out among 634 study participants of Bale and East Bale Zones from June 1 to 20, 2020. The level of anxiety was determined by using the 5-item Coronavirus Scale and the coping strategies were determined by using the 15-item Coping and Adaptation Processing Scale. Interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to collect the data. Bi-variable analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to estimate the relationship among the variables. Results: COVID-19-related dysfunctional level of anxiety was found 95 (16.58%). About 290 (50.6%) respondents were copied from anxiety that occurred as a result of COVID-19. Factors significantly associated with the dysfunctional level of anxiety related to COVID-19 were being an urban resident (AOR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.86), those who had no information from TV/radio (AOR=1.76, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.84), and walking a long distance more than 1 hour from the health institution (AOR=0.58, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.97). Conclusion: COVID-19-related dysfunctional levels of anxiety were 16.58% in the study community. Half of the community was coped with COVID-19-related anxiety. Being an urban resident and walking along distances more than 1 hour from the health facility were the factors that decreased the odds of having a dysfunctional anxiety, whereas respondents who had no information from TV/radio increased the odds of having a dysfunctional anxiety. Accordingly, focusing on these identified factors could improve a dysfunctional level of anxiety in the study community.","Engida, Zinash Teferu, Damtew Solomon, Shiferaw, Ketaro, Musa Kumbi, Mamo, Ayele, Ahmednur Adem, Aliyi, Abduljewad, Hussein Mohamed, Mesud Mohammed, Hassen, Abdulshakur Mohammed, Abduletif, Abate Lette, Wodera, Sintayehu Hailu, Ayene, Jeylan Kasim, Esamael, Gezahegn, Habtamu, Esmael, Adem","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S309806","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Psychology Research and Behavior Management; 14:1019-1031, 2021.; Publication details: Psychology Research and Behavior Management; 14:1019-1031, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16111,""
"Experiences of primary care physicians managing postpartum care: a qualitative research study","Background The postpartum period is redefined as 12 weeks following childbirth. Primary care physicians (PCP) often manage postpartum women in the community after uneventful childbirths. Postpartum care significantly impacts on the maternal and neonatal physical and mental health. However, evidence has revealed unmet needs in postpartum maternal care. Aim The study aimed to explore the experiences of PCPs in managing postpartum mothers. Methods Four focus group discussions and eleven in-depth interviews with twenty-nine PCPs were conducted in this qualitative research study in urban Singapore. PCPs of both gender and variable postgraduate training background were purposively enrolled. Audited transcripts were independently coded by two investigators. Thematic content analysis was performed using the codes to identify issues in the â€œclinicianâ€, â€œmotherâ€, â€œpostpartum careâ€ and â€œhealthcare system & policyâ€ domains stipulated in â€œThe Generalistsâ€™ Wheel of Knowledge, Understanding and Inquiryâ€ framework. Findings PCPsâ€™ personal attributes such as gender and knowledge influenced their postpartum care delivery. Prior training, child caring experience and access to resource materials contributed to their information mastery of postpartum care. Their professional relationship with local multi-ethic and multi-lingual Asian mothers was impacted by their mutual communication, language compatibility and understanding of local confinement practices. Consultation time constraint, awareness of community postnatal services and inadequate handover of care from the specialists hindered PCPs in the healthcare system. Discussion Personal, maternal and healthcare system barriers currently prevent PCPs from delivering optimal postpartum care. Conclusion Interventions to overcome the barriers to improve postpartum care will likely be multi-faceted across domains discussed.","Poon, Zhimin, Esther Cui Wei, Lee, Ang, Li Ping, Tan, Ngiap Chuan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-021-01494-w","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMC Family Practice; 22:1-12, 2021.; Publication details: BMC Family Practice; 22:1-12, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16112,""
"The Level of Expression of Anxiety and Depression in Clinical Health Care Workers during the COVID-19 Outbreak in 2 Hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam","The disease caused by the SARS-Cov 2 virus has spread to most areas of the world with high rates of infection and deaths. Facing the complicated developments of the epidemic, clinical medical staff (CMS) are at risk of suffering psychological pressure. This study aimed to investigate the situation of anxiety, depression, and related factors affecting CMS during the COVID-19 pandemic at Dong Da General Hospital and Dong Anh General Hospital in Hanoi. A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to July 2020 using selfâ€”administered questionnaires amongst 341 CMS. The participants' anxiety levels were assessed using the standardized General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) toolkit and levels of depression expression were assessed based on the standardized Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) toolkit. Of the CMS who completed the questionnaire, 33.1% had an anxiety disorder and 23.2% exhibited mild to very severe depression. The factors associated with anxiety and depression were department of work, shortage of human resources, and discrimination from the community that directly affects the family of the CMS. The study results highlight the need for a training session to equip CMS with the skills required to cope with psychological stress in all circumstances in general and during the pandemic in particular. This training is especially important for those working in at-risk departments which are susceptible to infection.","Quang, La Ngoc, Kien, Nguyen Trung, Anh, Pham Ngoc, Anh, Dang Thi Van, Nghi, Tran Do Bao, Lan, Pham Phuong, Anh, Nguyen The, Son, Nguyen Van, Lieu, Nguyen Thi Thuy","https://doi.org/10.1177/11786329211033245","","Database: CINAHL; Publication details: Health Services Insights;: 1-7, 2021.; Publication details: Health Services Insights;: 1-7, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16113,""
"Changes in Alcohol Habits Among Workers During the Confinement of COVID-19: Results of a Canadian Cross-Sectional Survey","Background: The restrictions implemented around the world to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) impact workers. Emotional distress and maladaptive behaviors such as alcohol misuse are expected, particularly in vulnerable groups such as front-line health workers. In the present study, we examined if alcohol consumption behaviors in Quebec workers changed during confinement of the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether healthcare workers reported specific patterns of changes. Methods: Data were obtained from an anonymous online survey conducted among adult workers aged <U+2A7E>18 years in the province of Quebec, Canada, between May 25, 2020 and June 26, 2020. Participants provided self-reported data regarding sociodemographic including field of work, as well as mental health disorders, alcohol use, alcohol craving, and type of alcohol consumed. Changes in alcohol behaviors were assessed using Wilcoxon signed rank test for categorial variables and paired- t tests for continuous variables. Results: The survey was completed by 847 participants (77.8% women), with 42.5% healthcare workers. Participants reported increased daily alcohol use (Z = -10.60;P &lt;.001, r = -.372) and alcohol craving (P &lt;.001, d = 0.485) during the confinement. Only the type of alcohol consumed during the confinement differed between health care workers and other workers (OR = 0.45, P =.003). Health care workers used less high alcohol products during the confinement. Conclusion: Our results show a significant increase in daily alcohol consumption and in alcohol craving during the confinement in the Quebec working population.

"COVID-19 and Mental Health of Young Adult Children in China: Economic Impact, Family Dynamics, and Resilience","Objective Background Method Results Conclusion Implications The current study aimed to examine the economic impact of COVID-19 virus on family dynamics and college-age children's mental health in China and to identity personal and social or relational resilience factors that could buffer the negative consequences of COVID-19.Since an outbreak of COVID-19 was first reported in China in December 2019, it has profoundly changed the lives of families and children of all ages. In particular, it has created challenges among families with college-age young adult children.Using a sample of 484 college students from 21 universities in China, an online survey design was utilized to obtain information from these students on their family demographics and economic situation, parentâ€“child interactions, and individual well-being during COVID-19.Results from structural equation modeling suggested that family income loss due to COVID-19 was related to economic pressure. Economic pressure was associated with negative interactions between parents and young adult children, which were associated with problems in young adult children's mental health (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms). Further, self-control was found to buffer the association between family income loss and economic pressure, and respect for family was found to weaken the association between economic pressure and negative parentâ€“child interactions.Findings supported the hypotheses of the negative impacts of COVID-19 on young adult children's mental health and the resilience factors that buffered the negative impacts.Implications to family researchers, family life educators, practitioners, and policymakers were discussed.

"Exposure to green space and prevention of anxiety and depression among young people in urban settings: a global scoping review","PurposeThere is a mental health crisis, particularly among young people. Despite many young people living in urban settings, reviews about the association between exposure to green or natural environments and mental health tend to focus on either children or adults. The aim of this review is to examine the scope of the global literature for this age group, to inform a systematic review on the role of exposure to green space in preventing anxiety and depression amongst young people aged 14â€“24 years.Design/methodology/approachSeven databases were searched for quantitative and qualitative sources published from January 2000 to June 2020. This identified 201 sources and their characteristics are described here. Gaps in the literature are also highlighted.FindingsThe number of relevant studies published per year has increased over time. Most studies are set in North America (28%) or Europe (39%). The most common study designs were observational (34%) or experimental (28%). A wide range of exposures and interventions are described.Research limitations/implicationsThis review included literature from predominantly high-income countries and has shown the under-representation of low-middle income countries and lack of ethnic diversity in study populations. It has also highlighted the lack of clinical measures of anxiety and depression as outcomes.Originality/valueThis inter-disciplinary review has contributed to the field by describing the geographic distribution of the literature and the broad range of exposures to green spaces being reported. Unlike previous scoping reviews, this review focused specifically on young people and on measures of anxiety and depression and their pre-cursers.","Reece, Rebecca, Bray, Isabelle, Sinnett, Danielle, Hayward, Robert, Martin, Faith","https://doi.org/10.1108/JPMH-02-2021-0030","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Public Mental Health; 20(2):94-104, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Public Mental Health; 20(2):94-104, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16120,""
"COVID-19 â€“ what do we know and how are we dealing with it? A quick online cross-sectional study in India","PurposeCoronavirus disease 2019 is a global public health emergency affecting almost the entire world. The exponential spread of the infection has become a matter of concern. The study aims to determine how well people in India know about COVID-19 outbreak and actions taken to cope up during lockdown.Design/methodology/approachA total of 5,000 randomly selected participants were sent the survey link, of which 1,526 responded (response rate of 30.5%). The survey was conducted from March 28 till March 31, 2020. The 20-item questionnaire aimed to determine how well people know about COVID-19 outbreak as well as actions taken to cope up during the lockdown. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the findings.FindingsParticipants exhibited good knowledge about the primary and secondary symptoms of COVID-19 and infection spread. Over 95% participants knew preventive measures such as use of masks, sanitizers and hand wash. And, 80% of the participants felt that steps taken by the government are effective, while 93% opined that lockdown would be effective. There was apprehension regarding the infection spread, its containment and age group affected. Over 60% referred the World Health Organization website as their source of information. During the lockdown, participants engaged in home-based exercise (39%) and yoga (28%) for fitness while used social media (64%) and television (63%) for entertainment.Originality/valueAlthough participants exhibited good knowledge related to symptoms and preventive measure related to COVID-19, the beliefs related to infection spread and containment need to be addressed. These should be targeted through health promotional campaigns focusing on mental health and home-based physical activities.","Verma, Ashwani, Gunjawate, Dhanshree R.; Sanny Bhushan, Kumar, Bharath, C.

"Sensescapes and attention restoration in nature-based tourism: Evidence from China and Australia","Several prior single-location case studies have found that the sensescape of a natural environment contributes to visitors' attention restoration. This study tests the effects of a soundscape and a visualscape on attention restoration using data from two natural destinations, Purple Mountain in China and Burleigh Heads Beach in Australia. The results indicate that the characteristics of a soundscape significantly contribute to visitors' attention restoration and quality of life directly and through the mediation of visualscape. Natural environments relate to visitors' quality of life through its multimodal sensescape. Critically, the attention restoration model is found to be applicable in different natural contexts, revealing that the restorative value of a natural sensescape is not contextually bound. Nature-based tourism can be used to promote mental health in the post-COVID-19 period worldwide.

"Nurse wellbeing during the coronavirus (2019) pandemic: A qualitative descriptive study","Background: The wellbeing of individuals influences organisational outcomes. Insight into nursesâ€™ wellbeing is crucial to a sustaining a high-quality workforce. Aim: To describe nursesâ€™ perceptions and experiences of wellbeing, work wellbeing, and mental health. Method: Using a qualitative descriptive design, semi-structured interviews were conducted, transcribed verbatim, analysed inductively and thematically, and reported per consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research. Findings: Nine Australian nurses were interviewed in 2020, each for 60 to 90 minutes. These nurses had a broad range of clinical roles and years of experience in metropolitan healthcare organisations. Six themes, each related to nurse wellbeing, depicted: (i) value and sense of purpose from nursing, yet also negative consequences of losing sight of oneself within the nursing role;(ii) work nurses did to disengage from their job and create a balance within their life;(iii) significance of the team and senior team as a source of both strength and opportunity for wellbeing;(iv) a range of wellbeing initiatives with a perception these were often developed, and for use, in response to crisis as opposed to preventative or proactive measures;(v) value of additional nurse wellbeing education and promotion of available support;and (vi) novel challenges and ways to wellbeing during times where resources were stretched and usual support systems impacted. Discussion: Identified positive and negative consequences of nursing must be addressed when developing targeted wellbeing interventions. Conclusion: New ways of working and supporting individual, team and organisational wellbeing are needed for flourishing working environments. Potential strategies to either leverage or mitigate the positive and negative consequences of nursing are offered. Â© 2021","Jarden, R. J.; Jarden, A. J.; Weiland, T.

"A study on the effects of meteorological and climatic factors on the COVID-19 spread in Canada during 2020","The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has infected more than three million people, with thousands of deaths and millions of people into quarantine. In this research, the authors focus on meteorological and climatic factors on the COVID-19 spread, the main parameters including daily new cases of COVID-19, carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Sulfur dioxide (SO2), PM2.5, Ozone (O3), average temperature, and humidity are examined to understand how different meteorological parameters affect the COVID-19 spread in Canada? The graphical quantitative analysis results indicate that CO2 emissions, air quality, temperature, and humidity have a direct negative relationship with COVID-19 infections. Quantile regression analysis revealed that air quality, Nitrogen, and Ozone significantly induce the COVID-19 spread across Canadian provinces. The findings of this study are contrary to the earlier studies, which argued that weather and climate change significantly increase COVID-19 infections. We suggested that meteorological and climatic factors might be critical to reducing the COVID-19 new cases in Canada based on the findings. This workâ€™s empirical conclusions can provide a guideline for future research and policymaking to stop the COVID-19 spread across Canadian provinces.Graphical abstract: The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has infected more than three million people, with thousands of deaths and millions of people into quarantine.

"Development of the COVID-19 Perinatal Perception Questionnaire (COVID19-PPQ)","The COVID-19 pandemic affects the mental health status of perinatal women, which makes it important to gain insight into and to effectively measure specific stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we aimed to develop a COVID-19 Perinatal Perception Questionnaire (COVID19-PPQ). In-depth interviews were conducted during the first national lockdown period with pregnant women, new mothers and perinatal healthcare professionals, resulting in (a) a 27-item pregnancy and (b) a 21-item postpartum scale. Explorative factor analyses (EFA) in sample Ia (N = 154) and Ib (N = 90), and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) in sample IIa (N = 113) and IIb (N = 81) were conducted to test the psychometric properties of both scales. For the pregnancy scale, EFA suggested a three-factor solution (risk of infection, contact, future), which was confirmed by CFA and resulted in a final nine-item scale. For the postpartum scale, a three-factor solution (first postpartum week, COVID-19 measures, fear for infection) was suggested by EFA and confirmed by CFA, resulting in a final ten-item scale. Symptoms of depression and pregnancy-specific distress were significantly correlated with the pregnancy (sub)scale(s), while symptoms of postpartum depression and anxiety showed significant correlations with the COVID-19 measures and fear for infection subscale. The COVID19-PPQ seems to be a valid instrument for assessment of perinatal COVID-19-related stress perception, showing adequate psychometric properties for both the pregnancy and postpartum scale. Future research should examine the use of this instrument in clinical practice during new episodes of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Experiences of nursing students under the unprecedented abrupt online learning format forced by the national curfew due to COVID-19: A qualitative research study","Background The unprecedented abrupt shift to remote online learning (OL) within the context of the national lockdown due to the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) highlights the importance of addressing students' preparedness in managing their first experiences with OL. Purpose To investigate the experiences of undergraduate nursing students during their first uses of OL to increase the understanding of their encountered opportunities and challenges. Design A descriptive qualitative design guided by a phenomenological approach was used. Methods The study used a purposive sampling technique to recruit 18 undergraduate nursing students from two universities. Data were collected using two focus group discussions, and the discussions with participants were audio/video recorded through the online platform Zoom due to the national imposed curfew. Content analysis employed Colaizzi's steps to derive the themes/categories. Results The study revealed four themes: experience of helplessness, burdens, and burnout;the need for social and technical support to manage OL;the propensity to consider OL as a positive opportunity;and the deficiency of OL in fulfilling the educational outcomes of clinical courses. Conclusions Abrupt remote OL was a challenge to clinical encounters. This format was very stressful;however, it was also useful. The current study highlighted the need for further research on the effectiveness of remote OL platforms in regard to the achievement of the intended learning outcomes of clinical courses.","Suliman, Wafika A.; Abu-Moghli, Fathieh A.; Khalaf, Inaam, Zumot, Arwa F.; Nabolsi, Manar","https://www.google.com/search?q=Experiences+of+nursing+students+under+the+unprecedented+abrupt+online+learning+format+forced+by+the+national+curfew+due+to+COVID-19:+A+qualitative+research+study","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Nurse Education Today; 100:1, 2021.; Publication details: Nurse Education Today; 100:1, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16127,""

"COVID-19 pandemic: Psychological effects of quarantine on adults and children","In recent months, the majority of nations (at first China) are facing a dangerous threat that has forced governments to adopt and implement drastic restrictive measures such as quarantine. This threat is called ""COVID-19 Emergency"" (Corona Virus Disease-19). The quarantine condition imposed due to the extensive spread of coronavirus has, in the medium and long term, inevitable repercussions on many psychopathological states characterized by anxiety-depressive symptoms. For children, however, the impact of the traumatic context has different importance and outcomes, depending on their cognitive capacity and emotional competence. When children are experiencing a quarantine period in a state of world emergency such as the current one, his or her ability to manage the cognitive capacity and emotional competence adaptively and functionally has an essential significance. They may also perceive the experience as traumatic or not, through Reflective Function and Affect Mirroring with parents. Family experiences, care, and parenting are formative and preparatory to cope with the many events that life presents. It, therefore, becomes essential to establish in the family a climate of support and containment that facilitates the restructuring of the phenomenon and exorcises the stress arising from the event itself and contributes to the development of agency and resilience skills.

"Mental Health Outcomes Among Health Care Workers Exposed to Covid-19 Pandemic, Qalyoubia Governorate: Cross-Sectional Survey","Background: The pandemic caused by novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is considered the worst health crisis facing the entire world today. At the topmost of this crisis are the healthcare workers (HCWs) who are working to maintain well-being of all people. COVID-19 pandemic added more and more stress to healthcare workers in particular, depending on their work position. Objective: To assess mental health outcomes among HCWs dealing with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. Methods: This is cross-sectional, hospital-based survey study conducted between Feb 6 and April 28, 2021. A total of 548 HCWs participated in the study. Mental health impact was assessed by using the 9- item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to determine the risk factors of mental health outcomes. Results: Among the 548 HCWs surveyed;64.8% were nurses and 50.0% aged from 26-30 years old. About 52.0% worked in Benha University Hospital, 21.2% worked in Toukh Fever Hospital, and 26.8% worked in Qaha Central Hospital. A considerable proportion of HCWs had symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia. Nurses, workers aged from 26-30, those working in Qaha Central Hospital and those who had shift hours from 7â€“10 experienced more severe symptom levels of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Nurses were associated with severe symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic represents a new working challenge for HCWs and intervention strategies to prevent depression and anxiety to reduce the risk of adverse mental health outcomes are needed.

"COVID-19 Pandemic and Child Psychology","During the COVID-19 epidemic, which affected the world, both physiological and psychosocial risks negatively have been affected the lives of individuals. As countries closed their borders, they have been organized stay-at-home campaigns to control the pandemic. The closure of the units that have an important place in children's lives such as schools, parks, sports halls among the public areas, causing psychological problems such as anxiety, trauma and depression to be observed more frequently in children;It was determined that they faced problems in both access to education and the adaptation process with the transition to distance education instead of face-to-face education. With the pandemic, the use of online psychotherapy has also increased. It has been observed that there are difficulties in transferring psychological services to the online environment. However it has been determined that maintaining dance and art therapy online with children has been found to be effective. In this article, the problems experienced by children during the epidemic process and the changes in education and psychotherapy are discussed.

"Vulnerabilities to and the Socioeconomic and Psychosocial Impacts of the Leishmaniases: A Review","The leishmaniases are a group of four vector-borne neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) with 1.6 billion people in some 100 countries at risk. They occur in certain eco-epidemiological foci that reflect manipulation by human activities, such as migration, urbanization and deforestation, of which poverty, conflict and climate change are key drivers. Given their synergistic impacts, risk factors and the vulnerabilities of poor populations and the launch of a new 2030 roadmap for NTDs in the context of the global sustainability agenda, it is warranted to update the state of knowledge of the leishmaniases and their effects. Using existing literature, we review socioeconomic and psychosocial impacts of leishmaniasis within a framework of risk factors and vulnerabilities to help inform policy interventions. Studies show that poverty is an overarching primary risk factor. Low-income status fosters inadequate housing, malnutrition and lack of sanitation, which create and exacerbate complexities in access to care and treatment outcomes as well as education and awareness. The co-occurrence of the leishmaniases with malnutrition and HIV infection further complicate diagnosis and treatment, leading to poor diagnostic outcomes and therapeutic response. Even with free treatment, households may suffer catastrophic health expenditure from direct and indirect medical costs, which compounds existing financial strain in low-income communities for households and healthcare systems. The dermatological presentations of the leishmaniases may result in long-term severe disfigurement, leading to stigmatization, reduced quality of life, discrimination and mental health issues. A substantial amount of recent literature points to the vulnerability pathways and burden of leishmaniasis on women, in particular, who disproportionately suffer from these impacts. These emerging foci demonstrate a need for continued international efforts to address key risk factors and population vulnerabilities if leishmaniasis control, and ultimately elimination, is to be achieved by 2030.","Grifferty, Grace, Shirley, Hugh, McGloin, Jamie, Kahn, Jorja, Orriols, Adrienne, Wamai, Richard","https://doi.org/10.2147/RRTM.S278138","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Research and Reports in Tropical Medicine; 12:135-151, 2021.; Publication details: Research and Reports in Tropical Medicine; 12:135-151, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16134,""
"COVID-19 Prevention Practices and Associated Factors Among Farmers in Peri-Urban Areas of Northeastern Ethiopia","Background: COVID-19 is a global health threat due to its rapid spread and ability to kill millions of people. The majority of pandemic-fighting approaches rely on prevention activities, which can be influenced by a variety of factors. Farmers are more vulnerable to COVID-19, so evaluating existing prevention practices and associated factors is critical to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: To assess COVID-19 prevention practices and associated factors among farmers in peri-urban areas of Northeastern Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among 409 selected farmers. Data were collected using face-to-face interviews and on-the-spot-observational checklist. Data were analyzed using bivariable logistic regression model at 95% CI (confidence interval). During the bivariable analysis (crude odds ratio [COR]), varibales having a p-value of less than 0.250 were included into the multivariable analysis (adjsuted odds ratio [AOR]). Factors associated with COVID-19 preventive practices were determined using a multivariable analysis at a p-value of 0.050. Results: Of 409 participants, 206 (63.6%), 157 (38.4%), and 117 (28.6%) of them had satisfactory knowledge, positive attitude, and good prevention practices about COVID-19, respectively. Age of the farmers with greater than or equal to 45 years (AOR: 3.2;95% CI: 1.7â€“ 6.1), educational status of secondary school and above (AOR: 3.1;95% CI: 1.4â€“ 6.6), and income level of having greater than or equal to 2,001.00 Ethiopian birr (ETB) (AOR: 1.9;95% CI: 1.1â€“ 3.4) were all found to be significantly associated with the COVID-19 prevention practices. Conclusion: Even though the majority of farmers had satisfactory knowledge, a considerable proportion of them had a negative attitude and poor COVID-19 prevention practices. Age, educational status, and income level are factors associated with COVID-19 prevention practices. Hence, health education should be given to improve the farmersâ€™ knowledge, attitudes and prevention practices to minimize the risk of COVID-19 among farmers in semi-urban areas of northestern Ethiopia.","Berhanu, Leykun, Gete, Berihun, Walle, Zebader, Teshome, Daniel, Gizeyatu, Adinew, Abebe, Masresha, Hassen, Seada, Ademas, Ayechew, Wagaye, Birhanu, Adane, Metadel","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S321456","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare; 14:1843-1852, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare; 14:1843-1852, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16135,""
"Change-Event Steals â€œAthleteâ€ from â€œCollege Athleteâ€: Perceived Impact and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress","Introduction: This research sought to establish the impact of the change-event of COVID-19 on college athletes and members of other campus groups (eg, marching band, eSports, Reserve Officers Training Corps). The specific purpose was to assess the perceived impact and impact on mental health (eg, depression, anxiety, and stress). Methods: The survey battery presented a total of 37 items. Demographic, sport or group-specific, and academic-related questions were included alongside the assessment of psychological well-being coming from the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Results: There were 249 participants completing some or all of the survey battery. It is notable that 172 participants (69.1%) indicated â€œa lot has changedâ€. Common one-word responses to the experience surrounding this change-event were feeling disappointment, upset, frustrated, sadness, annoyance, and depression. Life events that conjured similar magnitude of emotion included significant injury, surgery, and losing a loved one. There were no differences by sport for the depression subscale, but 110 participants reported elevated scores and females had a higher mean depression subscale score compared with males. Differences between sports for the anxiety subscale were negated when evaluating Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, but 69 participants reported elevated scores and females had a higher mean anxiety subscale score compared with males. There was no difference by sport for the stress subscale, but 77 participants reported elevated scores and females had a higher mean stress subscale score compared with males. Discussion: Authors urge the campus and athletics community to be diligent in monitoring the holistic wellness of college athletes and members of other campus groups. Mainly, we contend it is important to consider that COVID-19 is a significant and widespread change-event, and other change-events are known to have significant impact. We should consider that COVID-19 may be acutely and longitudinally impactful to the American college student.","Garver, Matthew J.; Gordon, Aqualus M.; Philipp, Nicolas M.; Huml, Matt R.; Wakeman, Amanda J.","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S320243","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare; 14:1873-1882, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare; 14:1873-1882, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16136,""
"â€œAnti-COVID-19â€ Medications, Supplements, and Mental Health Status in Indonesian Mothers with School-Age Children","Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic affects all aspects of life and might cause stress for vulnerable groups such as mothers with school-age children, both housewives and working mothers. With the uncontrolled circulating information about medications, supplements, and herbs that are believed to treat COVID-19, self-medication and misused might escalate. Therefore, this study aims to determine the consumption of â€œanti-COVIDâ€ agents and the mental health of mothers with school-age children in Indonesia. Methods: Online questionnaires regarding medications/supplements for COVID-19 prevention and treatment of â€œanti-COVIDâ€ consumption behavior and mental health using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21) were distributed among Indonesian mothers with school-age children. Data (n = 610) were analyzed;descriptive and association between sociodemographic factors, â€œanti-COVIDâ€ medications consumption, and mental health were presented. Results: A quarter of the respondents were categorized as having mental disorders, with higher scores of DASS-21 was higher in the housewivesâ€™ group. The incidence associated with age, family expenses, and marital status in the working mothersâ€™ group, and only with family expense in the housewivesâ€™ group. Moreover, the result showed 80% of the respondents consumed â€œanti-COVIDâ€ medications or supplements to prevent COVID-19, with 75% did self-medication without consulting with a healthcare professional. Friends/family and social media were two primary sources of information regarding the â€œanti-COVIDâ€ products. In the housewivesâ€™ group, their consumption behavior was influenced by education. Meanwhile in the working mothersâ€™ group, the consumption behavior was influenced by age, family income, and family expense. In addition, there was no association between the usage of medications/supplements with the respondentsâ€™ mental health status. Conclusion: This study showed the importance of controlling information and expanding the motherâ€™s knowledge to find the correct information to minimize the unwanted effect in the post COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing awareness of mental health issues in the community, especially in the vulnerable population such as mother with school-age children, is necessary to avoid detrimental effects that might occur in the future.","d'Arqom, Annette, Brihastami, Sawitri, Nasution, Zamal, Riko, Lazuardi","https://doi.org/10.2147/IJWH.S316417","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Women's Health; 13:699-709, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Women's Health; 13:699-709, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16137,""
"Health-Related Quality-of-Life and Associated Factors Among Post-Partum Women in Arba Minch Town","Background: It is generally accepted that pregnancy and childbirth are natural physiological processes. However, these significantly affect the quality of mothersâ€™ lives. Little is known about the level of quality-of-life and associated factors among postpartum women in Ethiopia, particularly in the study area. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 409 randomly selected post-partum women who were living in Arba Minch town. Systematic random sampling was employed to select the study participants. The standard quality-of-life assessment tool which is known as the short-form SF 36 tool was used to assess health-related quality-of-life. The logistic regression model was used to identify associated factors. Statistically significant variables at a p-value&lt; 0.25 in the bi-variable analysis were candidate variables for multi-variable analysis and statistical significance which was declared at a p-value&lt; 0.05. Results: Among the study participants, 255 (62.3%) had lower level health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). About 46.2% of the study participants had lower physical HRQoL and about 79% of the study participants had lower mental HRQoL. The overall mean score of HRQoL was 45.15 (Â± 8.13). Factors associated with lower overall HRQoL were age group 17â€“ 24 years (AOR=2.73, 95% CI=1.22â€“ 6.10), no formal education [AOR 2.02, 95% CI (1.05â€“ 3.89)], and cesarean delivery (AOR=0.49, 95% CI=0.24â€“ 0.97). A factor associated with lower physical HRQoL was cesarean delivery (AOR=0.34, 95% CI=0.13â€“ 0.88). Factors associated with lower mental HRQoL were age group 17â€“ 24 (AOR=3.37, 95% CI=1.60â€“ 7.04), not receiving antenatal care (AOR=3.65, 95% CI=1.45â€“ 9.16), and having postpartum depression (AOR=2.27, 95% CI=1.30â€“ 3.93). Conclusion: The results suggest that the majority of post-partum women had a lower HRQoL, particularly womenâ€™s mental health was compromised. In this study, a suggestion is made that the respective bodies need to give particular attention to mothers during the post-partum period to prevent poor quality-of-life.","Tola, Yirgalem, Ayele, Gistane, Negussie, Boti, Manaye, Yihune, Gethahun, Firdawek, Gebru, Zeleke","https://doi.org/10.2147/IJWH.S295325","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Women's Health; 13:601-611, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Women's Health; 13:601-611, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16138,""
"Reducing psychological distress and depression in humanitarian emergencies: An essential role for nonspecialists","Nonspecialists, such as community health workers or lay persons, do not have specialty training in mental healthcare;yet, these frontline providers often play an essential role in delivering primary care services in many low- and middle-income countries [3,4], and they are increasingly being recognized as critical for scaling up access to psychological treatments for mental disorders [5,6]. Skill use and the mechanism of action Jordans and colleagues offer a novel exploration of why and how Group PM+ worked, revealing that participantsâ€™ use of the program skills such as breathing exercises, problem solving techniques, and seeking social support were important drivers in the difference in outcomes between study arms. Consideration of potential moderators is also important for determining whether there may be differential intervention response depending on individual characteristics, such as demographics, severity of distress, or history of mental health problems. Recent studies have reported on the increasing viability of digital approaches for supporting delivery of mental health services even in conflict settings and in severely resource-limited contexts at risk for humanitarian emergencies [15];yet, there remains a substantial digital divide, particularly in impoverished communities and among women compared to men. [...]digital tools could allow opportunities to capture data from nonspecialists and participants to assess the treatment mechanism of action, facilitate remote supervision, and enable ongoing support for nonspecialists to ensure effective delivery of psychological interventions such as Group PM+.","Naslund, John A.; Karyotaki, Eirini","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003625","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: PLoS Medicine; 18(6), 2021.; Publication details: PLoS Medicine; 18(6), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16139,""
"Effectiveness of Group Problem Management Plus, a brief psychological intervention for adults affected by humanitarian disasters in Nepal: A cluster randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Globally, 235 million people are impacted by humanitarian emergencies worldwide, presenting increased risk of experiencing a mental disorder. Our objective was to test the effectiveness of a brief group psychological treatment delivered by trained facilitators without prior professional mental health training in a disaster-prone setting. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) from November 25, 2018 through September 30, 2019. Participants in both arms were assessed at baseline, midline (7 weeks post-baseline, which was approximately 1 week after treatment in the experimental arm), and endline (20 weeks post-baseline, which was approximately 3 months posttreatment). The intervention was Group Problem Management Plus (PM+), a psychological treatment of 5 weekly sessions, which was compared with enhanced usual care (EUC) consisting of a family psychoeducation meeting with a referral option to primary care providers trained in mental healthcare. The setting was 72 wards (geographic unit of clustering) in eastern Nepal, with 1 PM+ group per ward in the treatment arm. Wards were eligible if they were in disaster-prone regions and residents spoke Nepali. Wards were assigned to study arms based on covariate constrained randomization. Eligible participants were adult women and men 18 years of age and older who met screening criteria for psychological distress and functional impairment. Outcomes were measured at the participant level, with assessors blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was psychological distress assessed with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Secondary outcomes included depression symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, ""heart-mind"" problems, social support, somatic symptoms, and functional impairment. The hypothesized mediator was skill use aligned with the treatment's mechanisms of action. A total of 324 participants were enrolled in the control arm (36 wards) and 319 in the Group PM+ arm (36 wards). The overall sample (N = 611) had a median age of 45 years (range 18-91 years), 82% of participants were female, 50% had recently experienced a natural disaster, and 31% had a chronic physical illness. Endline assessments were completed by 302 participants in the control arm (36 wards) and 303 participants in the Group PM+ arm (36 wards). At the midline assessment (immediately after Group PM+ in the experimental arm), mean GHQ-12 total score was 2.7 units lower in Group PM+ compared to control (95% CI: 1.7, 3.7, p &lt; 0.001), with standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.4 (95% CI: -0.5, -0.2). At 3 months posttreatment (primary endpoint), mean GHQ-12 total score was 1.4 units lower in Group PM+ compared to control (95% CI: 0.3, 2.5, p = 0.014), with SMD of -0.2 (95% CI: -0.4, 0.0). Among the secondary outcomes, Group PM+ was associated with endline with a larger proportion attaining more than 50% reduction in depression symptoms (29.9% of Group PM+ arm versus 17.3% of control arm, risk ratio = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.4, p = 0.002). Fewer participants in the Group PM+ arm continued to have ""heart-mind"" problems at endline (58.8%) compared to the control arm (69.4%), risk ratio = 0.8 (95% CI, 0.7, 1.0, p = 0.042). Group PM+ was not associated with lower PTSD symptoms or functional impairment. Use of psychosocial skills at midline was estimated to explain 31% of the PM+ effect on endline GHQ-12 scores. Adverse events in the control arm included 1 suicide death and 1 reportable incidence of domestic violence;in the Group PM+ arm, there was 1 death due to physical illness. Study limitations include lack of power to evaluate gender-specific effects, lack of long-term outcomes (e.g., 12 months posttreatment), and lack of cost-effectiveness information. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that a 5-session group psychological treatment delivered by nonspecialists modestly reduced psychological distress and depression symptoms in a setting prone to humanitarian emergencies. Benefits were partly explained by the degree of psychosocial kill use in daily life. To improve the treatment benefit, future implementation should focus on approaches to enhance skill use by PM+ participants. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03747055.","Jordans, M. J.

"Spirituality, moral injury and mental health among Chinese health professionals","BackgroundMoral injury has been found to be prevalent among healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 public health crisis.AimsThe present study examines the relationship between spirituality, moral injury, and mental health among physicians and nurses in mainland China during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodAn online cross-sectional study was conducted involving 3006 physicians and nurses in mainland China, where the COVID-19 pandemic has caused high rates of hospital admission and death. The Moral Injury Symptoms Scale-Health Professional was administered, along with measures of mental health and spirituality. Hierarchical linear regression modelling was used to examine the mediating and moderating role of moral injury in the relationship between spirituality and mental health.ResultsSpirituality was positively correlated with moral injury (ÃŸ = 2.41, P &lt; 0.01), depressive symptoms (ÃŸ = 0.74, P &lt; 0.01) and anxiety symptoms (ÃŸ = 0.65, P &lt; 0.01) after controlling sociodemographic variables. Moral injury significantly mediated the relationship between spirituality and both depression and anxiety, explaining 60% (0.46/0.76) of the total association between spirituality and depression and 58% (0.38/0.65) of the association with anxiety. No moderating effect of moral injury was found on the spiritualityâ€“mental health relationship.ConclusionsAlthough they were the findings of a cross-sectional study, these results suggest that concern over transgressing moral values during the pandemic may have been a driving factor for negative mental health symptoms among Chinese health professionals for whom spirituality was somewhat important. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine the causal nature of these relationships.","Wang, Zhizhong, Faten Al, Zaben, Koenig, Harold G.; Ding, Yuanlin","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.972","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 7(4), 2021.; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 7(4), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16141,""
"The Beneficial Role of Auricular Point Pressure in Insomnia and Anxiety in Isolated COVID-19 Patients","Background. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes psychological distress and can have a negative impact on the general mental health and rehabilitation in affected patients under currently implemented isolation guidelines. Auricular point pressure (APP) as well-established technique in traditional Chinese medicine may help to relieve sleep disturbance and anxiety in COVID-19 patients. Methods. During the early phase of the epidemic/pandemic, patients were enrolled in this study (02/2020 until 03/2020 n = 84). They were strictly isolated on specific wards at the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine in Hubei. The retrospective cohort study design included two groups. Group A patients were treated with an auricular point pressure (APP) in addition to standard intensive care medicine while Group B participants (No-APP) received routine nursing measures alone. Treatment outcome was measured using the St. Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaire (SMH) Score and the 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Both scores were measured in each patient at baseline and on the discharge day. Results. The SMH score and sleep status changed in APP patients at the end of the treatment period when compared with No-APP patients (P &lt; 0.01). APP-treated patients demonstrated lower GAD-7 scores than No-APP controls (P &lt; 0.01). Further, no significant differences in safety or adverse events between the APP and No-APP groups were observed. Conclusion. The results from our snapshot study during the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic/pandemic suggest that auricular point pressure could be a simple and effective tool to relieve insomnia and situational anxiety in hospitalized patients suffering from COVID-19 and kept under disconcerting conditions of isolation.

"#3123 Assessing international alcohol and internet use patterns during COVID-19 isolation using an online survey: highlighting distinct stressors conferring risk to compulsive behaviours","Objectives and AimsThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has required drastic safety measures to contain virus spread, including an extended self-isolation period. Those with greater perceived or actual life stress are vulnerable to develop or reinstate problematic behaviours characterised by addiction and compulsive mechanisms. Thus, we assessed how the COVID-19 pandemic and isolation measures affected alcohol consumption and internet use in the general population.MethodsWe developed an online international survey, entitled Habit Tracker (HabiT), completed by 1,346 adults (=18 years), which measured changes in amount and severity of alcohol consumption (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test;AUDIT),online gaming (Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form;IGDS9-SF), and pornography viewing (Cyber Pornography Addiction Test;CYPAT) before (post-hoc recall)and during the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent lockdown. These measures were related to ten COVID-19-specific stress factors. Lastly, we assessed psychiatric factors widely recognized to be associated with problematic alcohol and internet use such as anxiety, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale;HADS), and impulsivity (Short Impulsive-Behavior Scale;SUPPS-P).ResultsOf the sample, we observed an overall increase in online gaming and a decrease alcohol consumption and pornography viewing. Those who increased their amount and severity of alcohol use (36%) during lockdown reported stress associated with the pandemic itself, such as being an essential worker directly caring for those with or having a loved one become severely ill from COVID-19. Further, those residing in the United Kingdom- as opposed the United States or Canada- increased their weekly amount of alcohol consumption. Alternatively, those who increased online gaming (64%) and pornography viewing (43%)reported low frequency or poor quality social interactions resultant of lockdown measures. All three groups displayed higher levels of depression, anxiety, and urgency impulsivity.ConclusionsOur findings underscore the theoretical mechanism of negative emotionality underlying forms of compulsive behaviour driven by stress, depression, and anxiety;while highlighting distinct avenues by which these behaviours can manifest. Limitations include subjects being within varying phases of lockdown during the time of testing and a large degree of study dropout (n=1,515). We emphasise the relevance of identifying those in need of greater support services to mitigate negative health outcomes associated with problematic alcohol consumption and internet usage in the context of COVID-19 isolation.","Sallie, Samantha N.; Ritou, Valentin J.

"#3121 Adapting the queen square guided self help (QGSH) for functional neurological disorders as a stand-alone intervention: an exonian pilot study","AimFunctional neurological disorders (FND) are one of the most common presentation in neurology clinics, causing a significant disability and economic burden. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has one of the best available evidence in managing FND, although access remains limited. Queen Square, London neuropsychiatry experts have established an excellent model for a CBT based, Guided Self Help (GSH) programme, which is preparatory to a multidisciplinary inpatient treatment. It has been shown to have good outcomes. This study was designed to ascertain the feasibility and acceptance of this QGSH model, in an Exonian cohort of FND patients, whilst piloting its stand-alone version, without the inpatient component. Additionally, the study explores the need and types of modifications required for the stand-alone adaptation of QGSH.MethodConsecutive patients referred to Exeter FND Service, between February to June 2020, who had internet access, were offered the QGSH pilot. Patients with a primary mental disorder concurrent drug/alcohol misuse or risk of self-harm or suicide were excluded. Ethics approval was not required. The QGSH intervention constitutes of 11 modules focussing on specific elements crucial to FND management along with homework tasks, delivered by the author, under supervision by QGSH experts. Patients completed Pre and Post-intervention questionnaires as well as structured feedback.ResultsThree successive patients with varied FND symptoms were recruited to the pilot between February and June 2020. The baseline health status of these patients was worse as compared to EQ-5D-5L population norms with significant baseline psychiatric comorbidity. Outcome measures used before and after QGSH intervention included PHQ 9, GAD 7, EQ-5D-5L and a locally devised symptom severity questionnaire. Necessary modifications were made to the program based on the patients informal feedback and structured formal feedback was sought in the end.ConclusionAll patients derived some benefit from QGSH and certain modifications were suggested in patient feedback to improve engagement. Despite study limitations, especially small size and the impact of Covid 19 pandemic during the intervention;QGSH model appears acceptable and feasible in an Exonian cohort, however, some modifications are recommended for the stand-alone version to succeed. The recommendations will be presented.","Sachdeva, Jasjeet, Selai, Caroline, Moutoussis, Michael","https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2021-BNPA.39","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry; 92(8):A17, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry; 92(8):A17, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16144,""
"#3125 Novel framework for neurocognitive COVID-19 assessment","BackgroundThe neurotrophic effects of Covid-19 are becoming increasingly recognized, with altered mental state now being the second most common presenting complaint insert numbers. A key question is whether this has long term consequences. Cognitive problems are commonly reported in patients 3 months after acute infection as part of the so called Long-Covid syndrome. However, the underlying cause is not well understood. Candidate explanations include legacy from encephalitis and stroke;however, other complications such as the sequelae, delirium, remain underexplored. Furthermore, little consideration has been given to functional cognitive disorders and the cognitive consequences of depression, anxiety and fatigue.AimsWe propose a structured approach to clinical assessment for clinicians reviewing late cognitive complaints after COVID 19.MethodsWe created our own unique framework for neurocognitive Covid assessment based upon a review of the literature.ResultsCovid status- Any positive test. If not review of core symptoms such as breathlessness, headache, anosmia, nasal obstruction, cough, myalgia, or gustatory dysfunction;duration, extent of exposure to Covid confirmed cases. Consider rapid antibody testing.Neuropsychiatric history- Part 1 symptoms at onset- in particular disruptions of consciousness and altered mental state. Acute memory impairment, anterograde/retrograde and with/without a temporal gradient. neurocognitive function. ITU admission and oxygen requirements.Part 2 Current cognitive and mental state- in addition to standard history seek evidence of internal inconsistency of memory symptoms and attentional dysregulation. Has social cognition and meta-cognition been affected. Note attribution bias i.e. no Im not depressed, I cant enjoy anything because of my symptomsBackground history- subtle suggestion of neurodegeneration and depression, anxiety and functional symptoms should be explored.MRI findings- signal changes in the medial temporal lobe, nonconfluent multifocal white matter hyperintense lesions, and isolated white matter microhemorrhages.Novel biomarkers IL-6, MCP-1, and IP-10.ConclusionCognitive symptoms are common after confirmed and assumed COVID exposure.

"Response to Routsolias and Mycyk Letter","[...]patients with opioid withdrawal symptoms benefit from its agonistic properties in the form of diminished cravings;however, its ceiling effect prevents the consequences of respiratory depression and euphoria present with full Âµ-receptor agonists such as methadone.1 These characteristics contribute to buprenorphine's excellent safety and efficacy profiles, protecting patients with OUD from overdose and death. [...]we respectfully disagree with the notion that â€œmedication alone is not sufficient treatment for OUD.â€ 11 In addition to the difficulties accessing treatment for OUDâ€”including buprenorphine or buprenorphine-naloxoneâ€”that our colleagues in Chicago describe and we have seen in Maine as well, emerging literature points to other pandemic-related challenges.12,13 First, evidence suggests that people with OUD may be at higher risk for experiencing COVID-19 infection due to a higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions, smoking, opioid-related immunosuppression, and the presence of structural lung disease.14-17 In addition, those with OUD are more likely to reside in congregate living situations such as group recovery housing, shelters, and correctional facilities where they may be unable to maintain social distancing.14,15 People with OUD also make up a disproportionate share of the United States unsheltered and unstably housed population, placing them at further risk for exposure to COVID-19.16,18 Although social distancing is an important public health measure, there is potential for the isolation associated with COVID-19 to cause harm for those with OUD.19 There is a strong association between social isolation, mood, and substance use disorders.20 Isolation can act as a trigger for some, exacerbating existing patterns of substance use or contributing to a return to use for those who are in recovery.19 In addition, many supportive and harm-reducing services for people with OUD are unavailable as a result of the current pandemic, including support groups, treatment programs, daily medication dispensing clinics, and needle exchanges.","Anonymous","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jen.2021.03.012","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: J Emerg Nurs; 47(4):527-529, 2021.; Publication details: J Emerg Nurs; 47(4):527-529, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16148,""
"Climate Mobility and Development Cooperation","Development cooperation actors have been addressing climate change as a cross-cutting issue and investing in climate adaptation projects since the early 2000s. More recently, as concern has risen about the potential impacts of climate variability and change on human mobility, development cooperation actors have begun to design projects that intentionally address the drivers of migration, including climate impacts on livelihoods. However, to date, we know little about the development cooperationâ€™s role and function in responding to climate related mobility and migration. As such, the main aim of this paper is to outline the policy frameworks and approaches shaping development cooperation actorsâ€™ engagement and to identify areas for further exploration and investment. First, we frame the concept of climate mobility and migration and discuss some applicable policy frameworks that govern the issue from various perspectives;secondly, we review the toolbox of approaches that development cooperation actors bring to climate mobility;and third, we discuss the implications of the current Covid-19 pandemic and identify avenues for the way forward. We conclude that ensuring safe and orderly mobility and the decent reception and long-term inclusion of migrants and displaced persons under conditions of more severe climate hazards, and in the context of rising nationalism and xenophobia, poses significant challenges. Integrated approaches across multiple policy sectors and levels of governance are needed. In addition to resources, development cooperation actors can bring data to help empower the most affected communities and regions and leverage their convening power to foster more coordinated approaches within and across countries.

"The Influence of Covid-19 Lockdown on Body Mass Index, Depression, Anxiety and Stress among Medical Students","The Covid-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc throughout the world, with 150 million cases to date and over 3 million lives claimed worldwide. Objectives: To explore the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on psychological health parameters i.e. depression, anxiety and stress as well as on body mass index among medical students studying in a private medical college in Pakistan. Study Design: Experimental study. Methodology: This study with enrolled students (n=233) was carried out after ethical review committeeâ€™s (ERC) approval at CMH Kharian Medical College (CKMC), Physiology Department, Kharian-Pakistan. Both male and female medical students were enrolled. In phase 1, the students reported to the Physiology laboratory where age and gender were recorded. The pre-lockdown readings of BMI and DASS-21(Depression, Anxiety, Stress) scale were taken. In phase-2, the post-lockdown readings of BMI and DASS-21 scale were taken once the students returned to campus. Statistical analysis: Data was analyzed by SPSS software, version 21. BMI and DASS-21 score were presented as mean + SD. Statistical significance was taken at p value &lt;0.05. Results: In present study, results showed that there was a decrease in level of depression post-Covid-19-lockdown among enrolled subjects with significant p-values (0.019*) in the pre and post covid-19-lockdown comparison. Conclusion: We concluded that significant difference was seen between Pre & Post Covid-19-lockdown depression with p-value of &lt;0.019.

"DAHAGA: An Islamic spiritual mindfulness-based application to reduce depression among nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacts students' mental health. Most of them may experience depression. Due to restrictions and social distancing during the pandemic, counseling may not be applicable in detecting the problems. Therefore, an Islamic spiritual mindfulness-based application called DAHAGA is created in order to detect and reduce depression. It is believed that this innovative app could reduce mental health problems among students. Objective: This study aimed to determine the effect of DAHAGA on reducing depression among nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study with a comparison group pretest/posttest design conducted from May to June 2020. Seventy students were selected using convenience sampling, of which 35 were assigned in an experimental group and a comparison group. The validated Indonesian Version-Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDIII) was used for data collection. Paired t-test and independent t-test were used for data analysis. Results: There was a significant effect of DAHAGA on depression (p &lt; 0.001). The level of depression after intervention (mean 11.49, SD 4.49) was lower than it before the intervention (mean 17.20, SD 4.94). Additionally, there was a significant difference in depression level between the experimental and comparison groups after the intervention with a p-value of &lt; 0.001. Conclusion: The DAHAGA is proven effective in reducing depression. Therefore, this study offers a new and innovative app that fits with the COVID-19 pandemic to help Muslim students maintain their health status. The findings also support Islamic spiritual mindfulness as a part of nursing interventions among psychiatric nurses to deal with mental health problems, especially depression.","Dwidiyanti, M.; Munif, B.; Santoso, A.; Rahmawati, A.

"Resilience and Hopelessness in Turkish Society: Exploring the Role of Spirituality in the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 is an infectious disease that first appeared in China, and turned into a global pandemic. It has affected the health of millions of people and has also driven many changes in societies. This research aims to describe and define the importance of ""spirituality"" as a mediator in the COVID-19 Pandemic in Turkey while having a positive correlation with ""resilience"" and an inverse relationship with ""hopelessness."" The correlational research design was used and data were gathered through the technique of convenience sampling. Standardized sociological and psychological instruments were used to measure the variables. The participants were (N=546) from the general Turkish population (male and female) with the age range of 20-69. The outcomes revealed that resilience is positively correlated with spirituality (r=0.83, p&lt;0.01), while spirituality is negatively correlated with hopelessness (r=-0.81, p&lt;0.01). Resilience is also negatively correlated with hopelessness (r=-0.72, p&lt;0.01). This study concluded that spirituality has a substantial impact on resilient behavior and reduces hopelessness even globally.

Results: The study population consisted of 51 puerperal women with COVID-19 and 52 without COVID-19, out of whom 66.67 % and 55.77 % had a fair lifestyle, respectively. The first group (those with COVID-19) showed a good mother-newborn bonding (64.71 %), intense physical activity (62.75 %), healthy diet (84.31 %), adequate rest and sleep (54.90 %), good mental health and self-esteem (62.74 %), and high social integration (68.72 %). The second group (those without COVID-19) showed a fair mother-newborn bonding (55.76 %), moderate physical activity (62.75 %), healthy diet (69.23 %), adequate rest and sleep (75.00 %), fair mental health and self-esteem (63.47 %), and medium social integration (67.31 %). Conclusions: COVID-19 had a significant impact (p &lt; 0.05) on the relationship between lifestyles and mother-newborn bonding. Rest and sleep were key factors in determining the impact of COVID-19.","RodrÃ­guez, A. R.; Loza, M. L.; Vega, J. R.; Angulo, J. N. H.; Cosavalente, H. E. F.; Paredes, J. E.

"The Impact of COVID-19 Curfew on Food Security Status, Eating Habits, and Health among Adults Living in Saudi Arabia","Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic and its related containment actions have impacted food security. This study aimed to assess food security status of adults in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 curfew, and describe their coping strategies, eating habits, and health conditions. Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey, which included questions on sociodemographic characteristics, food security status, coping strategies, eating habits and self-rated health. Results: A total of 605 adults living in Saudi Arabia were recruited through an online survey. The overall prevalence of food insecurity was 28.4% (n= 172). Food insecurity was significantly higher among males with lower education and income level, and in participants living in rented properties. Numerous coping strategies were found to be significantly different between four types of food security groups. The total score of coping strategies was negatively associated with food security status (0.94Â±1.59, 2.78Â±2.44, 6.43Â±2.76, 7.34 Â± 2.20, respectively, p &lt; 0.001). Food-insecure participants were significantly more likely to report poor/fair physical and mental health, compared to food-secure participants (p&lt; 0.001). Food insecurity was significantly associated with changes in usual eating habits during the COVID-19 curfew (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The results showed that food insecurity can have a potential impact on adults' health and eating habits. Governments need to take crucial actions and adopt comprehensive policies, both locally and globally, to ensure food security among populations.","Hanbazaza, M.

"STUDYING SOME POSSIBLE IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME MANIFESTATIONS IN COVID-19 PATIENTS","The starting point of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2) pandemic is a highly debated topic today. Despite the fact that a multitude of hypotheses have been issued in this context, this new strain beta-coronavirus is not only highly contagious, but also rapidly transmitted interpersonally through the perpetually disrupting the homeostasis. It constantly affects the lungs, and also the digestive tract according to the latest reports following its binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Material and methods: In the present study we aimed to explain and describe some gastrointestinal deficiencies exhibited by the positive patients Therefore, the Visual Analogue Scale-IBS ( VAS-IBS) questionnaire was applied to a group of positive patients (n = 22) and compared to their sex-matched controls (n = 22). The confirmation for the SARS- CoV-2 infection was carried out by specific RT-qPCR testing. Results: We observed that the overall scores attributed to the spectrum of Physical symptoms, Mental health and Quality of life are significantly different among the COVID-19 group dependent on sex than in the control group. However, we did not find significant differences in terms of shape and stool consistencies (as evaluated by Bristol scale). Conclusions: In this study, we showed that several gastrointestinal symptoms (as evaluated by VAS-IBS scale) could occur during or following SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ilie, O. D.; Nita, I.

"Mood and Affective Balance of Spaniards Confined by COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study","The aim of this study was to analyze the mood and affective balance of Spaniards in quarantine and determine the predictive role of sociodemographic variables and mood on the negative affective balance. This cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample of 1014 Spanish adults, 67.2% were women and 32.8% men. The age ranged from 17 to 76. The instruments used were the Mood Assessment Scale and the Affective Balance Scale, which were implemented as a CAWI survey (Computer Aided Web Interviewing). Results showed that age correlated negatively with Sadness-Depression, Anxiety, and Happiness. Women had more Sadness-Depression, Anxiety, and negative affect, while men showed more Happiness and higher positive affect. Thus, the risk of a negative affective balance during confinement was greater for women and those who showed an emotional state marked by sadness-depression and anxiety, while older age and higher scores in happiness were associated with lower risk. In conclusion, knowing which groups are at risk of emotional and affective alteration can facilitate the detection and prevention of later disorders, such as severe stress and posttraumatic stress disorder, avoiding their generalized presence, and becoming a new public health problem derived from COVID-19.","Perez-Fuentes, M.

"Exposure to Domestic Violence During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Potent Threat to the Mental Well-being of Children","The unprecedented scale of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has indeed brought about tremendous ramifications on the state of mental health for children. One notable aspect deserving emphasis however, is the psychological impact in children as a result of the purported surge of domestic violence (DV) in many of the countries that imposed stay-at-home requirement. The imposition of movement restriction policy led to isolation and overcrowding, made worse by loss of income in some instances, causing high levels of stress and anxiety, thereby increasing the risk of DV and child abuse particularly those already living within violent or dysfunctional families. Children exposed to DV have higher risk of developmental delay and behavioural problems, more likely to suffer from post-traumatic symptoms, depression and anxiety, reduced cognitive functioning and social competence. Additionally, these children tend to have poorer academic performance and are more likely to engage in violent or abusive relationship later in life. Health care providers need to be vigilant and actively screen and identify children or families that are affected by DV to protect their physical and mental health well-being.","Hon, B.

"Feelings, Stress, and Coping of Nurses Amidst COVID-19 Outbreak in Saudi Arabia","Background: A year after the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world, the pandemic is still affecting healthcare systems with an increasing number of infected healthcare workers. Such a unique situation may often result in emotional turmoil, anxiety, depression, and fear, which could lead to resignation and burnout. The study intended to assess the feelings of nurses toward the COVID-19 outbreak;ascertain the factors that cause stress;and determine their coping strategies and factors contributing to coping. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional design was utilized to recruit 313 nurses working in the Ministry of Health (Saudi Arabia) hospitals that accommodate COVID-19 patients. The study instrument was adapted and modified from the ""MERS-CoV Staff Questionnaire"" and the Brief COPE. Results: The results showed that female, married, those with a bachelor's degree, and aged 25-34 years had higher significant coping strategies. On the other hand, Filipino nurses assigned in the Outpatient Department and COVID-19 Isolation Ward had more negative feelings and encountered several factors causing stress but were coping in a better way than others. Conclusion: Nurses' commitment to their profession appears to be an intrinsic motivation to continue caring for COVID-19 patients despite the risk of infection. Comfort with religion, spiritual beliefs, and the presence of a support system were the coping strategies used by nurses to ameliorate the stress and negative feelings during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Natividad, M.

"MENTAL HEALTH AND PROFESSIONAL BURNOUT AMONG RESIDENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: SITUATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS","The paper presents the results of a study of the level and factors of mental maladjustment and professional burnout of medical residents undergoing training at the Training Center of N.V. Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Medicine during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study involved 110 first and second year residents (30 men and 80 women;mean age - 25.1 +/- 2.32), both working in the COVID-19 ""red zone"" and helping other patients. The following methods were used to assess symptoms and factors of mental maladjustment and professional burnout: Beck Depression and Anxiety Scales (Beck et al., 1988;1996), Maslach Burnout Inventory (Maslach & Jackson, 1981), PTSD Checklist for DSM 5 (PSL-5;Weathers et al., 2013) Distress Thermometer (Holland, Bultz, 2007), UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell et al., 1978) Three-Factor Perfectionism Inventory (Garanyan et al., 2018) and Toronto Alexithymia Scale (Taylor et al., 2003). According to the data, 43% of young doctors noted symptoms of depression of moderate and high severity, suicidal thoughts were present in 10%, symptoms of heightened anxiety in 30%, and more than a half (55%) had critically high rates of symptoms of post-traumatic stress. About a quarter of the respondents showed high rates of general distress (24%) and professional burnout in all three of its aspects (emotional exhaustion - 21%, depersonalization - 23%, and personal accomplishment - 22%). Most residents associated distress with difficulties in combining work and study and fear for the quality of education during the pandemic. Social support was noted as a factor in coping with stress. A series of regression analyzes showed the importance of the contribution of the experience of loneliness, as well as high rates of perfectionism and alexithymia, to mental distress and professional burnout of residents.","Kholmogorova, A.

"Physical activity in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: Research profiling and mapping","Background and Study Aim The aim of the study is to profile and map the scientific output in research on physical activity in the COVID-19 context. The study makes an attempt to response to the three following questions: (1) What are the leading contributors (countries, research institutions, authors and source titles) to research production in the field? (2) What are the core references? (3) What are the leading thematic areas / research fronts? Material and Methods We used the Scopus database as a source of bibliometric data for the research sampling process and employed a combination of bibliometric methods, including research profiling and selected science mapping methods, i.e. co-word analysis and direct citation analysis, in order to achieve the aim of the study and provide responses to the study questions. Science mapping processes were supported with VOSviewer software. Results: Research profiling indicates that the main contributors to scientific output on physical activity in the COVID-19 context are scholars and research institutions from countries, which have been heavily affected by the pandemic such as: the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Brazil. Certainly, the reports from China, which was the first nation to suffer from COVID-19 and associated epidemic restrictions, constitute an important input, too. The core references in research on physical activity in the COVID-19 context may be grouped into three categories aimed at: (1) investigating the consequences of pandemic restrictions on physical activity, (2) analysing the outcomes of physical activity for other variables, and (3) providing recommendations for practising home-based physical activity during COVID-19 confinement. Science mapping of the research field conceptual structure indicates the following thematic areas / research fronts in research on physical activity in the COVID-19 context: (1) 'pandemic and its outcomes', (2) 'physical activity during self-isolation', (3) 'health behaviour', (4) 'food habits', (5) 'mental health', (6) 'adults and the pandemic'. Conclusions: The study contributes to development of physical activity theory by profiling and mapping research conducted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through mapping the scientific output, the paper points out the leading contributors and core references, and makes an attempt to identify leading thematic areas / research fronts. Discovering the main signposts may be useful for all the researchers planning and designing research within the field. Moreover, mapping research fronts indicates them the topics attracting attention of the academia and potential research gaps.","Tomanek, M.; Lis, A.","https://doi.org/10.15561/20755279.2021.0301","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Physical Education of Students; 25(3):136-148, 2021.; Publication details: Physical Education of Students; 25(3):136-148, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16165,""

"Prevalence of Anxiety, Depression, and Perceived Stigma in Healthcare Workers in Nepal During Later Phase of First Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic: A Web-Based Cross-Sectional Survey","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has caused discrimination and social stigma among healthcare workers (HCW) causing psychological problems due to prolonged work shifts, uncertain pay, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), added fear of infection to self or family, and so on. This online survey is directed towards the determination of anxiety, depression, and stigma among healthcare providers in Nepal during the later phase of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods Anxiety and depression were assessed using standard Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), respectively. Data for the survey were collected from January 10, 2021, to February 6, 2021, and analyzed using Stata 15 (College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC). Results A total of 213 participants were enrolled in the study from different parts of Nepal and their mean age was 29.90 +/- 6.43 years. The prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers was 46.95% and 41.31%, respectively. A bidirectional relationship was present between GAD-7 and PHQ-9 score interpretation. About 57% of HCW experienced some form of perceived stigmatization due to COVID-19. Frontline HCW were six times more likely to be stigmatized compared to non-front line HCWs and diagnosis of COVID-19 was associated with three times higher odds of facing perceived stigmatization. Conclusion A significant number of HCW experienced symptoms of anxiety and depression during the later phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Frontline HCW who were infected experienced a higher level of stigma.","Adhikari, S. P.; Rawal, N.; Shrestha, D. B.; Budhathoki, P.; Banmala, S.; Awal, S.; Bhandari, G.; Poudel, R.; Parajuli, A.

"Benzodiazepine Misuse: An Epidemic Within a Pandemic","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had deleterious effects on patients with mental health problems and several studies have shown a spike in the rates of depression, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Anxiety and insomnia rates have also increased among both the general public and health care professionals. Benzodiazepines are some of the most commonly used drugs in the treatment of anxiety and insomnia. However, benzodiazepines are also misused, abused alone, or abused in combination with other drugs. Lockdowns and social distancing have also had negative consequences on patients with mental health problems. We assessed the extent of benzodiazepine use during the pandemic and interpreted its effects in the future. We conducted a literature search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol and eight articles reviewed specifically reported worrying fluctuations in benzodiazepine use during the pandemic. We observed varied trends in the usage of benzodiazepines in various parts of the world. Some studies showed an increase in the consumption of benzodiazepine while others demonstrated a decrease in the prescription refills of benzodiazepine, which may be a result of gaps in mental health care. At this time, we can conclude that the current trend with benzodiazepine use is fluctuating and mental health professionals must continue to exercise caution before prescribing benzodiazepines. Future research is also warranted to be aware of the changing patterns and to avoid misuse and/or abuse at an epidemic level.","Sarangi, A.; McMahon, T.; Gude, J.","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.15816","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Cureus; 13(6):9, 2021.; Publication details: Cureus; 13(6):9, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16169,""
"The mental health and job burnout of nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak: Resilience as a mediator","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had adverse psychological, social, and economic consequences around the world. Nurses and physicians have been more negatively affected by this pandemic as compared to other occupational groups. Objectives: The present survey aimed to investigate the job burnout and mental health of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between mental health and job burnout. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in two public hospitals of Kashan, Iran from March 2020 until the end of June 2020. A total of 108 nurses participated in this study. The assessment tools included the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), nurses' job Burnout Questionnaire, and Resilience Scale. Hierarchical linear regression models were used to evaluate the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between job burnout and mental health. Results: The results showed that 61.1% of the participants had mild to severe mental health problems, while 13% reported no job burnout. In terms of resilience, most participants (88.9%) reported moderate resilience. Based on the results, resilience partially mediated the effect of mental health problems on job burnout. The present findings highlighted the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between job burnout and mental health problems among nurses. Conclusions: The present findings suggested that evaluation of resilience resources and traits might be helpful in predicting individuals at risk of psychological problems and job burnout.","Zanjani, Z.; Joekar, S.; Omidi, A.","https://doi.org/10.5812/ijpbs.109925","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Iranian Journal of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences; 15(2), 2021.; Publication details: Iranian Journal of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences; 15(2), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16170,""
"The impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on quality of life in diabetic patients","Background. Diabetes is one of the most prevalent metabolic diseases and it includes disabling complications and chronic and invisible progression. On the one hand, this disease imposes high financial expenses on the patient and, on the other hand, reduces the quality of life. Presently, the COVID-19 epidemic has been an international concern, and evidence implies that people who have the underlying disease are at higher risk for the virus and will experience serious problems if they develop the disease. Methods. This research is a qualitative study with a kind of phenomenological investigation that has been conducted to investigate the patient's experiences and personal feelings with diabetes in terms of the effects of corona disease on their quality of life. In this study, the semi-structured interview method was utilized to collect information. The number of sample included 15 patients referred to health centers, and each interview was recorded with the patient's consent and was written on paper and analyzed. Results. The data of this study were classified into 6 main themes and 19 sub-themes after analysis. The main themes of the information obtained from this study included knowledge and awareness, psychological effects, entertainment, and recreational programs, patient's family, medical care, and communication with patients placing the greatest emphasis on medical care. Stress caused by corona disease and depression were the most important psychological effects expressed by diabetic patients. They also expressed some serious medical care problems, including the reduction of referrals to health centers for follow-up and care and the shortage of physicians and health personnel to provide services. Conclusion. This study suggests that diabetic patients experience many different problems due to corona disease. These problems influence the diabetic patients' quality of life, so we need to understand better and solve the diabetic patients' problems, make more effort, and perform more suitable planning to improve their health and quality of life.","Alimehr, M.; Malayen, S.; Vafa, F.

"Assessing COVID-19 Impacts on College Students via Automated Processing of Free-form Text","In this paper, we report experimental results on assessing the impact of COVID-19 on college students by processing free-form texts generated by them. By free-form texts, we mean textual entries posted by college students (enrolled in a four year US college) via an app specifically designed to assess and improve their mental health. Using a dataset comprising of more than 9000 textual entries from 1451 students collected over four months (split between pre and post COVID-19), and established NLP techniques, a) we assess how topics of most interest to student change between pre and post COVID-19, and b) we assess the sentiments that students exhibit in each topic between pre and post COVID-19. Our analysis reveals that topics like Education became noticeably less important to students post COVID-19, while Health became much more trending. We also found that across all topics, negative sentiment among students post COVID-19 was much higher compared to pre-COVID-19. We expect our study to have an impact on policy-makers in higher education across several spectra, including college administrators, teachers, parents, and mental health counselors.","Sharma, R.; Pagadala, S.

"Psychological Status of Clinical Laboratory Staff During the COVID-19 Outbreak","Background: In early December 2019, during the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first detected in Wuhan, COVID-19 was suspected, detected, and confirmed in an increasing number of patients every day. The clinical laboratory staff have always played an important role in the laboratory diagnosis of patients. Currently, there are many research studies on the mental health of the first-line doctors or nurses managing the COVID-19 outbreak, both domestically and overseas, but data of the mental health and associated factors among the clinical laboratory staff who handle the blood or biological samples of confirmed cases and are consequently exposed to COVID-19 are limited. Methods: This cross-sectional survey-based study was performed via an online survey in a single designated hospital from April 20 to April 23, 2020 in Yiwu,China. The online survey included questions on sociodemographic and clinical variables. Totally, 45 clinical laboratory staff and 20 nonmedical health workers participated. Mental health variables were assessed via 4 Chinese versions of validated measurement tools : Zungs Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ). Results: Significant differences were observed in the SDS and SAS scores, between the clinical laboratory staff and the nonmedical health workers (P &lt; .001, P &lt; .003, respectively). The scores for exposure risk and neuroticism of participants were the main factors influencing both the SDS scores of the clinical laboratory staff (P = .002, P = .005, respectively), and also their SAS scores (P = .003 P = .006, respectively). Conclusions: The results showed that a significant proportion of clinical laboratory staff experienced anxiety and depression symptoms. Their scores for mental health problems, exposure risk, and neuroticism were associated with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. Therefore, the high-risk group of the clinical laboratory staff and those individuals with higher neuroticism scores may need special attention.","Cheng, C.; Rao, Y. B.; Lu, Y.

"The Prevalence of Pandemic Anxiety, Anxiety and Depression During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Turkey","Background: This prevalence study involved participants from various cities in Turkey was conducted in April 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic in Turkey, with a view to evaluate the pandemic-related anxiety, generalized anxiety, and depression in the society. Method: The study was conducted with 1267 people in more than 70 cities in Turkey. The study data were obtained by means of online data collection forms, due to the risks posed by the contagious COVID-19 disease in face to face interviews. The Demographic Properties Form, the Utkan Pandemic Anxiety (UPA) scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (BDI-PC) were utilized as data collection tools. Results: The average value for the UPA scale for the sample was calculated as 10.5 +/- 0.257 points, for the GAD-7 scale as 5.5 +/- 0.153 points, and for the BDI-PC as 3.8 +/- 0.095 points. The cut-off threshold for the UPA scale was exceeded by 34%, for the GAD-7 scale by 25.7%, and for the BDI-PC by 30.9% of the sample. Conclusion: It was concluded that the level of pandemic-related anxiety in the community was high, that the level of generalized anxiety and depression had increased in comparison to pre-pandemic times, and that women had a higher risk of pandemic-related anxiety, generalized anxiety, and depression, because they were a group at risk, and also due to the effect of media surveillance and reports.","Firat, M.; Okanli, A.; Kanbay, Y.; Utkan, M.; Gokmen, B.

"A Multi-Dimensional Psychiatric Perspective on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) arose in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread worldwide rapidly, and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization as of March 2020. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spread worldwide, its impact is increasingly being recognized among vulnerable groups and also by the public in general. Recent findings indicate that patients with mental health disorders are among the groups most vulnerable to psychological stress and social hardships related to the current pandemic. Studies also indicate an increased risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in subjects with psychiatric disorders. Patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 may present to the psychiatrist with delirium, psychotic symptoms, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and insomnia. Some patients will develop persistent somatic symptoms such as fatigue after the acute infection. In this article, we summarize the preliminary findings related to the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on patients with mental health disorders, as well as recent research on psychiatric presentations in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2.","Poyraz, C.

"Evaluating Factors Related to Health Anxiety in COVID-19 Patients","Background: The COVID-19 outbreak affects both the physical and mental health of individuals and society. This study investigates the factors related to health anxiety in COVID-19 patients and explores their sociodemographic-, disease-, and treatment-related factors, trait anxiety, and characteristics of secure or insecure attachment. Methods: The sample consisted of 420 individuals aged 18-65 years and diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 15 and May 15, 2020. The participants completed a sociodemographic data form and the Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI), Adult Attachment Scale (AAS), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that female gender, presence of chronic physical diseases, presence of mental health problems, and high AAS insecure attachment scores significantly predicted high HAI scores. Moreover, results indicated that the model explained approximately 21% of variance in HAI scores. Conclusions: Factors such as gender, presence of chronic physical diseases, presence of mental health problems, and attachment style influence health anxiety. Determining the appropriate factors that cause health anxiety can contribute to the implementation of protective measures for mental health and to the application of effective interventions for individuals who develop mental problems.","Kilincel, O.; Tan, E.; Altun, F.

"The risk of post-intensive care syndrome among patients hospitalised in the intensive care unit","The development of medicine and the improvement of techniques used for life support in intensive care units (ICUs) have significantly contributed to reducing the mortality of treated patients. On the other hand, many of them experience reduced quality of life and health problems after discharge from the unit. Individuals who have undergone a critical illness requiring intensive care have reported physical weakness, mental health problems, and a decrease in cognitive functions. It has been proposed that this form of reaction of patients treated in the ICU should be called post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Understanding and early diagnosis of PICS may therefore be important for the medical personnel and for the patient and his/her family.

"Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccination in Cancer Patients in Hong Kong: Approaches to Improve the Vaccination Rate","Emerging efficacy and safety data have led to the authorization of COVID-19 vaccines worldwide, but most trials excluded patients with active malignancies. This study evaluates the intended acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in cancer patients in Hong Kong. Methods: 660 adult cancer patients received a survey, in paper or electronic format, between 31 January 2021 and 15 February 2021. The survey included patientâ€™s clinical characteristics, perceptions of COVID-19 and vaccination, vaccine knowledge, cancer health literacy, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). The primary outcome was the intended acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine in cancer patients. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify factors associated with intended acceptance. Results: The intended acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination was 17.9%. A total of 487 (73.8%) believed that vaccination could prevent them from infection. Over 70% worried about vaccine negative effects on cancer and its side effects. Factors associated with intended acceptance included higher level of â€œbelief in vaccine on preventing them from getting COVID-19â€, less worry about long-term side effects of vaccine, lower level of cancer health literacy, and normal HADS (Depression scale). Conclusions: To improve vaccine acceptance rate, public education campaigns specific to cancer patients to gain their trust in efficacy and relieve their worries are needed.","Chan, Wing-Lok, Ho, Yuen-Hung Tricia, Wong, Carlos King-Ho, Choi, Horace Cheuk-Wai, Lam, Ka-On, Yuen, Kwok-Keung, Kwong, Dora, Hung, Ivan","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9070792","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Vaccines; 9(7):792, 2021.; Publication details: Vaccines; 9(7):792, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16180,""
"Individual Subjective Well-Being during the COVID-19 Pandemic","This paper examines how contextual and institutional factors are associated with individual subjective well-being, which is measured by individualsâ€™ happiness, during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data collected in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC), the Republic of Korea, Japan, Italy, the United Kingdom (UK), and the four biggest states of the United States (US) in April 2020, we find that the financial effects (represented by employment and income change) and nonfinancial effects (represented by experiencing negative nonfinancial effects including mental health issues and enjoying positive benefits) caused by nonpharmaceutical measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 are associated with individual subjective well-being. Moreover, positive benefits could reduce the likelihood of becoming unhappy for those who have experienced negative nonfinancial effects or those who have lost their jobs. The results also suggest that the degree to which people agree with their governmentâ€™s approach to dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic is positively correlated with their happiness. The risks associated with the pandemic, however, are only slightly associated with peopleâ€™s happiness. We also find that the correlation between the above factors and individual well-being varies from country to country.","Long, Trinh Q.","https://doi.org/10.3390/su13147816","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(14):7816, 2021.; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(14):7816, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16181,""

We used a self-reported online questionnaire (answers on a 5-point scale or binary), composed of 73 questions investigating the opinions, feelings, and emotions of teenagers, along with sociodemographic information and measures of the exposure to lockdown. The survey was conducted online through a web platform in Italy (between 27 April and 15 June 2020), Romania, and Croatia (3 June and 2 July 2020). Students aged &gt;14 years, living in a small flat, and not spending time outside were more likely to report anger, sadness, boredom/emptiness, and anxiety. Boys were significantly less likely than girls to report all measured emotional reactions. Those who lost someone from COVID-19 were more than twice as likely to experience anger compared to those who did not. Our findings may help identifying adolescents more likely to report negative emotional reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic and inform public health strategies for improving mental health among adolescents during/after the COVID-19 crisis.","Forte, Alberto, Orri, Massimiliano, Brandizzi, Martina, Iannaco, Cecilia, Venturini, Paola, Liberato, Daniela, Battaglia, Claudia, NÃ¶then-Garunja, Isabel, Vulcan, Maria, BrusÃ¬c, Asja, Quadrana, Lauro, Cox, Olivia, Fabbri, Sara, Monducci, Elena","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147638","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7638, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7638, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16182,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Sleep Quality, Stress Level and Health-Related Quality of Lifeâ€”A Large Prospective Cohort Study on Adult Danes","The everyday lives of Danish inhabitants have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, e.g., by social distancing, which was employed by the government in March 2020 to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the pandemic has entailed economic consequences for many people. This study aims to assess changes in physical and mental health-related quality of life (MCS, PCS), in stress levels, and quality of sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify factors that impact such changes, using a prospective national cohort study including 26,453 participants from the Danish Blood Donor Study who answered a health questionnaire before the pandemic and during the pandemic. Descriptive statistics, multivariable linear and multinomial logistic regression analyses were applied. A worsening of MCS and quality of sleep was found, and an overall decrease in stress levels was observed. PCS was decreased in men and slightly increased in women. The extent of health changes was mainly affected by changes in job situation, type of job, previous use of anti-depressive medication and the participantsâ€™ level of personal stamina. Thus, living under the unusual circumstances that persisted during the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the health of the general population.

"Teacher Teleworking during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Association between Work Hours, Workâ€“Family Balance and Quality of Life","Background: Teachers worldwide had to reinvent their work routine according to teleworking during the COVID-19 pandemic, a work format that negatively impacts individualsâ€™ physical and mental health. This study evaluates the association between work hours, workâ€“family balance and quality of life (QoL) among teachers during the Chilean health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic. Teachers from across Chile were contacted via email and social media to answer an online survey. QoL was evaluated via the SF-36 questionnaire, work hours and workâ€“family balance in the pandemic. A total of 336 teachers from across Chile participated in this study. Teachers had a low QoL score, associated with age (p &lt; 0.05). Teachers who were =44 showed lower deterioration risks in the Physical Component Summary (OR: 0.54) than the =45-year-old age group;simultaneously, the younger group (=44 years) had a greater risk (OR: 2.46) of deterioration in the Mental Component Summary than teachers over 45 years. A total of 78.7% of teachers reported having increased their work hours during the COVID-19 pandemic due to teleworking and 86% indicated negative effects on their workâ€“family balance. Pandemic work hours and negative workâ€“family balance increase the risk of reducing the Mental Component Summary (OR: 1.902;OR: 3.996, respectively). Teachers presented low median QoL scores, especially in the Mental Component Summary, suggesting that it would be beneficial to promote a better workload distribution for teachers in emergency contexts, considering the adverse effects of teleworking.","Lizana, Pablo A.; Vega-Fernadez, Gustavo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147566","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7566, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7566, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16184,""

The results showed that environmental risk and physical and mental health awareness were not significantly associated with the travel intention of Dajia Matsu pilgrimage participants (p &gt; 0.05), while travel decision and attitude toward epidemic prevention were significantly associated with travel intention (p &lt; 0.05).","Tseng, Kuan-Chieh, Lin, Hsiao-Hsien, Lin, Jan-Wei, Chen, I-Shen, Hsu, Chin-Hsien","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147539","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7539, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7539, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16185,""
"The Positive Role of Tai Chi in Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic","The ongoing coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed a significant threat to both peopleâ€™s physical and mental health. Physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, and negative emotions among the general population have been significantly increased because of COVID-19 home confinement. These are major risk factors associated with higher incidences of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, effective exercise management should be proposed as a prevention strategy to improve both physical and mental health while diminishing the effects of COVID-19. Tai Chi as a low-to-moderate aerobic exercise combines physical and mental training and plays a positive impact on human health. Here we aim to outline the effects of Tai Chi on the immune system, inflammatory responses, pulmonary function, and emotional control. The benefits of Tai Chi practice for individuals coping with COVID-19 are stated here which include immune system promotion, inflammation response reduction, rehabilitation in respiratory diseases, and emotional improvement. This statement has been supported by available clinical, physiological, and biological research. As a result, we hope to introduce Tai Chi as an effective exercise intervention for people coping with COVID-19 and as a beneficial exercise for maintaining an active lifestyle during a pandemic.","Xu, Suodi, Baker, Julien S.; Ren, Feng","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147479","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7479, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7479, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16186,""
"The hierarchy of walking needs and the covid-19 pandemic","More than 150 cities around the world have expanded emergency cycling and walking infrastructure to increase their resilience in the face of the COVID 19 pandemic. This tendency toward walking has led it to becoming the predominant daily mode of transport that also contributes to significant changes in the relationships between the hierarchy of walking needs and walking behaviour. These changes need to be addressed in order to increase the resilience of walking environments in the face of such a pandemic. This study was designed as a theoretical and empirical literature review seeking to improve the walking behaviour in relation to the hierarchy of walking needs within the current context of COVID-19. Accordingly, the interrelationship between the main aspects relating to walking-in the context of the pandemic-and the different levels in the hierarchy of walking needs were discussed. Results are presented in five sections of â€œdensity, crowding and stress during walkingâ€, â€œsense of comfort/discomfort and stress in regard to crowded spaces during walking experiencesâ€, â€œcrowded spaces as insecure public spaces and the contribution of the type of urban configurationâ€, â€œrole of motivational/restorative factors during walking trips to reduce the overload of stress and improve mental healthâ€, and â€œurban design interventions on arrangement of visual sequences during walkingâ€.","Paydar, M.; Fard, A.

"Cross-National Study of Worrying, Loneliness, and Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparison between Individuals with and without Infection in the Family","Objective: The objective of this study was to examine differences in worry, loneliness, and mental health between those individuals infected by COVID-19 or having someone their family infected, and the rest of the population. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Norway, UK, USA, and Australia during April/May 2020. Participants (n = 3810) were recruited via social media postings by the researchers and the involved universities. Differences between those with and without infection in the family were investigated with chi-square tests and independent t-tests. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess associations between sociodemographic variables and psychological outcomes (worry, loneliness, and mental health) in both groups. Results: Compared to their counterparts, participants with infection in the family reported higher levels of worries about themselves (p &lt; 0.05) and their family members (p &lt; 0.001) and had poorer mental health (p &lt; 0.05). However, the effect sizes related to the differences were small. The largest effect (d = 0.24) concerned worries about their immediate family. Poorer psychological outcomes were observed in those who were younger, female, unemployed, living alone and had lower levels of education, yet with small effect sizes. Conclusions: In view of the small differences between those with and without infection, we generally conclude that the mental health effects of the COVID-19 situation are not limited to those who have been infected or have had an infection within the family but extend to the wider population.","Bonsaksen, Tore, Leung, Janni, Schoultz, Mariyana, Thygesen, Hilde, Price, Daicia, Ruffolo, Mary, Geirdal, Amy Ã˜stertun","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9070903","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(7):903, 2021.; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(7):903, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16188,""
"COVID-19 Lockdown Effect on Not Institutionalized Patients with Dementia and Caregivers","SARS-COV-2 is a severe medical condition. Old patients are very vulnerable, but they have been studied only as institutionalized patients. During the lock-down, little attention is dedicated to old, demented patients who lived at home. This study wants to examine their behavioral reactions by video-phone follow-up. We conducted a longitudinal study in subcortical vascular dementia (sVAD) patients. We enrolled 221 sVAD, not institutionalized patients. We divided sVAD patients into low-medium grade sVAD (A) and severe sVAD (B), based on neuroimaging severity degree and executive alterations. At baseline, at the end of lock-down, and two months later, global behavioral symptoms were recorded for each patient. We found significantly higher scores of general behavioral deterioration, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations and apathy after controlling for sVAD severity. The direct consequence was a drastic increment of psychotropic drugs prescribed and employed during the lock-down. Moreover, caregiversâ€™ stress has been evaluated, together with their anxiety and depression levels. During the lock-down, their scores increased and reflected a severe worsening of their behavior. Our data demonstrate that social isolation induces a severe perception of loneliness and abandonment;these fears can exacerbate behavior disturbances in old-aged frail persons. Thus, these can be considered as indirect victims of SARS-COV-2.","Moretti, Rita, Caruso, Paola, GiuffrÃ©, Mauro, Tiribelli, Claudio","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9070893","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(7):893, 2021.; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(7):893, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16189,""
"Variations in Circadian Rhythmicity and Studentsâ€™ Gender-Related Psychological Conditions during the COVID-19 Lockdown","In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic experienced around the world, new student lifestyles have had an impact on their daily behavior. The purpose of this study was to examine post-traumatic stress associated with the initial COVID-19 crisis in students (N = 280) with a mean age of 13 Â± 1.70 and to determine the relationship between their reported daily behaviors in terms of their gender. The study was conducted primarily in Casablanca and Marrakech, the two cities most affected by the pandemic at the time of the study in Morocco in May 2020. Our sample consists of 133 high school students and 147 middle school students, 83.6% of whom are females. Students were asked to answer questions based on an Activity Biorhythm Questionnaire, the Post-Traumatic Stress Scale (Weathers et al., 1993), the Hamilton Scale (Hamilton, 1960), the Worry Domains Questionnaire (Tallis, Eyzenck, Mathews, 1992), and the Visual Analog Scale of Moods (VASM) (Stern et al., 1997). The results obtained confirm that there is a significant relationship between the circadian rhythm of some variables and gender in some activities such as academic study (p &lt; 0.05) and TV and Internet use (p &lt; 0.05) and was highly significant for physical activity (p = 0.001), while others are not significant in relation to other schedules of the same variables or in relation to others. Likewise, for the psychological conditions, significant relationships with mood states and depressive tendencies were confirmed. In lockdown, the studentsâ€™ daily lives underwent changes in circadian rhythm and lifestyle. Therefore, it is necessary to treat their current psychological problems and avoid future complications.","Sabaoui, Ikram, Lotfi, Said, Talbi, Mohammed","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11070355","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Education Sciences; 11(7):355, 2021.; Publication details: Education Sciences; 11(7):355, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16190,""
"Teaching and Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Topic Modeling Study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused significant disruption to teaching and learning activities at all levels. Faculty, students, institutions, and parents have had to rapidly adapt and adopt measures to make the best use of available resources, tools and teaching strategies. While much of the online teaching pedagogies have been theoretically and practically explored to a limited extent, the scale at which these were deployed was unprecedented. This has led a large number of researchers to share challenges, solutions and knowledge gleaned during this period. The main aim of this work was to thematically model the literature related to teaching and learning during, and about, COVID-19. Abstracts and metadata of literature were extracted from Scopus, and topic modeling was used to identify the key research themes. The research encompassed diverse scientific disciplines, including social sciences, computer science, and life sciences, as well as learnings in support systems, including libraries, information technology, and mental health. The following six key themes were identified: (i) the impact of COVID-19 on higher education institutions, and challenges faced by these institutions;(ii) the use of various tools and teaching strategies employed by these institutions;(iii) the teaching and learning experience of schools and school teachers;(iv) the impact of COVID-19 on the training of healthcare workers;(v) the learnings about COVID-19, and treatment strategies from patients;and (vi) the mental health of students as a result of COVID-19 and e-learning. Regardless of the key themes, what stood out was the inequities in education as a result of the digital divide. This has had a huge impact not only in middle- and low-income nations, but also in several parts of the developed world. Several important lessons have been learned, which, no doubt, will be actively incorporated into teaching and learning practices and teacher training. Nonetheless, the full effect of these unprecedented educational adaptions on basic education, expert training, and mental health of all stakeholders is yet to be fully fathomed.","Vijayan, Ranjit","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11070347","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Education Sciences; 11(7):347, 2021.; Publication details: Education Sciences; 11(7):347, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16191,""
"Coping Strategies, Anxiety and Depression in OCD and Schizophrenia: Changes during COVID-19","Background: The main aim was to examine changes in coping strategies, anxiety and depression in obsessiveâ€“compulsive and schizophrenia patients during COVID-19, in addition to controlling the influence of intolerance to uncertainty and experiential avoidance. Method: The first time, the study comprised (15â€“30 April 2020) 293 patients, 113 of whom were diagnosed with obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder, 61 with schizophrenia and 119 healthy controls, aged 13â€“77 years (M = 37.89, SD = 12.65). The second time (15â€“30 November), the study comprised 195 participants (85 obsessiveâ€“compulsive patients, 42 schizophrenic patiens and 77 healthy controls participants). The evaluation was carried out through an online survey. Results: The clinical groups worsened over time in cognitive coping, anxiety and depression, while the control group only worsened in depression. Intergroup differences in anxiety, depression and coping strategies were maintained, highlighting the use of some maladaptive strategies (avoidance, spiritual) in clinical groups. Experiential avoidance and tolerance for uncertainty mainly affected coping. Conclusions: The duration of COVID-19 not only produced changes in anxiety and depression in clinical groups but also in coping strategies to face this pandemic and its consequences.","Rosa-AlcÃ¡zar, Ãngel, Parada-Navas, JosÃ© Luis, GarcÃ­a-HernÃ¡ndez, MarÃ­a Dolores, MartÃ­nez-Murillo, Sergio, Olivares-Olivares, Pablo J.; Rosa-AlcÃ¡zar, Ana I.","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11070926","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(7):926, 2021.; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(7):926, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16192,""
"The Psychosocial Influence of Companion Animals on Positive and Negative Affect during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The initial months of COVID-19 forced people to quickly adapt to dramatic changes to their daily lives. As a result of the inevitable decrease in access to social support available during the lockdown phase of COVID-19, countless individuals relied upon their companion dogs and cats. Given the strong connections people often have with their companion animals, this study hypothesized that companion dogs and cats would positively impact guardiansâ€™ mental health. Anonymous, cross-sectional online surveys were used to test this premise. A total of 5061 responses, primarily females (89%) from the United States (84%), were analyzed. Results suggest that companion animals played a critical role in helping reduce feelings of depression, anxiety, isolation, and loneliness for a majority of pet guardians. Companion animals also helped increase guardiansâ€™ experiences of self-compassion, ability to maintain a regular schedule, feel a sense of purpose and meaning, and cope with uncertainty. This was most pronounced for women under the age of 40 who were highly bonded to their companion animal. In conclusion, our study suggests that a companion dog or cat can buffer the effects of extreme stress and social isolation as witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kogan, Lori R.; Currin-McCulloch, Jennifer, Bussolari, Cori, Packman, Wendy, Erdman, Phyllis","https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11072084","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Animals; 11(7):2084, 2021.; Publication details: Animals; 11(7):2084, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16193,""
"School Professional Needs to Support Student Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","School closures due to COVID-19 left students in Michigan without physical access to school mental health professionals (SMHPs) and other supports typically available in schools. This report examines the needs of SMHPs across Michigan during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and how those needs informed programming and resources provided by a University of Michigan school mental health training and implementation program. In April 2020, a web-based survey asking about student and SMHP mental health was sent to 263 SMHPs who had previously participated in this program. 155 SMHPs (58.9%) responded. Nearly half of SMHPs reported their students' most pressing needs were support for self-care, anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress. Some SMHPs also met screening criteria themselves for depression and/or anxiety. This survey provided an overview of SMHPs' concerns early in the COVID-19 pandemic and drove development of new COVID-19-related resources designed to support SMHPs.","Rusch, A.; Rodriguez-Quintana, N.; Choi, S.

"Exploring the development and maintenance of therapeutic relationships through e-Health support: A narrative analysis of therapist experiences","Objective: Amid COVID-19 disruptions, e-therapy has become even more essential and has rapidly expanded across statutory, private and third sectors to meet growing demands for digital mental health support. A challenge in digital therapeutic care is how to develop and maintain a supportive, collaborative therapeutic relationship, built upon mutual trust and respect;intrinsic values of relationships that are often implied through complex non-verbal cues. Online practitioners are eager to learn how to adapt to online delivery, although platform-specific training is limited. The aim of the current study was to focus upon the therapist experience of online therapeutic relationships with young people, exploring a range of factors through their perspectives, including the impact of anonymity. Methods: Eight e-therapy practitioners were recruited from Kooth, an online mental health service. Narrative interviews undertaken via Skype facilitated reflective conversational one-to-one discussions, based upon the practitionersâ€™ individual experiences, led by the interviewee. Following transcription and anonymisation, a narrative analysis was undertaken to explore participantsâ€™ experiences, perspectives and reflections. Results: Four analytic layers arose from the narratives, which explored the challenging learning experience of translating existing therapeutic skills to online working, rapidly building therapeutic relationships, managing risk in the online therapeutic relationship, and techniques for maintaining a digital therapeutic relationship. Conclusion: The study provides novel insights into the flexibility and adjustments therapists can make to improve online interventions and delivery through the development and maintenance of positive therapeutic relationships. Recommendations are also made in relation to platform-specific training, communicative adaptations, risk management and practitioner support.","Wood, M. J.; Wilson, H. M. N.; Parry, S.

"Vitamin D in the time of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic â€“ a clinical review from a public health and public mental health perspective","Individuals with serious mental disorders (SMD) may have a higher risk of vitamin D (VIT-D) deficiency. They also experience higher mortality because of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Therefore, we have conducted a comprehensive review to examine the significance of VIT-D for public health and public mental health during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This review had three specific aims, from a global perspective to (a) create a profile of VIT-D and review the epidemiology of VIT-D deficiency, (b) explore VIT-D deficiency as risk factor for SMD and COVID-19 infections and (c) examine the effectiveness of VIT-D supplementation for both conditions. We found that, in terms of SMD, the evidence from laboratory and observational studies points towards some association between VIT-D deficiency and depression or schizophrenia. Mendelian randomisation studies, however, suggest no, or reverse, causality. The evidence from intervention studies is conflicting. Concerning COVID-19 infection, on proof of principle, VIT-D could provide a plausible defence against the infection itself and against an adverse clinical course. But data from observational studies and the first preliminary intervention studies remain conflicting, with stronger evidence that VIT-D may mitigate the clinical course of COVID-19 infection rather than the risk of infection in the first place. From a public health and public mental health point of view, based on the currently limited knowledge, for individuals with SMD, the benefits of VIT-D optimisation through supplementation seem to outweigh the risks. VIT-D supplementation, however, should not substitute for vaccination or medical care for COVID-19 infection.","Werneke, U.; Gaughran, F.; Taylor, D.

"Effects of Covid-19 lockdown on parental functioning in vulnerable families","Abstract Objective The aim of this study was to increase the knowledge about how the initial Covid-19 lockdown influenced parental functioning in vulnerable families. Background The Covid-19 pandemic has caused major changes to family life. Using a natural experiment design can potentially adjudicate on former inconclusive findings about the effects of lockdown on parental functioning in vulnerable families. Method Responses from parents in a sample of potentially vulnerable families in Norway were divided into a lockdown group if participating at baseline and during the initial Covid-19 lockdown (nÂ =Â 820 responses) or into a control group if participating at baseline and before lockdown (nÂ =Â 1368 responses). Mixed model regression analyses were used to mimic a wait-list design investigating direct lockdown effects on mental health, parenting stress, and three aspects of interparental conflicts, as well as moderation effects. Results The lockdown group showed significantly higher levels of parenting stress compared with the control group, but no aversive lockdown effect on mental health or destructive conflicts were found. In fact, decreased levels of verbal aggression and child involvement in conflict were found during lockdown among parents living apart. Pre-existing financial problems and conflict levels, age of youngest child, and parent gender did not moderate the lockdown effects. Conclusion The initial lockdown did not seem to adversely affect parental functioning, beyond increased parenting stress. Caution should be taken when generalizing the findings as child effects and long-term lockdown effects were not investigated.","Helland, Maren Sand, Lyngstad, Torkild Hovde, Holt, Tonje, Larsen, Linda, RÃ¸ysamb, Espen","https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12789","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Journal of Marriage and Family; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Marriage and Family; n/a(n/a), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16197,""
"Increased depression was the main impact of COVID-19 lockdown in Australian fibromyalgia patients","Objective: To gauge the impact of severe COVID-19 related lockdown restrictions on the mental and physical wellbeing of Australian fibromyalgia patients. Design/Setting/Participants: Telephone or online surveys were conducted with sequential patients from a single Australian tertiary centre specialist fibromyalgia clinic during October 2020 when Melbourne was in enforced stage 4 lockdown. Patients were invited to participate if they had been seen in the 6 months prior to lockdown and had recorded illness impact data from that visit. There was a 73% response rate. Outcome measures: Demographic and clinical information was collected. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (Revised Version) (FIQR) was used to assess current fibromyalgia illness impact. The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression symptoms. Results: 50 responses were received. Most patients reported increased isolation, decreased exercise, worse sleep and increased use of fibromyalgia-related medications. 25 (50%) of patients had a PHQ-9 score = 15, with 20 patients (40%) reporting moderately-severe and 5 patients (10%) reporting severe depression. No significant difference was found between pre-lockdown and during lockdown FIQR total score but there were trends for worse pain, fatigue and sleep (mean time interval 12.2 Â± 0.28 months). The mean FIQR sub-score for depression was significantly elevated during the COVID lockdown (5.98 Â± 2.63) compared to previously (5.28 Â± 3.22) (p=0.048). Conclusion: Severe COVID-19 related lockdown restrictions in Melbourne in 2020 resulted in significantly worse reported features of depression. Other clinical aspects of fibromyalgia were not measured to be significantly different from previously reported levels.","Worcester, B.; Guymer, E.; Littlejohn, G.","https://doi.org/10.1111/imj.15302","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Internal Medicine Journal; 51(SUPPL 2):13-14, 2021.; Publication details: Internal Medicine Journal; 51(SUPPL 2):13-14, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16198,""
"The Radmis trial-smartphones for real-time treatment in bipolar disorder","Due to the limited access to treatment facilities, during recent years, and especially emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic and log-down, there has been a rapid increase in the international interest in the potential and importance of advancing the use of various mHealth technologies for both monitoring and treatment within mental health. The MONARCA I and II trials investigating the effect of daily smartphone-based treatment were negative but suggested that smartphone-based monitoring may increase the quality of life and reduce perceived stress in bipolar disorder (BD). The present RADMIS trial was the first to investigate the effect of smartphone-based monitoring on the rate and duration of readmissions in BD. This was a randomized controlled single-blind parallel-group trial. Patients with BD (ICD-10) discharged from hospitalization in the Mental Health Services, Capital Region of Denmark were randomized 1:1 to daily smartphone-based monitoring including a feedback loop (+ standard treatment) or to standard treatment for 6-months. Primary outcomes: the rate and duration of psychiatric readmissions. Results will be presented and discussed at the conference.

"Navigating the implementation of a behavioral intervention RCT for prisoners with bipolar disorders during a global pandemic: Lessons learned from project CARE","Background: Individuals with bipolar disorders (BD) are 5x more likely to be arrested, jailed, or convicted of a criminal offense than those in the general population. BD, in turn, increases risk for adverse outcomes for prisoners post-release, including mood instability, suicide attempts, substance use relapse, and repeat incarceration. Despite these negative sequelae, up to 70% of prisoners with BD do not receive mental health treatment following re-entry. Methods: To address this critical need, we have been piloting the CARE (Community treatment Adherence at Re-Entry) Program, a hybrid in-person/ telephone-based intervention that combines cognitive-behavioral, family, and telephone outreach strategies to promote treatment engagement for prisoners with BD following community re-entry. Results: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we successfully completed an open feasibility trial (N = 12). At the time of the prison lockdown, 11 (out of 40) individuals had been enrolled in the ongoing pilot RCT of CARE vs. TAU, necessitating adjustments to the study protocol so as to safely and ethically retain participants during the pandemic. Other adjustments were made to recruitment and assessment of new participants, given the unique ethical and practical considerations regarding use of telehealth services in the prison setting. Discussion: We will compare and contrast our clinical, operational, and regulatory experiences prior to and during the pandemic, with respect to implementation of this clinical trial to support prisoners with BD around community re-entry.","Weinstock, L.","https://doi.org/10.1111/bdi.13085","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Bipolar Disorders; 23(SUPPL 1):13-14, 2021.; Publication details: Bipolar Disorders; 23(SUPPL 1):13-14, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16200,""
"Reconfiguring the prevention of underage alcohol and drug use on California Indian reservations: Pandemic responses","Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted rural American Indian populations disproportionately in terms of elevated infection rates, economic hardship and psychosocial stressors. As Kirsch et al. (2020), Dumas et al. (2020) and others have noted, social distancing efforts to contain the spread of the virus exacerbate risk factors for substance use in youth, including social isolation, boredom and depression. Historical trauma, socioeconomic inequalities and geographic isolation already challenge Tribal-community-partnered interventions to reduce and prevent underage substance use in rural California Native communities. We describe innovative ways one program addressed the additional challenges of pandemic conditions. Methods and Data: Tribal clinic providers and partnering research scientist met weekly to design, implement, and evaluate a multilevel intervention which combined clinic-based behavioral programs to reduce individual demand for alcohol and other drugs with community-based environmental strategies to reduce social supply of alcohol and other drugs. Research staff meetings were recorded in written logs. Using an extended case study approach, we conducted thematic review of weekly activity logs for the period of March through December 2020. Results: Recurring themes included responding to community emergency concerns, leveraging prior relationships, and creatively expanding technological capabilities while adhering to the underlying model of the multilevel intervention. Staff participated in drive-through medication pick-ups, virtual and drive-through events promoting resources and mental health as well as informal wellness checks with community partners and study participants through virtual outreach. The intervention's clinic component was shifted from in-person to online meetings on a secure web-based platform using Tribal IRB-approved digital signatures for parental consent and youth assent. The environmental prevention component enhanced educational messaging in lieu of in-person presentations. Conclusions: Transitioning to virtual intervention activities to reduce underage drinking and drug use among American Indian youth facilitated deeper relationship-building within the community. Expanded technology applications enabled the project to continue serving remote communities. These innovations present novel ways for clinics serving rural, reservation-dwelling, Tribal youth to treat, reduce, and prevent underage substance use and other tribal health disparities in the time of a pandemic health emergency and otherwise.","Moore, R.

"Greater benefits of flash glucose monitoring in patients where occupation is a barrier to self-monitored blood glucose testing","Background and Aims: Our centre commenced use of Flash Glucose Monitoring system Freestyle Libre(FSL) within NHS for the first time in the spring of 2019. This retrospective real life study aimed to examine the impact of FSL on glycaemic control at the end of 6 months of FSL use. Methods: Patients attending the centre for their routine diabetes care were assessed against the eligibility criteria set out and adapted by the local health authority. Each patient had HbA1c at baseline and 6 months after FSL initiation. Results: A total of 208(n) patients were provided with FSL between May & October 2019.Mean age and duration of diabetes (SD) was 39.7 Â± 16.1 and 19.1 Â± 14.6 respectively. Less than a third was DAFNE trained. Majority were on basal bolus insulin regimen (73%) followed by insulin pump therapy (21%).Most common indication for FSL were occupation (30%), psychosocial (18%) & hypoglycaemia(14.4%). 6 month review was not possible in 91(n) due to COVID19 & missed appointments. Overall paired mean HbA1c improved significantly at 6months compared to baseline (71.7 Â± 1.9 & 68.1 Â± 1.7,p &lt;0.001). The improvement was seen most in occupational category (73.9 Â± 2.7 &68.0 Â± 2.6,p &lt;0.001) with 66% achieving improved HbA1c followed by psychosocial category (89.1 Â± 5.9 & 82.8 Â± 5.4,p 0.016).Time in Range (TIR) was significantly higher in those who scanned FSL =8/day vs &lt;8scan /day (34.7 Â± 1.9 & 25.9 Â± 2.0,p0.002). Conclusions: This real life study demonstrates that FSL will help achieve better glycaemic control particularly in those where occupation is the barrier to routine finger prick test. Furthermore, people with significant mental health do also benefit from the FSL.","Gaur, S.; Phyoe, A.; Brown, F.; Elliott, M.; Neupane, S.","https://doi.org/10.1089/dia.2021.2525.abstracts","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics; 23(SUPPL 2):A117, 2021.; Publication details: Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics; 23(SUPPL 2):A117, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16203,""
"COVID-19 lockdown: Impact on college students' lives","Objective: In light of COVID-19, leaders issued stay-at-home orders, including closure of higher-education schools. Most students left campus, likely impacting their employment and social network. Leaders are making decisions about opening universities and modality of instruction. Understanding students' psychological, physiological, academic, and financial responses to the shut-down and reopening of campuses can help leaders make informed decisions. Participants: 654 students from a large western university enrolled during the pandemic shutdown. Methods: Students were invited via email to complete an online survey. Results: Students reported stress, depression, loneliness, lack of motivation, difficulty focusing on schoolwork, restless sleep, appetite changes, job loss concerns, and difficulties coping. Most wanted to return to campus and felt social/physical distancing was effective but were mixed in terms of testing or masks. Conclusions: Moving to remote learning created physical and psychological stress. Students want to return to campus but do not want to take risk-reducing measures.","Birmingham, W. C.; Wadsworth, L.

"The Impact of Domestic and Global Risk Factors on Turkish Stock Market: Evidence from the NARDL Approach","The study investigates the short-run and long-run asymmetric effects of the global economic policy uncertainty, real oil prices, and country-specific geopolitical risk on real stock returns in Turkey by using the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) framework over the pre-COVID-19 period of 1997:01-2019:12 and full-sample period of 1997:01-2020:12. The empirical findings indicate the following results. Firstly, global economic policy uncertainty leads to depress real stock returns for both sample periods. Secondly, negative real oil price changes, in the long run, have relatively greater effects compare to positive changes on real stock returns, whereas positive oil price changes affect negatively in the short-run for the full-sample period. Thirdly, the country-specific geopolitical risk exerts positive effects on the real stock returns in the long run for both periods. The overall results suggest that the Turkish real stock returns react more to the bad news caused by the global factors than the domestic one.","Erdogan, L.; Ceylan, R.; Abdul-Rahman, M.","https://doi.org/10.1080/1540496x.2021.1949282","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Emerging Markets Finance and Trade;: 14, 2021.; Publication details: Emerging Markets Finance and Trade;: 14, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16205,""
"Mental disorders and risk of COVID-19-related mortality, hospitalisation, and intensive care unit admission: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Summary Background Mental disorders might be a risk factor for severe COVID-19. We aimed to assess the specific risks of COVID-19-related mortality, hospitalisation, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission associated with any pre-existing mental disorder, and specific diagnostic categories of mental disorders, and exposure to psychopharmacological drug classes. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Web of Science, Cochrane, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases between Jan 1, 2020, and March 5, 2021, for original studies reporting data on COVID-19 outcomes in patients with psychiatric disorders compared with controls. We excluded studies with overlapping samples, studies that were not peer-reviewed, and studies written in languages other than English, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese. We modelled random-effects meta-analyses to estimate crude odds ratios (OR) for mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection as the primary outcome, and hospitalisation and ICU admission as secondary outcomes. We calculated adjusted ORs for available data. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic, and publication bias was tested with Egger regression and visual inspection of funnel plots. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall strength of the evidence and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale to assess study quality. We also did subgroup analyses and meta-regressions to assess the effects of baseline COVID-19 treatment setting, patient age, country, pandemic phase, quality assessment score, sample sizes, and adjustment for confounders. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021233984. Findings 841 studies were identified by the systematic search, of which 33 studies were included in the systematic review and 23 studies in the meta-analysis, comprising 1 469 731 patients with COVID-19, of whom 43 938 had mental disorders. The sample included 130 807 females (8Â·9% of the whole sample) and 130 373 males (8Â·8%). Nine studies provided data on patient race and ethnicity, and 22 studies were rated as high quality. The presence of any mental disorder was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (OR 2Â·00 [95% CI 1Â·58â€“2Â·54];I2=92Â·66%). This association was also observed for psychotic disorders (2Â·05 [1Â·37â€“3Â·06];I2=80Â·81%), mood disorders (1Â·99 [1Â·46â€“2Â·71];I2=68Â·32%), substance use disorders (1Â·76 [1Â·27â€“2Â·44];I2=47Â·90%), and intellectual disabilities and developmental disorders (1Â·73 [1Â·29â€“2Â·31];I2=90Â·15%) but not for anxiety disorders (1Â·07 [0Â·73â€“1Â·56];I2=11Â·05%). COVID-19 mortality was associated with exposure to antipsychotics (3Â·71 [1Â·74â€“7Â·91];I2=90Â·31%), anxiolytics (2Â·58 [1Â·22â€“5Â·44];I2=96Â·42%), and antidepressants (2Â·23 [1Â·06â€“4Â·71];I2=95Â·45%). For psychotic disorders, mood disorders, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics, the association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, and other confounders. Mental disorders were associated with increased risk of hospitalisation (2Â·24 [1Â·70â€“2Â·94];I2=88Â·80%). No significant associations with mortality were identified for ICU admission. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions showed significant associations of baseline COVID-19 treatment setting (p=0Â·013) and country (p&lt;0Â·0001) with mortality. No significant associations with mortality were identified for other covariates. No evidence of publication bias was found. GRADE assessment indicated high certainty for crude mortality and hospitalisation, and moderate certainty for crude ICU admission. Interpretation Pre-existing mental disorders, in particular psychotic and mood disorders, and exposure to antipsychotics and anxiolytics were associated with COVID-19 mortality in both crude and adjusted models. Although further research is required to determine the underlying mechanisms, our findings highlight the need for targeted approaches to manage and prevent COVID-19 in at-risk patient groups identified in this study.

"Suffering, Mental Health, and Psychological Well-being During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study of US Adults with Chronic Health Conditions","Suffering has been a topic of considerable discussion in the fields of medicine and palliative care, yet few studies have reported causal evidence linking the experience of suffering to health and well-being. In this three-wave prospective cohort study, we explore the potential psychological implications of suffering during the COVID-19 pandemic by examining relations among suffering, mental health, and psychological well-being in a sample of U.S. adults living with chronic health conditions. We analyzed data from nÂ =Â 184 participants who completed assessments one month before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (February 2020) and then two months (April 2020) and four months later (May/June 2020). Analyses controlled for a range of factors, including sociodemographic characteristics, physical health, religious/spiritual factors, psychological characteristics, and prior values of the predictor and each of the outcomes assessed one month before the COVID-19 pandemic. Results of the primary analysis indicated that greater overall suffering assessed one month into the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with lower psychological well-being (ÃŸÂ =Â -.17, 95% CI: -.29, -.05) and higher levels of anxiety (ÃŸÂ =Â .27, 95% CI: .13, .41) and depression (ÃŸÂ =Â .16, 95% CI: .03, .29) two months later. In a secondary analysis that explored anxiety, depression, and psychological well-being as candidate antecedents of suffering, depression assessed one month into the COVID-19 pandemic was most strongly associated with worse overall suffering two months later. We highlight the implications of the findings for high-risk populations who are suffering amidst the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Potential benefits of both integrating assessments of suffering into screening procedures and addressing experiences of suffering in mental health service settings are discussed.","Cowden, Richard G.; Davis, Edward B.; Counted, Victor, Chen, Ying, Rueger, Sandra Y.; VanderWeele, Tyler J.; Lemke, Austin W.; Glowiak, Kevin J.; Worthington, Everett L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wss.2021.100048","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Wellbeing, Space and Society;: 100048, 2021.; Publication details: Wellbeing, Space and Society;: 100048, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16207,""
"Sleep disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic: An investigation of AIAN, Asian, Black, Latinx, and White young adults","Objectives This study investigates race-related disparities in sleep duration and quality among diverse young adults during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Design & setting Online cross-sectional study of young adults in the United States in April 2020. Participants About 547 American Indian/Alaskan Native (AIAN), Asian, Black, Latinx, and White young adults ages 18-25 years. Measurements Participants completed measures of sleep duration and quality, coronavirus victimization distress, depression, age, sex/gender, employment status, essential worker status, student status, residential region, socioeconomic status, concerns about contracting coronavirus and CDC health risks. Results Black young adults reported the largest disparity in sleep duration and quality. For sleep duration, AIAN, Asian, White, and Latinx young adults reported approximately one additional hour of sleep compared to Black respondents. Mediation analyses suggest that disparities in sleep duration between Asian and Black young adults may be explained by the higher likelihood of Black respondents being essential workers. For sleep quality, Latinx, White, AIAN, and Asian young adults reported higher levels than Black respondents. Including coronavirus victimization distress as an intervening pathway decreased the effect for Asian and White respondents on sleep quality, suggesting that coronavirus victimization distress partially explains Black and Asian, as well as Black and White differences in sleep quality. Conclusions Black young adults reported the shortest sleep duration and lowest levels of sleep quality relative to AIAN, Asian, Latinx and White peers. Interpersonal experiences of coronavirus victimization and structural inequities may partially explain disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yip, Tiffany, Feng, Ye, Fowle, Jillianne, Fisher, Celia B.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2021.05.008","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Sleep Health;2021.; Publication details: Sleep Health;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16208,""

It is noteworthy that the associations between COVID-19 related experiences and typical mental symptoms among pregnant women remain unclear. A cross-sectional online survey among pregnant women was conducted in Shenzhen, China. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied to explore the associations of COVID-19 related experiences with anxiety and depression symptoms during pregnancy. Totally, 751 pregnant women were enrolled. Lower prevalence of anxiety and depression was observed among older individuals: 17.2%, 12.3%, and 6.7% for anxiety symptom;40.0%, 35.3%, and 24.6% for depression symptom, respectively in age &lt;30 years, 30 to 34 years, and =35 years groups. COVID-19 related experiences that associated with the anxiety and depression symptoms among pregnant women included uncertainty or recognition of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases around, subjective moderate or high risk of being infected, severe life impact, moderate or severe psychological impact, and spending more than one hour in COVID-19 related news. In the post-pandemic era, the psychological strain imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic is urgently needed to be alleviated among pregnant women.

"COVID-19 y adultos mayores con deterioro cognitivo: Â¿puede influir el aislamiento social en la enfermedad?","Resumen IntroducciÃ³n y Objetivo: En Argentina, la calidad del cuidado que los adultos mayores con cuadros crÃ³nicos de deterioro cognitivo reciben esta siendo afectada por la pandemia de COVID-19. Nuestro objetivo fue estudiar en quÃ© medida la cuarentena afectÃ³ el bienestar y los sÃ­ntomas conductuales de sujetos con demencia que viven en la comunidad y sus cuidadores luego de las 8 semanas iniciales de aislamiento obligatorio. MÃ©todos: Familiares de 119 pacientes con Demencia tipo Alzheimer (DTA) o trastornos relacionados que viven en la comunidad fueron invitados a participar de forma anÃ³nima y voluntaria de una encuesta exploratoria, de tipo transversal o sincrÃ³nica, y con formato electrÃ³nico. Se utilizÃ³ estadÃ­stica descriptiva y el test de chi cuadrado con un valor de significancia de p&lt;0.05 para analizar las diferencias segÃºn la severidad de la demencia. Resultados: La edad media de los sujetos con demencia fue 81.16 (Â± 7.03), 35% tenÃ­an &gt;85. El 67% tenÃ­a DTA y el 26% demencia mixta. El 34.5% tenÃ­an demencia leve, 32% moderada, 33% severa. En el 67 % de los casos, el cuidador principal era familiar. Se observÃ³ un aumento de ansiedad (43%), insomnio (28%), depresiÃ³n (29%), empeoramiento de la marcha (41%) y aumento del uso de psicofÃ¡rmacos. La frecuencia de sÃ­ntomas conductuales fue mayor en sujetos con demencia leve (p&lt;0.05). En casi todos los casos la rehabilitaciÃ³n fue suspendida durante la cuarentena. Hubo un aumento significativo de la sobrecarga del cuidador durante la pandemia (t= -8.657, p&lt;0.001). Conclusiones: Tanto los sujetos con demencia que viven en la comunidad como sus cuidadores mostraron un empeoramiento de su bienestar y estado de salud durante la pandemia de COVID-19, debido a una combinaciÃ³n multifactorial de aislamiento social, ausencia de rehabilitaciÃ³n, aumento del estrÃ©s del cuidador, miedo de contraer la enfermedad entre otras causas. Es necesario desarrollar un plan de acciÃ³n coordinado y urgente que involucre a las familias de los pacientes, las autoridades sanitarias y el personal de salud que habitualmente atiende a estos pacientes para mitigar el impacto negativo de la cuarentena y epidemia en la salud de los sujetos con demencia que viven en la comunidad. Introduction: In Argentina, the quality of care that elderly subjects with dementia living in the community received has been deeply affected by COVID-19 epidemic. Our objective was to study to what extend mandatory quarantine imposed due to COVID-19 had affected behavioral symptoms in subjects with dementia after the first 8 weeks of quarantine. Methods: Relatives of 119 patients with Alzheimer-type Dementia or related disorders living in the community were invited to participate anonymously and voluntarily in an exploratory, cross-sectional and synchronous survey. Characteristics of people with dementia and their caregivers were analyzed with descriptive statistics using the chi-square tests, p &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Mean age: 81.16 (Â±7.03), 35% of the subjects had more than 85 years of age. Diagnosis were 67% AlzheimerÂ´s dementia and 26% mixed AlzheimerÂ´s disease. Stages were 34.5% mild cases, 32% intermediate stage, and 33% severe cases as per Clinical dementia Rating score. In 67% of the sample, a family member was the main caregiver. Important findings were increased anxiety (43% of the sample), insomnia (28% of the subjects), depression (29%), worsening gait disturbance (41%), and increase use of psychotropics to control behavioral symptoms. Behavioral symptoms were more prevalent in subjects with mild dementia compared to subjects with severe dementia. Rehabilitation services had been discontinued in most subjects due to the quarantine. COVID-19 confinement increased stress caregiver (t= -8.657, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: We concluded from our analysis that during COVID-19 epidemic there was a deterioration of behavioral symptoms in our population of elderly dementia subjects living in the community. Perhaps, our findings are related to a combination of social isolation, lack of outpatient rehabilitation services, and increased stress of family caregivers. It is necessary to develop a plan of action to help dementia subjects deal with the increased stress that this epidemic imposed on them.","Russo, MarÃ­a Julieta, Cohen, Gabriela, Campos, Jorge, Allegri, Ricardo F.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuarg.2021.06.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: NeurologÃ­a Argentina;2021.; Publication details: NeurologÃ­a Argentina;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16211,""
"Role of Ayurveda and Yoga-Based lifestyle in the COVID-19 Pandemic â€“ A Narrative Review","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an immense challenge to health care systems around the globe in terms of limited health care facilities and proven medical therapeutics to address the symptoms of the infection. The current health care strategies have primarily focused on either the pathogen on the environmental factors. However, efforts towards strengthening the host immunity are important from public health perspective to prevent the spread of infection and downregulate the potency of the agent. While a vaccine can induce specific immunity in the host, non-specific ways of improving overall host immunity are the need. This scenario has paved the way for the use of traditional Indian therapies such as Ayurveda and Yoga. This review aims at collating available evidence on Ayurveda, Yoga and COVID-19. Further, it draws inferences from recent studies on Yoga and Ayurveda on immunity, respiratory health and mental health respectively to approximate its probable role in prophylaxis and as an add-on management option for the current pandemic.","Umesh, Chikkanna, Ramakrishna, Kishore Kumar, Jasti, Nishitha, Bhargav, Hemant, Varambally, Shivarama","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2021.07.009","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16212,""
"Suicide attempts among college students hospitalized for COVID-19","ABSTRACT Background Suicide is the second leading cause of death among U.S. college students. Past pandemics have been linked to increases in suicide risk, but little is known about how suicide risk relates to COVID-19 symptoms or hospitalizations. Methods We analyzed data from the Fall cohort of the 2020-2021 Healthy Minds Study, a cross-sectional, web-based survey of undergraduate and graduate students in the U.S. (N=16,315). Logistic regression was used to test for associations between COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and symptoms severity, and suicide-related outcomes. Results Suicidal ideation was reported by n=2190 (13.4%), plans by n=885 (5.4%), and attempts by n=209 (1.3%). The prevalence of each suicide-related outcome measure was greater among those reporting COVID-19 symptoms/diagnosis and among those with greater COVID-19 symptom severity, with a drastically greater prevalence of suicide attempts among those who were hospitalized for COVID-19, odds ratio (95% confidence interval)Â =Â 9.43 (3.87-22.95). Among respondents with suicidal ideation, 53.8% of those hospitalized for COVID-19 also made a suicide attempt, compared to 8.9% of non-infected respondents with past-year ideation. Limitations Limitations include the use of cross-sectional data and retrospective self-report measures, which may be subject to recall biases. The response rate was low but typical of online surveys conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions Hospitalization for COVID-19 may be an underestimated risk factor for suicide attempts. While mechanisms remain unclear, these data suggest that college students hospitalized for COVID should be screened for suicidal thoughts and behaviors subsequent to discharge, particularly if they have pre-existing suicidal ideation.","DeVylder, Jordan, Zhou, Sasha, Oh, Hans","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.07.058","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16213,""
"The long psychological shadow of COVID-19 upon healthcare workers: A global concern for action","Introduction : The outbreak of COVID-19 has posed unprecedented psychological pressure upon every National Health Service in the world. In Piedmont, one of the most affected areas in Italy, 4550 healthcare workers were assessed online in May-June 2020, after the acute outbreak of March-April 2020, that compelled the Italian government to enforce, what was then, the first total lockdown in the Western world. Methods : Socio-demographic information of healthcare workers was gathered along with responses to: General Anxiety Disorder-7, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Beck Depression Inventory-II, Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire. Information about the need for psychological support was also gathered. Results : The regression models predicted the presence of moderate to severe symptoms for all the conditions assessed. Almost half of healthcare workers presented at least one clinically relevant symptom, and among them one in every four expressed the need of receiving psychological support. Conclusions : Evidence calls for an increase of psychological services within the National Health System in Italy so as to guarantee for healthcare workers the psychological support necessary to cope with the long shadow of COVID-19, whose long-term impact is likely to reveal itself more strongly the more the acute stage of it is passed. Limitations : The assessment of the psychological symptoms was performed without knowing the life and professional situations of the sample, and their medical records. Healthcare workers from only one region in Italy were involved, and some professionals (e.g. self-employed healthcare workers) were not included.","Zara, Georgia, Settanni, Michele, Zuffranieri, Marco, Veggi, Sara, Castelli, Lorys","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.07.056","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16214,""
"The Mental Impact of Digital Divide due to COVID-19 Pandemic Induced Emergency Online Learning at Undergraduate Level: Evidence from Undergraduate Students from Dhaka City","Background COVID-19 outbreak has drawn out institutions to closure with several challenges for university students of undergraduate level in Dhaka city including an emergency shift from traditional learning to online learning, which associated digital divide, left several arguments in response to technological inefficiency, pedagogic inefficiency of teachers, inappropriate study environment and so on. Previous literature shows that the COVID-19 is imposing a threat to mental health all over the nation since its spread. This study intended to evaluate the emerging reasons for psychological distress among university students of undergraduate level in Dhaka, also assess the execution methods, barriers of online learning, and lastly, the attitudes of students regarding online learning throughout the pandemic. Methods A mixed methodology was used to conduct the research. Primary data has been collected using simple purposive sampling on 180 undergraduate students, 9 interviews were taken including 6 in-depth interviews of different university undergraduates from Dhaka city and also 3 (KIIs) from specialists of pedagogy and medical anthropology, and a high official from Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC). Results Based on the Kessler K-10 distress scale, the study found that the prevalence of no psychological distress (16.67%) followed by mild (40%), moderate (30.56%), and severe psychological distress (12.78%).

"Network Analysis of Physical and Psychiatric Symptoms of Hospital Discharged Patients Infected with COVID-19","In the current study, we aimed to investigate the network structure of COVID-19 symptoms and its related psychiatric symptoms, using a network approach. Specifically, we examined how COVID-19 symptoms relate to psychiatric symptoms and highlighted potential pathways between COVID-19 severity and psychiatric symptoms. With a sample of six hundred seventy-five recovered COVID-19 patients recruited 1 month after hospital discharge, we respectively integrated COVID-19 symptoms with PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms and analyzed the three network structures. In all three networks, COVID-19 severity and ICU admission are not linked directly to COVID-19 symptoms after hospitalization, while COVID-19 severity (but not ICU admission) is linked directly to one or more psychiatric symptoms. Specific pathways between COVID-19 symptoms and psychiatric symptoms were discussed. Finally, we used directed acyclic graph estimation to show potential causal effects between COVID-19 related variables and demographic characteristics.","Liu, Dong, Epskamp, Sacha, Isvoranu, Adela-Maria, Chen, Caixia, Liu, Wenjun, Hong, Xinyi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.07.043","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16216,""
"The changes of suicidal ideation status among young people in Hong Kong during COVID-19: A longitudinal survey","Background : Pandemics affect the physical and mental well-being of all potentially at-risk young people globally. This longitudinal study examines changes of suicidal ideation status among adolescents during COVID-19. Method : A follow-up after nine-months of a school-based survey among 1,491 secondary school students was conducted during COVID-19. Psychological well-being, psychological factors, family support, and COVID-19-related experiences were examined. Results : The prevalence of suicidal ideation were 24% and 21% among the participants before and during COVID-19, respectively. In particular, 897 (65.0%) remained non-suicidal, 193 (14.0%) recovered from being suicidal, 148 (10.7%) newly reported being suicidal, and 143 (10.4%) remained suicidal. Respondents who remained suicidal were found to have significantly higher depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness, and social anxiety, fixed mindset, lower meaning of life and self-control;and lower parental support and supervision than the other three groups. Participants with suicidal ideation reported more negative perceptions about COVID-19 than non-suicidal participants. Multinomial logistic regression showed that anxiety, trait anxiety and life satisfactory in baseline were associated with suicidal ideation at follow-up. Limitation : This study was limited by the small number of protective variables being included in the baseline survey to examine the potential reasons for the recovery of suicidal ideation at follow-up. Conclusion : Poor psychological well-being, lower level of family support, and negative impacts of the pandemic were consistently associated with studentsâ€™ presence of suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Further intervention studies are needed to examine effects of mental health consequences of COVID-19 on youth mental health and to promote positive youth well-being.","Zhu, Shimin, Zhuang, Yanqiong, Lee, Paul, Wong, Paul W.

"The network of stress-related states and depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown","ABSTRACT Background : The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the social distancing protocols used to impede the spread of the virus may have severe mental health consequences. The purpose of this study was to investigate the network of components of pandemic-related negative psychological states (i.e., fear of infection, financial worries, loneliness) and symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Methods : Data from 10,061 Norwegian adults recruited through an online survey during a period of strict social distancing protocols were analyzed by cross-sectional network methods. Results : Of the infection fears, fear of being infected, fear of dying from the coronavirus and fear of significant others dying from it had notable connections to the GAD symptoms anxiety and/or fear of awful events. The financial worry component worry about personal economy was connected to the MDD symptom sleep problems and to the GAD symptom generalized worry. Each of the loneliness components was connected to a specific MDD symptom. Depressed mood, low energy and worthlessness had the highest strength centrality among the MDD symptoms;generalized worry, uncontrollability of worry, and trouble relaxing among the GAD symptoms;fear of dying from the virus among the fear of infection components;and feeling isolated among the loneliness components. Limitations : Random sampling was not conducted, although the sample turned out to be relatively representative of the Norwegian population. Conclusions : Some components of the pandemic-related distressing states of fear of infection, financial worry and loneliness seem to be associated with specific symptoms of MDD and GAD.","Hoffart, Asle, Johnson, Sverre Urnes, Ebrahimi, Omid V.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.07.019","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16218,""
"â€œCrisis management in the hospitality sector SMEs in Pakistan during COVID-19â€","The COVID-19 pandemic has delivered one of the worst economic shocks in modern history and the hospitality sector has been severely affected. Since small businesses from the hospitality sector are known to be relatively more susceptible to the economic complications arising from a crisis, we explore the underlying factors and management practices that influence their continuity of operations as they continue to struggle with the on-going COVID-19 crisis in Pakistan. Using a phenomenological approach, in-depth interviews were conducted to comprehend the experiences of owners-managers. The findings show that government support, cordial relationships with stakeholders, self-determination of entrepreneurs and formal planning are the most crucial factors that shaped the immediate adjustments of operational activities in response to COVID-19. These resilient practices are hygiene concerns, increased promotion through social media, innovative marketing practices (e.g., revised offerings), operational cost-cutting and employee training to comply with changing standard operating procedures from the government and industry. The practical and theoretical implications are also discussed.","Burhan, Muhammad, Salam, Muhammad Talha, Hamdan, Omar Abou, Tariq, Hussain","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhm.2021.103037","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: International Journal of Hospitality Management;: 103037, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Hospitality Management;: 103037, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16219,""

"Health and healthcare for people with disabilities in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background While emerging evidence shows increased mortality from COVID-19 among people with disability, evidence regarding whether there are disability-related inequalities in health during the pandemic is lacking. Objective This study compares access to COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 related health care and mental health of people with and without disability. Methods Longitudinal analysis of 12,703 adults (16â€“64 years) who participated in W9 (2017â€“2019) and the April and/or May COVID-19 special surveys of the UK Understanding Society study. Descriptive analyses and Poisson regression (adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity and financial stress) were conducted to estimate associations between disability (measured at Wave 9) and a number of different COVID-19-related health and health care outcomes (COVID-19 symptoms, testing and hospitalisation), mental health and loneliness, and non-COVID-19 related health care (e.g. outpatient and inpatient hospital care, prescription medications). Results Results from the fully-adjusted regression models found that people with disability were more likely: to be hospitalised if symptomatic (adjusted PRR 3.0 95% 1.07â€“8.43);to experience current symptoms of psychological distress (PRR 1.15, 95% CI 1.05â€“1.26) and to report being lonely (PRR 1.75, 95% CI 1.46â€“2.09) compared to non-disabled people. People with disability reported much higher levels of comorbidities than people without disability. However, inability to access health care and treatment were similar. Conclusions As the UK opens up, it is important that health care services and social policy address the poor mental health and social isolation of people with disability so that the inequalities occurring early in the pandemic do not become further entrenched.","Kavanagh, Anne, Hatton, Chris, Stancliffe, Roger J.; Aitken, Zoe, King, Tania, Hastings, Richard, Totsika, Vaso, Llewellyn, Gwynnyth, Emerson, Eric","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101171","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Disability and Health Journal;: 101171, 2021.; Publication details: Disability and Health Journal;: 101171, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16221,""
"The effectiveness of psychological interventions for loneliness: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Chronic loneliness is associated with a range of mental health difficulties. Previous theory and research indicate that psychological interventions show promise for reducing loneliness, however, there have been no systematic reviews or meta-analyses to ascertain the efficacy of these interventions across the lifespan. The aim of this study was to synthesise, meta-analyse and explore the heterogeneity in RCTs of psychological interventions for loneliness in order to establish their efficacy. Five databases (Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science and CINAHL) were systematically searched in order to identify relevant studies. Included studies were required to be peer-reviewed RCTs examining psychological interventions for loneliness. Two independent coders examined the abstracts of the 3973 studies and 103 full texts, finding 31 studies that met inclusion criteria, 28 of which contained sufficient statistical information to be included in the meta-analysis. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The 31 studies (NÂ =Â 3959) that were included in the systematic review were conducted with a diverse range of cultures, age groups and populations. The interventions were of mixed quality and were mostly face to face, group-based and delivered weekly. The most common type of intervention was Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). 28 studies (NÂ =Â 3039) were included in a meta-analysis which found that psychological interventions significantly reduced loneliness compared to control groups, yielding a small to medium effect size (gÂ =Â 0.43). Subgroup analysis and meta-regressions were conducted in order to explore heterogeneity and found that type of psychological intervention was approaching significance as a moderator of the effectiveness of psychological interventions for loneliness. In conclusion, psychological interventions for loneliness across the lifespan are effective. This finding should inform policy makers, researchers and clinicians going forward, especially in the context of increased loneliness due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There was considerable heterogeneity in the effectiveness of the interventions, suggesting that future research should also explore what works for whom and consider personalising psychological treatment.","Hickin, Nisha, KÃ¤ll, Anton, Shafran, Roz, Sutcliffe, Sebastian, Manzotti, Grazia, Langan, Dean","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2021.102066","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Clinical Psychology Review;: 102066, 2021.; Publication details: Clinical Psychology Review;: 102066, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16222,""
"Abusive and positive parenting behavior in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic under the state of emergency","Background The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the lives of children and parents, raising concerns about child maltreatment. Objective We examined the prevalence of abusive parenting behavior during the pandemic of the COVID-19 and its relations with physical, psychological, and social factors and positive parenting behavior. Participants and Setting An online survey was performed during the COVID-19 state of emergency in Japan. Participants were 5,344 parents of children aged 0â€“17 years. Methods We conducted an anonymous online survey using multiple platforms, including websites of child-related organizations and social networking services (SNS). Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with abusive behavior. Results One-fifth of parents reported abusive behaviors, whereas over 80% of parents reported positive parenting behaviors (e.g., empathizing with a child). Abusive parenting behaviors were associated with longer screen time (6+ hours per day: OR, 1.44;95%CI, 1.05â€“1.98), poor maternal mental health (K6= 13+: OR, 2.23;95%CI, 1.71â€“2.89), and the occurrence of domestic violence (OR, 4.54;95%CI, 3.47â€“5.95). Positive parenting behaviors, especially showing empathy, were associated with lower risks of abusive behaviors (OR, 0.51: 95%CI, 0.39â€“0.66).

"Differences in urban and suburban/rural settings in the care provision and concerns about cancer care for older adults during covid-19","Introduction Care for older adults with cancer became more challenging during the pandemic, particularly in urban hotspots. This study examined the potential differences in healthcare providers' provision of and concerns about cancer care for older adults with cancer between urban and suburban/rural settings. Methods Members of the Advocacy Committee of the Cancer and Aging Research Group, with the Association of Community Cancer Centers, surveyed multidisciplinary healthcare providers responsible for the direct care of patients with cancer. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used. Results Complete data was available from 271 respondents (urban (n=144), suburban/rural (n=127)). Most respondents were social workers (42, 44%) or medical doctors/advanced practice providers (34, 13%) in urban and suburban/rural settings, respectively. Twenty-four percent and 32.4% of urban-based providers reported strongly considering treatment delays among adults aged 76-85 and &gt;85, respectively, compared to 13% and 15.4% of suburban/rural providers (ps=0.048, 0.013). More urban-based providers reported they were inclined to prioritize treatment for younger adults than older adults (10.4% vs. 3.1%, p=0.04) than suburban/rural providers during the pandemic. The top five concerns reported were similar between the groups, related to patient safety, treatment delays, personal safety, and provider mental health. Conclusions These findings demonstrate location-based differences in providers' attitudes regarding care provision for older adults with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Krok-Schoen, J.; BrintzenhofeSzoc, K.; Pisegna, J.; MacKenzie, A.; Canin, B.; Plotkin, E.; Boehmer, L.; Shahrokni, A.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-021-06285-8","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Supportive Care in Cancer; 29(SUPPL 1):S79, 2021.; Publication details: Supportive Care in Cancer; 29(SUPPL 1):S79, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16226,""

"Influence of aerosol electrical charging state and time of use on the filtration performance of some commercial face masks for 10â€“150Â nm particles","The filtration performance of three types of commercially available face masks (hygienic, surgical, and FFP2) has been evaluated for aerosol particle size in the range 10â€“150Â nm at a fixed face velocity of 9.5Â cm/s. Two parameters have been varied in this study: the time of use of the mask, and the electrical charging state of the particles. Mask aging has been carried out by wearing it for a prescribed period of time. Four different charging states of NaCl particles generated by evaporation-condensation have been examined: positively charged particles, negatively charged particles, uncharged particles, and a mixture of the three former types (the latter referred to as â€œmixed aerosolâ€). Aerosol charging was carried out with a low activity radioactive source so that most of the charged particles carried a single charge of either sign in all instances. The charging state of the aerosol exerts a considerable effect on filtration efficiency for the three types of masks. Highest filtration efficiencies are attained for positively and negatively charged particles, but polarity seems to play a role: some masks capture more efficiently particles of a given polarity, although differences in the capture efficiencies of positively and negatively charged particles are insignificant in comparison with those observed between charged and uncharged particles. Uncharged particles give the lowest efficiency and the mixed aerosol leads to filtration efficiencies between those of charged and uncharged particles. The time of use of the mask has also a great influence on its filtration performance: while hygienic masks give poor results from the very beginning, one of the two FFP2 masks assayed has shown a good performance even after 24Â h of use, and the surgical mask also performed well after 8Â h. The relative importance of mechanical (diffusion and or interception) and electrostatic particle deposition, as a function of particle diameter and aging time, has been estimated and discussed. The electrostatic mechanism generally dominates for small particles and short aging times. Pressure drop across the mask has also been measured: the largest pressure drop was observed for the FFP2 and the surgical masks. The time of use of the masks did not affect the pressure drop. Lack of a good fit between the mask and the face of the wearer drastically reduces the actual filtration efficiency of the mask because part of the incoming aerosol bypasses the filtering medium. A few additional efficiency measurements were done after cutting off a small surface area of the mask sample.","CarsÃ­, M.; Alonso, M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2021.105849","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Aerosol Science;: 105849, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Aerosol Science;: 105849, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16228,""

"Jungian psychodrama during the Covid-19 pandemic: a review in times of crisis","Many studies have alerted to the after-effects of the coronavirus in lung infected people but, in reality, the pandemic also affects uninfected people. Children, the elderly and many people among psychiatric patients and minors with disabilities, individuals who are helpless and at risk of marginalisation, although without other medical problems, often suffered from symptoms of anxiety and depression during the epidemic, caused not only by the state of fear and the difficulty of making sense of the event, but also by social isolation, lockdown and norms of social distancing. For the first time in history, emergency psychologists implemented support strategies that were entirely at a distance due to the problem of Sars-CoV-2 infectiousness: counselling via social networks and various help-chat services. A comparison with the Chinese experience in Wuhan will lead to the proposal of a therapeutic project in the Italian context, still ravaged by the pandemic, using the Jungian approach to attempt to cure the ""symptom"" by exploring the myths, archetypes, and symbols of death and life. In fact, after the trauma of hospitalisation or, as it is more often said, after a pandemic trauma, the patient can return to health by finding a good psychophysical condition within the analytical group.","della Vella, P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Jungian+psychodrama+during+the+Covid-19+pandemic:+a+review+in+times+of+crisis","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Rivista Di Psicologia Dell Emergenza E Dell Assistenza Umanitaria; - (25):34-50, 2021.; Publication details: Rivista Di Psicologia Dell Emergenza E Dell Assistenza Umanitaria; - (25):34-50, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16231,""

This disease has developed psychological distress among all the population. COVID virus is one of the leading threats to all the healthcare organizations and due to increase rate of patients day by day, it has given enormous burden to all healthcare workers especially nurses the front line fighters who are always ready to give care towards the patient whom they encountered so it's very crucial part to assess the impact of COVID -19 on the mental health of the nurses. Objective: The objective of the study is to identify the frequency level of stress, anxiety and depression among nurses while dealing with those patients who were admitted in various hospitals in Karachi for treatment of COVID-19. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted from 20thNovember to 31stDecember 2020 from different hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. Those Registered nurses who were assigned in isolation ward of Covid-19 were the part of the study. For data collection survey form was designed based on Depression Anxiety Stress scale (DASS-21) scale (Lovibond & Lovibond 1995). Results: The total mean score of depression among nurses was 50 (68%), Anxiety was 32 (43%) and stress was 34 (46%). 50 nurses suffered from moderate depression, 24 nurses reported from extremely severe anxiety and 50 nurses suffered from moderate stress level. From 74 participants 41(55.4%) were females and 33 (44.6%) were males. Furthermore, it shows that 25 (76%) males and 25 (61%) females suffered from moderate depression, 32 nurses 14 (42%) male and 18(43.90%) females reported from extremely severe anxiety. Conclusion: This pandemic is highly complex, contagious and vulnerable. The study results portrait that nurses working with COVID-19 patients have affected a lot of various psychological distress such as anxiety, stress, and depression. It is very vital for higher management to take major steps and take preventive intervention which would be beneficial towards their mental health in decreasing negative psychological outcomes, because they all are working under pressure environment.","Amen, U.; Rajwani, Z.; Sumayya, U.; Haroon, R.; Mushtaq, N.; Sharif, S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Influence+of+COVID-19+on+the+mental+health+of+nurses+dealing+with+COVID-19+patients+(A+Study+on+Nurses+within+Karachi)","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Pakistan Journal of Medical and Health Sciences; 15(5):1200-1204, 2021.; Publication details: Pakistan Journal of Medical and Health Sciences; 15(5):1200-1204, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16232,""

However, there are neuropsychiatric symptoms since the beginning of the disease. Several investigations have indicated a direct relationship between chronic diseases such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), tuberculosis, SARS, MERS, Ebola and SARS 2003 with mental disorders such as depression. Neuropsychiatric disorders can occur due to different mechanisms, such as cerebral hypoxia, cytokine storm due to exaggerated immune response and encephalitis due to direct brain infection.

"Psychological impact on health workers of Covid-19 outbreak in the early emergency period: a brief and quick systematic review","The outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus (Covid-19) is a newly emerged disease started in Hubei province of China as a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown aetiology. Due to rapid spread and severity of the infection, on March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared officially Covid-19 outbreak as a pandemic. In front of this public health concern, medical staff is affected both physically and psychologically. The Covid-19 outbreak has caused severe psychological stress, as anxiety, depression, sleep disorders and emotional distress in frontline healthcare workers which were exposed to severe emotional reactions often without psychological support. This review aimed to investigate the existing literature about psychological impact of Covid-19 pandemic on healthcare workers. The literature search was conducted in the following databases: Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo. All types of articles published from March 2020 to the end of April 2020 which were relevant to the issue were searched. A total of 39 articles were selected by initial search and 11 of them were included in the final work. PRISMA guidelines were followed. The current review suggests that healthcare workers exposed to the battle against novel coronavirus disease reported considerable levels of depression, anxiety, fear, distress and insomnia. For this reason, it is necessary to highlight that it is essential to provide adequate training and psychological support to medical staff engaged in the emergency in order to minimize the risk of chronicizing the reported symptoms.","Ahmad, M.; Floris, M.

"Psychological impact of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on patients with rheumatological disorders: A web-based cross-sectional multicentric survey","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in uncertainty and negative psychological outcomes for patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases for several reasons. It is essential to understand the level of anxiety among rheumatic disease patients at the current situation of COVID-19. Objectives and Methods: A web-based cross-sectional multicenter survey was done across 5 rheumatology centers in India. The study duration was between 9 measured by Beck Anxiety Inventory. Results: The survey was sent to 2987 patients, there were 933 responses, and 581 were complete (male = 175). Complete responses were considered for data analysis. Rheumatoid arthritis was the most frequent (50.6%) diagnosis followed by other conditions. Most of the patients (43%) were on combination disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy, 12.7% of patients were on biological drugs, and 23.9% of patients were on glucocorticoids (GCs). Statistically significant higher anxiety scores were observed in females (8.79 Â± 9.3), fibromyalgia patients (19.78 Â± 14.8), patients on GCs (9.26 Â± 8.8), and biological agents (10.65 Â± 10.6). Difficulty in meeting rheumatologists and getting medications was expressed by 327 (56.2%) and 73 (29.7%) respondents, respectively. Conclusion: The findings of the study revealed that anxiety is a major concern in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Fibromyalgia patients and those who were on GC and biological drugs were found to have more anxiety levels compared to other groups of patients. There is a need to intensify the awareness and address the mental health issues. Â© 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

"A cross-sectional online survey of relationship between the psychological impact of coronavirus disease 2019 and the resilience among postgraduate health sciences students from Maharashtra, India","Introduction: Because of the rapid global spread, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a state of an emergency situation. Postgraduate (PG) health sciences students (HSSs) are the frontline healthcare workers who are susceptible to psychological issues like depression, anxiety and stress during such stressful pandemic period. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between the psychological issues such as depression, anxiety and stress and the level of resilience among PG HSSs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: The present cross-sectional online survey was conducted by the department of Psychiatry of tertiary health care center from Maharashtra state of India over a 10 days period (from April 15, 2020 to April 24, 2020), with a sample size of 195 which was calculated by using the formula of sample size calculation for the cross-sectional study design. Data were collected using the purposive sampling method from the PG HSSs. Data were recorded from the study participants in an online structured questionnaire prepared for the study using the sociodemographic details and the two scales namely Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 item (DASS-21) and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). DASS-21 scale was used to assess the presence and severity of depression, anxiety, and stress, while BRS scale was used to assess the level of resilience among the PG HSSs. Data were collected and analyzed using the SPSS software version 15.0, Fisher's exact test, and Pearson's correlation test. Results: Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress were 43.1%, 68.7%, and 11.3%, respectively. There was a high positive correlation between all three subscales of DASS-21 (depression, anxiety, and stress subscales). On BRS, 2 (1.0%) study participants had high resilience, 120 (61.5%) had normal resilience, and 73 (37.5%) Conclusion: Study concluded that significant proportion of PG HSSs had psychological impact of COVID-19 in the form of depression, anxiety and stress. Programs such as timely evaluation of mental health status and stress management to address these psychological issues should be a priority. In long terms, increasing the resilience of PG HSSs can have protective value against the psychological issues during the stressful events of infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 pandemic.

"Drivers Affecting the Acceptance and Use of Electronic Learning Among Ugandan University Students in the COVID-19 Era: A Cross-Sectional Survey Among Three Universities","COVID-19 is an emerging and highly infectious disease that is becoming a global health challenge affecting all sectors. To prevent COVID-19 transmission, all education institutions were closed and advised to turn to online learning. The present study sought to determine the factors affecting the acceptance and use of electronic learning among Ugandan University students in three universities. The study relied on two data collection instruments: a questionnaire and a semi-structured interview. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted on a population of students in three pre-selected universities: Kyambogo (KYU), Makerere (MAK), and Kampala International University (KIU). Of the 614 questionnaires returned, 578 were valid;65.4% of the respondents were males;60.7% were from MAK and the majority being in their third year of study (49%). Overall, 69.2% had good knowledge, 22.5% had positive attitudes toward e-learning. The semi-structured interviews revealed connectivity and skills challenges as the main barriers to the implementation of e-learning. For better implementation of e-learning by Universities, effective planning needs to be done with active studentsâ€™ involvement to avert negative attitudes. We recommend more studies be done on the Universitiesâ€™ preparedness for the implementation of e-learning. Universities should collaborate with telecommunication companies to provide subsidized prices for internet costs and information and communications technology (ICT) equipment to students.

"Family Resilience during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Literature Review","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly in many countries. This pandemic has led to short-term as well as long-term psychosocial and mental health implications for all family members. The magnitude of family resilience is determined by many vulnerability factors like developmental age, educational status, preexisting mental health condition, being economically underprivileged or being quarantined due to infection or fear of infection. Methods: PubMed, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Cochrane, and ProQuest were searched from the inception of the pandemic to December 31, 2020. Articles were screened for inclusion by Authors. Results: After exclusion, there were eight studies included in the analysis with 165,515 participants. The literature review demonstrated that pandemic has caused mental health problems such as anxiety, stress, and depression. Creating daily practices of gratitude is important to build family wellbeing. It is essential to have good and healthy communication and to find positive activities to do together among family members which can build a sense of togetherness, trust, cohesion, and happiness. Conclusion: In conclusion, the pandemic has caused unpredictable and uncertain impacts that can pose a threat to the wellbeing of the families. Pandemic has caused mental health problems such as anxiety, stress, and depression. A healthy relationship, communication, faith-based practices, a positive mindset, and building social support are adaptive coping to respond to the crisis and adversity together.

"How robust is the association between youth unemployment and later mental health? An analysis of longitudinal data from English schoolchildren","BackgroundSeveral studies show that youth unemployment is associated with worse mental health later in life. However, existing studies report results for only one model, or a few models, and use regression adjustment to support causal claims. We use two novel methods to address these gaps in the literature.MethodsWe use data from Next Steps, a cohort study of English schoolchildren who entered the labour market in the aftermath of the 2008â€“2009 global financial crisis, and measure mental health using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) at age 25. We use specification curve analysis and a negative control outcome design (a form of placebo test) to test whether associations between youth unemployment and later GHQ-12 scores are sensitive to model specification or are likely to be confounded by unobserved factors.ResultsWe find that the association between unemployment and later GHQ-12 is qualitatively similar across 99.96% of the 120 000 models we run. Statistically significant associations with two placebo outcomes, height and patience, are not present when regression adjustments are made.ConclusionsThere is clear evidence that youth unemployment is related to later mental health, and some evidence that this cannot be easily explained by unobserved confounding.","Wright, Liam, Head, Jenny A.; Jivraj, Stephen","https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2021-107473","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Occupational and Environmental Medicine; 78(8):618-620, 2021.; Publication details: Occupational and Environmental Medicine; 78(8):618-620, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16243,""

"Understanding global mental health: a conceptual review","BackgroundMental health disorders are viewed as a global concern requiring globally led approaches to address them. Since the publication of the 2007 Lancet series on global mental health (GMH), the term has become widespread. Over the last two decades, GMH has become increasingly affiliated with policy reform, academic courses, funding bodies and research. However, it is not always obvious how those working in the field of GMH are using the term, resulting in a lack of clarity. Therefore, work is needed to synthesise the current understanding(s) of GMH to help characterise its meaning.AimTo synthesise the literature and identify the different ways GMH is understood.MethodA conceptual review, using a systematic search and a content analysis, was conducted to develop a conceptual framework of the different conceptual understandings of GMH.ResultsWe developed a conceptual framework of four understandings of GMH. These understandings of GMH are as follows: an area of research generating findings to establish a GMH evidence-base;implementation of research into practice;improving the mental health environment;learning from and supporting low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs).ConclusionOur review proposes a simple framework, clarifying the key characteristics of the GMH landscape. The findings highlight the diversity of usage of the term in the literature, as well as present the wide scope that comprises the field of GMH. Referring to this framework may help those engaged with GMH to be more specific with which aspect of the field they are concerned with.","Rajabzadeh, Vian, Burn, Erin, Sajun, Sana Z.; Suzuki, Mimi, Bird, Victoria Jane, Priebe, Stefan","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004631","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Global Health; 6(3), 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Global Health; 6(3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16245,""
"Adolescent health in the Sustainable Development Goal era: are we aligned for multisectoral action?","Adolescents are an increasing proportion of low and middle-income country populations. Their coming of age is foundational for health behaviour, as well as social and productive citizenship. We mapped intervention areas for adolescent sexual and reproductive health, including HIV, mental health and violence prevention to sectors responsible for them using a framework that highlights settings, roles and alignment. Out of 11 intervention areas, health is the lead actor for one, and a possible lead actor for two other interventions depending on the implementation context. All other interventions take place outside of the health sector, with the health sector playing a range of bilateral, trilateral supporting roles or in several cases a minimal role. Alignment across the sectors varies from indivisible, enabling or reinforcing to the other extreme of constraining and counterproductive. Governance approaches are critical for brokering these varied relationships and interactions in multisectoral action for adolescent health, to understand the context of such change and to spark, sustain and steer it.","George, Asha, Jacobs, Tanya, Ved, Rajani, Jacobs, Troy, Rasanathan, Kumanan, Shehla Abbas, Zaidi","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004448","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Global Health; 6(3), 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Global Health; 6(3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16246,""
"Enhancing science preparedness for health emergencies in Africa through research capacity building","[...]attention has turned to the contribution of local researchers in the pandemic response and by extension, countriesâ€™ science preparedness. The most urgent demand globally is for testing expertise and platforms. Because of their established biosciences capacity, many ARCH partner institutions were among the first COVID-19 testing and diagnostics training nodes in their respective countries. Beyond testing, the institutions have also deployed their surveillance systems, and expertise in epidemiology, modelling and pathogen sequencing, a significant proportion of which was developed under the ARCH framework, to gather the population-level data needed to improve incidence estimates and transmission models reliability.4 In parallel, many ARCH-trained researchers are currently launching immunology and pathogenesis studies to inform COVID-19 drug and vaccine development.

"Report of the WHO independent high-level commission on NCDs: where is the focus on addressing inequalities?","The current report highlights that given the current measures in place the 2030 sustainable development goal (SDG) target 3.4 of reducing by â€˜one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-beingâ€™ will not be met.2 Whereas the first report proposed recommendations for heads of state, governments, civil society and the private sector, the proposals put forward in this report were targeted at the WHO. The eight recommendations include: encouraging heads of state and governments to take the lead in the NCD response;supporting countries to ensure healthy lifestyles for their populations;proposing investments in mental health;including prevention in universal health coverage (UHC);introducing social and financial protection measures to prevent people falling into poverty due to NCDs;engaging with businesses and member states to address NCDs and mental health;encouraging interactions between governments and civil society;and advocating for a â€˜multi-donor trust fund to support countries in activities to reduce NCDs and promote mental healthâ€™.3 As a group of humanitarian actors, clinicians and academics active in the area of NCDs in low/middle-income countries (LMICs) and humanitarian settings, we welcome the launch of this report. On the contrary, it will reinforce these by having prevention measures tailored to the context where people live.9 With regards to access to medicines and technologies, including diagnostic tools, many studies have found that availability and affordability of NCD medicines and technologies is much lower in LMICs than in high-income countries (HICs).10 Insulin is a striking example in that despite having been discovered 100 years, there are marked disparities and gaps in global insulin access.11 Governments, the private sector and other actors all need to be involved in finding sustainable solutions to ensure access to medicines and technologies within functioning health systems.

"The promise and pitfalls of social science research in an emergency: lessons from studying the Zika epidemic in Brazil, 2015â€“2016","Social science generates evidence necessary to control epidemics. It can help to craft appropriate public health responses, develop solutions to the epidemic impacts and improve understanding of why the epidemic occurred. Yet, there are practical constraints in undertaking this international research in a way that produces quality, ethical and appropriate data, and that values all voices and experiences, especially those of local researchers and research participants. In this paper, we reflected on the experience of undertaking social science research during the 2015/2016 Zika epidemic in Brazil. This experience was considered from the perspective of this paperâ€™s authors: three Brazilian academics, two UK academics and two mothers of children affected by congenital Zika syndrome. This group came together through the conduct of the Social and Economic Impact of Zika study, a mixed-methods social science study. The key findings highlight practical issues in the achievement of three goals: the conduct of high-quality social science in emergencies and efforts towards the decolonisation of global health in terms of levelling the power between Brazilian and UK researchers and optimising the role of patients within research. From our perspective, the information collected through social science was valuable, providing detailed insight into the programmatic needs of mothers and their affected children (eg, economic and social support and mental health services). Social science was considered a low priority within the Zika epidemic despite its potential importance. There were logistical challenges in conducting social science research, foremost of which are the difficulties in developing a trusting and balanced power relationship between the UK and Brazilian researchers in a short time frame. When these issues were overcome, each partner brought unique qualities, making the research stronger. The mothers of affected children expressed dissatisfaction with research, as they were involved in many studies which were not coordinated, and from which they did not see a benefit. In conclusion, the importance of social science in epidemics must continue to be promoted by funders. Funders can also set in place mechanisms to help equalise the power dynamics between foreign and local researchers, researchers and participants, both to promote justice and to create best quality data.","Passos, Maria Joana, Matta, Gustavo, Tereza Maciel, Lyra, Lopes Moreira, Maria Elisabeth, Kuper, Hannah, Penn-Kekana, Loveday, MendonÃ§a, Mila","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002307","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ Global Health; 5(4), 2020.; Publication details: BMJ Global Health; 5(4), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16249,""
"Exploring the impact of COVID-19-related fear, obsessions, anxiety and stress on psychological well-being among adults in Pakistan","Purpose: Fear of COVID-19 is one of the pivotal components that have generated higher levels of stress, obsessions and anxiety among the adult population, thus creating numerous mental health issues. The purpose of this study was to evaluate psychological well-being based on COVID-19-related fear, obsessions and anxiety during the pandemic situation. Design/methodology/approach: The current study aimed to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19-related fear, obsessions, anxiety, stress and well-being among adult populations. Additionally, the aim was to see the impact of COVID-19-related fear, obsessions, anxiety and stress on well-being. This was a cross-sectional study based on nonclinical sample of (n = 250) adults;data was obtained via online questionnaire survey method and analysis was performed by using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS-22). Findings: The authorsâ€™ findings based on descriptive statistics showed that COVID-19-related fear and obsessions were positively associated with COVID anxiety and stress and negatively associated with well-being. COVID anxiety was positively associated with stress and negatively associated with well-being. Moreover, perceived stress is negatively associated with well-being. The results additionally provide the outcome/conclusion that COVID-related anxiety significantly negatively predicted the psychological well-being. Overall the model explained 24% of the variance in psychological well-being. Females scored significantly high in COVID-19-related anxiety and obsessions as compared to males. Research limitations/implications: A distinctive feature of this study is the understanding of COVID-19-related fear, obsessions, anxiety, stress and well-being among adult populations, and the findings are highlighting the need for psychological and social interventions for this specific population;therefore, immediate attention is needed by the clinical health professionals dealing with mental health issues. Originality/value: There is a vital need to explore and develop psychological interventions aiming at the negative consequences being faced by the adult populations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the impending second wave that will expose individuals to various mental health issues evolving because of the health crisis.

"Examining second-order impacts of COVID-19 in urban areas","This paper examines the current state of knowledge focusing on the second-order impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic through a geospatial lens. The purpose is twofold: (1) present a global programme â€“ Citiesâ€™ COVID Mitigation Mapping (C2M2) programme â€“ focusing on urban areas that explores second-order impacts through the use of geospatial tools and technologies, and (2) identify and assess the emerging literature on second-order impacts using geospatial data and analysis to support this project. Effects of the pandemic are rapidly unfolding across the world;however, an assessment of the literature reveals that second-order impacts of COVID-19 are seasonal, spatial, and scalar across multiple thematic areas includ-ing the economy, environmental health sector, education, and migration/mobility. Successive waves of the pandemic are continuing to be met with specific public health measures (e.g. lockdowns, travel restrictions, social distancing guidance, mandates for the use of personal protective equipment) that will have long-term impacts on vulnerable populations. A literature review was conducted to identify how the pandemicâ€™s second-order impacts derived from geospatial data and analysis can provide the basis for using geospatial data to study vulnerable urban populations more generally. This review reveals a gap in the literature, with far more articles emphasizing geospatial approaches to assess first-order impacts and alimited number of articles focused on geospatial approaches investigating second-order impacts. Nonetheless, this nascent literature provides the basis for designing approaches with local partners and by local and regional governments to apply geospatial data and methodologies to the development of mitigation strategies to prioritize limited resources to minimize the long-term consequences of COVID-19.

"Same storm, different nightmares: emergency remote teaching by contingent communication instructors during the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic amplified existing inequities in higher education. This paper documents the stories of four precariously employed communication instructors in their transition to emergency remote teaching in March 2020. Through collaborative autoethnography, the instructors share their stories of reliance and compliance within the gig academy, using their support networks to foster resilience and create points of resistance. In the Spring 2020 semester, we experienced the same storm but with different nightmares. Technological frustrations, mental health concerns, accent barriers, financial stresses, care work, and illness were pushed to the background while we dealt with suddenly teaching online during the pandemic. The relentless uncertainty about job security hanging overhead persists. From our subaltern counterpublic, we posit a resistance to the gig academy. We urge departmental leadership to use this paper to inform policy making and practice and for other contingent instructors to expose their stories in scholarship.

"Death Anxiety and Intrusive Thinking during the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 has expanded into a life-threatening global pandemic. We examined COVID-19 effects on trauma measures, loneliness, and death anxiety in senior Israelis. Young and old adults (N = 277) were recruited through social media. They completed online questionnaires assessing mental status during the crisis. The findings yielded correlations between trauma reactions, death anxiety, and loneliness, age-related change in rates of death anxiety and traumatic symptoms, but not in perceived loneliness. Trauma-related intrusive thinking was predicted by age, loneliness, death anxiety, and being in isolation. Traumatic reactions, as indicated by DSM-V, were observed for young adults, while grandchildren were found to be protective for older adults. Conclusions point to a high risk of postcrisis symptoms in older adults. The article recommends methods for maintaining mental health, highlighting the role of social interaction.

The imposition of physical distancing and restrictions on activities outside the home will have an impact on discomfort for all individuals, including the elderly. The elderly are forced to stay in their respective homes that causes reduced physical activity. If this condition continues, it can reduce endurance, cause discomfort, boredom, anxiety, and depression in the elderly. Objective: This study aimed to identify the effect of physical activity on of depression in the elderly at Integrated Health Center (Posyandu), Kasin Sub-District, Working Area of Puskesmas Bareng, Malang City. Methods: This type of analytic correlative research was categorized as a quantitative survey type with cross sectional design. The sample was 54 elderly aged 60 years taken by random sampling. The instruments used were the Geriatric Depression Scale for screening depression incidents and the questionnaire for assessing demographic data and physical activity. Data were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression method. Results: Exercising, doing outwork had a significant effect on the occurrence of depression in the elderly, with a sig value of exercising 0.004 and doing homework at 0.047. exercise can reduce the risk of depression by 99% and doing homework can reduce the risk of depression by 10%.

"Why people living with mental illnesses should have been prioritized earlier for COVID-19 vaccines","Researchers and advocates have argued that people living with severe mental illnesses are a vulnerable group and should be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccines. People living with severe mental illnesses, including substance use disorders, bear an elevated burden of intersecting risk factors related to the social determinants of health and medical comorbidities leading to greater COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. This increased risk is based on several intersecting factors, including the likelihood of living in unstable and crowded living conditions such as shelters, group homes, or institutions;unsafe working conditions;high rate of comorbidities;and marginalization and stigmatization. Nonetheless, many of the initial iterations of vaccine allocation frameworks internationally did not prioritize people living with severe mental illnesses. Moreover, people with severe mental illness who are long-stay inpatients in psychiatric institutions were left off of vaccine priority setting lists that included long-term care facilities and other congregate settings. In this commentary, we question why people living with severe mental illnesses â€“ particularly those who are institutionalized â€“ were not initially considered a priority for vaccine access given the supposed vulnerability. We describe how people are made vulnerable by intersecting aspects of systematic disadvantage such as stigma, poverty, and racism. We suggest that the lack of attention given to intersectional factors in vaccine prioritization compromises health equity for people living with mental health and substance use disorders. We end the commentary by suggesting how vaccine distribution and allocation could be more equitable by including people with lived experience of mental illness in designing and implementing vaccination strategies. Understanding how people with mental illnesses have experienced structural vulnerability and intersecting risk factors throughout the pandemic can help inform the creation of effective and ethical vaccine-related responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Addressing Loneliness and Social Isolation in Older Adults","The incidence of cardiovascular disease and mental health disorders is significantly increased, and socially isolated individuals report a higher prevalence of tobacco product usage and other deleterious health behaviors.1,3,5,7 Individuals who are socially isolated and/or lonely also report higher rates of health service utilization that may be because of greater disease occurrence and/or increased outreach provided by health service agencies.1 Nevertheless, these individuals report decreased adherence with medical advice.3,8 IDENTIFYING LONELINESS AND SOCIAL ISOLATION Family physicians recognize the importance of loneliness as a condition that affects their patients but are often limited in their ability to reliably identify affected patients.9 The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force does not have a recommendation about screening for loneliness and social isolation;however, a recent report from the National Academy of Medicine provides guidance.1 Universal screening is not currently indicated because of the paucity of evidence-based interventions;however, physicians may consider assessments using validated tools, such as the Berkman-Syme10 or UCLA Loneliness Scale.1,11 Screening may be indicated in at-risk patients, for example, in those who have experienced a challenging life event such as the loss of a loved one, those who disclose limited social networks, or those who have frequent health care use.1 When patients at risk have been identified, physicians should consider discussing the adverse health outcomes associated with social isolation and loneliness with their patients and caregivers and investigate for underlying health or functional limitations that may be contributing factors.1 There is growing interest in information technology as a platform for assessing social isolation and loneliness.1 Several technologies are being explored as tools to identify or predict patterns of social isolation, including home-based activity monitoring, tracking of online and electronic usage patterns, and wearable devices that record sleep and physical activity.1 STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE LONELINESS AND SOCIAL ISOLATION There is currently limited evidence to support specific interventions to mitigate the health effects of social isolation and loneliness. The recent National Academy of Medicine report also noted the limited evidence base supporting interventions;however, the report provided approaches that could be implemented by family physicians caring for patients who are experiencing social isolation and loneliness.1 Social prescribing is an approach involving the activities that health care professionals can suggest to link patients with nonclinical support services, which are often found in the community.1 Primary care physicians can implement social prescribing in multiple ways, including a direct referral to community-based agencies through the use of a practice-based care manager for assessing needs and tailoring the referral or by providing access to a directory of support services for patients and family caregivers.1 Peer support groups, particularly for patients with a shared illness or condition, have an extensive evidence base in chronic disease self-management and may benefit those who are socially isolated or lonely.1,14 Although cognitive behavior therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy have the potential to mitigate the negative perceptions of social interactions, the evidence demonstrating effectiveness is limited.1 In addition to its role in assessment, information technology may offer new tools to deliver individual or group interventions to this population.1 Social media virtual communities and video-assisted friendly visits are among these intervention strategies that are currently being researched.1 The National Academy of Medicine recommends that physicians, clinical practices, and health care systems partner with community-based providers to promote care that includes and facilitates the use of tailored social services in addressing social isolation and loneliness in older adults.1 Many countries, having identified the public health implications of social isolation and loneliness, have launched initiatives to support systems-level interventions, and regional organizations have created directories of resources (Table 2). [...]screening for comorbid mood disorders may provide an opportunity to offer a more directed intervention, such as cognitive behavior therapy.","Lahlou, Rita M.; Daaleman, Timothy P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Addressing+Loneliness+and+Social+Isolation+in+Older+Adults","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: American Family Physician; 104(1):85-87, 2021.; Publication details: American Family Physician; 104(1):85-87, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16258,""

"Stress among Resident Doctors Working in Different Hospitals of Nepal in the Face of COVID-19 Pandemic: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study","Introduction: The emergence and propagation of COVID-19 pandemic has subjected resident doctors to greater workload and consequent psychological implications. Many studies have illustrated various degrees of mental health issues among health care workers in general;however very limited ones have focused primarily on the resident doctors. Therefore, this study aimed to find out the prevalence of stress among the resident doctors of Nepal. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in all the teaching hospitals of Nepal with ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Committee (Reference number-245). An online self-designed structured questionnaire developed using Google forms along with questions from stress subscale of Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale -21 was disseminated to the residents via social media platforms using Convenience sampling technique. Responses generated were analyzed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. Results: The prevalence of stress among resident doctors was found to be 16 (8.2%) (4.3-12.1 at 95% Confidence Interval). Greater prevalence of stress was seen among residents working outside Kathmandu valley, those in the frontline and those who were unmarried. Loss of collaborative study/ professional and academic growth experiences was responsible for causing extremely severe stress among 60 (30.9%) residents, followed by stress due to uncertainty regarding COVID-19 58 (29.9%) and unavailability/lack of quality control of personal protective equipment 58 (29.9%). Conclusions: This study has shed light upon the prevalence of stress and its precipitating factors in Nepalese resident doctors due to COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings could help address these issues for their mitigation promptly.","Adhikari, G.; Paudel, L.; Pokhrel, B.; Bhandari, G.; Shrestha, K.

"Long-term effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the health and safety of children and mothers around the world","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is a global health disaster with significant effects on the health of children and mothers on a scale not seen in 100 years. METHODS: We searched in Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus databases with keywords of ""COVID-19"", ""children"", ""mothers"", ""health"", ""impact"", ""effect"", and ""pandemic"". We found 33 related new studies and wrote a narrative review article. Some of them were full-text articles and others were organizational statistics or expert comments. RESULTS: Analyses showed that the COVID-19 epidemic led to widespread disruption of health systems and reduced access to food, and low- and middle-income countries should expect large increases in maternal and child mortality. The long-term effects of COVID-19 on the physical and mental health of children and mothers are very different and challenging compared to other people. During the pandemic, many mothers denied access to prenatal care. In addition to the many indirect effects, although most children have mild symptoms, they should be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) if children are hospitalized with the same percentage of adults. CONCLUSION: It is very necessary for politicians and organizations in charge of children's health to have comprehensive and long-term plans to limit the destructive and unintended effects of the pandemic on children and mothers around the world, with a greater focus on underdeveloped and less developed countries.","Chegini, V.; Chegini, V.; Parsarad, E.; Rouhi, S.","https://doi.org/10.22122/cdj.v9i2.602","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication details: Chronic Diseases Journal; 9(2):73-80, 2021.; Publication details: Chronic Diseases Journal; 9(2):73-80, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16262,""

"Reflections for global public health research and evidence-based medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic","Healthcare professionals are often overburdened, with limited time to examine all current, best available evidence to inform their practice and clinical decision-making. This has been very much the case during the COVID-19 pandemic, with healthcare professionals at the frontline facing physical exhaustion, mental health challenges associated with stigma, limited family time, and the passing of those seeking healthcare. In addition to some of the psychosocial factors impacting on healthcare professionals, the surge in the available evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic made clinical decision making cumbersome, as evidence-based medicine attempted to address clinical decision-making through the best available evidence together with clinical expertise and patient values. Researchers and academics rapidly responded to this public health emergency through the generation of knowledge that aimed to be both relevant and timeous to address the needs of the pandemic and halt the number of infections for those at great risk. The rapid response meant that while researchers aimed to inform the public and the scientific community about advances in science, methodological and ethical dilemmas emerged as part of evidence based decision-making. Cutting corners and producing evidence rapidly often meant that researchers and academics needed thoughtful reflection about whether they are guilty of exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic for academic progression while losing methodological and ethical integrity. In April 2020, the WHO database reported 5,362 COVID-19-related studies and numerous online COVID-19 collections (such as the Living Overview of Evidence platform and the Living Systematic Map of Evidence, to name but two). Would the adaptations to evidence-based medicine that the pandemic brought about change how evidence generation and synthesis is conducted in the future? Simultaneously, it could also suggest that this is the shift from traditional research methods and approaches to ones that are changing with the times in light of the fourth industrial revolution and the current pandemic. Some reflections that researchers and academics might need to consider to avoid jeopardising the methodological and ethical integrity of scientific contributions are set out in. All attempts at global public health research and evidence-based medicine should take place while the researcher reflects on how she/ he can ensure that the knowledge generated and shared can be relevant to help clinicians and the general public, locally. The language that is used in the dissemination and knowledge translation of evidence that emerges from research during the COVID-19 pandemic should also consider the availability of evidence in languages other than English, both languages widely spoken internationally and locally.","Davids, E.

"Covid-19 Pandemic may have Unique Effects on Emergency Admissions for Pediatric Psychopathology: A Single-Center Study","Objective: In December 2019, a new coronavirus was identified that caused an epidemic across China and a worldwide pandemic (COVID-19). We aimed to examine the admissions of the children to the emergency service with psychiatric symptoms by comparing retrospectively in terms of sociodemographic variables, diagnoses, psychiatric symptoms, and psychiatric treatments during and before the Covid-19 Pandemic. Methods: In our study, the first group consisted of the 170 patients who were consulted to child and adolescent psychiatry emergency service department between 11.03.2019 and 30.09.2019 and the second group consisted of the 102 patients who have consulted in the same period previously. The statistical analysis of the study was performed by using SPSS 23. The significant level was accepted as a p-value &lt;0.05. Results: We found that child psychiatry applications decreased by 42% compared to the previous year. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of gender and age between the two groups (p&gt; 0.05). The diagnosis of depression and anxiety disorders were found to be the most common diagnosis in both two groups (48.8%;42%, respectively). We observed an increase in diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorders and a decrease in neurodevelopmental disorders among the children who applied to the emergency department during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Conclusion: Our results contribute the knowledge about the features of emergency administrations of children during the pandemic. Further research is crucial to ensure that child and adolescent psychiatry services are prepared in extraordinary situations such as epidemics.","Eray, S.; Sahin, V.","https://doi.org/10.5455/pbs.20210329114825","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences; 11(2):115-120, 2021.; Publication details: Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences; 11(2):115-120, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16266,""

"Pandemic novel corona virus and its long-run effects on world economy with special reference to GDP of India","The aim was to study how corona virus outbreak has impacted the global economy and fluctuated world market due to restrictions over international trade and fall in GDP of India. Theoretical and numerical data were used from December 2019 to April 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic will shrink world output by 3% in 2020, IMF said in the April update of its world economic outlook (WEO) released in Washington DC the first after the magnitude of the outbreak became clear. India is a developing country whose GDP growth rate estimated for year 2020 is 1.9% by IMF which was estimated as 5.8% in January 2020, which was a sign of worst recession since great depression (1930s). It has been seen that 2.7 billion workers impacted by COVID-19 restrictions globally. Information is about the emergence of a deadly virus named novel corona virus and its spread to the whole world, how it affects the economy and human health. It is expected that if this virus cannot be controlled, then we have to face next great depression in near future.","Din, T. M. U.; Afzal, A.; Bhat, T.

"COVID cough and Fukushima novels: On the not-bareness of life in environmental humanities","This essay introduces three works of post-Fukushima Japanese literature, by Hayashi Kyoko (1930â€“2017), Kimura Yusuke (1970â€“) and Kobayashi Erika (1978â€“), to offer an environmental humanities alternative to Giorgio Agambenâ€™s response to COVID-19. Politically, Hayashi is probably closest to Agamben in that her work has been embraced by antinuclear activists in Japan and upheld as evidence of the injustice of the state of exception into which victims of both Fukushima and Hiroshima/Nagasaki were thrust. The author focuses instead on how these three authors acknowledge the cruelties of biopolitics but nevertheless celebrate the fact that â€œlifeâ€ is never bare. For them, ionizing radiation acts like the COVID cough did for many of us: not as an invitation to critique the state but as a material intrusion that forces an awareness of what Rocco Ronchi, in his response to Agamben, called â€œthe destiny of the community of man with nature.â€ What are the material forces immanent to that destiny? What does it do to our mental health to engage them directly? The three works analyzed answer these questions in creative, powerful ways.

"Myeloid phenotypes in severe COVID-19 predict secondary infection and mortality: a pilot study","BACKGROUND: De-regulated host response to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), directly referring to the concept of sepsis-associated immunological dysregulation, seems to be a strong signature of severe COVID-19. Myeloid cells phenotyping is well recognized to diagnose critical illness-induced immunodepression in sepsis and has not been well characterized in COVID-19. The aim of this study is to review phenotypic characteristics of myeloid cells and evaluate their relations with the occurrence of secondary infection and mortality in patients with COVID-19 admitted in an intensive care unit. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the circulating myeloid cells phenotypes of adult COVID-19 critically ill patients. Phenotyping circulating immune cells was performed by flow cytometry daily for routine analysis and twice weekly for lymphocytes and monocytes subpopulations analysis, as well as monocyte human leukocyte antigen (mHLA)-DR expression. RESULTS: Out of the 29 critically ill adult patients with severe COVID-19 analyzed, 12 (41.4%) developed secondary infection and six patients died during their stay. Monocyte HLA-DR kinetics was significantly different between patients developing secondary infection and those without, respectively, at day 5-7 and 8-10 following admission. The monocytes myeloid-derived suppressor cells to total monocytes ratio was associated with 28- and 60-day mortality. Those myeloid characteristics suggest three phenotypes: hyperactivated monocyte/macrophage is significantly associated with mortality, whereas persistent immunodepression is associated with secondary infection occurrence compared to transient immunodepression. CONCLUSIONS: Myeloid phenotypes of critically ill COVID-19 patients may be associated with development of secondary infection, 28- and 60-day mortality.","Marais, C.; Claude, C.; Semaan, N.; Charbel, R.; Barreault, S.; Travert, B.; Piloquet, J.

"Decision support system for major depression detection using spectrogram and convolution neural network with EEG signals","The number of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients is rising rapidly these days following the incidence of COVID-19 pandemic. It is challenging to detect MDD through personal interviews and by observing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Hence, an automated MDD detection system developed using deep learning techniques can help reduce the workload of clinicians by diagnosing MDD accurately. In this study, we have proposed a novel deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and spectrogram images. In this work, Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is first applied to the EEG signals to obtain spectrogram images of MDD patients and healthy subjects. These spectrogram images are then fed to the CNN model for automated detection of MDD patients and healthy subjects. The EEG signals used in this study were obtained from public database with 34 MDD patients and 30 healthy subjects. The highest classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score of 99.58%, 99.40%, 99.70%, 99.48%, and 99.55% respectively were obtained with hold-out validation. Our MDD detection model is highly accurate and needs to be validated with more diverse MDD database before it can be used in clinical settings. Also, we plan to use our developed prototype to detect depression using other physiological signals like electrocardiogram (ECG) and speech signals for accurate and faster diagnosis.

"Transitioning to adulthood from residential childcare during COVID-19: Experiences of young people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism spectrum disorder in South Africa","Accessible Summary Background Methods Findings Conclusions For young people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism, the transition from children's residential care into adulthood during COVID-19 has been difficult. Opportunities for greater independence were blocked because of the lockdown. Some of these young people experienced an increase in depression or other mental health difficulties. But more time at home due to public health restrictions also helped to deepen the relationship with caregivers. Service continuity is crucial, both in person and online, to support care leavers with intellectual disability and/or autism, as well as training and support to caregivers to continue with independent and interdependent living programmes at home. This study focuses on young people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism who, due to child welfare concerns, have grown up in children's residential care and are now transitioning out of care at the age of 18Â years towards young adulthood. This transition is termed â€œcare leavingâ€ and the young people in transition â€œcare leaversâ€. The care leaving transition can be particularly difficult for young people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism. These challenges can be magnified in a time of a global crisis like COVID-19, which has resulted in countries being on lockdown and care leaversâ€™ transitions being curtailed. Many mental health problems have emerged due to the COVID-19 outbreak and resultant lockdown that may negatively impact on the care leaving transition of young people with intellectual disabilities.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six care leavers with intellectual disabilities and their three caregivers in June 2020 in the Cape Peninsula region of South Africa to explore the impact of COVID-19 on their transitional journeys.Three core themes emerged from the analysis: young people evidenced regression of independence, rather than the expected growth in young adult independence, due to disruptions to routines and opportunities to move out into the world;some young people experienced an exacerbation or emergence of mental health problems, which impacted on their transition to young adulthood;and young people and their caregivers experienced a deepening of caregiver relationships, which enhanced the transition of the care leaver.Services must continue to facilitate progress towards independence and promote personal and caregiver well-being. Support service for care leavers with intellectual disabilities should be essential services, offered in person or online while adhering to COVID-19 regulations. Caregivers should be trained in continuing independent and interdependent living programmes for care leavers in their care, supported through in person or online training, mentoring and supervision. Service continuity is recommended to avoid the contraction of young people's social world at a time when it should be opening up.

"Mental health innovative solutions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic","Purpose This study aims to explore worldwide innovative solutions that have been proposed to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on people's mental health. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative methodology is adopted, which performs an exploratory study considering the innovative projects identified by the Observatory for Public Sector Innovation framework. Additionally, the analysis of the relevance and characteristics of these projects are explored considering a multidimensional framework composed of five dimensions: novelty level;social need;improvement of society;sector neutrality;and level of emergence. Findings The findings reveal that the number of projects in the field of mental health is low, despite their strong relevance to their communities. These projects arise from a strong social need to protect especially the most vulnerable groups in this pandemic and involve a large number of partners in the public sector, business and civil society. The role of volunteering in the revitalization and growth of these initiatives is also recognized. Originality/value This study is relevant in both the theoretical and practical dimensions. It allows the exploration of these projects considering the dimensions of social innovation and offers practical implications that allow these projects to be replicated in other countries and regions.","Rocha, A.; Almeida, F.","https://doi.org/10.1108/jstpm-11-2020-0165","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management; ahead-of-print(ahead-of-print):19, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management; ahead-of-print(ahead-of-print):19, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16273,""
"â€œA Year in Review: Sleep Dysfunction and Psychological Distress in Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemicâ€","The Covid-19 outbreak has taken a substantial toll on the mental and physical wellbeing of healthcare workers (HCWs), impacting healthcare systems at a global scale. One year into the pandemic, the need to establish the prevalence of sleep dysfunction and psychological distress in the face of COVID-19, identify risk and protective factors and explore effective countermeasures remains of critical importance. Despite implicit limitations relating to the quality of available studies, a plethora of evidence to-date suggests that a considerable proportion of HCWs experience significant sleep disturbances (estimated to afflict every two in five HCWs) as well as mood symptoms (with more than one in five reporting high levels of depression or anxiety). Younger age, female gender, frontline status, fear or risk of infection, occupation, current or past mental health concerns, and a lower level of social support were all associated with a greater risk of disturbed sleep and adverse psychological outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss the link between sleep deprivation, susceptibility to viral infections and psychosocial wellbeing, in relevance to COVID-19 and summarize the existing evidence regarding the presence and predictors of traumatic stress/PTSD and burnout in HCWs. Finally, we highlight the role of resilience and tailored interventions in order to mitigate vulnerability and prevent long-term physical and psychological implications. Indeed, promoting psychological resilience through an enhanced social support network has proven crucial for HCWs in coping under these strenuous circumstances. Future research should aim to provide high quality information on the long-term consequences and the effectiveness of applied interventions.","Pappa, Sofia, Sakkas, Nikolaos, Sakka, Elpitha","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.07.009","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Sleep Medicine;2021.; Publication details: Sleep Medicine;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16274,""
"Is psychological flexibility a mediator between perceived stress and general anxiety or depression among suspected patients of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)?","This study is aimed to investigate the status of general anxiety and depression among suspected patients of COVID-19 and explore whether psychological flexibility can serve as a mediator between perceived stress and general anxiety or depression. Total of 180 participants completed the online questionnaire which comprised demographic information, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 9-item Patients Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II) and the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (CFQ). Statistical methods including correlation analysis, multiple linear regression analysis and structural equation model were used in this study. The scores of 23.9% (43/180) and 34.4% (62/180) of participants were higher than the cut points of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 respectively. Psychological flexibility was significantly correlated with perceived stress, general anxiety and depression. Multiple regression analyses showed the possible mediation effect of psychological flexibility between perceived stress and general anxiety or depression. The structural equation model confirmed that psychological flexibility partially mediated between perceived stress and general anxiety or depression. Our findings suggested the potential benefit of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) as a psychological support approach in suspected patients of COVID-19 because ACT targets psychological flexibility.","Huang, Chi, Xie, Jiaying, Owusua, Theresah, Chen, Zhiheng, Wang, Jiangang, Qin, Chunxiang, He, Qingnan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111132","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Personality and Individual Differences;: 111132, 2021.; Publication details: Personality and Individual Differences;: 111132, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16275,""
"Prevalence, severity and distribution of depression and anxiety symptoms using observational data collected before and nine months into the COVID-19 pandemic","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by substantial increases in adverse mental health, particularly among the young. However, it remains unclear to what extent increases in population scores on mental health assessments are due to changes in prevalence, rather than severity of symptoms. Further, it is not obvious that widely used assessments of aggregate symptoms retain their typical interpretation during an event that directly disrupts behavior. Methods Pre-pandemic data on workers age 18-69y in the 2019 National Health Interview Survey are reweighted to match distributions of demographic characteristics of Duke University employees surveyed nine months into the pandemic. The latter population was at low risk of infection or economic insecurity. Prevalence, severity, and scores for each of nine symptoms are compared overall and by age group. Outcomes Elevated psychological distress is primarily driven by increases in prevalence of particular symptoms. Prevalence of trouble concentrating increased six-fold from 9.6% to 72.5%. Other symptoms increased by over one-third;feeling anxious, having little interest, feeling depressed, sleep problems and being irritable, while some symptoms rose only 10% or less. Severity also increased but magnitudes are small relative to prevalence changes. Escalation in prevalence and severity are greatest for the youngest. Interpretation Some of the least prevalent symptoms pre-pandemic became the most prevalent during the pandemic, affecting interpretation of indices validated pre-pandemic. Clinical and policy interventions should focus on specific symptoms that increased including trouble concentrating and anxiety.

"Correlation between anxiety-depression symptoms and immune characteristics in inpatients with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is widely acknowledged as a severe traumatic event, and depression, anxiety, and psychological distress are common in diagnosed patients. However, the correlations of biological indicators with emotion are rarely reported. The primary objective of this study was to explore the dysfunction of immune-inflammatory characteristics in patients with depression-anxiety symptoms. Methods We investigated the mental status of inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and compared the differences in cytokines and lymphocytes between patients with and without depression-anxiety symptoms at admission. After two weeks of treatment, we evaluated the mental conditions and measured the cytokines and lymphocytes of the patients with depression and anxiety symptoms and explored the changes and their associations. Results Approximately half of the patients with COVID-19 had depression and anxiety symptoms, and the symptoms were related to the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ and the level of CD4+ T lymphocytes. When compared with patients without depression-anxiety symptoms, CD4+ T lymphocytes level was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with depression-anxiety symptoms. Conclusion This study provided novel evidence regarding the association between depression and anxiety symptoms and immune characteristics, especially CD4+ T lymphocyte levels, in COVID-19 patients. We emphasized the importance of paying attention to the dynamic immune process of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with depression/anxiety.","Wu, Congchong, Zhou, Zhiying, Ni, Li, Cao, Jiang, Tan, Meifang, Wu, Xiu, Hu, Jianbo, Xu, Yi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.07.027","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16277,""
"Dissociating compulsive washing and hoarding tendencies through differences in comorbidities and the content of concerns","Clinical compulsive washing and hoarding are intercorrelated and share comorbidities even though they are distinct and appear to manifest through opposing extremes of cleanliness and disorder (respectively). We attempted to resolve this paradox by testing five hypotheses in online, non-clinical samples (Nstudy 1=123, Nstudy 2=177, Nstudy 3=217). We replicated the intercorrelation of washing and hoarding tendencies in all studies, despite observing non-clinical individual differences. Both washing and hoarding were associated with anxiety, depression, and fears of social rejection and failure, but they were also distinguishable. Compulsive washing was associated with greater anxiety, disgust, perceptions of infection vulnerability, and the desire to organize a cluttered space, whereas hoarding was associated with reduced concerns about germs and full or cluttered spaces and higher concerns about assault, threats to safety, and insects. A third study tested and confirmed the hypothesis that washing and hoarding may be related because they are adaptive in combination during stressful conditions, like a global pandemic. During COVID-19, washing and hoarding tendencies were even more strongly interrelated, and disease-avoidant behaviors like wearing a mask and avoiding people increased with washing tendencies but decreased with hoarding tendencies. Overlapping psychopathological states can be distinguished even in non-clinical samples through psychopathological profiles and the content of concernsâ€”that shift with one's context. Treatment may benefit from not only working to cease undesirable behaviors but also from ameliorating root fears and anxieties that are dissociable by condition and individual but not always linked to the behavioral expression.","Liu, Tingting, Ackerman, Joshua M.; Preston, Stephanie D.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbct.2021.05.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Behavioral and Cognitive Therapy;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Behavioral and Cognitive Therapy;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16278,""
"Fear and Anxiety in the Face of COVID-19: Negative Dispositions Towards Risk and Uncertainty As Vulnerability Factors","In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic it is important to identify factors that make people particularly vulnerable of developing mental-health issues in order to provide case-specific treatments. In this article, we examine the roles of two psychological constructs â€“ originally put forth in the behavioral decision sciences â€“ in predicting interindividual differences in fear responses: general risk aversion (GRA) and intolerance of uncertainty (IU). We first provide a review of these constructs and illustrate why they may play important roles in shaping anxiety-related disorders. Thereafter we present an empirical study that collected survey data from 550 U.S. residents, comprising self-assessments of dispositions towards risk and uncertainty, anxiety- and depression levels, as well as demographic variables â€“ to thus test the extent to which these psychological constructs are predictive of strong fear responses related to COVID-19 (i.e., mortal fear, racing heart). The results from Bayesian multi-model inference analyses showed that GRA and IU were more powerful predictors of fear responses than demographic variables. Moreover, the predictive power of these constructs was independent of general anxiety- and depression levels. Subsequent mediation analyses showed that the effects of GRA and IU were both direct and indirect via anxiety. We conclude by discussing possible treatment options, but also highlight that future research needs to further examine causal pathways and conceptual overlaps.","Millroth, Philip, Frey, Renato","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102454","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Anxiety Disorders;: 102454, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Anxiety Disorders;: 102454, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16279,""
"An international study on psychological coping during COVID-19: Towards a meaning-centered coping style","Background/Objective: This study examined the role of different psychological coping mechanisms in mental and physical health during the initial phases of the COVID-19 crisis with an emphasis on meaning-centered coping. Method: A total of 11,227 people from 30 countries across all continents participated in the study and completed measures of psychological distress (depression, stress, and anxiety), loneliness, well-being, and physical health, together with measures of problem-focused and emotion-focused coping, and a measure called the Meaning-centered Coping Scale (MCCS) that was developed in the present study. Validation analyses of the MCCS were performed in all countries, and data were assessed by multilevel modeling (MLM). Results: The MCCS showed a robust one-factor structure in 30 countries with good test-retest, concurrent and divergent validity results. MLM analyses showed mixed results regarding emotion and problem-focused coping strategies. However, the MCCS was the strongest positive predictor of physical and mental health among all coping strategies, independently of demographic characteristics and country-level variables. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the MCCS is a valid measure to assess meaning-centered coping. The results also call for policies promoting effective coping to mitigate collective suffering during the pandemic.

"Mental Health and Well-being of Indigenous People during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh","Background The ongoing pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus and the subsequent containment strategies has taken a heavy toll on the mental health of people irrespective of age, gender, race, ethnicity, and geographical location. Studies have documented the mental health status of non-indigenous Bangladeshi people, but little attention has been paid during the pandemic to the investigation of the mental health status of indigenous people living in remote hilly areas. To address this gap the present study aimed at investigating the prevalence and accompanying risk factors of depression, anxiety, stress, and compromised well-being among indigenous people during the pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 422 indigenous people aged between 16 and 90 using the 21-item Bangla Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (BDASS-21) and the Bangla version of the WHO-5 Well-being Index from January 30 to April 10, 2021. Data were collected by trained research assistants from three remote hilly areas namely Bandarban, Rangamati, and Khagracchari in the Chattogram Hill Tracts (CHT). Chi-squares, logistic regression, and ANOVA were performed to examine the association of variables. Results The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, stress, and low well-being among the indigenous population during the pandemic was found to be 49.3%, 47.2%, 36.7%, and 50.9%, respectively. Risk predictors for depression, anxiety, and stress included age, ethnicity, geographical locations, educational attainment, occupation, and marital status. Conclusions The results suggest that the ongoing pandemic has led to the rise of common mental health problems among indigenous people during the pandemic. The results can contribute to the formation of mental health policy for indigenous people and the development of suitable mental health intervention strategies especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Faruk, Md Omar, Ching, Umay, Chowdhury, Kamal Uddin Ahmed","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07582","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Heliyon;: e07582, 2021.; Publication details: Heliyon;: e07582, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16281,""
"P-EP021 Impact of COVID-19 on people with epilepsy: Understanding their needs","Introduction. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with the implementation of the movement control order (MCO) resulted in unprecedented loss of access to healthcare in Malaysia. This study aimed to identify the impact of COVID-19 on people with epilepsy (PWE) in terms of their clinical, logistics and psychological aspects. Methods. This is a cross-sectional anonymized web-based study on PWE in University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) and Malaysia Epilepsy Society. An online questionnaire was used to assess the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 to the epilepsy patients, including Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE- 31). Results. 461 patients were included in this study, with a mean age of 39.21Â±15.88 years, majority female (50.1%), with focal epilepsy (54.0%), and experienced seizures at least once yearly (62.5%). There were 11.1% reported increased seizure frequency during COVID period. The associated factors of increased seizure frequency during COVID period included focal seizures, baseline seizures frequency &gt;1 per month, unemployed status, lower education, and precipitating factors such as inadequate sleep and stress. There were 30.2% worried of seizure worsening due to difficulty in re-scheduling clinic appointments, 28.9% were afraid of going to the emergency unit, 11.5% had self-adjusted medication dosages to avoid running out of supply. A significant number experienced anxiety (27.6%) and depression (18.8%), which were correlated with poorer quality of life (pÂ =Â 0.01). Conclusion. This study highlights the clinical and psychological impacts of the COVID-19 on PWE in Malaysia.","Yi Koh, May, Lim, Kheng-Seang, Fong, Si-Lei, Bao Khor, Si, Tan, Chong-Tin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2021.02.183","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Clinical Neurophysiology; 132(8):e84-e85, 2021.; Publication details: Clinical Neurophysiology; 132(8):e84-e85, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16282,""

"Development and implementation of COVID-19 safety protocols for conducting a randomized trial in global mental health: Field report from Central India","The COVID-19 pandemic impacted ongoing clinical trials globally resulting in the suspension, cancellation or a transition to an entirely remote implementation of studies. In India, the countrywide lockdown was imposed in phases starting from March 2020 to June 2020, followed by continued restriction on in-person activities including study procedures which halted the ESSENCE (Enabling translation of Science to Service to ENhance Depression CarE) trial activities such as recruitment, consenting, baseline assessment, digital training orientation, face to face training and end-line assessment evaluation. This situation made it imperative for us to amend our procedures in order to mitigate the risk and address safety requirements for participants and the research team. In this paper, we discuss the need, development and implementation of the protocols focused on risk reduction and safety enhancement with an objective to resume and continue the research activities while ensuring safety of study participants and research staff. These protocols comprise of guidelines and recommendations based on existing literature tailored according to different components in each arm of our trial such as guidelines for supervisors, travelers, training/recruitment venue safety procedures, individual safety procedures;and procedures to implement the study activities. These protocols can be adapted by researchers to conduct research trials during pandemics such as COVID 19.","Joshi, Udita, Khan, Azaz, Muke, Shital, Choubey, Shivangi, Tugnawat, Deepak, Naslund, John A.; Bhan, Anant","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102750","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Asian Journal of Psychiatry;: 102750, 2021.; Publication details: Asian Journal of Psychiatry;: 102750, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16285,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Drug Use and Harm Reduction Programming in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Region: a Regional Consultation of Stakeholders and People Who Use Drugs","The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has witnessed a slow but steady increase in the harm reduction response since 2016. It is likely that such gains are threatened by the impact of COVID-19. Very little is known about the health response and situation of people who use drugs (PWUD) during the pandemic in the region. A mixed method study was conducted by the MENA Harm Reduction Association (MENAHRA) to assess the situation of PWUD and impacts on harm reduction services during COVID-19. Twelve countries and two regional viewpoints responded to the survey. A virtual focus group was held with the MENA Network of People who Use Drugs (MENANPUD) focal points (n = 11). The study highlights how COVID-19 aggravated existing marginalization and stigmatization of PWUD and other key populations in the MENA region, with government level resourcing severely impacted by COVID-19. It further illustrates the commitment by harm reduction non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in diversifying their response, particularly through mobile outreach to drug hot spots, and the reliance of technology to support awareness raising, telemedicine, and medicine supplies. Positive shifts are observed in harm reduction policy by governments in some MENA countries and the continued commitment to support PWUD communities by existing harm reduction NGOs. Continued advocacy for and implementation of harm reduction responses at the domestic and regional levels should be underpinned by inclusion in state health emergency planning and disease control efforts, awareness raising around innovation and telemedicine to support health and NGO support systems and medicine supply chains, resourcing of NGOs, and provision of economic support for PWUD, disease surveillance, and research.

"CONFINEMENT AND ANXIETY IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN THE MEXICANS SOUTHEAST DURING THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC","The anxiety levels of young Mexican university students were analyzed regarding the #Quedateencasa (#Stayhome) recommendation during phase 3 of the Covid-19 epidemic. For this, the Beck anxiety test was applied, obtaining a reliability of .931.709 students from public and private universities in southeast Mexico participated. The mean age was 21 years, 62.7% women and 37.3% men. Student's ""t"" and Spearman's Rho tests were used with the SPSS software for data analysis. It was found that 37.7% of the participants were located at the high level of anxiety, 30.3% were located at low levels, which means that more than half of the university students in the sample (62.3%) are located at moderate or high levels of anxiety. anxiety. There are significant differences by gender (p &lt;0.05), with women having a higher average. It is concluded that university students in conditions of confinement and social distancing present high levels of anxiety, it is essential to translate scientific knowledge into pragmatic public health measures in a timely manner, anticipating a second outbreak or epidemic on people's mental health.","Perez-Aranda, G.

"Functional stroke-like presentations in the time of COVID-19","Recent international studies describe the emergence of adverse psychological affects for some patients with COVID-19 and worsening mental health for those with pre-existing functional neurological disorders (FND). Though New Zealand has been relatively spared from the pandemic, locally there have been a noticeable spike in the numbers of patients presenting with functional stroke-like symptoms. The diagnosis of FND is challenging;clinical features include a history atypical for organic pathology and physical examination may demonstrate give-way weakness, a Hoover's sign and inconsistent neurological examination findings, particularly when compared with what the patient can perform when distracted. The cause of FND is unknown but may be associated with psychological stresses. Between 1 January to 31 August 2020, there are 24 admissions with stroke-like symptoms in 22 patients who had a final diagnosis of FND. This is in contrast to 5 admissions with FND over the same period in 2019. 9 of the patients admitted with FND acknowledged recent psychological stressors which may have contributed to their symptoms. It was found that an early explanation of the diagnosis, using the term 'functional weakness', demonstrating inconsistencies in examination to reinforce the 'functional' nature of the condition, validating the illness and explaining the overall good prognosis, is well received by patients. In addition to the economic hardship, the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be having an adverse impact on societal health and wellbeing. The volume of patients and healthcare resource implications of FND pose a significant public health issue, and may exacerbate once the full economic impact of COVID-19 is realised. The solution may lie in preventative and remedial action: a focus on societal wellbeing and mental health in the community, educating healthcare professionals on the condition and providing adequate mental health and rehabilitation support in the early recovery period.","Mahawish, K.

"The Intermediary Role of Loneliness in the Relationship between COVID-19 Stress and Maladaptive Coping among People with Disabilities and Chronic Health Conditions","Social distancing currently in place to reduce community spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in negative structural, social, psychological, and financial consequences. Loneliness is linked to adverse mental health and health outcomes, and facing COVID-19 can increase feelings of stress and loneliness. In this study, we aimed to gain a better understanding of how COVID-19 affects mental health in vulnerable populations. Data from 269 individuals with disabilities and chronic conditions (mean age 39.37;56.1% male;84.0% white) were collected to understand whether loneliness mediates the relationship between perceived COVID-19 stress and maladaptive COVID-19 coping strategies among people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. The findings suggest that loneliness serves as a partial mediator between perceived COVID-19 stress and maladaptive COVID-19 coping. Implications of the findings for public health and rehabilitation intervention for individuals with disabilities are discussed. Â© 2021 National Rehabilitation Association.

"Perceived COVID-19 Impacts on Stress, Resilience, and Mental Health among People with Multiple Sclerosis: A Longitudinal Prospective Study","Background: Relative to the general population, people with disabilities and chronic illnesses are in greater danger of contracting COVID-19 and for experiencing severe complications. Although it is established that people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) are at increased risk for infection and complications due to immunocompromise, use of immunosuppressive therapies, and MS-related comorbidities, there has been relatively little longitudinal research on the psychosocial response of PwMS to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We used an online survey to collect data before and during the pandemic. Using self-report measures, we investigated changes in psychological well-being, perceived stress, resilience, anxiety, and depression in response to the pandemic. Results: One hundred thirty-three respondents participated in the study. Participants had significantly increased negative feelings and depression when perceiving higher stress (e.g., irritability, lack of joy) and resilience (e.g., spiritual belief). Conclusions: The pandemic has affected mental health and psychosocial adjustment for PwMS. We found specific pandemic impacts on stress perception, resilience, and mental health. It is valuable to understand the different impacts of the pandemic on PwMS living in the community regarding transactional interpretations of stress, ways to keep resilient, and emotional responses.

"The evaluation of the early impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the export of fishery commodities of Turkey","Increasing attempts have been directed to understand the negative impacts of COVID-19 on different components of human life across the World. Fisheries and aquaculture sectors which are important sectors with high potential for export in the Turkish economy were immediately hit by the crisis. In this study, therefore, the early impacts of the COVID-19 on the export of aquatic products of Turkey were evaluated by using export data on quantity (kg) and customs value (USD) of the aquatic products belong to the first quarter period of 2019 and 2020. Fisher quantity index and price index showed that the mean values of exported products in both quantity and customs were decreased by 3.79% and 4.22% from 2019 to 2020, respectively. Drill-down analysis of export statistics showed that fresh Sea bass, Sea bream, Bluefin tuna, Carp were main exported products and Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Russia, Greece, and Japan were main exported countries that determined the way and strength of the Turkish export on aquatic products. Their exports from 2019 to 2020 were changed as -7.89% (in quantity) and -7.43% (in customs value-USD). Frozen sea cucumber exported to China, Hong Kong, and the USA was decreased by 56.07%, 24%, and 5.5%, respectively. The export of frozen or fresh crab, shrimp, lobster, frozen fillet (trout, sea bream and sea bass) and live fish (sea bream and sea bass) were also decreased by 31.08% and 48.55%, respectively. In contrast to the general decrease, the quantity of fresh, live, and frozen snails, mussels, octopus, squid and cuttlefish exported to South Korea, Greece, and China was increased by 58.59%. Also, the export of dried, salted, or pickled and smoked fish (7.24% in quantity), canned aquatic products (26.63% in quantity) and frozen sea bass, sea bream, and tuna fish (7.56% in quantity) were increased. In conclusion, it was clearly identified that, in general, the products exported as mostly canned, frozen, and smoked fish have experienced an increase in demand. However, these increases have not been compensated for the decreases in demand for other products, yet. In that chaotic situation, therefore, the Turkish government should immediately fund the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. In the context of risk management, the government also should make new arrangements and promotions for processing industries (enhancing the capacity both in volume and in product variety) to protect and improve fishing and aquaculture sectors in the mid and long term.","Can, M.

"Mental and physical health in general population during COVID-19: Systematic review and narrative synthesis","Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 changed the normality of daily life. Due to mobility restriction measures, physical and mental health in general population became a remarkable concern for researchers and health professionals. Material and methods: This article briefly reviews the evidence of mental and physical health consequences during COVID-19 pandemic. The review was conducted in October 2020 through PubMed and Web of Science with the searching frame: Mental health and Physical health and COVID-19. The study selection process followed the PRISMA flow diagram. Results: The reported mental consequences were mainly negative psychological effects including stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression. The total physical activity in MET- minutes/week demonstrated a statistically significant reduction between before and during COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, males showed higher significant variation of Delta-MET compared with females (p &lt; 0.001). Also, the reduction of total physical activity was related to worse psychological well-being (r = 0.07541, p &lt; 0.001).

"Onsite Chlorination of Greywater in a Vertical Flow Constructed Wetlandâ€”Significance of Trihalomethane Formation","To reduce public health hazards, greywater reuse may involve disinfection, which is often performed through chlorination. The formation of toxic disinfection by-products is a negative side-effect of chlorineâ€™s reaction with organic matter, of which trihalomethanes (THM) are one of the most dominant (though not most toxic) groups. Greywater treatment in vertical flow constructed wetlands leads to a decrease in dissolved organic matter. We hypothesized that these dissolved organic carbon (DOC) changes would be reflected in differences in THM formation. Greywater samples, at different treatment levels (i.e., decreasing organic matter content), were exposed to 5 mg/L of chlorine for 1 h. THM formation in raw greywater samples was significantly lower than in the more treated (recirculated) samples, despite their significantly higher DO concentrations. This trend was verified in six different systems. Furthermore, this was also shown when greywater was exposed to higher chlorine doses (25 and 50 mg/L). It is suggested that the increase in THM formation for longer recirculated water is the result of two factors: competition between a higher number of reactive sites in the raw waterâ€™s organic matter, which leads to smaller THM yields, and changes in the abundance of THM formation moieties in the recirculated waterâ€™s DOC. The latter was reflected in the SUVA increase in the treated water. Overall, THM formation, following treated greywater chlorination at the lower chlorine concentration studied, is not expected to pose an environmental health risk when the water is reused for irrigation.","Bernstein, Anat, Hagar, Siebner, Kaufman, Andrew G.","https://doi.org/10.3390/w13070903","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Water; 13(7):903, 2021.; Publication details: Water; 13(7):903, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16301,""
"Visual Quality Assessment of Urban Scenes with the Contemplative Landscape Model: Evidence from a Compact City Downtown Core","In the face of rapid urbanization and the growing burden of mental health disease, there is a need to design cities with consideration for human mental health and well-being. There is an emerging body of evidence on the importance of everyday environmental exposures regarding the mental health of city inhabitants. For example, contemplative landscapes, through a series of neuroscience experiments, were shown to trigger improved mood and restoration of attention. While the Contemplative Landscape Model (CLM) for scoring landscape views was applied to single images, its suitability was never tested for walking paths and areas with a diversity of viewpoints. This study aims to fill this gap using the high-density downtown of Singapore, also known as a â€œCity in a Gardenâ€ for its advanced urban greening strategies, as a case study. In this study, 68 360Â° photos were taken along four popular walking paths every 20 m. A photo set of 204 items was created by extracting three view angles from each photo. Each of them was independently scored by three experts and average CLM scores for each view and path were obtained. The results were then fed into an open-source Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) for visualization. Cohenâ€™s kappa agreement between expertsâ€™ scores was computed. The outcomes were mapped to facilitate the identification of the most contemplative viewpoints and paths. Moreover, specific contemplative landscape patterns have been distinguished and assessed allowing the recommendation of design strategies to improve the quality of viewpoints and paths. The inter-rater agreement reached substantial to perfect values. CLM is a reliable and suitable tool that enables the fine-grained assessment and improvement of the visual quality of the urban living environments with consideration of the mental health and well-being of urbanites. It can be used at a larger scale owing to 360Â° photos taken from the pedestrianâ€™s point of view. Utilizing spatially explicit maps in QGIS platforms enables a wider range of visualizations and allows for spatial patterns to be revealed that otherwise would have remained hidden. Our findings demonstrate the usefulness of our semi-automated method. Furthermore, given the high inter-rater agreement observed, we suggest that there is potential in developing fully automated methods.","Hou, Yanru, Masoudi, Mahyar, Chadala, Agnieszka, Olszewska-Guizzo, Agnieszka","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12213517","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Remote Sensing; 12(21):3517, 2020.; Publication details: Remote Sensing; 12(21):3517, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16302,""
"Perceived Stress and Increased Food Consumption during the â€˜Third Waveâ€™ of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of people worldwide. An increase in perceived stress can lead to unhealthy behaviors such as increased food consumption. The aim of this study was to find the level of perceived stress and its relationship with increased food consumption during the â€œthird waveâ€ of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. This was a cross-sectional study that employed anonline self-reported frequency of consumption questionnaire and the Perceived Stress Scale-10. A total of 637 subjects participated and 83.6% of respondents had moderate or high stressâ€”more prevalent in the female and young respondents. Moreover, 36.1% of respondents reported that they had increased the frequency of consumption of some foods, mainly nuts, snacks, and jellybeans, along with coffee, tea, cocoa, and soft drinks. Eating between meals was more pronounced in those with high stress (65.1%) than in those with moderate stress (40.4%) and low stress (20.2%). Furthermore, the respondents with high stress reported greater weight gain. Thus, the results show that the level of perceived stress during the â€˜third waveâ€™ of this pandemic increased food consumption.","SÃ¡nchez-SÃ¡nchez, Eduardo, DÃ­az-Jimenez, Jara, Rosety, Ignacio, AlfÃ©rez, Maria JosÃ© M.; DÃ­az, Antonio JesÃºs, Rosety, Miguel Angel, Ordonez, Francisco Javier, Rosety-Rodriguez, Manuel","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13072380","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Nutrients; 13(7):2380, 2021.; Publication details: Nutrients; 13(7):2380, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16303,""
"Psychological Distress among Students in Higher Education: One Year after the Beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the psychological well-being of students. Several stressors (such as socioeconomic and education-related contexts) could influence mental health, as well as individual and relational dimensions. This study proposes to evaluate the predictive effect of these factors on anxiety and depressive symptoms among students in higher education one year after the beginning of the pandemic. A sample of 23,307 students (Mage = 20.89;SD = 1.96;69.08% of women) was assessed through an online self-report questionnaire including adapted and validated measures. The main rates were as follows: 50.6% of students presented anxiety symptoms;55.1% reported depressive symptoms;20.8% manifested suicidal ideations;42.4% saw their financial situation deteriorate;39.1% felt they were dropping out of school. One year after the beginning of the pandemic, students in higher education are anxious and depressed, especially those who identify as women (for both anxiety and depression) and as a non-binary gender (only for anxiety), experience a deterioration in their financial situation, are dropping out of school, or manifest hostility (for both anxiety and depression). The degree of study affects the symptomsâ€™ severity (Bachelor 2 and 3 for anxiety and Master for depression). Contact with family and friends (for both anxiety and depression) as well as regular physical activity (only for depression) should provide some protection against psychological distress. Policy-makers must make a long-term investment in the well-being and positive mental health of the student community.","Schmits, Emilie, Dekeyser, Sarah, Klein, Olivier, Luminet, Olivier, Yzerbyt, Vincent, Glowacz, Fabienne","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147445","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7445, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7445, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16304,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic as a Traumatic Event and Its Associations with Fear and Mental Health: A Cognitive-Activation Approach","The COVID-19 global pandemic still represents a major threat with detrimental health consequences. Analyzing the psychological outcomes, COVID-19 could be interpreted as a collective traumatic event that can generate symptoms related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Considering this, the purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to investigate the relationship between intrusive thoughts and fear related to the COVID-19 pandemic and between intrusive thoughts and mental health;second, to test the mediating role of hyperarousal and avoidance in these two relationships. In order to reach these aims, the present study investigated these relationships and tested a mediation model in two cross-sectional studies in Italy. Altogether, 627 individuals and 495 workers completed an online survey for study 1 and study 2, respectively. Mediation analyses were performed via the SPSS macro PROCESS;the significance of total, direct, and indirect effect was tested via bootstrapping. The results showed that within the PTSD framework, hyperarousal compared with avoidance mediated the relationship between intrusion and the analyzed outcomes. In conclusion, the present study provided empirical evidence for the influence of hyperarousal on individual consequences such as fear of COVID-19 and mental health. Research, as well as theoretical and practical implications, are discussed.","Sanchez-Gomez, Martin, Giorgi, Gabriele, Finstad, Georgia Libera, Urbini, Flavio, Foti, Giulia, Mucci, Nicola, Zaffina, Salvatore, LeÃ³n-Perez, JosÃ© M.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147422","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7422, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7422, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16305,""
"The Lived Experiences of COVID-19 Patients in South Korea: A Qualitative Study","The purpose of this qualitative study is to provide an in-depth understanding and description of the disease experiences of COVID-19 patients. The participants were 16 patients discharged from hospitals after receiving treatment for COVID-19 in isolation. Data collection was conducted through individual in-depth interviews until data saturation, and the interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using Colaizziâ€™s phenomenological method. The participants were quarantined after their COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed, and they experienced desperate and uncertain times during treatment. The participants expressed shock and dissatisfaction due to an excessive invasion of privacy during the quarantine process and in the quarantine system. As confirmed COVID-19 cases, the participants experienced social stigma and feelings of guilt, negative attitudes from others and society, and negative influences from social networking services and the media. The participants also experienced mental and physical difficulties due to COVID-19 symptoms. However, they rediscovered meaningful relationships through the support of their family and friends in the midst of adversity. It is necessary to provide an integrated psychosocial rehabilitation program to reduce social stigma and improve the resilience of COVID-19 patients.","Son, Haeng-Mi, Choi, Won-Hee, Hwang, Young-Hui, Yang, Hye-Ryun","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147419","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7419, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7419, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16306,""
"The Transformational Experience of Junior Nurses Resulting from Providing Care to COVID-19 Patients: From Facing Hurdles to Achieving Psychological Growth","The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has put significant pressure on junior nursing staff. The objective of this study was to examine the in-depth experiences of junior nurses in providing care for COVID-19 patients within an acute care setting. This study employed a phenomenological method to understand the situation from a first-person perspective. Purposive sampling was used. Interviews were performed with 40 junior nurses (&lt;4 years of clinical experience) who provided direct care to COVID-19 patients in isolation wards in acute care settings in Hong Kong. The interviews were conducted from 1 January 2021 to 24 May 2021 via virtual conferencing software (Zoom) to maintain social distancing, and the responses were analysed using Colaizziâ€™s seven-step method. Junior nursesâ€™ psychological experiences of providing direct care to COVID-19 patients were categorised into four main themes. First, there were hurdles in the early stages, in which participants experienced negative emotions, such as fear, anxiety, helplessness, and fatigue. Somatic symptoms, such as headaches and sleep disturbance, were reported. Second, the adoption of self-care coping strategies enabled nurses to confront the hurdles, signifying the start of self-transformation. Third, junior nurses maintained positivity under pressure by appreciating their sources of support (including their families and other important relationships in their lives). Professionalism was also found to reinforce positivity. Fourth, self-transformation resulted in psychological growth, which prepared junior nurses to be resilient and confident in their clinical practice to take up future challenges in the ongoing battle against the pandemic. The hurdles experienced by junior nurses at the early stage of their work in isolation wards provided the foundation upon which self-transformation took place. Being able to employ self-care coping strategies and further sustain positivity characterised the self-transformation process. Eventually, junior nurses became resilient and more capable of understanding both the negativity and positivity of their experiences. The self-transformation process also enabled junior nurses to recognise and appreciate the wider support system from various parties in society.","Yip, Yuk-Chiu, Yip, Ka-Huen, Tsui, Wai-King","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147383","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7383, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7383, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16307,""
"Stress and Associated Factors among Frontline Healthcare Workers in the COVID-19 Epicenter of Da Nang City, Vietnam","Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in the COVID-19 response have a higher risk of experiencing psychosocial distress amidst the pandemic. Between July and September 2020, a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic appeared in Vietnam with Da Nang city being the epicenter. During the outbreak, HCWs were quarantined within the health facilities in a bid to limit the spread of COVID-19 to their respective communities. Using the stress component of the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), we assessed the level of stress among HCWs in Da Nang city. Between 30 August and 15 September 2020, 746 frontline HCWs were recruited to fill in an online structured questionnaire. Overall, 44.6% of participants experienced increased stress and 18.9% severe or extremely severe stress. In multivariable analysis, increased stress was associated with longer working hours (OR = 1.012;95% CI: 1.004â€“1.019), working in health facilities providing COVID-19 treatment (OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.04â€“2.39), having direct contact with patients or their bio-samples (physicians, nurses and laboratory workers;OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.02â€“1.99), low confidence in the available personal protective equipment (OR = 0.846;95% CI: 0.744â€“0.962) and low knowledge on COVID-19 prevention and treatment (OR = 0.853;95% CI: 0.739â€“0.986). In conclusion, many frontline HCWs experienced increased stress during the COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang city. Reducing working time, providing essential personal protective equipment and enhancing the knowledge on COVID-19 will help to reduce this stress. Moreover, extra support is needed for HCWs who are directly exposed to COVID-19 patients.","Nguyen, Nhan Phuc Thanh, Le, Duong Dinh, Colebunders, Robert, Siewe Fodjo, Joseph Nelson, Tran, Trung Dinh, Vo, Thang Van","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147378","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7378, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7378, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16308,""
"Investigating the relationship between job stress and coronary mental health (Covid Virus 19) in Iranian companies and families","The main purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between job stress and coronary artery health (Covid virus 19) in Iranian companies and families. Methods: 241 employees (214 males and 27 females) were selected from the employees of Iranian companies using Cochran's formula by stratified random sampling method and using the Helrigel job stress questionnaire. And Slocum, the Stress Response Styles Questionnaire (CISS) and the Goldberg - Hiller General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) were evaluated. The obtained data were statistically evaluated using path analysis method. Results: The findings showed that job stress and its dimensions are able to predict changes related to mental health as well as problem-oriented and emotion-oriented coping strategies of the subjects. The findings also confirmed the mediating role of coping with problem-oriented and coronary-induced stress in the relationship between job stress and mental health. Conclusions: According to the findings, mental health can be improved by increasing problem-oriented strategy by teaching the use of these types of strategies as well as reducing emotion-oriented strategies.","Homami, H.

"Leveraging Transfer Learning to Analyze Opinions, Attitudes, and Behavioral Intentions Toward COVID-19 Vaccines","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 vaccine is considered to be the most promising approach to alleviate the pandemic. However, in recent surveys, acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine has been low. To design more effective outreach interventions, there is an urgent need to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to analyze the potential of leveraging transfer learning to detect tweets containing opinions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccines, and to explore temporal trends as well as automatically extract topics across a large number of tweets. METHODS: We developed machine learning and transfer learning models to classify tweets, followed by temporal analysis and topic modeling on a dataset of COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets posted from November 01, 2020 to January 31, 2021. We used the F1 values as the primary outcome to compare the performance of machine learning and transfer learning models. The statistical values and p-values from the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test were used to assess whether users' perceptions changed over time. The main topics in tweets were extracted by latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) analysis. RESULTS: We collected 2,678,372 tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines with 841,978 unique users and annotated 5,000 tweets. The F1 values of transfer learning models were 0.792 [0.789, 0.795], 0.578 [0.572, 0.0.584], and 0.614 [0.606, 0.622] for these three tasks, which significantly outperformed the machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine). The prevalence of tweets containing attitudes and behavioral intentions varied significantly over time. Specifically, tweets containing positive behavioral intentions increased significantly in December 2020. In addition, we selected tweets in the following categories: positive attitudes, negative attitudes, positive behavioral intentions, and negative behavioral intentions. Then we identified 10 main topics and relevant terms for each category. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we provided a method to automatically analyze the public understanding of COVID-19 vaccines from real-time data in social media, which can be used to tailor educational programs and other interventions to effectively promote the public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.

"Factors Associated with College Students' Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to upend the lives of students in higher education institutions. In particular, the pandemic has had deleterious effects on students' mental health, leading to increased prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD;Healthy Minds Network & American College Health Association [HMN], 2020). Students' mental health has become a paramount concern to institutional leaders. As faculty, student affairs practitioners, administrators, and mental health providers brace for the impact of increasing numbers of students who experience mental health disorders in upcoming semesters, they may benefit from an enhanced understanding of the students who are likely to experience mental health disorders and of the roles that other stressors or supports can play in students' mental health. The unique context surrounding the pandemic may create conditions that alter previous research findings related to students' mental health. This study is to examine the associations between individual, interpersonal, institutional, health, and stress-related factors and undergraduates' risks for clinically significant MDD and GAD.","Soria, Krista M.; Horgos, Bonnie","https://doi.org/10.1353/csd.2021.0024","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of College Student Development; 62(2):236-242, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of College Student Development; 62(2):236-242, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16311,""
"How to prepare for the next pandemic: Behavioural sciences insights for practitioners and policymakers","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the challenges the world is facing right now. It has seen an unparalleled spread within a short span of time, and claimed victims in many parts of the world. As the number of confirmed cases skyrockets exponentially, a recent surge of â€˜badâ€™ behaviours such as xenophobia attacks, propagation of misinformation, and panic-buying of essential items have become increasingly commonplace. Panic and chaos reigned as the world witnessed unprecedented moves by countries to close their borders and implement strict quarantine orders in a desperate attempt to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. COVID-19 has impacted many different aspects of society, from politics and economics to the psychological well-being of citizens, and the list will continue to grow as the spread of the coronavirus persist. While it is impossible to fathom the way COVID-19 will change our usual way of life, there are prevailing concerns that the community currently faces. What are the psychological impacts of a pandemic? How do we enhance the collective resilience of the community during a pandemic? How do we cope with mental health issues during a pandemic? How do we deal with bereavement during a pandemic? How can we support healthcare workers and emergency responders during a pandemic? These are just some of many important concerns that influence the way we cope with the COVID-19 outbreak. There is therefore an urgent need to enhance our understanding and level of preparedness against Covid-19 and pandemic in general. To that end, this edited book, How to Prepare for the Next Pandemic: Behavioural Sciences Insights for Practitioners and Policymakers aims to examine the impacts pandemic have on our society from a behavioural sciences perspective, and to identify solutions that practitioners and policymakers can adopt to combat the spread of COVID-19 in this new operating environment.

"Longitudinal reduction of quality of life in patients with epilepsy and no seizure increase during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background and aims: In early 2020, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impaired medical care of chronic neurological diseases, including epilepsy. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the levels of anxiety, depression, somnolence and quality of life using validated scales in patients with epilepsy in real-life clinical practice. Methods: Self-administered scales of anxiety disorders (GAD-7), depression (NDDI-E), somnolence (Epworth Sleepiness Scale;ESS) and quality of life (QOLIE-31-P) in patients with epilepsy treated in the Refractory Epilepsy Unit of a tertiary hospital were longitudinally analyzed with Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Data were collected before the beginning (December 2019-March 2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (September 2020-January 2021). Results: 37 patients, 45.0Â±17.3 years of age, 43.2% women, epilepsy duration 23.0Â±14.9 years, number of anti-epileptic drugs 2.1Â±1.4, answered in the two periods. Significant longitudinal reduction of QOLIE-31-P scores (from 58.9Â±19.7 to 56.2Â±16.2, p=0.035) was identified. No statistically significant longitudinal changes in NDDI-E (from 12.3Â±4.3 to 13.4Â±4.4, p=0.293) or the number of seizures (from 0.9Â±1.9 to 2.5Â±6.2, p=0.125) were found.

"Cognitive and behaviorial features of a cohort of patients in COVID-19 post-acute phase","Background and aims: To define post-acute cognitive and behavioural features in a large cohort of subjects with confirmed COVID-19. Methods: 49 subjects with confirmed COVID-19 underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and a brain MRI scan within two months from hospital discharge. Frequencies of cognitive and behavioural alterations, according to the normative data, were reported. Total brain volumes were obtained. In all patients, correlations were performed between neuropsychological performances, brain volumes and the severity of acutephase respiratory symptoms at the time of hospital admission. Results: At the time of the visit, 16% of patients presented with depressive symptoms and 18% reported post-traumatic stress disorder. 45% of the total sample showed executive dysfunctions, 30% visuospatial difficulties, and 25% longterm verbal and nonverbal memory problems. The youngest patients (age&lt;50) showed the most severe profile with 75% of patients showing executive dysfunctions, 50% pure visuospatial dysfunctions and 40% primary long-term memory problems. The total sample showed a negative relationship between frontal executive performances and the severity of acute-phase respiratory symptoms at the hospital admission (r=-0.347;p&lt;0.01). No significant relationship was observed between cognitive performances and brain volume. Conclusion: Cognitive and behavioural alterations are associated with COVID-19 infection within two months from hospital discharge and were more severe in the youngest patients. The patient cognitive/behavioural disturbances were independent of their brain structural integrity. Whether these alterations are directly linked with the infection itself or with its related consequences is still to be determined, as well as whether they are reversible or part of a neurodegenerative process.","Agosta, F.; Barbieri, A.; Bernasconi, P.; Cecchetti, G.; Vabanesi, M.; Castelnovo, V.; Giacalone, G.; Falautano, M.; Rovere-Querini, P.; Roveri, L.; Filippi, M.; Canu, E.","https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14968","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: European Journal of Neurology; 28(SUPPL 1):250, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Neurology; 28(SUPPL 1):250, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16316,""
"Preventing COVID-19 Spread Using Information and Communication Technology","Without an effective vaccine, treatment, or therapy, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading like fire and claiming lives. Countries began to adopt various strategies such as lockdown, mass testing, tracing, quarantine, sanitization, isolation, and treatment to contain COVID-19. However, it was soon realized that we need to take the help of powerful technologies to combat the spread of deadly COVID-19 until a vaccine or a drug is discovered. In this article, we discuss how the use of cutting edge technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Big data, artificial intelligence (AI), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones, blockchain, robotics, autonomous ground vehicles, communication technologies in screening, testing, contact tracing, spread analysis, sanitization, and protocol enforcements can help prevent the COVID-19 spread.","Tripathy, P.

"One Health for neglected tropical diseases","The forthcoming World Health Organization road map for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) 2021-2030 recognises the complexity surrounding control and elimination of these 20 diseases of poverty. It emphasises the need for a paradigm shift from disease-specific interventions to holistic cross-cutting approaches coordinating with adjacent disciplines. The One Health approach exemplifies this shift, extending beyond a conventional model of zoonotic disease control to consider the interactions of human and animal health systems within their shared environment and the wider social and economic context. This approach can also promote sustainability and resilience within these systems. To achieve the global ambition on NTD elimination and control, political will, along with contextualised innovative scientific strategies, is required.","Laing, G.; Vigilato, M. A.

"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on people with epilepsy: An interventional study using early physical consultation","Background Telehealth use is limited in developing countries. Therefore, a modified approach with early physical consultation was designed and applied in our hospital. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of this early physical consultation in reducing the clinical and psychological impacts of COVID-19, which enabled insight into its global feasibility. Method Participants were contacted and offered early physical consultation with a neurologist. Patients who participated in the Phase 1 study on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with epilepsy and treated in our hospital were recruited. Clinical and psychological outcomes of COVID-19 were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31). Result A total of 312 patients completed this study with a mean age of 39.13Â±16.13 years, majority female (51.0%), and experienced seizures at least once yearly (64.7%). There was 12.6% who experienced seizure worsening related to the COVID-19 pandemic. After receiving early clinical intervention, 30.8% achieved better seizure control with another 51.1% had no seizure occurrence. The mean HADS anxiety score improved immediately post-intervention (5.27Â±4.32 vs. 4.79Â±4.26, p&lt;0.01), and at 2 weeks post-intervention (5.58Â±4.46 vs. 4.73Â±3.95, p&lt;0.01). The mean HADS depression score also improved immediately post-intervention (4.12Â±3.69 vs. 3.84Â±3.76, p&lt;0.05) and at 2-weeks post-intervention (4.38Â±3.81 vs. 3.73Â±3.63, p&lt;0.05). The intervention resulted in significant improvement in energy-fatigue and social function subscales in QOLIE-31 but a reduction in cognitive and medication effects subscales. Conclusion Early physical consultation with stringent precautionary measures is feasible and effective in improving the psychological outcome during COVID-19 pandemic.","Koh, May-Yi, Lim, Kheng-Seang, Fong, Si-Lei, Khor, Si-Bao, Tan, Chong-Tin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108215","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Epilepsy & Behavior;: 108215, 2021.; Publication details: Epilepsy & Behavior;: 108215, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16320,""
"How does the COVID-19 affect mental health and sleep among Chinese adolescents: A longitudinal follow-up study","Objective The Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has evolved into the largest public health event in the world. Earlier COVID-19 studies have reported that the pandemic caused widespread impacts on mental health and sleep in the general population. However, it remains largely unknown how the prevalence of mental health problems and sleep disturbance developed and interacted in adolescents at different times in the epidemic. Methods 831 teenagers (aged 14-19) underwent a longitudinal follow-up study to evaluate the prevalence of mental health problems and sleep disturbance among adolescents before, during, and after the COVID-19 breakout in China and to explore the interaction between mental health and sleep across the three measurements. The chronotype, anxiety and depression level, sleep quality, and insomnia were investigated during each measurement. Results The adolescents had delayed sleep onset and sleep offset time, longer sleep duration during the quarantine than before and after the epidemic, whereas their chronotype tended to morning type during the epidemic. Yet, the highest prevalence of anxiety, depression, poor sleeper, and insomnia symptoms were observed before but not during the COVID-19 breakout. The females and adolescents who were eveningness type showed significantly higher anxiety and depression levels, poorer sleep quality, and severe insomnia status than the males and the intermediate and morning types. Sleep disturbance was positively associated with mental problems among three measurements. Pre-measured depression level significantly predicted sleep disturbance level at follow-ups. Conclusion These findings suggested that adolescents' high prevalence of mental health and sleep problems occurred before the COVID breakout and decreased during and after the epidemic. Gender and chronotype were significant risk factors associated with affective and sleep disturbances. Depression positively predicted later sleep problems, but not vice versa.","Li, Yun, Zhou, Ying, Ru, Taotao, Niu, Jiaxing, He, Meiheng, Zhou, Guofu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.07.008","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Sleep Medicine;2021.; Publication details: Sleep Medicine;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16321,""
"The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical radiography practice: a systematic literature review and recommendations for future services planning","Introduction Worldwide, reports and experiences indicate that there has been extensive re-organisation within diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy departments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was necessary due to changes in workload and working practice guidelines that have evolved during the pandemic. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on radiography practice, service delivery and workforce wellbeing. Methods A systematic review methodology was adopted to obtain data from primary studies of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods designs from databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL], and SCOPUS: all 2020 to present). The included articles were subjected to information extraction and results-based convergent synthesis. Results The electronic database search yielded 10420 articles after removal of duplicates. Of these, 31 articles met the final inclusion criteria with some (n=8) fully focussed on radiotherapy workforce and service delivery. The pandemic impact on radiography practice is broadly themed around: training, communication, and information dissemination;infrastructure, technology, and clinical workflow;and workforce mental health and well-being. Conclusions Globally, most radiographers received inadequate training for managing COVID-19 patients during the initial acute phase of the pandemic. Additionally, there were significant changes to clinical practice, working patterns and perceived increase in workload due to surges in COVID-19 patients and the consequent strict adherence to new infection protocols. These changes, coupled with fear emanating from the increased risk of the workforce to contracting the infection, contributed to anxiety and workplace-related stress during the pandemic. Implications for practice Local pandemic response strategies must be appropriately developed from standard protocols in readiness for safe clinical practice and well-being management training of practitioners.","Akudjedu, Theophilus N.; Mishio, Nathaniel A.; Elshami, Wiam, Culp, Melissa P.; Lawal, Olanrewaju, Botwe, Benard O.; Wuni, Abdul-Razak, Julka-Anderson, Naman, Shanahan, Madeleine, Totman, D.

"The impact of the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation on job search and vacancy creation","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) increased US unemployment benefits by $600 a week. Theory predicts that FPUC should decrease job applications, while the effect on vacancy creation is ambiguous. We estimate the effect of FPUC on job applications and vacancy creation week by week, from March to July 2020, using granular data from the online jobs platform Glassdoor. We exploit variation in the proportional increase in benefits across local labor markets. To isolate the effect of FPUC, we flexibly allow for different trends in local labor markets differentially exposed to the COVID-19 crisis. We verify that trends in outcomes prior to the FPUC do not correlate with future increases in benefits, which supports our identification assumption. First, we find that a 10% increase in unemployment benefits caused a 3.6% decline in applications, but did not decrease vacancy creation;hence, FPUC increased labor market tightness (vacancies/applications). Second, we document that tightness was unusually depressed during the FPUC period. Altogether, our results imply that the positive effect of FPUC on tightness was likely welfare improving: FPUC decreased competition among applicants at a time when jobs were unusually scarce. Our results also help explain prior findings that FPUC did not decrease employment.","Marinescu, Ioana, Skandalis, DaphnÃ©, Zhao, Daniel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2021.104471","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Public Economics; 200:104471, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Public Economics; 200:104471, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16324,""
"Promising Evidence of the Role of Emotional CPR: Co-Immunity Through Community CPR","Currently, it is vital to not only to improve the social connections of numerous persons with mental health challenges, but for the connections of millions of persons fighting the psychological and physiological impacts of the COVID-19 virus. The chronic stress of isolation can lead to a prolonged fight-flight response, which inhibits our immune response. People with lived experience of recovery from mental health issues in conjunction with the National Empowerment Center developed a trauma-informed training called Emotional CPR to help address isolation and powerless-ness. Emotional CPR was originally developed to teach the public how to help someone in emotional distress through a crisis. Just as CPR (cardio-pulmonary resuscitation) is designed for members of the public to help one another through a crisis of their physical heart, emotional CPR (eCPR) is designed to help members of the public through crises of their emotional hearts.","Fisher, Daniel B.

"Psychological and physiological effects of a green wall on occupants: A cross-over study in virtual reality","Social change due to COVID-19 has had negative impacts on the mental health of people who live indoors. One of the possible solutions to these problems is to introduce biophilic design. Among the elements of this design, green walls are often favored due to their spatial efficiency. This study investigated the effectiveness of green walls in relieving stress indoors. First, the stress level of the occupants of an indoor space that has green walls was measured. Then their psychological and physiological responses to the green walls were analyzed. To this end, using virtual reality, an experimental condition was set up in which a green wall was installed, and the stress level of the subjects was analyzed based on their state-trait anxiety (STAI), heart rate variability, electrodermal activity (EDA), and electroencephalogram (EEG). Twenty-seven subjects were recruited and the changes in their psychological and physiological responses when their environment changed from a non-green wall condition to a small to large green wall condition were measured. The results showed statistically significant differences in STAI, EDA, the relative alpha power in the parietal and occipital lobes, mental stress, and mental fatigue. Ultimately, the small green wall had a more significant relaxing effect. On the other hand, in the indoor space with a large green wall, the stress level of the residents increased. Thus, when installing a green wall in an indoor space, a small green wall is proposed.","Yeom, Seungkeun, Kim, Hakpyeong, Hong, Taehoon","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108134","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Building and Environment; 204:108134, 2021.; Publication details: Building and Environment; 204:108134, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16326,""
"Psychiatric distress in family caregivers of patients with COVID -19","Purpose Many COVID-19 patients with low to moderate disease severity were cared for at home by family members. Caring for relatives with COVID-19 could have a psychiatric disorder for informal caregivers. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the psychiatric disorders of family caregivers of relatives with COVID-19, in Iran. Methods This online survey was conducted with 350 family caregivers over 18Â years from April to July 2020, which was guided by the STROBE checklist. The study survey consisted of socio-demographic items, 7-items fear of COVID-19 scale, and a 21-item version of the depression, anxiety, and stress scales. Results The mean (standard deviation) scores for depression, anxiety, and stress were 20 (0.40), 19.52 (0.39), and 19.72 (0.35), respectively, moreover for fear of COVID-19 was 20.33 (0.43). Of all family caregivers, 77.75%, 75%, and 80% had depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Sixty-nine percent of caregivers had fear with moderate to high severity. Being younger, married, having a health-related occupation, not exercising, and high monthly salary were significant predictors of the total score of depression, anxiety, and stress scale (PÂ &lt;Â 0.05). Further, being married, having a health-related occupation, and not exercising, having comorbidity, high income, and being younger were independent predictors of fear of COVID-19 (PÂ &lt;Â 0.05). Only 32% and 33% of the variance of total depression, anxiety, and stress, and fear of COVID-19 scores were predicted by the studied variables (pÂ &lt;Â 0.001).

"The effect of Covid-19 on sleep quality, anxiety and depression on healthcare staff at a tertiary hospital in Turkey","Background The Covid-19 pandemic has forced healthcare staff into an unprecedented situation, such as making tough decisions and practising under enormous pressure. Aim This study was designed to investigate the effect of Covid-19 on sleep quality, anxiety and depression in healthcare staff at a tertiary hospital. Methods This descriptive and cross-sectional study recruited healthcare staff working at a tertiary hospital. Those who had given their informed consent participated in this study between April 17 and May 17, 2020. Data were collected using the introductory information form, the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). The data were then analyzed on the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v.24. Results The mean scores of the respondents derived from the HADS-Anxiety (HADS-A) and HADS-Depression (HADS-D) scales were 7.89Â Â±Â 4.60 and 7.22Â Â±Â 4.13, respectively. Their depression levels were established to be at risk, though their anxiety levels were not. The mean PSQI score turned out to be 8.42Â Â±Â 2.30 for the participants, most of whom (92.9%) experienced poor sleep quality. Total sleep quality of the respondents exhibited a moderate positive correlation with HADS-A scores and a weak positive correlation with HADS-D scores (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05). Conclusion Our major conclusion from the collected data is that healthcare staff suffered from poor sleep quality, and that their depression levels, but not anxiety levels, were at risk. Providing appropriate information about the health care of patients diagnosed with Covid-19 as well as offering regular psychoeducation-psychological support services and resting areas can reduce the susceptibility of healthcare staff to anxiety and depression and improve their overall sleep quality.","Yigitoglu, GÃ¼lay Tasdemir, Yilmaz, Atakan, Yilmaz, Halis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2021.07.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Archives of Psychiatric Nursing;2021.; Publication details: Archives of Psychiatric Nursing;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16328,""
"An Investigation of the Impact of Occupational Stress on Mental health of remote working women IT Professionals in Urban Bangalore, India","The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced various aspects of our lives and triggered many long-term consequences. The actual well-being of women IT employees is in danger due to the prolonged period of work from home as the pandemic has influenced individuals differently across the world. Physical distancing, dread, vulnerability, and a continued period of remote working has prompted an enormous number of women in the IT sector to experience challenges to emotional well-being. Work-related pressure is one of the major sources of stress in the modern working environment. Stress and unfavorable working conditions have been connected to low efficiency, truancy, and increasing rates of mishaps in and out of work. This is largely due to ailments, substance abuse, and family issues experienced by a large number of work-from-home women software company employees. Extended period of work from home can disturb women and their mental health as they try to strike a work-life balance. The purpose of this research is to examine the impact of occupational stress factors on the mental health of the women software professionals working remotely in urban Bangalore during the COVID-19 pandemic. The exploratory factor analysis identifies that Workload, Job Insecurity, Poor Work Environment, Personal Problems, and Lack of Structure as the main five factors of occupational stress while working from home for women IT employees in urban Bangalore. Multiple regression analysis undertaken in the study indicates that the relationship between the five factors of Occupational Stress and Mental Health is negatively significant with an inverse relationship.","Subha, B.; Madhusudhanan, R.; Thomas, Ajai Abraham","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+Investigation+of+the+Impact+of+Occupational+Stress+on+Mental+health+of+remote+working+women+IT+Professionals+in+Urban+Bangalore,+India","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of International Women's Studies; 22(6):139-149, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of International Women's Studies; 22(6):139-149, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16329,""
"Modifications to a Collaborative Network During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Adapting to a Changing Landscape to Meet Community Needs","Individuals living in the United States of America experienced remarkable changes to their activities, routines, and facets of their daily life as a result of the coronavirus or COVID-19. Mitigation strategies, including social distancing, telework and telemental health (TMH), have had significant implications in neighborhoods and communities. Research has indicated community collaboration in behavioral health is a key factor in meeting the health needs of individuals through the organization of resources, shared communication, and an understanding of the roles of different community agencies (Christens & Inzeo, 2015;Walzer, Weaver, & Mcguire, 2016). As a result of COVID-19, Central Virginia's behavioral healthcare and human services agencies shifted from largely face-to-face contact to a telehealth delivery of care through audio and video conferencing. The purpose of this article is to present a case study on the modifications made by a human services collaborative network in Central Virginia which may provide generalized lessons that other agencies and collaborative networks consider when adapting to address an unforeseen pandemic.

"Clinical psychopathology during COVID-19 pandemic: Case reports of first psychiatric presentations","The current pandemic is creating uncertainties about what is real and anyone as a personal viewpoint about Coronavirus, hence people become disoriented, illogical, anxious, frightened, paranoid and intolerant of others to the point of displaying irrational behaviours (Jakovljevic et al. 2020). The emotional reactions of people to the COVID-19 pandemic can be recorded as a traumatic experience developing as extreme anxiety or depressive disorder or post-traumatic stress illness (Jakovljevic 2020). The clinical cases found in the psychiatric hospitals of the authors of the current study and here reported bolsters the theory that COVID-19 pandemic can trigger, fuel or break mental stability in fit individuals who never had contacts with psychiatric services before. In all cases, presentation to psychiatric hospitals or infirmaries is characterised by extreme anxiety and psychomotor agitation which is a direct or aberrant route connected to COVID-19 pandemic, social segregation, constraints or interference of day by day lifestyles.","Lazzari, C.; Shoka, A.; Nusair, A.; Hein, S.

"The human default consciousness, jhana consciousness, gaia â€œconsciousnessâ€ and some thoughts on the COVID-19 pandemic","In a recent paper (Dennison, 2019) the term â€œhuman default consciousnessâ€ (DCs) was coined to describe the everyday consciousness that we live within throughout most of our lives. The default nature of that consciousness was highlighted by its profound disruption during a littleknown yet core practice within Buddhist meditation traditions, jhana meditation, which explicitly requires meditators to withdraw or disengage, temporarily, from engagement with the sensory world. The default consciousness is therefore a sensorily-based consciousness. The profound effects on brain activity that were observed to result from this withdrawal highlighted just how powerfully embedded the default consciousness is, and what a significant undertaking it is to disengage the personal element. In this chapter we explore in more detail the characteristics of the DCs as it has featured in philosophic thought, in psychoanalysis and mental health, as well as in Buddhist thought and from a modern neuroscience perspective. We then compare and contrast the form of consciousness that emerges in jhana meditation, before extending the discussion to recent neuroscience models of nested hierarchies within self-organising systems and their associated Markov blankets, with implications for the forms of consciousness that may or may not arise in those systems. We also discuss briefly the outermost hierarchical system, that of planet Earth in interaction with worldwide societies, and the likely information geometries linking â€œouterâ€ with â€œinner.â€ In light of the current crises of climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic, we speculate on the possibility of breakdown of this outermost Markov blanket system.

"Implications of COVID-19 for the Mental Health of Pharmacists","Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19) has had a detrimental impact on the mental health of healthcare workers ( HCWs). As frontline workers, pharmacists have experienced an escalation in many areas of responsibility, often increasing their burden, frustration, and stress and negatively impacting their mental health and well-being. Although most stress symptoms are temporary, normal, and will resolve on their own, HCWs are likely to benefit from access to mental-health resources that can address sources of anxiety and distress. Awareness of the warning signs of emotional distress and developing practices to alleviate stress may help. Pharmacist managers can encourage self- care and provide pharmacy staff with resources to help them better cope.","Alrais, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Implications+of+COVID-19+for+the+Mental+Health+of+Pharmacists","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Us Pharmacist; 46(6):25-29, 2021.; Publication details: Us Pharmacist; 46(6):25-29, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16335,""

"The Effect of Coronavirus Anxiety on Self-esteem, Life Satisfaction and Mood of Women with Moderate-to-Moderate Physical Activity During Covid-19 Quarantine","Background and Objectives: The widespread prevalence of Coronavirus disease and the resulting epidemic and implementation of quarantine has increased Coronavirus anxiety. On the other hand, collective tragedies, especially those involving infectious diseases, often increase waves of fear and anxiety that appear to cause widespread behavioral disturbances and threaten the mental health of many people in the population. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of coronavirus anxiety on self-esteem, life satisfaction and mood of women with moderate to moderate physical activity during the Covid-19 quarantine period. Material and Methods: The present study is a descriptive survey study. The sample consisted of 165 women with regular moderate physical activity who participated in the study through available sampling through telegram and WhatsApp virtual networks by distributing online questionnaire link. Required data through standard questionnaires including coronary anxiety Alipour, Brumez Mood Scale (BRUMS) Items, Life satisfaction of Diener. The Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (RSES) and IPAQ physical activity questionnaire was provided. Data in SPSS 26 software were analyzed using descriptive statistics and path analysis using SMARTPLS software. Results The results showed that anxiety caused by coronavirus had a significant inverse effect on self-esteem (P = -0.238) and life satisfaction (P = -0.307) of women with moderate-to-moderate physical activity during coronavirus 19 quarantine, and has a positive and significant effect on mood (P = 0.573) of women with regular moderate physical activity and their model has a good fit (p &lt;0.05). Conclusion: Coronary anxiety disorder plays an important role in the self-esteem, life satisfaction, and mood of women with moderate-to-moderate physical activity during the Covid-19 quarantine period. Reducing coronary anxiety through appropriate exercise programs can be effective in improving the self-esteem, life satisfaction, and mood of women with moderate to moderate physical activity during the Covid-19 quarantine period.","Esteki, Samira","https://doi.org/10.34172/doh.2021.10","","Database: CINAHL; Publication details: Depiction of Health; 12(2):96-104, 2021.; Publication details: Depiction of Health; 12(2):96-104, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16337,""
"The relationship between self-isolation during lockdown and individuals' depressive symptoms: Humor as a moderator","The isolation that people of many nations have experienced during lockdown periods to prevent the spread of COVID-19 may adversely affect their mental health. In this study we examined whether humor moderates the relationship between extent of self-isolation and the depressive symptoms that people experience when locked down. Participants were 400 Japanese adults aged between 21 and 69 years, who completed the Humor Styles Questionnaire and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale in addition to responding to a question to establish the extent of their self-isolation. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis results indicate that affiliative humor moderated the relationship between the degree of self-isolation and depression, and attenuated their association. In contrast, aggressive humor strengthened their association. Our study findings suggest that affiliative humor served to safeguard people from suffering from depression induced by self-isolation during lockdown, whereas aggressive humor increased the likelihood of people becoming depressed during lockdown.

"The journey of SARS-CoV-2 in human hosts: a review of immune responses, immunosuppression, and their consequences","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory findings from a significant number of patients with COVID-19 indicate the occurrence of leukocytopenia, specifically lymphocytopenia. Moreover, infected patients can experience contrasting outcomes depending on lymphocytopenia status. Patients with resolved lymphocytopenia are more likely to recover, whereas critically ill patients with signs of unresolved lymphocytopenia develop severe complications, sometimes culminating in death. Why immunodepression manifests in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. Therefore, the evaluation of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings from infected patients is critical for understanding the disease course and its consequences. In this review, we take a logical approach to unravel the reasons for immunodepression in patients with COVID-19. Following the footprints of the virus within host tissues, from entry to exit, we extrapolate the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of immunodepression.","Alshammary, A. F.; Al-Sulaiman, A.

"Consequences of job insecurity for hospitality workers amid COVID-19 pandemic: does social support help?","Using a time-lagged field survey, the current study examined the psycho-economic effects of job insecurity among hospitality workers during the recent pandemic of COVID-19. The study also examined social support as a buffering agent against the harmful effects of job insecurity. Data were collected from employees (N =Â 272) working in numerous hotels, restaurants, and travel agencies across Pakistan. Hierarchical moderated regression analysis was used to test the studyâ€™s hypotheses. The results suggested that job insecurity was negatively related to self-esteem and positively related to economic deprivation. In addition, social support significantly moderated the effects of job insecurity on mental health, self-esteem, economic self-efficacy and life satisfaction such that the negative effects of job insecurity were stronger when social support was low. The results for economic deprivation, however, were contrary to the expectations, whereby job insecurity had a strong positive effect on economic deprivation in case of high social support.

"Introduction to the Special Issue: Mental Health in Therapeutic Recreation","In partnership with Recreation Nova Scotia, we received a ""Community Mental Health"" grant from the Nova Scotia government based on the argument that: (1) recreation could be a resource for improving the mental health of all Nova Scotians, and (2) recreation practitioners needed access to training and resources so they could remove barriers to community participation and create more welcoming environments and programs. While the Recreation for Mental Health game was originally designed to train community recreation practitioners about the barriers people living with mental health problems experience when trying to access community recreation (and about strategies and supports to overcome these barriers), TR practitioners in Nova Scotia also advocated for the use of the game as a leisure education tool to support the recovery of their clients or patients. In addition to adding evidence to the leisure-based stress-coping literature, from our perspective this article highlights the importance of community-based and (largely volunteer driven/supported) organizations to ensure a spectrum of recreation-related supports and services are available to persons recovering from PTSD and other mental health disorders. Dr. Shintaro Kono and colleagues Ethan Blumhorst and Jasmine Cave have provided important insights on the benefits of an adaptive scuba diving program in their article titled ""An Exploratory Study of Adaptive Scuba Diving's Effects on Psychological Well-Being among Military Veterans"" Like the previous article, Kono and colleagues highlight the prevalence of mental health problems experienced by military veterans and the important role recreation can serve as an alternative therapy.","Hutchinson, Susan, Sullivan, Anne-Marie","https://www.google.com/search?q=Introduction+to+the+Special+Issue:+Mental+Health+in+Therapeutic+Recreation","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Therapeutic Recreation Journal; 54(2):103-107, 2020.; Publication details: Therapeutic Recreation Journal; 54(2):103-107, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16342,""
"General Anxiety Predictors among Frontline Warriors of COVID: Cross-Sectional Study among Nursing Staff in Punjab, Pakistan","COVID-19 pandemic has increased the generalized anxiety among nursing staff. This cross-sectional questionnaire-based study aimed to determine the generalized anxiety disorders among the nursing staff working in secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Punjab province, Pakistan. A GAD-7 scale was used to assess anxiety. Non-parametric statistics were applied to estimate the difference among the groups. Multiple regression model was adopted to explore the impact of covariates on the GAD-7 score. A total of 133 nurses responded to this survey. It was revealed that being female (7.38 +/- 4.20, p=0.032) and having an age of &gt;= 31 years (7.68 +/- 5.14) might lead to a higher GAD-7 score. 19.6% of the respondents had a high level of generalized anxiety (GAD-7 score &gt;= 10), and about 49.6% were falling in the range of mild anxiety. Female nursing staff have the probability of higher GAD-7 score up to 15% [0.148(-0.450 - 4.697), p= 0.049]. Job experience, especially being new to the field (&lt;= 3 years) might increase the likelihood of having a higher GAD-7 score by 14%. In conclusion, 19.6% of the respondents were meeting the GAD-7 criteria of moderate-severe level of generalized anxiety and depressive disorder. Being female, having less job experience, and no training on how to handle COVID patients were revealed to the main factors influencing the GAD-7 score. Risk of getting COVID, transmission of COVID to family members through them, and uncertainty about the consequence of COVID in Pakistan were some of the common stressors reported by the nurses who participated in this study.","Khan, T.

"Psychometric characteristics of the Brazilian version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale","Different studies have been assessing the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. Nonetheless, in Brazil, a few studies approach the fear associated with COVID-19 as a research problem. Therefore, this article presents the process of adaptation and testing of the psychometric properties of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to the Brazilian context through two studies. In Study 1 (N = 464), we performed an exploratory factor analysis and we identified a unifatorial and reliable structure (alpha = 0.85) of the FCV-19S. In Study 2 (N = 199) a confirmatory factorial analysis reaffirmed the unifatorial structure and reliability (alpha = 0.87). In addition, evidence of convergent-discriminating validity and invariance by gender were identified. Taken together, these results suggest that FCV-19S has good psychometric properties of validity and reliability, and may be useful for studies approached in the impacts of fear associated to COVID-19 on mental health.","Silva, W.

"Parent Personality Traits During Covid-19 Pandemic: a Correlational Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a sudden and profound impact on international communities. The emergence of COVID-19 has led to drastic measures to ensure social distancing throughout the world, in order to prevent disease. In Romania, prevention measures regarding the infection with the new coronavirus and the limitations imposed at national level suddenly changed the routines and interactions of the population and made many parents feel overwhelmed due to work at home, home-schooling and family care, simultaneously. The national home quarantine policy may have influenced parents' mental health. The present study aimed to investigate the anxiety, self-efficacy, anger, energy level, distrust and frustration about the basic psychological needs of parents during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore the relationship between them.Alternate abstract:Die COVID-19-Pandemie hatte plÃ¶tzliche und tiefgreifende Auswirkungen auf die internationalen Gemeinschaften.

To assess the cognitive and emotional-affective spheres of functioning of patients with a new coronavirus infection who were treated in an infectious COVID hospital and to develop strategies for emergency psychological assistance. Materials and methods. The study sample consisted of patients admitted to the Center for the treatment of patients with new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) of I.P.Pavlov First St.-Petersburg State Medical University, who were assigned a consultation with a medical psychologist. Results. The predictors of more pronounced cognitive decline were determined: older age and severity of the disease, as well as predictors of a higher level of anxiety and depressive symptoms: younger age, previous traumatic situation and more severe course of the disease. Three main problem areas have been identified that require psychological intervention in the treatment of patients with COVID-19: cognitive impairment, high anxiety and depressive symptoms associated with psychological trauma of patients, conflicting or non-adherent patients.

"The mental health condition of 12-17-year-old girl students in Aran-Bidgol City, Iran, during COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Fear and stress caused by COVID-19 increases the feeling of insecurity in children and adolescents, and if not taken timely action, will cause serious mental health problems in them. The aim of this study was to determine the mental health status of girls aged 12-17 years in Aran-Bidgol City, Iran, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was performed on 390 girl students of Aran-Bidgol in 2020-21. Data collection tools were demographic/family information checklist and of child health questionnaire (CHQ), spiritual health, social support, and measuring the long-term effects of the accident on children's mental health, which were completed electronically. Data were analyzed using SPSS software with independent t, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression tests with a significance level of 0.05. Finding: 65.10% of girls received a score of 25-50 from the Mental Health Questionnaire, which indicated a mild mental health problem. 34.40% got a score of 50-75 and none of them got a score above 75. The regression model showed that two patterns of family communication (dialogue and compliance) and girls' existential health predicted the girls' mental health score (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The results showed that the patterns of family communication and existential health in adolescents had effect on adolescents' mental health;so it is suggested to identify the best regulatory model and family function with an emphasis on existential health, to improve their mental health by gaining the ability to positive valuation.

"Critiquing 21st century creative violence: Tagore's concord (milan) and harmony (samanjaysya) imagining ""one world""","Modern science, acclaiming the success of the creative human brain as 'progressive changes' in the 21st century continues to prosper through prominent images of scientism, ingestion, cartelized capitalism, chemistry and rocket technology to name a few. Introspecting the 21st century from the given nexus, we are quite likely to conclude that it has remained a century when the human destructiveness has reached its creative pinnacle. 'Creative progression' disguised under the garb of SARS COVID-19 is currently ransacking mankind, resulting in mass genocide, destruction of cultures and worldviews. The creative human self now remains predisposed with the activation of low-grade mental illness. depression, anxiety and trauma. Tagore's 'creative self' with a magisterial rebuke had always protested the prevalent dominant theories of violence and counter- violence down the time line. His philosophical vision intertwined with the humane self of 'being' instead of 'becoming' counterpoises this 'creative enigma' of scientific and material human progression even to this day. Standing on the threshold of the 21st century we earnestly look forward to reminiscence Tagore's vision of Concord (milan) nurturing the ""living bonds in a society""and brewing Harmony (samanjaysya) as the ""wholeness and wholesomeness of human ideals""to provide a remedy for re-thinking the possibilities of ""One World""(my italics) defined in terms of 'becoming' instead of 'humane -being'.

"Portfolio optimization under mean-CVaR simulation with copulas on the Vietnamese stock exchange","This paper studies how to construct and compare various optimal portfolio frameworks for investors in the context of the Vietnamese stock market. The aim of the study is to help investors to find solutions for constructing an optimal portfolio strategy using modern investment frameworks in the Vietnamese stock market. The study contains a census of the top 43 companies listed on the Ho Chi Minh stock exchange (HOSE) over the ten-year period from July 2010 to January 2021. Optimal portfolios are constructed using Mean-Variance Framework, Mean-CVaR Framework under different copula simulations. Two-thirds of the data from 26/03/2014 to 27/1/2021 consists of the data of Vietnamese stocks during the COVID-19 recession, which caused depression globally;however, the results obtained during this period still provide a consistent outcome with the results for other periods. Furthermore, by randomly attempting different stocks in the research sample, the results also perform the same outcome as previous analyses. At about the same CvaR level of about 2.1%, for example, the Gaussian copula portfolio has daily Mean Return of 0.121%, the t copula portfolio has 0.12% Mean Return, while Mean-CvaR with the Raw Return portfolio has a lower Return at 0.103%, and the last portfolio of Mean-Variance with Raw Return has 0.102% Mean Return. Empirical results for all 10 portfolio levels showed that CVaR copula simulations significantly outperform the historical Mean-CVaR framework and Mean-Variance framework in the context of the Vietnamese stock exchange.

"PCD 2021 Student Research Collection: Building Public Health Research Capacity in Real-World Settings and the 2022 Call for Papers","Early in his career, Dr Posner recognized the value of mentoring students in the value of publication, and his student research competition brought a new generation of public health researchers and practitioners to PCD. Since the inception of the competition, the journal has received nearly 500 student manuscripts for consideration. Specifically, we aim to 1) provide an opportunity to become familiar with a journalâ€™s manuscript submission requirements and peer review process;2) foster connections among student knowledge and training, the conduct of quality research, and a journalâ€™s publication expectations;3) develop research and scientific writing skills to become producers of knowledge, rather than just consumers of knowledge;4) provide an opportunity to become a first author on a peer-reviewed article;and 5) promote supportive, respectful, and mutually beneficial mentee relationships that strengthen studentsâ€™ ability to generate and submit scholarly manuscripts throughout their professional careers (1). From 2011 through 2015, manuscripts were screened and reviewed by a panel of peer reviewers who identified an overall winner whose manuscript was ultimately published (2â€“11). Because of the tremendous response from students, we expanded submission screening, peer reviewing, and publishing to 5 student levels in 2017 and 2018, and winners were identified at the high school, undergraduate, graduate, doctoral, and postdoctoral levels (1,12). The current collection addresses a broad range of topics, including childhood obesity in secondary schools in Hong Kong (13);nutrition and physical activity among adults (14â€“16);the impact of inadequate sleep on mental health (17);the association between neighborhood built environments and depression in the rural South (18);colorectal cancer risk factors and screening among uninsured adults living in Tampa Bay, Florida (19);spatial accessibility to dental care among Alabama youth (20);identifying challenges to care for people living with hepatitis delta virus and their caretakers (21);and community resources to promote health among Chinese immigrants living in Philadelphia (22).","Jack, Leonard, Jr.","https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd18.210214","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Preventing Chronic Disease; 18, 2021.; Publication details: Preventing Chronic Disease; 18, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16351,""
"Management of mental health during covid-19 pandemic: Possible strategies","In the 21st century, any pandemic, especially, SARS-CoV-2 is a global burden due to high incidence, mortality, and mutation rate. Although several techniques have already been identified to control the pandemic or treat patients and causes of adverse impact on mental health, relatively only, fewer researchers have little concern about finding effective mitigation strategies to improve mental health. Therefore, this study aimed to find some common and unique approaches to manage mental health during a pandemic. Some strategies for the better management of mental health induced by SARS-CoV-2 infections are required for all classes of peoples. Early management is vital, and those must be associated with frontline workers and people staying at home, particularly in isolation centers and already identified as active cases. Experts have pointed out the need to pay specific attention to proper daily life. To manage abnormal mental conditions, such as anxiety, mood, personality, and psychotic disorder during the pandemic;social media, meditation, and psychological motivation with adequate diet, exercise, and sleep have significant roles in regulating some biological mechanism, incredibly immune, hormonal, and neural process. Management of mental health is mandatory for all at the time of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We can consider all of the strategies mentioned above to treat mental health during and after the COVID-19 pandemic condition.

A 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia PR depression in the inferior leads associated with an apparent pseudo ST elevation. In the absence of elevation of inflammatory indices, considering the lack of symptoms neither NSAIDs nor colchicine were prescribed, and the patient was referred for clinical follow-up. After ten days ECG documented initial reduction of the widespread concave STE and PR depression, and the 1-month follow-up visit, the patient was asymptomatic with unremarkable physical examination, and a 12-lead ECG showed almost complete normalization of the ST and PR segments.

Using data from National Health Surveys held in 2005 and 2013, a cross-sectional study was conducted on 18,612 Italian emerging adults grouped into three groups: university students, workers, and working students. The odds ratios of self-reported anxiety or depression, poor general health, and poor mental health and physical health (as assessed through SF-12) were estimated through logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Results. Compared with workers, students showed an increased risk of anxiety or depression and a lower risk of poor general health. Students and working students showed an increased risk of reporting weak mental health compared with that in workers, while students displayed a lower risk of poor physical health. Significant differences were not found between the 2005 and 2013 surveys. Conclusions.

However, it remains unknown whether physical activity can improve mental health in a state of emergency. The present study aimed to examine the importance of physical exercising and stress management mechanisms (problem-focused, emotion-focused, and avoidant) in the context of mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, and nonspecific stress) in conditions of social isolation during COVID-19-induced lockdown in Serbia. The sample consisted of 680 adults (66% female), mean aged 35.91 years (SD = 12.45). The results indicated a significant relation between physical exercising and a reduced stress response and confirmed the usefulness of the already well-known problem-focused strategies. Avoidant and emotion-focused coping were associated with poorer mental health outcomes.

"Teleworker Performance in the COVID-19 Era in Japan","This paper investigates teleworker efficiency in Japan in the COVID-19 era by using unique survey data on telework. Many Japanese workers started teleworking during the pandemic and found both benefits as well as impediments. Overall, we find that telework experience and the work environment (e.g., having clearly specified tasks and a flexible working system), changes in work-life balance (e.g., working time), and good mental health improves teleworker efficiency.","Okubo, T.; Inoue, A.; Sekijima, K.","https://doi.org/10.1162/asep_a_00807","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Asian Economic Papers; 20(2):175-192, 2021.; Publication details: Asian Economic Papers; 20(2):175-192, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16360,""
"Food insecurity and mental health: new answers and remaining questions","Correspondence to Dr Miriam Evensen, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo 0213, Norway;Miriam.Evensen@fhi.no Food insecurityâ€”the economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate foodâ€”is high on the agenda.1 In Europe, estimates from Eurostat in 2020 show that 7% of households with children are food insecure.2 There is a worry that the corresponding figures for 2021 may be even higher as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased unemployment and economic uncertainty, processes that likely exacerbate food insecurity.3 4 The fact that so many children experience insecure access to food is important in its own right, but food insecurity is also associated with long-term adverse outcomes related to, for example, education and nutrition.5 6 In a timely new study, Men et al 7 examine the association between food insecurity and mental health problems among children and young adults. Men et al 7 also found a strong association between food insecurity and risk of mental health problems, net of household income and other socioeconomic factors.

"5 key ways freelancers help companies stay nimble","PurposeWhy building out a fleet of freelance talent could be the reason some companies survive to see 2021, while their competitors do not.Design/methodology/approachAuthors drew upon their experience as cofounders of 10x Management and their experience in the talent management field.FindingsIf you are not so sure if freelance talent could be game changing for your company, consider that experimentation is a key element of staying nimble. Companies tend to layoff staff, pause raises and scale back the office lease as initial reactions to reduce costs and stay lean. But the ones that do it the best go the extra mile. It is not just about cutting costs â€“ rather, it is about doubling down on new (and old) ways to achieve peak performance in the face of uncertainty. Using freelancers can do just that.Research limitations/implicationsThere are five number of ways in which freelance workers benefit a company, including speed, adaptability, cost, low commitment and remote expertise.Originality/valueThe findings will help companies stay nimble in the midst of crises such as the current pandemic.","Solomon, Michael, Blumberg, Rishon","https://doi.org/10.1108/SHR-10-2020-0087","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Strategic HR Review; 20(2):38-41, 2021.; Publication details: Strategic HR Review; 20(2):38-41, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16363,""
"Phobic COVID-19 Disorder Scale: Development, Dimensionality, and Item-Structure Test","Over the century, the world has witnessed a number of pandemicsâ€”such as plague, Spanish flu, smallpox, and tuberculosis. Such pandemics have not only resulted in a great loss to human lives but have also affected the economy of many countries. COVID-19, declared as global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), is the latest in this series which has hit the world since the last quarter of 2019. Although a number of scales exist to assess fear and distress of individuals related to COVID-19, it is well articulated in the extant literature that sometimes the proposed scales are context specific and lack applicability in multi-cultural environment as also the factorsâ€™ structure of the scale are fit from the context of audience from certain geographical regions. Thus, a need was felt to evaluate the FCV-19S and propose and statistically validate a new COVID-19-based scale called Phobic COVID-19 Disorder scale (Phobic-19 scale). A structured e-questionnaire in English was used to collect the data from the respondents. A 12-item, three-dimensional (fear, anxiety, and distress) scale was developed to capture the emotions of general populations towards COVID-19. The study analyzes the dimensionality and item structure of the scale through exploratory factor analysis and further validated with the help of confirmatory factor analysis. The results show that the Phobic-19 scale has a strong internal consistency along with better psychometric characteristics. Mass replication and a large number of empirical research using the Phobic-19 scale would instill confidence amongst scholars and practitioners in the results. The findings also highlight that the results would help to advance our understanding by providing critical information related to COVID-19 and ensure that the scale provides accurate and usable data.

"Foreign Language Anxiety in Virtual Classrooms during the Covid-19 Pandemic in Turkey","This mixed-methods study investigated Foreign Language Anxiety in virtual English as Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms during the Covid-19 pandemic in Turkey. The Turkish EFL university learners' anxious feelings in traditional and virtual classrooms were compared. Then, the reasons for their feelings were explored. Data were gathered from 212 online learners via a questionnaire including both open-ended and close-ended questions. A large number of the students felt less stressed in a face-to-face classroom. Comparing the activities, a larger number of the respondents felt less stressed to participate in face-to-face classroom language activities than in online classroom activities. Over half of the respondents felt anxious thinking that others might see their home settings or hear the voices in their homes, recorded for every activity, physical and mental health due to long-time use of technology. The online classroom setting made a large number of the participants feel more suffocated and isolated. The existence of live interactions in face-to-face environments were mentioned as an effective factor. The other reasons included individual differences and preferences, lack of technological knowledge, and the technological infrastructure problem. In terms of the benefits of the online classes, several learners felt comfortable with answering questions while others are not looking at them, and that others do not see their physical appearance. The direct presence of eye contact with the teachers in face-to-face classrooms made several students more nervous. Some also referred to the Covid-19 pandemic and that it is risky for their health to be in face-to-face classrooms.","Valizadeh, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Foreign+Language+Anxiety+in+Virtual+Classrooms+during+the+Covid-19+Pandemic+in+Turkey","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: St Theresa Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences; 7(1):54-80, 2021.; Publication details: St Theresa Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences; 7(1):54-80, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16367,""
"The COVID-19 Fear Scale (FCV-19S): Psychometric properties and invariance of the measure in the Spanish version","Introduction. The emergence of COVID-19 worldwide has had serious consequences for physical and psychological health. Spain is one of the countries that has been most-seriously affected by the pandemic. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the COVID-19 fear scale (FCV-19S), assessing its structural validity, differential item functioning, and measurement invariance by gender and age. Methodology. A cross-sectional study was carried out in several stages. Descriptive, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, scale reliability, item differential functioning, and measurement invariance tests were carried out. Results. We obtained a single-factor scale with excellent goodness-of-fit indices and high internal consistency (alpha = .90;omega = .93) adapted to the general Spanish population. We also found a significant relationship with depression (r = .72) and anxiety (r = .84). Gender invariance testing indicated that men and women understood the scale items differently, with differences also being found by age group. Conclusions. This is the first study attempting to assess the gender and age invariance of the FCV-19S scale. The scale demonstrates adequate psychometric properties, high internal consistency, and an appropriate relationship with depression and anxiety. Men and women in the general Spanish population have different perceptions of the fear of infection by COVID-19, and the fear affects some age groups more than others.","Sanchez-Teruel, D.; Robles-Bello, M.

"The Great Unmasking of 2021","Gennaro shares her worries about what the return to the new normal will mean for the dissemination of nursing science. The first has to do with peer review. As we have seen a universal rise in manuscript submissions to all journals during the pandemic, we have also seen a decrease in peer reviewers submitting timely reviews. But, now more than ever, we need to have excellent peer reviewers reading the science and raising questions that we truly need to discuss, research, and try to answer. Another worry is the mental exhaustion so many nurse scientists have felt as they have been caring for patients, families, and themselves while continuing to conduct research might lead us to missed opportunities to conduct new and meaningful post-pandemic research. This is the time for not only innovation, but renewed efforts to improve the mental health of the world's citizens.","Gennaro, Susan","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Great+Unmasking+of+2021","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Nursing Scholarship; 53(4):391-392, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Nursing Scholarship; 53(4):391-392, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16369,""

"Experience of the telephone counseling service for people with psychological disorders associated with social isolation","Background: In the current conditions of social isolation, imposed by COVID-19, psychological help lines have been implemented via telephone. It is of interest to know if the contribution of this counseling service is effective;and to what extent the population has assumed this as a reliable way of psychological help. Objective: to describe the experience of the telephone counseling service to people with psychological disorders associated with social isolation. Methods: a descriptive study was carried out of the telephone counseling service aimed at the population with psychological disorders, carried out by the Mella District Mental Health Center, Camaguey province, during May 2020. The reasons for the call, clinical manifestations and behavior to follow were the main variables studied. Results: the elderly population contributed the highest number of calls (40.6%), as well as the most frequent reason being the search for psychological support. Depression and anxiety were found as the main clinical manifestations;and psychological support and monitoring of this as the behaviors to follow in most cases. Conclusion: due to the impossibility of going to specialized mental health centers, due to the conditions imposed by the pandemic, telephone counseling allowed a considerable group of people to receive psychological help backed by trained professionals, in correspondence with individual needs.","Diaz, A.

"Interim Guidance on People Experiencing Unsheltered Homelessness","Summary of Recent Changes Added considerations for developing a long term strategy related to COVID-19 prevention among people experiencing unsheltered homelessness In this guide Community coalition-based COVID-19 prevention and response Communication Considerations for outreach staff Considerations for people experiencing unsheltered homelessness Considerations for encampments Considerations for a Long-Term Infection Prevention Strategy for People Experiencing Unsheltered Homelessness People experiencing unsheltered homelessness (those sleeping outside or in places not meant for human habitation) may be at risk for infection when there is community spread of COVID-19. This interim guidance is intended to support response to COVID-19 by local and state health departments, homelessness service systems, housing authorities, emergency planners, healthcare facilities, and homeless outreach services. Homeless shelters and other facilities should also refer to the Interim Guidance for Homeless Shelters. Community and faith-based organizations can refer to the Interim Guidance for Communities of Faith for other information related to their staff and organizations. COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus. We are learning about how it spreads, how severe it is, and other features of the disease. Lack of housing contributes to poor physical and mental health outcomes, and linkages to permanent housing for people experiencing homelessness should continue to be a priority. In the context of COVID-19 spread and transmission, the risks associated with sleeping outdoors or in an encampment setting are different than from staying indoors in a congregate setting such as an emergency shelter or other congregate living facility. Outdoor settings may allow people to increase physical distance between themselves and others. However, sleeping outdoors often does not provide protection from the environment, adequate access to hygiene and sanitation facilities, or connection to services and healthcare. The balance of risks should be considered for each individual experiencing unsheltered homelessness.","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/homeless-shelters/unsheltered-homelessness.html","","Database: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Publication type: non-conventional","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16372,""

"Assessment of the level of clinical preparedness amongst EMS professionals in managing life threatening emergencies in suspected COVID 19 patients","Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected millions of people worldwide and has claimed lakhs of lives in its wake. The sudden onset of the pandemic has led to increased levels of anxiety and depression amongst healthcare workers. EMS professionals are the first responders and need to provide emergency Medical Care to their patients. They are required to perform lifesaving interventions in a short period of time. As it is not possible to ascertain the Covid status of the patient, hence EMS professionals are at the greatest risk of getting infected. The study aims to assess the level of clinical preparedness of EMS professionals and suggests recommendations to improve upon it. Objective: To assess the level of clinical preparedness amongst EMS professionals in tackling life threatening emergencies in suspected Covid 19 patients. Methodology: The study was conducted amongst 150 Emergency Medical Professionals in Pune, India. Respondents were asked to respond to each item using 5 point Likert scale. The Questionnaire was administered to the respondents through online mode after obtaining informed consent. Responding to all questions was mandatory. The respondents were given a period of two days to fill the questionnaire. Discussion: The present study was aimed at examining the current level of preparedness with regards to the disease after nearly a year of the pandemic. The result obtained in terms of knowledge were encouraging and pointed to the fact that the EMS professionals had received adequate training in identification of suspected cases and their initial management. Majority of the respondents suffered from high grade anxiety of contracting the infection. The study highlights the urgent need to conduct counselling and stress management sessions for better mental health of EMS professionals and showed that hospitals are slowly but steadily devising appropriate protocols and safety measures to protect their employees. Conclusion: The contribution of EMS professionals in providing emergency lifesaving care to suspected Covid 19 patients cannot be over emphasized. As the pandemic continues it is essential to ensure the mental and physical of all healthcare professionals. The study is a small attempt to portray the level of knowledge and mental attitude amongst EMS professionals. The findings need to be corroborated with a larger multicentric study.","Rishipathak, P.; Vijayraghavan, S.; Hinduja, A.; Dongre, P.","https://doi.org/10.37506/ijfmt.v15i3.15440","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology; 15(3):971-976, 2021.; Publication details: Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology; 15(3):971-976, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16375,""
"Economic European Integration: Assessment and Modelling of Superficial and Hidden Factors of Divergence Between Ukraine and the EU","The article analyses the current European integration processes and measures implemented by Ukraine over the past five-six years in terms of its social and economic development. The study has shown that Ukraine's involvement in European integration processes has questioned the economic performance of the domestic economy sector, the wealth of Ukrainian citizens, infrastructure upgrade and industrial re-equipment. The Agreement on Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area with the EU countries, signed and implemented by Ukraine, has not had a critical impact on the improvement of Ukraine's leading macroeconomic indicators. Thus, the GDP recovery, investment and infrastructure renewal rate was very low, with depressed and unstable social and economic projects in 2014 - 2019;in general, this prevented from moving toward the EU standards. It is also noted that with the growth of EU's GDP by USD 1, the foreign trade turnover of all goods will increase by USD 0.887, and bilateral turnover of agricultural and industrial goods - by USD 1.693 dollars;Ukraine's GDP growth has a much smaller impact, which can be explained by the difference in the EU and Ukrainian economic scales. Based on modelling study, forecasting and analysis of time series within the last five-six years, it is proved that without regular investments, supporting measures to trigger the development of high-tech sectors of Ukraine's economy and without its production and logistics partnership and involvement in the global most powerful economic centres, the domestic social and economic segments will continue to worsen and be exposed to the globalized economic risks. Therefore, it is proposed to develop new approaches to the European integration process based on pragmatism and successful experience of Central and Eastern European countries, namely to implement the relevant measures and a strategic level program in Ukraine to propel and develop high-tech and high-margin industrial sector.

"Counselors' perceptions of distance counseling: A national survey","Investigating how counselors perceive technology as a tool for delivering counseling services is crucial to understand the usage and challenges that may have implications for training programs, policymaking, and allocation of resources. With the COVID-19 crisis and accompanying shelter-in-place and self-distancing guidelines, telemental health, including distance counseling, has become a satisfactory primary delivery system and is now expected to be part of routine counseling care. The present pre-COVID-19 study explored practicing counselors' perceptions of distance counseling regarding advantages and challenges. While noting benefits, results indicate continuing barriers to widespread telemental health use encompassing licensure, training, safety, privacy, evaluation, and regulatory policies. Also, attention is needed for therapeutic relationships and culturally alert digital interventions. In addition, counselors can take advantage of rapidly changing technologies to provide numerous innovative counseling services.

"Mast cells heparin â€” New information on the old component (review)","Mast cells (MC) are widely distributed throughout the body of animals and humans, mainly in barrier tissues. This review provides new information on the hematopoietic origin of MCs from early erythromyeloid progenitors (EMPs), late EMPs, and definitive hematopoietic stem cells. As well as information on the maturation of MSs and heparin synthesis already in the embryonic period. Many physiological functions of MCs are determined by the properties of heparin, which forms the basis of the matrix of granules, since the heparin molecule is a strong polyanion, capable to forming complexes with many biologically active substances and regulating their properties. In a new hypothesis about the participation of MCs in pathological processes, it is assumed that this is due to the depletion of the heparin pool. In such cases, injections of exogenous heparin can help replenish MCs heparin stores. As a result of the restoration of the physiological functions of MCs and the action of exogenous heparin, the pathological process will be converted into an adaptive one. In clinical practice, unfractionated heparin (UFH) obtained from natural sources and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) obtained by the biochemical route are used. Most often, UFH and LMWH are used in the clinic only as anticoagulants. The worldwide spread of a disease named COVID-19 in 2020 showed that UFH and LMWH are multifunctional drugs that have saved many people. The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has been an unprecedented social and health emergency worldwide. Depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been reported in populations of many countries. This review provides new information on experimental studies on the successful treatment of pathology with low doses of UFH in modeling PTSD in animals. Consequently, heparin can be considered as a promising multifunctional drug for effective pharmacological correction of comorbid diseases under the influence of extreme factors.","Kondashevskaya, M.

"Counseling international students in times of uncertainty: A critical feminist and bioecological approach","Amidst the global health crisis of COVID-19, international students' safety and well-being is threatened by community- and policy-level animus. In addition to adjusting to a foreign culture, a series of draconian policies and communal hate crimes during the pandemic have placed international students in an especially vulnerable position. In this context, professional counselors must be well prepared to support this community. The authors describe the current sociopolitical events that have adversely impacted international students in the United States. Next, challenges to international students' mental health are identified to aid counselors' understanding of this community's needs.

"The impact of COVID-19 national lockdown on orthopaedic trauma admissions in the northern part of South Africa: A multicentre review of tertiary- And secondary-level hospital admissions","Background. COVID-19 national lockdown measures in South Africa (SA) have been under scrutiny since they were implemented in March 2020. Currently there are no studies showing the effect of the first lockdown on hospital admissions in the northern provinces of SA. Objectives. To evaluate the impact of national lockdown restrictions on musculoskeletal injury admissions in three hospitals across three provinces (Gauteng, Limpopo and North West). Methods. In a retrospective review, we compared orthopaedic trauma admissions from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020 (during alert level 5 of the national lockdown) with cases admitted during the same period in 2019 (non-lockdown). We reviewed the number of admissions, demographic data and mechanisms of injury in the adult and paediatric population groups. Results. A total of 449 patients were admitted with musculoskeletal injuries during the lockdown period compared with 664 patients in 2019, equating to a 32% reduction in total admissions. While there was an 8% increase in paediatric admissions during lockdown at Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital, adult admissions decreased in all centres. More young males were admitted during both lockdown (mean age 39.8 years) and non-lockdown (mean age 41.2 years) periods than females (p=0.004). There were significant reductions in the number of injuries due to motor vehicle accidents (59%) and in the number of gunshot wounds (36%) during lockdown. However, we observed an 11% rise in injuries related to suicide attempts among adult admissions during the lockdown period. Conclusions. Lockdown restrictions resulted in a significant reduction in orthopaedic trauma admissions, and were effective in terms of allowing institutions to direct resources to the management of COVID-19 patients. In the light of the increased suicide attempts observed during lockdown, future lockdown regulations should include comprehensive measures to relieve socioeconomic stress.","Rachuene, P.

"The social, psychological and clinical implications of the covid-19 pandemic in cardiovascular patients using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker","Objective: The heart expresses angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 that makes it vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syn-drome-coronavirus-2. Besides ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are used for cardiovascular diseases. Although no sig-nificant increase in the risk of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection and no increase in the severity of disease in patients receving ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy were shown, it has been noticed that some patients have tendency to stop the use of these agents. The aim of this study is to determine the behavior attitude of the cardiovascular outpatients during pandemic who use ACE inhibitor/ARB and to asses the impact of COVID-19 on them. Material and Methods: One hundred outpatients were in-cluded. A survey questioning the social, psychological and the clinical implications of COVID-19 was applied to volunteers. To measure the anxiety and despair levels, Beck scorings were used. Results: A small num-ber of patients stopped using ACE inhibitors/ARBs. Severe hopelessness and severe anxiety levels were seen in a few patient. Gender, fear of get-ting sick, thinking to have enough information about COVID-19 and ac-cessibilty to cardiovascular drugs were the factors affecting the Beck scores. Social distancing and cleaning hands are stated as the best measures for protection. Most of the patients preferred primary health clinics for routine controls and a few patient had knowledge about tele-medicine. Conclusion: Although a confusion has occured in the public about the use of ACE inhibitors/ARBs, drug release rates were found to be low. The anxiety and disparity levels are subsantially not severe. But it is still impor-tant to continue informing patients about the precautions and the use of tele-medicine.","Ege, M. R.; PaÃ§, A.

"Evaluation of fear levels of anesthetists and prophylaxis practices in the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic","Objective: Due to the working areas of anesthesiologists, the possibility of encountering COVID-19 positive or suspected patients is very high. In this study, it was aimed to raise awareness by determining the fear of COVID-19, medical prophylaxis, isolation and general approaches of the anesthesiologists during the COVID-19 pandemic process. Method: Faculty members, specialist and residents, specialists working in the field of anesthesia all over Turkey were included in the study. The link of the questionnaire prepared including demographic data, COVID-19 fear scale, perceived fear level and medical prophylaxis they used was sent online to anesthetists via e-mail and WhatsApp. Results: Two hundred and twenty-seven participants responded to the questionnaire and the answers of the respondents were analyzed. While 19% of the participants indicated that they had met with COVID-19 positive or suspected patients every day, and 10.2% of them stated that they never had contact with them. Fear of Covid-19 was statistically significantly higher in women, specialists and participants with chronic diseases (p=0.003, p=0.024 and p=0.014, respectively). Anesthetists working in the COVID 19 intensive care unit at the beginning of the pandemic had a higher level of perceived fear (p=0.006). Covid-19 scores of anesthetists who changed their smoking habits were found to be statistically significantly higher (p&lt;0.001). About half of the anesthetists were taking vitamin supplements for prophylaxis, while one fourth were using hydroxychloroquine. Conclusion: As a result of these findings, it is seen that the fear of Covid-19, in anesthetists, causes notable psychological effects and need for prophylaxis. We hope that these data will raise awareness in the near and distant future to protect the mental health of anesthetists and to reduce their fears by psychological support.","Ã–zgÃ¼nay, S E.; AkÃ§a, F.; Karasu, D.; Eminoglu, S, Gamli, M.","https://doi.org/10.5222/jarss.2021.40412","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Anestezi Dergisi; 29(1):25-31, 2021.; Publication details: Anestezi Dergisi; 29(1):25-31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16387,""

"The impact of working in a COVID hospital on sexual functioning in male nurses: A study from North India","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to almost all the countries and regions in the world. The fear of getting infected while serving COVID patients and the stress due to separation from family during the quarantine period may impact over sexual functioning of healthcare workers (HCWs). Methodology: The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee. This was a nonfunded, cross-sectional, observational study. All participants provided written informed consent. This study was carried out in a multispecialty tertiary teaching hospital in North India. The participants were drawn from married and living with partner male nurses. Sexual functioning was assessed using the changes in sexual functioning questionnaire short-form (CSFQ-14). Results: The study found that the prevalence of global sexual dysfunction was significantly higher in male nurses who had completed their rotations in the COVID hospital when compared to those who had not. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on sociodemographic profiles and the profile of their spouses.

"Coping with the aftermath of COVID: Industrial resurgence, mental health, and resilience","COVID-19 pandemic has affected billions of people worldwide. Economies world over have suffered slowdown with a direct impact on industry. The vulnerable industrial worker has suffered both financially and mentally. As the pandemic has begun to slow down, the industry has started showing signs of growth and economy appears to be coming back on track. Financial losses may be recovered in time, but the mental health impact of pandemic is likely to be long-lasting. In the aftermath of COVID-19, mental health needs of vulnerable sections of societies need to be addressed. An attempt has been made to understand the mental health impact of COVID-19 pandemic on industrial workers.

"Postexposure psychological sequelae in frontline health workers to COVID-19 in Andhra Pradesh, India","Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has engulfed the globe since December 2019. Healthcare workers remain at the forefront of this battle, and like prior pandemics face mental health challenges along with physical risks. We aimed to study the perceived stress and possible posttraumatic stress in the frontline workers exposed to active COVID-19 duties in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. Methodology: A special voluntary, anonymous, survey-based Google questionnaire was designed with mandatory consent form and queries to clarify inclusion exclusion criteria. Tools included valid, reliable self-administered scales, namely General Health Questionnaire 12, Perceived Stress Scale and Impact of Events Scales-Revised. A purposive sampling method was adopted, by posting the survey questionnaire on WhatsApp groups of doctors, interns, and nurses working on active COVID-19 duty in Andhra Pradesh. Results: About 69.7% of the frontline workers recorded higher perceived stress and definitive posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was found in 34.8%, with psychological distress recorded in 53%. Conclusion: The higher levels of perceived stress discovered in the vast majority with definitive PTSD features in a third of the sample indicates the need for provision of mental health support proactively among frontline workers on active COVID-19 duty.","Das, Keya, Ryali, V.; Bhavyasree, R.; Sekhar, C.","https://doi.org/10.4103/ipj.ipj_15_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 30(1):123-130, 2021.; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 30(1):123-130, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16393,""
"Perceived stigma among the patients of coronavirus disease-19 admitted at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital in Northern India: A cross-sectional study","Background: Coronavirus disease-related stigma started early in the pandemic with multiple media reports highlighting the discriminatory practices toward the health-care workers, patients, and survivors. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a designated COVID -19 hospital in Delhi from 22 October 20 to 21 November 20. All patients admitted to the hospital for more than 72 h were eligible for participation in the study. Anyone without a mobile phone and not able to read was excluded from the study. The data were collected using a pretested, prevalidated questionnaire. Results: One hundred and twenty-two (92.4%) patients answered the questionnaire. All patients were male. A total of 54 (44.26%: 95% confidence interval [CI] 35.3â€“53.5) COVID-19 patients blamed themselves for getting the infection, compared to 68 (55.74% 95% CI: 46.5â€“64.7) patients who believed that acquiring the disease was not their fault. There was a statistically significant association between feeling ashamed and blaming themselves for COVID-19 (P = 0.046). A total of 19 (15.6%) have reported that they have been told that getting COVID-19 is your fault. Conclusion: The stigma related to COVID -19 needs to be tackled with multipronged strategy. In India, it is not a routine to assess mental health;however, the current pandemic has brought forward the importance of stigma and other related issues during the pandemic.","Yadav, Arun, Mangal, Vishal, Devarakonda, Ravi, Srivastava, Kalpana","https://doi.org/10.4103/ipj.ipj_13_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 30(1):118-122, 2021.; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 30(1):118-122, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16394,""
"Exploring Psychological Factors for COVID-19 Vaccination Intention in Taiwan","To underpin the psychological factors for vaccination intention, we explored the variables related to positive and negative attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination in Taiwan. The data were collected via an online survey platform with a sample size of 1100 in April 2021. We found that peopleâ€™s interpretations of the origin of the virus were relevant. People who tended to believe that the virus was artificially created felt powerless and were more concerned about the possible side-effects of the vaccines, which was negatively associated with their vaccination intention. The source of vaccine recommendation was found to be relevant to vaccination intention. Peopleâ€™s vaccination intention was highest if the vaccines were recommended by health professionals, followed by friends and the government, and then mainstream media and social media. The analysis of the demographic variables showed that men tended to be more receptive to vaccines than women. Our findings should provide insights into developing communication strategies to effectively promote vaccination intentions.","Lo, Shih-Yu, Li, Shu-Chu Sarrina, Wu, Tai-Yee","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9070764","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Vaccines; 9(7):764, 2021.; Publication details: Vaccines; 9(7):764, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16395,""
"Synthesis, Docking, 3-D-Qsar, and Biological Assays of Novel Indole Derivatives Targeting Serotonin Transporter, Dopamine D2 Receptor, and Mao-A Enzyme: In the Pursuit for Potential Multitarget Directed Ligands","A series of 27 compounds of general structure 2,3-dihydro-benzo[1,4]oxazin-4-yl)-2-{4-[3-(1H-3indolyl)-propyl]-1-piperazinyl}-ethanamides, Series I: 7(aâ€“o) and (2-{4-[3-(1H-3-indolyl)-propyl]-1-piperazinyl}-acetylamine)-N-(2-morfolin-4-yl-ethyl)-fluorinated benzamides Series II: 13(aâ€“l) were synthesized and evaluated as novel multitarget ligands towards dopamine D2 receptor, serotonin transporter (SERT), and monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) directed to the management of major depressive disorder (MDD). All the assayed compounds showed affinity for SERT in the nanomolar range, with five of them displaying Ki values from 5 to 10 nM. Compounds 7k, Ki = 5.63 Â± 0.82 nM, and 13c, Ki = 6.85 Â± 0.19 nM, showed the highest potencies. The affinities for D2 ranged from micro to nanomolar, while MAO-A inhibition was more discrete. Nevertheless, compounds 7m and 7n showed affinities for the D2 receptor in the nanomolar range (7n: Ki = 307 Â± 6 nM and 7m: Ki = 593 Â± 62 nM). Compound 7n was the only derivative displaying comparable affinities for SERT and D2 receptor (D2/SERT ratio = 3.6) and could be considered as a multitarget lead for further optimization. In addition, docking studies aimed to rationalize the molecular interactions and binding modes of the designed compounds in the most relevant protein targets were carried out. Furthermore, in order to obtain information on the structureâ€“activity relationship of the synthesized series, a 3-D-QSAR CoMFA and CoMSIA study was conducted and validated internally and externally (q2 = 0.625, 0.523 for CoMFA and CoMSIA and r2ncv = 0.967, 0.959 for CoMFA and CoMSIA, respectively).","Cerda-Cavieres, Christopher, Quiroz, Gabriel, Iturriaga-VÃ¡squez, Patricio, RodrÃ­guez-Lavado, Julio, AlarcÃ³n-EspÃ³sito, JazmÃ­n, Saitz, Claudio, Pessoa-Mahana, Carlos D.; Chung, Hery, Araya-Maturana, Ramiro, Mella-RaipÃ¡n, Jaime, Cabezas, David, Ojeda-GÃ³mez, Claudia, Reyes-Parada, Miguel, Pessoa-Mahana, HernÃ¡n","https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25204614","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Molecules; 25(20):4614, 2020.; Publication details: Molecules; 25(20):4614, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16396,""
"Prolonged Stress Causes Depression in Frontline Workers Facing the COVID-19 Pandemicâ€”A Repeated Cross-Sectional Study in a COVID-19 Hub-Hospital in Central Italy","The COVID-19 pandemic has severely tested the mental health of frontline health care workers. A repeated cross-sectional study can provide information on how their mental health evolved during the various phases of the pandemic. The intensivists of a COVID-19 hub hospital in Rome were investigated with a baseline survey during the first wave of the pandemic in April 2020, and they were contacted again in December 2020, during the second wave. Of the 205 eligible workers, 152 responded to an online questionnaire designed to measure procedural justice, occupational stress (effort/reward imbalance), sleep quality, anxiety, depression, burnout, job satisfaction, happiness, and turnover intention. Workers reported a further increase in workload and compassion fatigue, which had already risen during the first wave, and a marked reduction in the time devoted to meditation and mental activities. A low level of confidence in the adequacy of safety procedures and the need to work in isolation, together with an increased workload and lack of time for meditation, were the most significant predictors of occupational stress in a stepwise linear regression model. Occupational stress was, in turn, a significant predictor of insomnia, anxiety, low job satisfaction, burnout, and intention to leave the hospital. The number of workers manifesting symptoms of depression increased significantly to exceed 60%. Action to prevent occupational risks and enhance individual resilience cannot be postponed.","Magnavita, Nicola, Soave, Paolo Maurizio, Antonelli, Massimo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147316","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7316, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7316, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16397,""

A scoping review that mapped English and Chinese-language studies (2019â€“2020) located in MEDLINE (Ovid), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycInfo, Sociological Abstracts, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and Airiti Library was undertaken. Search terms related to COVID-19, mental health, and physical health were used and articles that included all three of these factors were extracted (n = 77). With the exception of one hospital-based pilot study, there were no intervention studies targeting mental health in those at risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Promising practices such as integrated care models that appropriately screen for mental health issues, address health determinants, and include use of digital resources were highlighted. Patient navigator programs, group online medical visits, peer support, and social prescribing may also support those with complex needs. Future policies need to address digital health access inequities and the implementation of multi-integrated health and social care.

"A Cross-Cultural Study of Distress during COVID-19 Pandemic: Some Protective and Risk Factors","Previous studies on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in different countries found an increase in anxiety, stress, and an exacerbation of previous mental health problems. This research investigated some of the protective and risk factors of distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, among which were the perception of receiving social support from family members and friends, and a chronic tendency to worry. The study was conducted in three European countries: Italy, Serbia, and Romania. A total of 1100 participants (Italy n = 491;Serbia n = 297;Romania n = 312) responded to a questionnaire. Results from this study show that distress during the COVID-19 pandemic is higher for people who are chronic worriers and those who have higher levels of fear of COVID-19. More specifically, it is confirmed that a chronic tendency to worry exacerbates the relationship between fear and distress: it is stronger for people who have a greater tendency to worry.","Kosic, Ankica, DÅ¾amonja Ignjatovic, Tamara, Petrovic, NebojÅ¡a","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147261","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7261, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7261, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16399,""
"Mental Health Crisis and Stress Coping among Healthcare College Students Momentarily Displaced from Their Campus Community Because of COVID-19 Restrictions in Japan","College students are one of the most affected groups by self-quarantine due to COVID-19, as they may live in loneliness and anxiety, increasing their risk of mental health crisis. This study aimed to identify risk factors for poor mental health and stress coping strategies among healthcare college students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. A cross-sectional survey was conducted over 7 consecutive days starting on 28 April 2020 using a web-based questionnaire. The survey assessed socioeconomic characteristics and the General Health Questionnaire-12 score, self-reported health status, anxiety, and satisfaction with daily life, work, leisure, and new activities. Approximately 70% of 223 respondents had poor mental health. Less communication with friends was the main risk factor for mental health problems. Good health status and satisfaction with leisure and new activities were associated with reduced risk of mental health problems. Students with poor mental health tended to seek social support as a stress coping strategy. This study showed that the mental health of students declined during self-quarantine, and loneliness could be the major reason. There is a need for a new form of communication and learning that deals with the isolation and loneliness of students, especially for students living alone.","Tahara, Masatoshi, Mashizume, Yuki, Takahashi, Kayoko","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147245","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7245, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7245, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16400,""
"â€œHealthcare Kamikazesâ€ during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Purpose in Life and Moral Courage as Mediators of Psychopathology","Although the required personal protective equipment was not available during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Spanish healthcare workers continued to work, being dubbed as â€˜healthcare kamikazesâ€™. Two possible reasons are moral courage and purpose in life that, in turn, would modulate the appearance of psychopathology. Cross-sectional study was carried out in 90 Spanish and 59 Mexican healthcare professionals, and 56 medical and nursing students. Spanish professionals had suffered more work and overall exposure (M = 8.30;SD = 2.57 and M = 9.03;SD = 2.66) than Mexican (M = 5.10;SD = 1.87 and M = 5.55;SD = 2.35). Mexican professionals had fewer anxiety disorders (30.5%;n = 18) and a lower depression score (M = 4.45;SD = 5.63) than the Spanish (43.7%;n = 38;and M = 8.69;SD = 8.07). Spanish professionals more often experienced acute stress disorder (32.6%;n = 29). Purpose in life, in addition to having a direct protective effect on psychopathology, also modulated the relationship between personal and family exposure and psychopathology. In conclusion, purpose in life protects against the appearance of psychopathology in healthcare workers with personal and family exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Echeverria, IvÃ¡n, Peraire, Marc, Haro, Gonzalo, Mora, Rafael, Camacho, Isabel, AlmodÃ³var, Isabel, MaÃ±es, Vicente, Zaera, Ignacio, Benito, Ana","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147235","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7235, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(14):7235, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16401,""

"Six-Month Outcomes in COVID-19 ICU Patients and Their Family Members: A Prospective Cohort Study","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a major influx of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. Currently, there is limited knowledge on the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 ICU-survivors and the impact on family members. This study aimed to gain an insight into the long-term physical, social and psychological functioning of COVID-19 ICU-survivors and their family members at three- and six-months following ICU discharge. Methods: A single-center, prospective cohort study was conducted among COVID-19 ICU-survivors and their family members. Participants received questionnaires at three and six months after ICU discharge. Physical functioning was evaluated using the MOS Short-Form General Health Survey, Clinical Frailty Scale and spirometry tests. Social functioning was determined using the McMaster Family Assessment Device and return to work. Psychological functioning was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: Sixty COVID-19 ICU-survivors and 78 family members participated in this study. Physical functioning was impaired in ICU-survivors as reflected by a score of 33.3 (IQR 16.7â€“66.7) and 50 (IQR 16.7â€“83.3) out of 100 at 3- and 6-month follow-ups, respectively. Ninety percent of ICU-survivors reported persistent symptoms after 6 months. Social functioning was impaired since 90% of COVID-19 ICU-survivors had not reached their pre-ICU work level 6 months after ICU-discharge. Psychological functioning was unaffected in COVID-19 ICU-survivors. Family members experienced worse work status in 35% and 34% of cases, including a decrease in work rate among 18.3% and 7.4% of cases at 3- and 6-months post ICU-discharge, respectively. Psychologically, 63% of family members reported ongoing impaired well-being due to the COVID-19-related mandatory physical distance from their relatives. Conclusion: COVID-19 ICU-survivors suffer from a prolonged disease burden, which is prominent in physical and social functioning, work status and persisting symptoms among 90% of patients. Family members reported a reduction in return to work and impaired well-being. Further research is needed to extend the follow-up period and study the effects of standardized rehabilitation in COVID-19 patients and their family members.","van Veenendaal, Nadine, van der Meulen, Ingeborg C.; Onrust, Marisa, Paans, Wolter, Dieperink, Willem, van der Voort, Peter H.

"Effects of Cognicise-Neurofeedback on Health Locus of Control, Depression, and Quantitative Electroencephalography Alpha Asymmetry in Elderly Women","Background: With an increase in the aged population, there is a growing concern regarding the care of the elderly. This study aims to identify effects of cognicise-neurofeedback on health locus of control, depression, and quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) alpha asymmetry in elderly women. Methods: A quasi-experimental control group pre-testâ€“post-test design was used. Korean women aged 65 years or over at a senior welfare center were randomly allocated to the control (n = 12) or experimental (n = 19) groups from July to October 2019. The intervention consisted of cognicise (exercise with intensified cognitive activity) and neurofeedback twice a week for 10 weeks. The locus of control and depression were measured via self-reported questionnaires. QEEG alpha asymmetry was measured using BrainMaster. Results: Depression significantly decreased in the experimental group (t = 4.113, p = 0.001), while internality in the locus of control significantly decreased in the control group (t = 3.023, p = 0.012). On the other hand, QEEG alpha asymmetry index differences in F3-F4 between the pre-test and post-test were not significant in the experimental group (t = 0.491, p = 0.629) or control group (t = 0.413, p = 0.678). Conclusions: Due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, contact between the elderly and healthcare workers in the clinical practice field has become more restricted. These findings can help decrease negative emotions among elderly women in the community based on an integrated neuroscientific approach.","Weon, Heewook, Yoo, Jieun, Yu, Jumhwa, Park, Miso, Son, Haekyoung","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11070899","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(7):899, 2021.; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(7):899, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16404,""
"Ensuring Agricultural Sustainability through Remote Sensing in the Era of Agriculture 50","Timely and reliable information about crop management, production, and yield is considered of great utility by stakeholders (e.g., national and international authorities, farmers, commercial units, etc.) to ensure food safety and security. By 2050, according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates, around 70% more production of agricultural products will be needed to fulfil the demands of the world population. Likewise, to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially the second goal of â€œzero hungerâ€, potential technologies like remote sensing (RS) need to be efficiently integrated into agriculture. The application of RS is indispensable today for a highly productive and sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the present study draws a general overview of RS technology with a special focus on the principal platforms of this technology, i.e., satellites and remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), and the sensors used, in relation to the 5th industrial revolution. Nevertheless, since 1957, RS technology has found applications, through the use of satellite imagery, in agriculture, which was later enriched by the incorporation of remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), which is further pushing the boundaries of proficiency through the upgrading of sensors capable of higher spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. More prominently, wireless sensor technologies (WST) have streamlined real time information acquisition and programming for respective measures. Improved algorithms and sensors can, not only add significant value to crop data acquisition, but can also devise simulations on yield, harvesting and irrigation periods, metrological data, etc., by making use of cloud computing. The RS technology generates huge sets of data that necessitate the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to extract useful products, thereby augmenting the adeptness and efficiency of agriculture to ensure its sustainability. These technologies have made the orientation of current research towards the estimation of plant physiological traits rather than the structural parameters possible. Futuristic approaches for benefiting from these cutting-edge technologies are discussed in this study. This study can be helpful for researchers, academics, and young students aspiring to play a role in the achievement of sustainable agriculture.","Martos, Vanesa, Ahmad, Ali, Cartujo, Pedro, OrdoÃ±ez, Javier","https://doi.org/10.3390/app11135911","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Applied Sciences; 11(13):5911, 2021.; Publication details: Applied Sciences; 11(13):5911, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16405,""

Among participants (n?=?277, 64% women), the most frequently used coping method was nature as a resource in dealing with stress and sadness, followed by listening to the sounds of surrounding nature and thinking of life as part of a greater whole;these coping methods were the most common in all subgroups studied. We used a cultural perspective to better understand the application of certain meaning-making coping methods.","Ahmadi, Fereshteh, Cetrez, Ã–nver A.; Akhavan, Sharareh, Zandi, Saeid","https://doi.org/10.1177/10541373211022002","","Database: sage; Publication details: Illness, Crisis & Loss;: 10541373211022002, 2021.; Publication details: Illness, Crisis & Loss;: 10541373211022002, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16406,""
"Otago exercise programme for physical function and mental health among older adults with cognitive frailty during COVID-19: A randomised controlled trial","Quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in longer-term sedentary behaviours and mental health problems. Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of the Otago exercise programme (OEP) on physical function and mental health among elderly with cognitive frailty during COVID-19. Lockdowns and restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic result in longer-term sedentary behaviours related disease and mental problem. Older people with cognitive frailty are more vulnerable to be influenced. Timely intervention may achieve better outcomes, OEP exercise was designed as a balance and muscle-strengthening programme for elderly people. A parallel-group, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial was performed according to CONSORT guidelines. This study was conducted from July 2020 to October 2020 among 62 elderly people with cognitive frailty from a nursing home. Participants were randomly divided into an OEP group (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 31) or a control group (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 31). Both groups received sleep- and diet-related health education. The OEP group also received a 12-week group exercise programme. The Five Times Sit to Stand Test (FTSST), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT) were used to assess physical function. The Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15) and the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey Mental Component Summary (SF-12 MCS) were used to assess mental health. Outcomes were measured at 6 and 12Ã‚Â weeks. Physical function and mental health were similar in the two groups at baseline. At 12Ã‚Â weeks, the OEP group (difference in change from baseline: FTSST, -2.78; TUGT, -3.73; BBS, 2.17; GDS-15, -0.72; SF-12 MCS, 2.58; all pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001) exhibited significantly greater improvements than the control group (difference in change from baseline: FTSST, 1.55; TUGT, 1.66; BBS, -0.10; GDS-15, 1.07; SF-12 MCS, -5.95; all pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). Our findings showed the OEP group had better physical function and mental health outcomes than the control group. OEP can be used to improve the physical and mental function among elderly people with cognitive frailty during the COVID-19 pandemic. Otago exercise program intervention programmes should be implemented to improve physical function for cognitive frailty elderly to reduce the harm of longer-term sedentary behaviours, and to ruduce depression symptom and improve mental health, particularly during COVID-19 pandemic period.","Chen, Zhao, Liu, Zhou, Zhang, Wei, Chen, Li, Ou, Huang, Yang, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15964","20210721","advanced nursing practice; health promotion; mental health; older people; quality of life; randomised controlled trial","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16407,""
"Sense of Coherence and COVID-19: A Longitudinal Study","The strong restrictive measures adopted in 2020 against the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy have deeply affected the general population's mental health. In the current longitudinal study, we specifically focus on sense of coherence (SOC), both in terms of comprehensibility/manageability and meaningfulness, among a large sample of Italian adults; SOC is a potential resource likely to foster the ability to cope with stressors. A total of 2,191 Italian participants (65.8% female) aged 18-82 completed an anonymous online self-report questionnaire at Time 1 (during the lockdown, March 2020) and at Time 2 (at the resumption of most activities, July 2020). The Repeated Measures Latent Profile Analysis (RMLPA) allowed us to identify seven different SOC profiles based on the change in both SOC dimensions, ranging from a strong ""crisis"" in terms of this resource in the face of the pandemic to a solid possibility to count on it. Interestingly, female and younger respondents were more likely to belong to those profiles characterized by lower levels of SOC, and these profiles have specific relations with fear and wellbeing. The implications of these results and the further expansion of the study are discussed.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/00223980.2021.1952151 .","Danioni, Sorgente, Barni, Canzi, Ferrari, Ranieri, Iafrate, Regalia, Rosnati, Lanz","https://doi.org/10.1080/00223980.2021.1952151","20210721","COVID-19; Repeated Measures Latent Profile Analysis (RMLPA); Sense of coherence; salutogenic approach","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16408,""
"Food insecurity during COVID-19 pandemic: A genuine concern for people from disadvantaged community and low-income families in Province 2 of Nepal","Food insecurity is a serious social and public health problem which is exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic especially in resource-poor countries such as Nepal. However, there is a paucity of evidence at local levels. This study aims to explore food insecurity among people from the disadvantaged community and low-income families during the COVID-19 pandemic in Province-2 of Nepal. The semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted virtually among purposively selected participants (n = 41) from both urban and rural areas in eight districts of Province 2 in Nepal. All the interviews were conducted in the local language between July and August 2020. The data analysis was performed using thematic network analysis in Nvivo 12 Pro software. The results of this study are grouped into four global themes: i) Impact of COVID-19 on food security; ii) Food insecurity and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, iii) Food relief and emergency support during the COVID-19 pandemic, and iv) Impact of COVID-19 and food insecurity on health and wellbeing. Most participants in the study expressed that families from low socioeconomic backgrounds and disadvantaged communities such as those working on daily wages and who rely on remittance had experienced increased food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants used different forms of coping strategies to meet their food requirements during the pandemic. Community members experienced favouritism, nepotism, and partiality from local politicians and authorities during the distribution of food relief. The food insecurity among low-income and disadvantaged families has affected their health and wellbeing making them increasingly vulnerable to the COVID-19 infection. Food insecurity among low-income and disadvantaged families was found to be a serious problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study suggests that the relief support plan and policies should be focused on the implementation of immediate sustainable food security strategies to prevent hunger, malnutrition, and mental health problems among the most vulnerable groups in the community.","Singh, Sunuwar, Shah, Sah, Karki, Sah","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254954","20210721","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16409,""
"Character strengths sustain mental health and post-traumatic growth during the COVID-19 pandemic A longitudinal analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought negative and positive changes in the general population, with some people experiencing post-traumatic growth after the first wave. Little research has focused, however, on personal factors potentially helping individuals cope with COVID-related difficulties. This study investigates the relations between character strengths, mental health, and post-traumatic growth. Longitudinal (T1: April 2020; T2: December 2020-January 2021). 254 Italian adults (54 males; mean age = 36.05, SD = 14.04) completed questionnaires on character and mental health at T1, and on mental health and post-traumatic growth at T2. General mental health was worse at T2 than at T1. Structural equation modelling showed that character, as a whole, had a significant direct effect on post-traumatic growth and mental health at T2, and an indirect effect mediated by post-traumatic growth. Furthermore, regression analyses evidenced that the virtue of transcendence was uniquely related to mental health at T2, while humanity was specifically associated with post-traumatic growth (after accounting for the other virtues). Individuals' character strengths related to their mental health and post-traumatic growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, with evidence of post-traumatic growth mediating the relation between character and mental health.","Casali, Feraco, Meneghetti","https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2021.1952587","20210721","COVID-19; character strengths; mental health; post-traumatic growth; virtues","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16410,""
"Staff's Psychological Well-Being and Coping Mechanisms During COVID-19 Lockdown in Care Homes for Older Adults: A Structural Equation Modeling Analysis","The current study investigated the psychological well-being and coping mechanisms of care home staff during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown. Among 147 staff members, 21.8%, 24.5%, and 12.9% reported depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. The results of structural equation modeling showed that self-efficacy and coping strategies had direct effects on psychological well-being. In the paths from self-perceived caregiving to psychological well-being, self-efficacy and positive coping strategies played mediating roles independently and together, and social support played a mediating role together with coping strategies. Care home staff's psychological well-being was undermined during the COVID-19 lockdown. Interventions aimed at improving staff's self-efficacy, adoption of positive coping strategies, and avoidance of negative coping strategies or considerations of social support along with coping strategies are suggested to decrease exhibited symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.

"The role of psychological flexibility, perceived injustice, and body-image in Vulvodynia: a longitudinal study","Women with Vulvodynia experience pain, related impacts on sex and daily functioning, and depression. While psychosocial factors are associated with outcomes in Vulvodynia, longitudinal data are limited, especially in mixed/spontaneous Vulvodynia. Broad psychological models such as Psychological Flexibility (PF) and content-specific factors such as body-exposure anxiety and avoidance during sexual activities (BEA), and perceived injustice, have not been adequately investigated in Vulvodynia. The aim of this study was to explore whether these factors assessed at baseline predict pain severity, pain-interference, sexual functioning and satisfaction, and depression three months later. A longitudinal study of 349 women with Vulvodynia was conducted. Participants completed online self-report measures of pain-related and sexual outcomes, depression, BEA, perceived injustice, and facets of PF (present-moment-awareness, pain acceptance, committed action) at baseline and after three months, overlapping with the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventy per cent of women responded at both assessments (n=244). There were significant decreases in pain severity, pain-interference, present-moment-awareness, committed action, and a significant increase in depression at three-months. All the baseline psychosocial factors significantly correlated with at least one outcome at three-months. When adjusting for baseline outcome and demographics, committed action significantly positively predicted depression at three-months, and pain acceptance significantly positively predicted pain-interference at three-months. Among women with Vulvodynia, pain acceptance and committed action are prospectively associated with pain-interference and depression. The reliability and generalisability of these results needs to be established given the overlap with the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should investigate whether targeting these factors enhances outcomes in Vulvodynia.","Chisari, Budhraja, Monajemi, Lewis, Moss-Morris, Scott, McCracken","https://doi.org/10.1002/ejp.1841","20210721","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16412,""

"Unintended consequences of COVID-19 social distancing among older adults with kidney disease","While social distancing policies protect older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) from exposure to COVID-19, reduced social interaction may also have unintended consequences. To identify subgroups of patients at risk for unintended health consequences of social distancing, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from a national cohort study of older Veterans with advanced CKD (n=223). Characteristics included activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs (IADLs), cognition score, depression score, social support, financial stress, symptom burden, and number of chronic conditions. Unintended consequences of social distancing included restricted Life Space mobility, low willingness for video telehealth, reduced in-person contact with caregivers, and food insecurity. We identified subgroups of patients at risk of unintended consequences using model-based recursive partitioning (MoB). Participants had a mean age of 77.9 years, 64.6% were white, and 96.9% were male. Overall, 22.4% of participants had restricted Life Space, 33.9% reported low willingness for video telehealth, 19.0% reported reduced caregiver contact, and 3.2% reported food insecurity. For Life Space restriction, four subgroups partitioned (i.e., split) by IADL difficulty, cognition score, and ADL difficulty were identified. The highest rate of restricted Life Space was 54.7% in the subgroup of participants with &gt;3 IADL difficulties For low willingness for telehealth and reduced caregiver contact, separate models identified two subgroups split by cognition score and depression score, respectively.

"Cancer patients and internal medicine patients attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination in Poland","The initial approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) marked a milestone in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased public debate about the vaccine development process and vaccine side effects has activated the anti-vaccine community, which has begun to spread conspiracy theories about vaccine safety. Our study is the first to investigate the awareness of Polish patients suffering from various chronic diseases, mainly cancer, about vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. An anonymous survey was made available from November 2020 to February 2021 to representatives of patient organizations through social media (Facebook) and to patients in the Chemotherapy Department of the Clinical Hospital in PoznaÃ…â€ž. The survey was completed by 836 patients. The majority of the survey respondents had cancer (77%, n = 644), and almost 1/5 of the respondents indicated hypertension (15.7%, n = 131) as well as depression and/or anxiety disorders (11.1%, n = 93).

More than half of the respondents (60.5%, n = 506) intended to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (58.8%, n = 378, among cancer patients; 66.3%, n = 128, among patients with other medical conditions). Fear of vaccine complications and lack of belief in vaccine effectiveness were prevalent among both cancer patients and patients with other medical conditions. The vast majority of cancer and medical patients wanted to be vaccinated against COVID-19. More than half of the respondents did not believe that the COVID-19 vaccine would be safe for them. Education of cancer and medical patients on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, as well as the use of additional protective measures against infection, is an extremely important element of prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kufel-Grabowska, Bartoszkiewicz, Ramlau, Litwiniuk","https://doi.org/10.17219/acem/138962","20210721","COVID-19; cancer patients; infection; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16418,""

Associations between categorical variables were assessed using Pearson's Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> test. Data were analysed in Stata 15.0 RESULTS: Among the five countries, Thai respondents reported having been most, and Slovenian respondents least, affected economically. The following factors were associated with greater negative economic impacts: being 18-24 years or 65 years or older; lower education levels; larger households; having children under 18 in the household and and having flexible/no income. Regarding social impact, respondents expressed most concern about their social life, physical health, mental health and well-being.There were large differences between countries in terms of voluntary behavioural change, and in compliance and agreement with COVID-19 restrictions. Overall, self-reported compliance was higher among respondents who self-reported a high understanding of COVID-19. UK respondents felt able to cope the longest and Thai respondents the shortest with only going out for essential needs or work. Many respondents reported seeing news perceived to be fake, the proportion varying between countries, with education level and self-reported levels of understanding of COVID-19. Our data showed that COVID-19 and public health measures have uneven economic and social impacts on people from different countries and social groups. Understanding the factors associated with these impacts can help to inform future public health interventions and mitigate their negative consequences.

"Statistical analysis plan for a pragmatic phase III randomised controlled trial examining behaviour change physiotherapy intervention to increase physical activity following hip and knee replacements: the PEP-TALK trial","Total hip (THR) and total knee replacements (TKR) are two highly successful orthopaedic procedures that reduce pain for people with osteoarthritis. Previous evidence suggests that physical activity, at best, remains the same pre- to post-operatively, and in some instances declines. The PEP-TALK trial evaluates the effects of a group-based, behaviour change intervention on physical activity following a THR or TKR. PEP-TALK is an open, phase III, pragmatic, multi-centre, parallel, two-arm, two-way superiority randomised controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of usual care plus a behaviour change therapy compared with usual care alone following primary THR or TKR. The primary outcome is the UCLA Activity Score at 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months post-randomisation which will be analysed using a linear mixed effects model. Secondary outcomes measured at 6 months and 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after randomisation include the UCLA Activity Score, Lower Extremity Functional Scale, Oxford Hip/Knee Score, Numerical Rating Scale for Pain, Generalised Self-Efficacy Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L index and EQ-VAS and complications or adverse events. Full details of the planned analysis approaches for the primary and secondary outcomes, as well as the planned sensitivity analyses to be undertaken due to the COVID-19 pandemic, are described here. The PEP-TALK study protocol has been published previously. This paper provides details of the planned statistical analyses for the PEP-TALK trial. This is aimed to reduce the risk of outcome reporting bias and enhance transparency in reporting. International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials database, ISRCTN Number: 29770908 .

"Suicide attempt risks among hotline callers with and without the coronavirus disease 2019 related psychological distress: a case-control study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic profoundly impacts on mental health, yet it is still unclear whether COVID-19 distress makes people more vulnerable to suicidal behavior. The present study aims to examine the association between COVID-19 related psychological distress and risk for suicide attempt, and moderators of this association, among hotline callers. This case-control study was conducted at the largest psychological support hotline in China. Hotline callers who sought help for psychological distress and reported whether or not they attempted suicide in the last 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks (recent suicide attempt) were analyzed. The primary predictor of recent suicide attempt was the presence or absence of COVID-19 related psychological distress. Demographic variables and common risk and protective factors for suicidal behavior were also studied. Callers with COVID-19 related distress (COVID-19 callers) and those without such distress (non-COVID-19 callers) were compared on these variables. Recent suicide attempt was regressed on COVID-19 related distress and the other variables, and significant interaction terms of aforementioned predictors by COVID-19 related distress, to identify variables that moderate the association of COVID-19 related distress and recent suicide attempt. Among 7337 included callers, there were 1252 COVID-19 callers (17.1%) and 6085 non-COVID-19 callers (82.9%). The COVID-19 callers were less likely to report recent suicide attempt (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°73, 5.8%) than the non-COVID-19 callers (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°498, 8.2%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.005). The COVID-19 callers were also less likely to have high scores on depressive symptoms (22.6% vs 26.3%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and psychological distress (19.5% vs 27.3%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and were more likely to have high hopefulness scores (46.5% vs 38.0%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Tests of moderating effects showed that acute life events were associated with one-half lower risk (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.021), and a trend that suicide attempt history was associated with two-thirds greater risk (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.063) for recent suicide attempt, among COVID-19 callers than non-COVID-19 callers. The COVID-19 calls are from individuals with lower suicide-related risk compared to more typical callers. Acute stressful life events provided a key context for suicide attempt in non-COVID-19 callers, i.e., more typical calls.","Tong, Conner, Yin, Zhao, Wang, Wu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03371-3","20210722","Coronavirus disease 2019; Hotline; Life events; Moderator; Prior suicide attempt history; Suicide attempt","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16424,""
"COVID-19 social distancing: negative effects on people with Parkinson disease and their associations with confidence for self-management","The purpose of this study was to describe the effects of COVID-19 social distancing on the function, health, and well-being of people with Parkinson disease (PD), and test the association of these effects with patients' activation levels, i.e., their skills and confidence in managing their health. Community-dwelling individuals with PD answered an anonymous web-based survey. Part 1 included 27 multiple-choice questions regarding changes in function, health, medical care, and well-being. Part 2 consisted of the Patient Activation Measure, which enquired about skills and confidence in managing one's health. Respondents (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°142) reported decreases in various function (24.8%-37.3%), health (33.8%-43%), and well-being (26.1%-47.1%) domains. Rehabilitation ceased for 61.2%. Among those reporting a worsening of health, 67.8% associated this with the cessation of rehabilitative treatments or decrease in physical activity. Patients' activation levels were inversely correlated with increased assistance for activities of daily living, increased tiredness, worsening symptoms, and lack of support from family and friends. Social distancing had a major negative impact on the health and function of people with PD. Supporting people with PD skills and confidence in managing health may preserve their physical and mental health during this period of dramatic changes in life's circumstances.","Yogev-Seligmann, Kafri","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12883-021-02313-6","20210721","COVID-19; Parkinson disease; Patient activation; Self-management; Social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16425,""
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdowns among adult women: the predictive role of individual differences and lockdown duration","COVID-19 pandemic has altered women's mental health as a consequence of the global threat and the lockdown measures adopted by public health policies. It has been suggested that women are at a higher risk for mood alterations, but most of the studies are cross-sectional or have only considered the first days of the confinement in their longitudinal designs. The present study was aimed at evaluating temporal changes in anxiety and depression in a general sample of 155 non-infected adult Spanish women after a complete quarantine. It also explored the predictive role of personality, the establishment of new routines and physical activity during lockdown in a pre-post design assessing temporal and clinical mood changes after 5Ã‚Â weeks of lockdown. Logistic regression analyses showed that higher neuroticism and depressive levels at baseline, lower routines engagement, and lower physical activity during lockdown predicted depression caseness, whereas anxiety caseness was best predicted by higher neuroticism, more days of lockdown and greater anxiety symptoms at baseline. It is concluded that lockdown duration, increased neuroticism and baseline levels of anxiety and depression are risk factors for women's mental health, while routines and physical activity emerge as protective factors for managing psychological wellbeing during the pandemic lockdowns.","Muro, Feliu-Soler, CastellÃƒÂ ","https://doi.org/10.1080/03630242.2021.1954133","20210721","Anxiety; Covid-19; depression; individual differences; personality; physical exercise; routines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16426,""
"Impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on systemic lupus erythematosus patients: Results from a multi-center prospective cohort","The aim of this study was to evaluate the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Patients with SLE participating in a multi-center longitudinal cohort study in New York and Boston were invited to complete a supplemental web-based questionnaire in the summer of 2020. Participants completed standardized patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures and a combination of Likert scale and open-ended questions exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their health and access to health care. Changes in PROs were evaluated with paired t-tests and frequencies of worsened symptoms were calculated. A thematic qualitative analysis was conducted on free text responses. Of 97 patients invited, 63 (65%) completed a supplemental questionnaire. Nearly 50% of respondents exhibited increases in anxiety (47.5%) and depression (48.3%) and over 40% scored worse in measures of pain interference, fatigue, and cognitive abilities. Respondents with pre-existing diagnoses of anxiety did not differ from other participants in PRO scores, but were more than three times as likely to report worsened health status. Patients denied difficulties accessing medications (85%) or medical care (84%) and over 50% participated in telehealth visits. Anxiety and increased health risks due to immunosuppression were recurring themes in free text responses. SLE patients experienced a significant physical and emotional toll in the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Comprehensive patient-centered care, including monitoring and addressing anxiety and health-related quality of life, is critical to improving health outcomes in this population during the ongoing health crisis.","Kasturi, Price, Paushkin, Salmon, McAlindon, Mandl","https://doi.org/10.1177/09612033211033981","20210721","COVID-19; Systemic lupus erythematosus; anxiety; patient reported outcomes; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16427,""
"Managing life during the pandemic: Communication strategies, mental health and the ultimate toll of the COVID-19","The purpose of this review was to present the ultimate toll of the COVID-19 pandemic by focusing on the communication strategies and mental health. We unsystematically reviewed the studies published between 2020-2021 from databases as Google Scholar, Web of Science and ScienceDirect. Firstly, ?new-normal? life challenges during the pandemic were discussed along with the public risk communication strategies. Later, mental health problems, posttraumatic growth, and protective factors were reviewed. Literature highlighted that people mainly experience COVID-19 related fear, anxiety, stress, negative emotions and sleep problems. Furthermore, the rates of clinically significant depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder suggest an increase. Specifically, COVID-19 stress syndrome, loneliness and sleep problems were associated with mental health problems in the pandemic. However, some individuals seem to be resilient to the COVID-19 trauma and experience posttraumatic growth. Brief online intervention studies are promising for reducing the emotional toll of the COVID-19 as well as for making people more resilient. To conclude, the negative conditions of the pandemic seem to make some people, but not all, vulnerable to mental illness. In addition, framing the public warnings in an optimal emotional tone seems to be more effective to comply with the precautions.","TÃƒÂ¼rkÃƒÂ§apar, Kahya, Ãƒâ€¡apar TaÃ…Å¸kesen, IÃ…Å¸ik","https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2106-175","20210721","Coronavirus disease-19; health communication; mental health; posttraumatic growth; protective factors; psychological intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-23","",16428,""
