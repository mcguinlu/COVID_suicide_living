"The Resilience and Mental Health Experiences of Emerging Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Creating Safeguards for the Future","There is limited research on the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on emerging adults from diverse communities, including those with disabilities, international students, and students who identify as part of the LGBTQ2AAI+ community. A purposeful sample of seven undergraduate students, between the ages of 19 and 30, at a university in British Columbia, Canada, participated in this study. In-depth narrative style interviews were conducted via Zoom. Data were analyzed thematically and from a resilience lens framework. This study demonstrates that participants experienced a diversity of challenges, and thus engaged in differing processes of adjustment. Four protective factors were identified: (1) Positive relationships;(2) Perceived efficacy;(3) Purpose and ambition;and (4) Sense of normality. This study contributes towards the limited research base, and thus offers valuable insights, which can inform university policy makers, university administration, and public health policy makers to be better positioned to develop innovative adaptions of services and/or delivery.","Roberts, J.; Humbert, B.; MacMillan, R.; Duff, C.","https://doi.org/10.1177/21582440221082148","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sage Open; 12(1):11, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29711,""
"Worry, Perceived Discrimination, Lifestyle Changes, and Protective Factors During COVID-19: A Study With Recovering Patients in Delhi, India","COVID-19 has affected people all over the world. For those who were infected by the virus, the repercussions go beyond immediate medical conditions to include social stigma, fear, uncertainty, and lifestyle changes. This study presents data collected as part of a mental health intervention (COVID Response) with individuals who had been diagnosed with coronavirus and had completed the minimum 14 days isolation period, in the city of Delhi, India. Through a survey conducted telephonically, participants self reported on six major mental health indicators: levels of worry, mood, lifestyle changes made through the phase of diagnosis and recovery, perceived discrimination faced due to the diagnosis, and the willingness to donate blood plasma. Descriptive findings show lower levels of worry than at the time of testing and diagnosis, positive mood states, and availability of social support. One Way Anova results further indicate that worry differed significantly across groups with differences in lifestyle changes, reported mood, availability of medical care, and the willingness to donate plasma. These findings contribute toward an informed understanding about recovery from coronavirus and sustainable coping with the pandemic, which can aid related health initiatives and evolving policy.","Majumdar, S.; Acholia, P.; Saraf, S.; Khurana, S.","https://doi.org/10.1177/21582440221079878","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sage Open; 12(1):14, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29712,""

"Foreign bodies in the urinary tract-can we learn something from the pandemic?","Aim: We aim to quantify the morbidity and resource utilisation from patients presenting with foreign bodies in the urinary tract and analyse the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the numbers. Often these patients have co-existing mental health issues, which necessitates coordinated multi-disciplinary care. It is important that patient care is assessed holistically, with assessment of whether changes in mental health care impact urological morbidity. Method: We performed a 2-year, retrospective, single-institution study of patients requiring removal of foreign bodies from their urinary tract. Results: There were 49 episodes of patients needing removal of foreign body;all were inpatients at the regional mental health hospital.8% of patient episodes presented with urinary sepsis. All patients had successful general anaesthetic, endoscopic removal of the foreign body from their urinary tract. There was significantly more episode's prepandemic (38 episodes, mean 2.7 per month) than during the pandemic (11 episodes, mean 1.1 per month). During the pandemic, staffing levels within the mental health hospital have been increased to enable isolation procedures to be conducted when necessary. It was felt that the reduction in foreign body insertion episodes was a consequence of this. The resultant reduction in acute hospital admissions and procedures is estimated to have saved Â£400,256 per annum. Conclusions: Patients presenting with a foreign body in the urinary tract utilize a considerable number of resources and are a source of morbidity. Urosepsis and retention arecommon sequelae. Reduced episodes during the pandemic have shown that increased staffing levels have a positive effect and could be cost-effective. It is imperative that this data is used to appropriately allocate resources to reduce patient morbidity.","Pinnamaraju, P.; Warner, R.; Pai, A.","https://doi.org/10.1093/bjs/znac039","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: British Journal of Surgery; 109(SUPPL 1):i57, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29714,""
"COVID-19-related racial discrimination on Asian Australians: An evaluation of symptoms of psychological distress, social support, and acculturation","COVID-19 restrictions and the social and financial repercussions are negatively affecting the mental health of Australians. Asian Australians may be further at risk of negative mental health outcomes due to the racial discrimination that has emerged during this pandemic. This study used an online questionnaire to assess whether COVID-19-related racial discrimination (firsthand and secondhand), acculturation, and perceived social support predicted psychological distress (depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms) among Asian Australians (n = 113, Mage = 29.82, SDage = 11.96, nonbinary n = 1, female n = 69, male n = 43). Participants perceived high social support and reported moderate amounts of COVID-19-related racial discrimination, as well as moderate cultural preferences for both host and heritage cultures. Multiple regression analyses indicated that (a) social support from significant others and family significantly predicted variance in depressive symptoms, (b) no independent variable was able to significantly predict variance in anxiety, and (c) social support from the family significantly predicted variance in stress. Participants reported mild amounts of depressive symptoms, normal amounts of stress symptoms, and verging amounts of anxiety symptoms that could be considered mild. This research contributes to the wider literature as one of the first studies to focus on Asian Australian mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and to empirically support anecdotal evidence of COVID-19-related racial discrimination.

"Mental Health and the PhD: Insights and Implications for Political Science","There is a severe mental health crisis among graduate students in political science. We present findings from an original survey on the mental health of political science PhD students at seven US universities. Our results are concerning: 15.8% expressed thoughts of suicide in the two weeks prior to taking the survey. About 30% of respondents met the criteria for depression and only a third of those were receiving treatment. Approximately 32% met the criteria for anxiety and fewer than half were receiving treatment. We also found that students with poorer mental health were more isolated, had fewer friends in their department and fewer people to turn to for help, and were more likely to contemplate dropping out of their program. Our study raises important questions about the experiences of graduate students during the PhD program and serves as an urgent call to action to address the well-being of our colleagues.","Almasri, Nasir, Read, Blair, Vandeweerdt, Clara","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1049096521001396","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: PS, Political Science & Politics; 55(2):347-353, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29716,""

"ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION WITH VESSEL OCCLUSION IN A YOUNG ADULT WITH A MECHANICAL AORTIC VALVE","Background: The occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI) with coronary vessel occlusion in an otherwise young, healthy adult with a mechanical aortic valve is rare. Case: A 25-year-old male with a history of congenital AS status-post mechanical aortic valve replacement presented to the hospital with an acute MI due to thromboembolism due to subtherapeutic INR. The patient developed ventricular fibrillation en route to the emergency department. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after one round of CPR with synchronized cardioversion. On admission, labs were significant for high sensitivity troponin &gt;27,000 x 3, BNP 23, INR 1.8. The patient was positive for COVID-19 but was asymptomatic. EKG showed ST elevations in leads I, AVL with reciprocal depressions in leads II, III and AVF. The patient underwent an emergent left heart catheterization which showed a normally functioning mechanical aortic valve and 100% occlusion of the mid LAD. After several rounds of balloon angioplasty, a thrombus was aspirated, mechanical thrombectomy was performed and a drug-eluding stent was deployed under IVUS guidance with restoration of TIMI 3 flow. A transthoracic echocardiogram following PCI showed an ejection fraction of 40% with anterior wall hypokinesis and mean aortic valve gradient of 10mmHg. The patient followed up in clinic two months later and was doing well. Decision-making: The effect of valvular heart disease on heart failure and cardiogenic shock is well studied. However, the occurrence of myocardial infarction due to thromboembolism in young patients with a subtherapeutic INR in the setting of mechanical aortic valve is not well described in literature. Conclusion: This case highlights both the importance of compliance with anticoagulation in patients with mechanical valves and a rare cause of myocardial infarction;i.e., non-compliance with anticoagulation in the setting of mechanical aortic valve. In addition, COVID-19 has been well established as a prothrombotic disease process, adding to the plot of this unusual case.","Jain, A.; Toirac, A.; Prasada, S.; Massey, J.; Mahmoud, A.; Choi, C.

"VERY LATE STENT THROMBOSIS AFTER JOHNSON & JOHNSON/JANSSEN VACCINATION","Background: Stent thrombosis (ST) is a dreaded complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), however incidence has been declining with improvement in stent design and pharmacological treatments. While ST can occur at any time after placement of a stent, the rate of ST declines as time from implantation progresses. Case: A 54 year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type two diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease status PCI to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) six years prior presented with substernal chest discomfort for three hours. Vital signs were within normal limits, and his electrocardiogram showed two-to-three-millimeter ST elevation across the precordial leads with reciprocal ST depressions. He was brought emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where coronary angiography revealed a large thrombus within the previously placed LAD stent. The patient underwent aspiration thrombectomy, balloon angioplasty and stenting of the LAD. The patient was discharged in good condition on dual-antiplatelet therapy three days after his presentation. Decision-making: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians on the front lines have been learning more and more about the virus including prevention and treatment. In a stunning collaboration of science and enterprise, several vaccines were created including the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen (J&J) single dose COVID-19 immunization. However, although effective at preventing serious COVID-19 infections, anecdotal evidence of thrombotic events has been reported. Given this patient&apos;s thrombotic event, a hypercoagulable workup was undertaken but unrevealing. Conclusion: We describe a case of very late ST of a six year-old drug eluting stent occurring three weeks after the patient received a J&J COVID-19 vaccine. While temporally the timing of the stent thrombosis is surprising and possibly related, this is yet another case to add to the body of evidence as we learn more about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus and the COVID-19 vaccines as we navigate this pandemic together.","Stauber, B.; Manalang, E.

"SELF-LIMITING MYOCARDITIS IN A YOUNG FEMALE: VIRUS OR VACCINE?","Background: Although rare, there is increasing incidence of myocarditis in young adult males who receive the second dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. We present a rare case of myocarditis in a young female following the initial dose. Case: A 20-year-old female presented with progressive pleuritic chest pain and fever. Past medical history was significant for depression and COVID-19 infection 5 months prior to admission. She received the first dose of the Moderna mRNA vaccine one week prior to admission. She had elevated D-dimer, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and troponin levels. Electrocardiogram showed PR depression. Echocardiogram, respiratory viral panels, and cultures were normal. Decision-making: Due to persistent worsening chest pain, she underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI), which was consistent with myocarditis. She was treated with supportive care and her condition improved. Given the temporal relationship between vaccine administration and symptom onset, as well as negative viral testing, it was determined that the Moderna vaccine was likely the culprit. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccine-induced myocarditis is becoming a more recognized entity, however other more common etiologies should be first ruled out. Nonetheless, the benefits of immunization against COVID-19 outweigh the risks of vaccine-induced myocarditis. [Formula presented]","Khan, S.; Samaan, S.; Marcu, C.

"Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic Related Mental Health on State Anxiety in Thailand (preprint); COVID-19 | Pandemic | Mental Health | State Anxiety","The objective of this academic article is to study the anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic situation which affects the mental health of people in Thailand. Since the pandemic has spread all over the world, including Thailand, has taken place over a long period of time and it is unlikely to end, the discovery of new knowledge both in terms of infection spreading and mutation still exists. As the recent mutation called Omicron has been found to spread faster than other strains, it results in the concern to the general public. According to the results of study collecting psychological information, it was found that the factors that drives high anxiety are overestimating threat, inflated sense of responsibility, and intolerance of uncertainty. Solving these factors will help reducing the anxiety about COVID-19. There should be continuously further studies of this disease. There should be an agency that provides accurate information quickly in a timely manner to help relieving the anxiety that arises. This allows the public to live a new normal life amidst the continuance to face this disease without risking mental health problems caused by anxiety from such situations.","Urairak, Buppachat","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effect+of+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+Related+Mental+Health+on+State+Anxiety+in+Thailand+(preprint);+COVID-19+|+Pandemic+|+Mental+Health+|+State+Anxiety","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29721,""

"Therapeutic interventions in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2: A review (preprint)","SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a life-threatening virus claiming number of lives and adversely affecting the physical, mental health and economic growth world-wide. There is an urgent need to treat this life threatening condition as it is adversely affecting the mankind. Because of the pandemic, the global economic rate has declined by several folds. Initially, FDA approved drugs for other diseases have been repurposed for treatment, but these therapeutic strategies do not provide targeted treatment to treat Covid-19. Broad spectrum antiviral drugs, their combinations and life supporting systems provide effective result to inhibit viral entry and replication. Other therapeutic options like Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) blockers and Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitors and plasma therapy have proven to have greater potential to target the virus. In this review, we have discussed a number of therapeutic interventions like use of antiviral drugs, drug combination therapy and other therapeutics that are currently exhibiting effective results and helping to lower the mortality rate significantly. Vaccine is the best option as it elicits immune response and provides long-term immunity to fight against such infections.

"Did Suicide Numbers Diverge from Pre-Existing Trends During the First 9-15 Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic? Interrupted Time Series Analyses of Total and Sex- and Age-Specific Suicide Counts in 33 Countries (preprint); Suicide | COVID-19 | pandemic | monitoring","Background When the COVID-19 pandemic began there were concerns that suicides might rise, but predicted increases were not generally observed in the pandemicâ€™s early months. However, the picture may be changing and patterns may vary across demographic groups. We aimed to provide an up-to-date, granular picture of the impact of COVID-19 on suicides globally.Methods We identified suicide data from official public-sector sources for countries/areas-within-countries. We used interrupted time series (ITS) analyses to model the association between the pandemicâ€™s emergence and total suicides and suicides by sex-, age- and sex-by-age in each country/area-within-country. We compared the observed number of suicides to the expected number in the pandemicâ€™s first nine and first 10-15 months and used meta-regression to explore sources of variation.Findings We sourced data from 33 countries (24 high-income, six upper-middle-income, three lower-middle-income). There was no evidence of greater-than-expected numbers of suicides in the majority of countries/areas-within-countries in any analysis;more commonly, there was evidence of lower-than-expected numbers. Certain sex, age and sex-by-age groups stood out as potentially concerning, but these were not consistent across countries/areas-within-countries. In the meta-regression, different patterns were not explained by countriesâ€™ COVID-19 mortality rate, stringency of public health response, level of economic support, or presence of a national suicide prevention strategy. They were also not explained by countriesâ€™ income level, although the meta-regression only included data from high-income and upper-middle-income countries, and there were suggestions from the ITS analyses that lower-middle-income countries fared less well.Interpretation Although there are some countries/areas-within-countries where overall suicide numbers and numbers for certain sex- and age-based groups are greater-than-expected, these are in the minority. Any upward movement in suicide numbers in any place or group is concerning, and we need to remain alert to and respond to changes as the pandemic and its mental health and economic consequences continue.","Pirkis, Jane, Gunnell, David, Shin, Sangsoo, DelPozo-Banos, Marcos, Arya, Vikas, Analuisa Aguilar, Pablo, Appleby, Louis, Arafat, S.

"Risk factors and preventive interventions for post Covid-19 condition: systematic reviews (preprint)","Background The Covid-19 outbreak has presented many challenges to governments and healthcare systems, including observations of symptoms that persist beyond acute infection labelled as post Covid-19 condition. Objectives To systematically identify and synthesize evidence around pre-existing and clinical risk factors for post Covid-19 condition (occurring =12 weeks after positive test/symptom onset) (KQ1), and interventions during the acute and post-acute phases of the illness that could potentially prevent post Covid-19 condition (KQ2). Methods We searched Medline and Embase (Jan 2021-Aug 12 2021 [KQ1], and Jan 2020-Jul 28, 2021 [KQ2]), Clinicaltrials.gov, organizational websites, and reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. Two investigators independently reviewed s and full-text articles against a priori inclusion criteria, and disagreements were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third reviewer. One investigator ed data and assessed risk of bias using design-specific criteria, and a second investigator checked data ion and assessments for completeness and accuracy. Meta-analysis was performed when there was sufficient clinical and methodological similarity in an exposure-outcome comparison, based on prespecified variables. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach (GRADE). A relative effect/association of 0.75-1.49 was considered as â€œlittle-to-noâ€, whereas 0.50-0.74/1.5-1.99 was â€œsmall-to-moderateâ€ and &lt;0.50/ =2.00 was â€œlargeâ€ for fewer/benefit or more/harm, respectively Results From 4,672 (KQ1) and 3,781 (KQ2) citations we included 17 and 18 studies, though 4 studies were included for both KQs. We found small-to-moderate associations between female sex and higher non-recovery, fatigue, and dyspnea (moderate certainty). Severe or critical acute-phase Covid-19 severity (versus not) has probably (moderate certainty) a large association with increased cognitive impairment, a small-to-moderate association with more non-recovery, and a little-to-no association with dyspnea. There may be (low certainty) large associations between hospitalization during the acute illness and increased non-recovery, increased dyspnea, and reduced return to work. There may be small-to-moderate associations between several other risk factors and post Covid-19 condition outcomes, including age =60 versus &lt;60 (functional incapacity), non-White people (lower return to work), children age &gt;6 versus &lt;2 years (non-recovery), having =1 versus no comorbidities (non-recovery), chronic pulmonary disease (fatigue), rheumatologic disorder (depression/anxiety), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or hypertension (cognitive impairment). Several other risk factors had low certainty for little-to-no association with one or more outcomes (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease) or very low certainty. Interventions to prevent post Covid-19 condition included medications (standard and traditional/ayurvedic), stem cell therapy, rehabilitation or similar therapies, and screening/referrals at either acute phase (symptom onset to 4 weeks) or early post-acute phase (4-8 week), with short (12-16 weeks) or longer (&gt;16 weeks) follow-up for outcomes. We are very uncertain about the effects of preventive interventions, mainly due to risk of bias, inconsistency/lack of consistency (single studies), and in some cases imprecision. Conclusions Guidelines in relation to surveillance, screening services, and other services such as access to sickness and disability benefits, might need to focus on females and those with previously severe Covid-19 illness. Interventions targeting fatigue, dyspnea, and cognitive impairment (especially in those who had severe Covid-19) may be good to prioritize for development and evaluation to provide evidence on their effects. Inputs from patients and primary care providers should be taken into account when deve oping new care pathways and some tailoring to individual needs will likely be paramount. Continuous assessment of the rapidly emerging evidence is important to better shape our understanding as the body of evidence grows. Sufficiently powered prospective trials of preventive interventions are warranted.

"Tracking the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown policy on public mental health using social media (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic and its corresponding preventive and control measures have increased the mental burden on the public. Social media serve as important platforms to timely track public mental status. In this study, we conducted social-media-based analyses on temporal, geographical and occupational distributions of public mental health status during the pandemic, and how the public reacted to the lock-down policy from the perspective of mental health. We extracted 2,973,319 mental health-related tweets of 1,778,140 users from February 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021. We found that, compared to the general public, healthcare workers had higher concerns on three types of mental health problems (depression, insomnia, addiction) (P&lt;0.001) and focused more on clinical topics while the public worried more about daily life issues. The lockdown policy in New York was correlated with a proportional decrease of mental health-related tweets, while Florida had an opposite correlation (both P&lt;0.05). Our findings indicated that the mental burden brought by the pandemic varied across occupations and locations and changed over time.","Li, Minghui, Hua, Yining, Liao, Yanhui, Zhou, Li, Li, Xue, Wang, Ling, Yang, Jie","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1498436/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29726,""
"THE IMPACT OF ROUTINES ON EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIOURAL DIFFICULTIES IN CHILDREN AND ON PARENTAL ANXIETY DURING COVID-19 (preprint)","Aims and hypothesis We hypothesised that there would be an association between maintaining a routine during lockdown and both lower emotional and behavioural difficulties in children and lower parental anxiety. We also hypothesised that children of â€˜keyworkerâ€™ parents would have fewer emotional and behavioural symptoms due to having maintained more normal routines. Background The Covid-19 pandemic and related public health measures have impacted on mental health of children. Methods We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to explore associations between maintaining a routine, and emotional and behavioural difficulties in children, using linear regression models. We included measures of parental anxiety. We separately explored associations with having a keyworker parent. We used the Carey Infant Temperament Questionnaire and the Revised Rutter Parent Scale for Preschool Children to establish levels of emotional and behavioural difficulties. Results 289 parents completed questionnaires about their 411 children. Keeping a routine was associated with emotional and behavioural difficulty scores 5.0 points lower (95% CI -10.0 to - 0.1), p=0.045 than not keeping a routine. Parents who reported keeping a routine had anxiety scores 4.3 points lower (95% CI -7.5 to -1.1), p=0.009 than those who did not. Children of keyworkers tended to have lower emotional and behavioural difficulty scores (-3.1 (95%CI -6.26 to 0.08), p=0.056) than children of non-keyworkers. All models were adjusted for relevant potential confounders. Conclusion Maintaining a routine may be beneficial for both child emotional wellbeing and parental anxiety, although it is also possible that lower parental anxiety levels made maintaining a routine easier. Being the child of a keyworker parent during lockdown may have been protective for child emotional wellbeing.","Lees, Vera, Hay, Rosie, Bould, Helen, Kwong, Alex, Major-Smith, Daniel, Kounali, Daphne, Pearson, Rebecca","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.25.22272950","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29727,""
"Tracking population mental health before and across stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in young adults (preprint)","Summary The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with worsening mental health. Longitudinal studies have monitored changes in mental health from pre-pandemic levels, identifying critical points for mental health as COVID-19 restrictions evolve. Here we highlight changes in depression and anxiety in the UK from pre-pandemic across four pandemic occasions: April and June 2020, January, and July 2021 â€“ corresponding to changes in COVID-19 restrictions. Data were from &gt;5,000 27â€“29-year-olds from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We found that anxiety almost doubled throughout the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels and remained high until July 2021 when COVID-19 restrictions were fully lifted. Depression was lower than pre-pandemic levels in April 2020 but increased as the pandemic evolved until July 2021. Women, those with existing mental/physical health conditions and those with economic hardship were most at risk of sustained poorer mental health across the pandemic. Our results highlight the importance of longitudinal studies for tracking mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and across virus suppression policy changes.","Kwong, Alex, Northstone, Kate, Pearson, Rebecca, McIntosh, Andrew, Timpson, Nicholas","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.24.22272899","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29728,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic and the Resulting Lifestyle Restrictions: The Effect on Classroom (preprint); COVID-19","Thriving for excellence can be very stressful at all times. According to new rules, the environment of a classroom is not the same friendly as it was until before the outburst of the pandemic. The new reality imposed restrictions have made it very difficult for students to get along with the delivery of knowledge without being affected by the prolonged uncertainty, fear and anxiety towards infections, precautionary social isolation and the possible economic disruption. All the above could leave them feeling lost. The sudden lifestyle paradigm shift of an accomplished individual could result in major confusion. This year many adolescents are retuning back to school after extensive closures and the need for safety and support as the year kicks off is of great importance. With 75% of adult mental health problems starting by the age of 18 adolescence, according to the UKHLS findings (Smith et al., 2021), itâ€™s a key period in the development of long-lasting mental health difficulties.","Kassapi, Sophia","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+Pandemic+and+the+Resulting+Lifestyle+Restrictions:+The+Effect+on+Classroom+(preprint);+COVID-19","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29729,""
"Increased blood monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and decreased activated T lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients (preprint)","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may produce a systemic disease, the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), with high morbidity and mortality. Even though we do not fully understand the interaction of innate and adaptive immunity in the control and complications of the viral infection, it is well recognized that SARS-CoV-2 induces an immunodepression that impairs the elimination of the virus and favors its rapid dissemination in the organism. Even less is known the possible participation of inhibitory cells of the innate immune system, such as the myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), or the adaptive immune system, such as the T regulatory cells (Tregs). That is why we aimed to study blood levels of MDSCs as well as lymphocyte subpopulations including Tregs, and activated (OX-40+) and inhibited (PD-1) T lymphocytes in patients with COVID-19 in comparison with data obtained from control donors. We have found that 12 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and no health history of immnosuppression had a significant increase in the number of peripheral monocytic MDSCs, but not Tregs, as well as an increase in the number of inhibited or exhausted T cells, whereas the number of activated T cells was significantly decreased compared with that from 20 healthy controls. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation (- 0.791) between the number of M-MDSC and the number of activated T cells. Therefore, SARS-Cov-2 seems to recruit MDSCs, and these inhibitory cells may contribute to the immunosuppression observed in patients with COVID-19.","JimÃ©nez-Cortegana, Carlos, LirÃ³, Julia, PalazÃ³n-CarriÃ³n, Natalia, Sojo-Dorado, JesÃºs, Salamanca, Elena, Cruz-Merino, Luis de la, Pascual, Alvaro, Rodriguez-BaÃ±o, Jesus, Sanchez-Margalet, Victor","https://doi.org/10.22541/au.164864738.87549346/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29730,""
"Burnout among Psychotherapists: A Cross-cultural Value Survey among 12 European Countries during the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic (preprint)","Objective:  The aim of this study was to examine cross-cultural differences, as operationalized by Schwartz's refined theory of basic values, in burnout levels among psychotherapists from 12 European countries during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We focused on the multilevel approach to investigate if individual- and country-aggregated level values could explain differences in burnout intensity after controlling for sociodemographic and work-related characteristics and COVID-19-related distress among participants. Methods In this study, 2915 psychotherapists from 12 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, Great Britain, Serbia, Spain, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sweden, and Switzerland) participated in this study. The participants completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Service Survey, the revised version of the Portrait Values Questionnaire, and a survey questionnaire on sociodemographic and work-related factors. Results Multilevel analysis revealed that burnout at the individual level was negatively related to self-transcendence and openness-to-change values but positively related to self-enhancement and conservation values. However, no significant effects on any values were observed at the country level. Moreover, male sex, younger age, being single, and reporting higher COVID-19-related distress were identified as significant burnout correlates. Conclusions Burnout among psychotherapists may be a transcultural phenomenon, where individual differences among psychotherapists are likely to be more important than differences between the countries of their practice. This finding enriches the discussion on training in psychotherapy in an international context and draws attention to the neglected issue of mental health among psychotherapists in the context of their professional functioning.","Hoy, Angelika Van, Rzeszutek, Marcin, Pieta, Malgorzata, Mestre, Jose, Mora, Ãlvaro RodrÃ­guez, Midgley, Nick, Omylinska-Thurston, Joanna, Dopierala, Anna, FalkenstrÃ¶m, Fredrik, Ferlin, Jennie, Gergov, Vera, Lazic, Milica, Ulberg, Randi, RÃ¸ssberg, Jan Ivar, Hancheva, Camellia, Stoyanova, Stanislava, Schmidt, Stefanie, Podina, Ioana, Ferreira, Nuno, Kagialis, Anthony, LÃ¶ffler-Stastka, Henriette, Gruszczynska, Ewa","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1414848/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29731,""
"Unravelling the link between sleep and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background:  The emergence of COVID-19 brought unparalleled changes in peoples lifestyle, including sleep. We aimed to assess the bidirectional association between sleep quality and mental health and describe how sleep and mental health were affected in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic (between June 2020 and September 2021). Methods: Data were obtained from the Omtanke2020 study. Participants who completed the baseline survey and 8 monthly follow-up surveys were included (N=9035). We described the distribution of sleep and mental health in the different Swedish regions using maps and over the study period with longitudinal graphs adjusting for sex, age, recruitment type (self-recruitment or invitation), and COVID-19 status. The inner relationships between mental health, sleep and covid infection were described through relative importance networks. Finally, we modelled how mental health affects sleep and vice versa using generalized estimating equations with different adjustments. Results: Seasonal and north-south regional variations were found in sleep and mental health outcomes at baseline and attenuated over time. The seasonal variation of sleep and mental health correlated moderately with the incidence rate of COVID-19 in the sample. Networks indicate that the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and mental health varies over time. We observed a bidirectional relationship between sleep quality and quantity at baseline and mental health at follow-up and vice versa. Conclusion: Sleep quality and quantity at baseline was associated with adverse symptom trajectories of mental health at follow-up, and vice versa, during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is also a weak relationship between COVID-19 incidence, sleep, and mental health.","Gonzalez-Hijon, Juan, KÃ¤hler, Anna, Frans, Emma, ValdimarsdÃ³ttir, Unnur Anna, Sullivan, Patrick, Fang, Fang, Lovik, AnikÃ³","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.28.22273027","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29732,""
"Maternal Fear of COVID-19 and prevalence of postnatal depression symptoms: Risk and protective factors (preprint)","Objective:  To evaluate the relations between Fear of COVID-19 and postpartum depression (PPD) symptoms. Design: A multicenter prospective observational study. Setting and Population: A cohort of women who delivered during COVID-19 pandemic between 03-05/2020. Methods: Participants were virtually approached after delivery and asked to complete an online questionnaire. Data was verified with each centerâ€™s perinatal database. The validated Fear of COVID-19 Scale was in use. PPD was evaluated using the EPDS questionnaire as a categorical (=10) and as a continuous scale. Pre-existing maternal disability was defined as any prior physiological/psychological chronic health condition. Stress-contributing complications during pregnancy or at birth included pregnancy and labor related complications. Regression analysis and ROC statistics were utilized to evaluate associations and control for confounders. Main Outcome Measure: PPD symptoms. Results: Overall, 421 women completed the questionnaires. Of them, 99(23.5%) had a high EPDS score. Fear of COVID-19 was positively correlated with PPD symptoms (r=0.35,p=0.000),ROC-AUC 0.67, 95%CI 0.61-0.74. Following adjustment to confounders (maternal age, nulliparity, ethnicity, marital status, financial difficulties, maternal disability, accessibility to medical services, and stress-contributing complications during pregnancy (, the most important factor that correlated with depression was maternal disability (aOR3,95%CI 1.3-6.9) followed by Fear of COVID-19 (aOR1.1,95%CI 1.05-1.15). High accessibility to medical services (aOR0.59,95% CI 0.45-0.77) and stress-contributing complications during pregnancy (aOR0.2, 95% CI 0.11-0.82) were both protective for PPD symptoms.

Using a nationally representative panel survey, we find that COVID-19 exposure led to a decrease in the levels of generalized trust. We also show that the change in interpersonal trust varied across domains. Specifically, COIVD-19 exposure significantly decreased trust in parents, neighbors, and local government officials, but had small and insignificant effects on trust in doctors, strangers, and Americans. Empirical tests suggest that changes in income and physical health status are not likely to be potential channels.

"Trauma-informed care in UK: where are we? A qualitative study of health policies and professional perspectives (preprint)","Background:  Trauma-informed (TI) approach is a framework for a system change intervention that transforms the organisational culture and practices to address the high prevalence and impact of trauma on patients and healthcare providers and prevent re-traumatisation in healthcare services. Our systematic review of TI approaches in primary and community mental healthcare identified limited evidence for its effectiveness in the UK, despite endorsement in various policies. We aimed to explain the evidence-policy gap by analysing how and why TI approaches are represented, understood, and implemented in the UK. Methods: : A qualitative study comprising of a document analysis of UK health policies followed by semi-structured interviews with key informants with direct experience of developing and implementing TI approaches. We used the Ready Extract Analyse Distil (READ) approach, and framework method. Results:  We analysed 25 documents and interviewed 11 professionals from healthcare organisations and local authorities. Policies from healthcare organisations, local authorities, and Scottish and Welsh governments recommended TI approaches. However, there was no UK-wide strategy, agreed terminology and framework, or robust evidence base. Despite growing endorsement of TI approaches in policies, positive statements were not backed up with legislation, funding or resource allocation. Documents and interviews revealed differing understandings of TI approaches between geographical areas and across services, with disconnected, piecemeal implementation. Professionals explained the current landscape of TI approaches by the lack of high-level strategy and leadership, a need for adequate evaluation funding, and a lack of understanding of the term, existing frameworks and evidence available. They wanted more coordination and collaboration between organisations and regions. We identified factors that affected implementation of TI approaches at the level of organisation (leadership support, bottom-up and top-down development, presence of systemic thinking, organisational culture, resource allocation, competing priorities) and wider context (government support, funding, impact of the COVID-19 pandemic). Professionals had conflicting views on the future of TI approaches, however all agreed that government backing is essential for implementing policies into practice. Conclusions: : A coordinated, centralised strategy on TI approaches in health systems, improved funding for evaluation, and education through professional networks about evidence-based TI health systems can increase value and reduce waste in research and implementation of TI approaches in the UK.","Emsley, Elizabeth, Smith, Joshua, Martin, David, Lewis, Natalia","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1459547/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29735,""
"Omicron and future public health emergencies: Sustainability and insights into support programs for healthcare providers (preprint)","Background:  The mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) has been at the forefront throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. While workplace-based support programs have been developed in hospitals globally, few systematically collected data. While critical to their success, information on these programs and the experience of mental healthcare providers (MHP) who support colleagues is limited. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences of MHP caring for HCW colleagues within a novel workplace-based mental health support program during the COVID-19 pandemic, to provide insights on facilitators, areas for improvement and barriers to program sustainability. Methods: : This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews conducted by videoconference between September 2020 to October 2021. UHN CARES (University Health Network Coping and Resilience for Employees and Staff) Program was developed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. It supports over 21,000 staff members within the UHN, Canadaâ€™s largest academic health research institution, in Toronto, Canada. Purposive sampling was used to select 10 of the 22 MHP in the UHN CARES Program. Using a critical realism framework, key components required to sustain a successful workplace-based mental health support program for HCWs and balance the needs of MHP were determined. Results: : Six psychiatrists and four psychologists with varying roles at UHN participated in 17 interviews, with repeat interviews exploring changes over time within the pandemic and program. Components which facilitated the success of the program included flexibility in scheduling, confidential health record storage, comprehensive administrative support, availability of resources and adaptive quality improvement approach. Recommendations for improvement included opportunities for peer supervision, triaging of cases, and managing HCW expectations. MHP found caring for HCWs to be meaningful and they utilized existing clinical skills during sessions. Challenges included working in a virtual setting, navigating boundaries when caring for colleagues, and managing the range of service users and their needs. Conclusions: : These findings suggest how support programs can be structured for HCWs, how to provide support, and how to sustain this support, allowing health systems to balance the needs of HCWs and MHPs in preparation for future public health emergencies.","Dhuper, Misha, Ruttan, Lesley, MacGillvray, Lindsey, McKay, Martha, DclinPsy, Adrienne Li, Stewart, Donna, Abbey, Susan, Berkhout, Suze, Sheehan, Kathleen, Schulz-Quach, Christian","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1447560/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29736,""

"Anxiety and depression in community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia in China during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background:  The 2019 Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) poses a huge challenge to the global public health. People with schizophrenia living in communities urgently need effective interventions to help them adjust to life and work, but they have not received enough attention. This study aims to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in community-dwelling patients with schizophrenia in China during the epidemic, and to explore possible influencing factors. Methods Using a cross-sectional survey, we collected 15165 questionnaires. Assessments included subjectsâ€™ demographic information, knowledge of COVID-19-related information, sleep status, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and other accompanying illnesses. The Chinese versions of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to evaluate the depression and anxiety of patients. Results Moderate to severe anxiety accounted for 16.9%, and the percentage of moderate and above depression was 34.9%. T-test showed that females with schizophrenia had a significantly higher score of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 than males with schizophrenia (t=-2.03, P = 0.042;t=-3.27, P = 0.001), and patients without other accompanying long-standing diseases (t = 4.18, P &lt; 0.001;t = 6.86, P &lt; 0.001), not understanding COVID-19 (t = 8.17, P&lt;0.001;t = 2.29, P = 0.022) had lower GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores. ANOVA showed that participants aged from 30 to 39 (F = 2.8, ,P = 0.014), with higher educational levels (F = 4.0, <U+0F0C>P = 0.007) scored higher on GAD-, <U+0F0C>and patients with better sleep(F = 158.8, <U+0F0C>P &lt; 0.001;F = 284.0, <U+0F0C>P &lt; 0.001), having a simple knowledge of COVID-19 (F = 93.19, P&lt;0.001;F = 95.30, P&lt;0.001) had lower GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores. Bivariate regression analysis indicated that participants aged 30â€“39 and 40â€“49 positively predicted anxiety, whereas only patients aged 30â€“39 years were positively predictive of depression. Participants with poor sleep, other long-standing diseases, knowing the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to experience anxiety and depression. Conclusion Patients aged from 30 to 39, with poor sleep, other accompanying long-standing diseases, knowing the COVID-19 pandemic were potential factors of depression and anxiety.

This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. The search was run in MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL from the Cochrane databases. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022302025). Our aim was to assess the present evidence for therapeutic role of fluvoxamine in COVID-19 patients, the review included studies which evaluate the effect of fluvoxamine in COVID-19 patients. The main outcomes evaluated in the review were: mortality, need for hospitalization (outpatients) and clinical deterioration. The quality control of the selected articles was made using Cochraneâ€™s Risk of Bias tool for the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the ROBINS-I criteria for non-randomized studies. A total of 4 studies were included in the final qualitative analysis of the review, 2 of which were RCTs, and the others were open-label prospective cohorts. 3 studies assessed outpatient population and 1 evaluated ICU population. Overall, the 4 studies included a total of 1864 participants. In conclusion, 3 studies with outpatients showed that fluvoxamine treatment can prevent clinical deterioration, hospitalisation, or proxy-hospitalisation. The only study with patients hospitalized in the ICU also demonstrated a therapeutic benefit reducing overall mortality.","Cardoso, Francisco, Moreira, Ricardo, Rocha, LuÃ­s, Coelho, Maria","https://doi.org/10.22541/au.164873588.87022449/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29739,""
"The pandemic within the pandemic: the surge of neuropsychological disorders in Italian children during the COVID-19 era (preprint)","Background:  Quarantine and isolation measures during COVID-19 pandemic may have caused additional stress and challenged mental health of the youth. Aim of the study is to investigate the COVID-19 pandemic impact on neuropsychological disorders (NPD) of Italian children and adolescents to provide general pediatric recommendations.Material and methodsA retrospective multicenter observational study was planned by the Italian Pediatric Society (SIP) to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the access of children to pediatric Emergency Departments (pED) for the evaluation of neuropsychological symptoms, collecting the classification codes of diagnoses between March 1, 2019 and March 2, 2021. The period study was split into two sub-periods: a pre COVID-19 period (from March 1 2019 to March 1, 2020) and a COVID-19 period (from March 2, 2020 to March 2, 2021). As additional information, data on NPD hospitalizations in any pediatric department of the involved centers were recorded.ResultsDuring the study period, a total of 533,318 children were admitted to the pED involved in the study. Despite a 48.2% decline of pED admissions, there was a significant increase (83.1%) in patient admissions for NPD. The most frequent NPD conditions which increased during the COVID-19 pandemic were suicidal ideation (+ 147%), depression (+ 115%), eating disorder (+ 78.4%), and psychosis (+ 17.2%). During the pandemic period, a 39.5% increase in NPD hospitalizations was observed as well. The NPD disorders that mostly required hospitalizations were suicidal ideation (+ 134%), depression (+ 41.4%), eating disorder (+ 31.4%), and drug abuse (+ 26.7%).DiscussionThe COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on children's health, mainly on their NPD development. Neuropsychological assessment should be required at the primary level, in the pediatrician's office, to facilitate early capture of the sign of impairment and provide an adequate treatment.Conclusion. SIP underlines the psychological consequences of COVID 19 pandemic on the youngest and recommend an early identification of NPD in the pediatric population to avoid other serious consequences for children's physical and mental health.","Bozzola, Elena, Ferrara, Pietro, Spina, Giulia, Villani, Alberto, Roversi, Marco, Raponi, Massimiliano, Corsello, Giovanni, Staiano, Annamaria","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1465091/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29740,""

"A Systematic Review of the International Evolution of Online Mental Health Strategies and Recommendations During the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Introduction:  The global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which started at the beginning of 2020, has had a negative impact on mental health (MH). As a response to the pandemic, international agencies and governmental institutions providedan initial response to the populationâ€™s needs. As the pandemic evolved, the population circumstances changed, and some of these international agencies, such as the UN or WHO, updated their strategies, recommendations, and guidelines for the populations. However, there is currently a lack of information on the attention given to response strategies by the different countries throughout the beginning of the pandemic. Objectives:  To evaluate the evolution of MH online strategies and recommendations developed by governments and related institutions to cope with the impact ofCOVID-19 on MH from the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic to the vaccination period and to assess their current status. Method:  ology: An adaptation of the PRISMA guidelines to review online documents was used together with a questionnaire for MH strategies and recommendation assessment. Basic statistics and Studentâ€™s t test were used to assess the evolution of the documents, while a two-step cluster analysis was performed to assess the organisation and characteristics of the most recent documents. Results:  Statistically significant differences were found both in the number of symptoms and mental disorders and MH strategies and recommendations included in the initial documents and the updated versions generated after vaccines became available. The most recent versionsare more complete in all cases. Regarding the forty-six total documents included in the review, the cluster analysis showed a broaddistribution from wide-spectrum documents to documentsfocusing on a specific topic. Conclusions: : Governments and institutions have worked actively but unevenly on updating the MH guidelines, paying attention to actions related to bereavement, telehealth and domestic violence. Significant improvements have been made regarding Mexicoâ€™s guideline and the availability of comprehensive resources from England, Australia and the United States of America. The study supports the use of the PRISMA protocol adaptation and questionnaire for MH strategy and recommendation assessments as a standard by which to conduct longitudinal assessments of dynamic documents.","Almeda, Nerea, DÃ­az-MilanÃ©s, Diego, Guiterrez-Colosia, Mencia, GarcÃ­a-Alonso, Carlos","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1435926/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29742,""
"Status of Post-Lockdown Mental Well-Being in Bangladeshi Adults: A Comprehensive Survey Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint); Bangladesh | COVID-19 | general population | lockdown | mental well-being | pandemic","It is evident that COVID-19 related lockdown has deleterious impacts on mental well-being of the general population;however, very little is known about the mental well-being when the lockdown has been relaxed or withdrawn. Our study aimed to measure the mental well-being of the general population when the lockdown was lifted in Bangladesh. A comprehensive cross-sectional survey was conducted from December 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021. Data from 3035 general Bangladeshi aged 18 and above were analyzed. Mental well-being was measured using Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. A multivariable linear regression model was employed to find the influential variables after controlling the confounders. The mean well-being score was 43.66. Well-being score was significantly lower among women (slope -2.171, p= &lt;0.001), low-educated (slope -2.485, p= 0.018), and currently not working (slope -2.263, p= &lt;0.001) population. However, we found significantly higher mental well-being scores among those with no comorbidity (slope 3.436, p= &lt;0.001). Though the withdrawal of lockdown improved the overall mental well-being, women, low-educated, not working, and the comorbid population was still suffering from low mental well-being problems. Special attention is recommended to address the vulnerable population when discussing the mental health of adult Bangladeshi during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ali, Mohammad","https://www.google.com/search?q=Status+of+Post-Lockdown+Mental+Well-Being+in+Bangladeshi+Adults:+A+Comprehensive+Survey+Amidst+COVID-19+Pandemic+(preprint);+Bangladesh+|+COVID-19+|+general+population+|+lockdown+|+mental+well-being+|+pandemic","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29743,""

This article comprehensively reviews the current knowledge on the impact of COVID-19 over pregnant women and neonates, as well as current recommendations for their management. We also analyse previous evidences from viral respiratory diseases such as SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and influenza that may help to guide clinical practice during the current pandemic. We collected 23 case reports, case series, and case-control studies (18 from China) comprising 174 pregnant women with COVID-19. The majority of mothers showed a clinical presentation of the disease similar to that of non-infected adults. Preliminary evidences point towards a potentially increased risk of pregnancy adverse outcomes in women with COVID-19, with preterm delivery the most frequently observed (16.7%) followed by fetal distress (9.77%). The most commonly reported adverse neonatal outcomes included respiratory symptoms (7.95%) and low birth weight (6.81%). A few studies reported other maternal comorbidities that can influence these outcomes. Mothers with other comorbidities may be at higher risk of infection. Mother-tochild transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appears unlikely, with no study observing intrauterine transmission, and a few cases of neonatal infection reported a few hours after birth. Although the WHO and other health authorities have published interim recommendations for care and management of pregnant women and infants during COVID-19 pandemic, many questions remain open. Pregnant women should be considered in prevention and control efforts, including the development of drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Further research is needed to confirm the exact impact of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. To fully quantify this impact, we urgently need to integrate the current knowledge about viral characteristics, epidemiology, disease immunopathology, and potential therapeutic strategies with data from the clinical practice.","Bouaziz, J.; Even, M.; Isnard-Bogillot, F.; Vesale, E.; Nikpayam, M.; Mihalache, A.; Krief, D.; Frydman, R.; Ayoubi, J.

"The COVID-19 pandemic impact on wellbeing and mental health in people with psychotic and bipolar disorders","The COVID-19 pandemic affects people globally, but it may affect people with psychotic and bipolar disorders disproportionally. Our aims were to investigate the pandemic impact on perceived wellbeing and mental health in this population, including which pandemic-related factors have had an impact. People with psychotic and bipolar disorders (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 520; femaleÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 81%; psychotic disorders nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 75/bipolar disorder nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 445) completed an online survey about wellbeing and mental health in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (June 5-July 5, 2020). Many participants experienced deteriorated wellbeing and mental health after the pandemic outbreak, especially in life satisfaction, meaning in life, positive feelings, depression, anxiety, and self-harm/suicidal ideation. Experienced recovery from mental health difficulties was significantly lower after compared to before the outbreak. Participants with psychotic disorders had significantly poorer wellbeing and mental health than participants with bipolar disorders, although they experienced significantly more worsening only of psychotic symptoms. Nearly half the participants reported coping with the situation; however, most factors potentially important to wellbeing and mental health changed adversely, including sufficiency and quality of treatment. More loneliness, low coping, insufficient mental health treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, pandemic worry, more insomnia symptoms, and increased alcohol use predicted poor wellbeing and poor mental health. During a pandemic, it is particularly important that mental health services strive to offer the best possible treatment under the current conditions and target loneliness, coping strategies, pandemic worry, insomnia, and increased alcohol use to uphold wellbeing and reduce mental health difficulties. For some, teletherapy is an agreeable substitute for traditional therapy.","Barrett, Simonsen, Aminoff, Hegelstad, Lagerberg, Melle, Mork, Romm","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2559","20220406","COVID-19; bipolar disorder; mental health; psychotic disorders; schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29746,""
"COVID-19 patients require multi-disciplinary rehabilitation approaches to address persisting symptom profiles and restore pre-COVID quality of life","Long-COVID diagnosis is prominent, and our attention must support those experiencing debilitating and long-standing symptoms. To establish patient pathways, we must consider the societal and economic impacts of sustained COVID-19. Accordingly, we sought to determine the pertinent areas impacting quality of life (QoL) following a COVID-19 infection. Three hundred and eighty-one participants completed a web-based survey (83% female, 17% male) consisting of 70 questions across 7 sections (demographics, COVID-19 symptoms; QoL; sleep quality; breathlessness; physical activity and mental health). Mean age, height, body mass and body mass index (BMI) were 42 Ã‚Â± 12 years, 167.6 Ã‚Â± 10.4 cm, 81.2 Ã‚Â± 22.2 kg, and 29.1 Ã‚Â± 8.4 kg.m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Participant health was reduced because of COVID-19 symptoms (""<i>Good health</i>"" to ""<i>Poor health</i>"" [<i>P</i>&lt;0.001]). Survey respondents who work reported ongoing issues with performing moderate (83%) and vigorous (79%) work-related activities. COVID-19 patients report reduced capacity to participate in activities associated with daily life, including employment activities. Bespoke COVID-19 support pathways must consider multi-disciplinary approaches that address the holistic needs of patients to restore pre-pandemic quality of life and address experienced health and wellbeing challenges. The long-term impact of long-COVID has a dramatic impact upon daily activities and lifestyle. The development of bespoke support pathways to support patients must address the physical and psychological considerations to adequately restore pre-COVID quality of life and address broader societal and economic implications, especially for those that are of working age.","Faghy, Maden-Wilkinson, Arena, Copeland, Owen, Hodgkins, Willmott","https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2022.2063843","20220406","COVID-19; Infections; Long term conditions; Long-COVID; Recovery; Rehabilitation; Respiratory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29747,""

Associations among asthma control, tobacco use, and mental health were also examined. 105 African American and Latinx college students with asthma (18-23 years) completed two online questionnaires (June 2019-March 2020 for Time 1; August 2020-October 2020 for Time 2). Participants completed the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (measure of COVID-19 impact), Asthma Control Test, Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, Patient Health Questionnaire (measure of depression), Perceived Stress Scale, and items related to tobacco use. Asthma control improved (<i>t =</i> -3.326, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) from Time 1 to 2, and e-vapor product use decreased (<i>ÃªÂ­â€œ</i><sup>2</sup><sub>104</sub> = 6.572, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.010).

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Portuguese university students","Worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a disruptive effect on daily routines, especially for university students. This study aimed to compare pre-pandemic domains of students' mental health during the pandemic lockdown. One cross-sectional study was conducted in two waves with academic students from 20 Portuguese universities, in March 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3579) and 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after the first lockdown in May 2020 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1228). The Positive Mental Health Questionnaire (PMHQ), the Mental Health Knowledge Questionnaire, the Mental Health-promoting knowledge, and the Psychological Vulnerability Scale were used. Statistical analyses were performed by bivariate associations and multiple linear regression models. Students were mostly women (79%), with an average age of 23.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.6), displaced from their family environment (43%), out-of-home (43%), and scholarship holders (37%). Higher scores found in the PVS were associated with decreased PMHQ in both moments (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). These cross-sectional studies showed a slight variation in the mental health variables studied in the period before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Being a woman, younger, out-of-home, and having a scholarship (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) seem to increase susceptibility to mental health variation before and during the pandemic. Universities should develop strategies that promote students' mental health.","Sequeira, AraÃƒÂºjo, LourenÃƒÂ§o, Freitas, Carvalho, Costa","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12999","20220406","COVID-19; literacy; positive mental health; university students; vulnerability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29749,""
"Psychological distress and well-being among students of health disciplines in Geneva, Switzerland: The importance of academic satisfaction in the context of academic year-end and COVID-19 stress on their learning experience","University students' psychological health is linked to their academic satisfaction. This study aimed to investigate students' psychological health and academic satisfaction in the context of COVID-19 and academic year-end stress. Standardized self-filled scales for anxiety, depression, stress, psychological well-being, academic satisfaction (subjective assessment of students' quality of life in their educational setting), and an ad-hoc scale for stress on the learning experience due to COVID-19 were used in this cross-sectional study. Participants were first- to third-year students of eight different health-related tracks in Geneva, Switzerland. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression analyses were applied. In June 2020, out of 2835 invited students, 433 (15%) completed the survey. Academic satisfaction was a stronger mental health predictor than COVID-19 stress on the learning experience, which mainly predicted stress and anxiety. Lower academic satisfaction scores were significantly associated with stress (ÃŽÂ² = -0.53, p &lt; 0.001), depression (ÃŽÂ² = -0.26, p &lt; 0.001), anxiety (ÃŽÂ² = -0.20, p &lt; 0.001), while higher scores with psychological well-being (ÃŽÂ² = 0.48, p &lt; 0.001). Identifying as female was strongly associated with anxiety and stress but not with depression or psychological well-being. Lower age was associated with stress only. The nature of the academic training had a lesser impact on mental health and the academic year had no impact. Academic satisfaction plays a more substantial role than COVID-19 stress on the learning experience in predicting students' overall mental health status. Training institutions should address the underlying factors that can enhance students' academic satisfaction, especially during the COVID-19 period, in addition to ensuring that they have a continuous and adequate learning experience, as well as access to psychosocial services that help them cope with mental distress and enhance their psychological well-being.","Tran, Franzen, Jermann, Rudaz, Bondolfi, Ghisletta","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266612","20220406","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29750,""
"The association between intolerance of uncertainty and Internet addiction during the second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: A multiple mediation model considering depression and risk perception","Repeated outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have forced people to shift most of their work and life activities from offline to online, leading to a growing problem of Internet dependence and even Internet addiction. However, the mechanism of the association between COVID-19-related intolerance of uncertainty (COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°IU) and Internet addiction during the second wave of COVID-19 is still unclear. The current study explored the association between COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°IU and Internet addiction as mediated by depression and risk perception based on the Uncertainty-Depression-Perception-Addiction model (UDPA). A total of 1,137 adult participants were recruited, and COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°IU, depression, risk perception, Internet addiction, and demographic variables were analyzed. The results showed that COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°IU was significantly and positively associated with Internet addiction and that this relationship was mediated in parallel by depression and risk perception. Our findings further extend the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution (I-PACE) model from the perspective of applicability in the unique context of COVID-19. Furthermore, the study suggests that individuals could decrease their dependence on the Internet to prevent Internet addiction during the second wave of the pandemic through effective interventions that include lowering COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°IU, improving emotion regulation, and developing reasonable perceptions of risk.","Luo, Li, Meng, Zheng, Hu, Zhang, Dai, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1002/pchj.545","20220406","Internet addiction; depression; intolerance of uncertainty; risk perception; the second wave of coronavirus disease 2019","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29751,""
"Mental Health Service Use, Suicide Behavior, and Emergency Department Visits Among Rural US Veterans Who Received Video-Enabled Tablets During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Suicide rates are rising disproportionately in rural counties, a concerning pattern as the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified suicide risk factors in these regions and exacerbated barriers to mental health care access. Although telehealth has the potential to improve access to mental health care, telehealth's effectiveness for suicide-related outcomes remains relatively unknown. To evaluate the association between the escalated distribution of the US Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA's) video-enabled tablets during the COVID-19 pandemic and rural veterans' mental health service use and suicide-related outcomes. This retrospective cohort study included rural veterans who had at least 1 VA mental health care visit in calendar year 2019 and a subcohort of patients identified by the VA as high-risk for suicide. Event studies and difference-in-differences estimation were used to compare monthly mental health service utilization for patients who received VA tablets during COVID-19 with patients who were not issued tablets over 10 months before and after tablet shipment. Statistical analysis was performed from November 2021 to February 2022. Receipt of a video-enabled tablet. Mental health service utilization outcomes included psychotherapy visits, medication management visits, and comprehensive suicide risk evaluations (CSREs) via video and total visits across all modalities (phone, video, and in-person). We also analyzed likelihood of emergency department (ED) visit, likelihood of suicide-related ED visit, and number of VA's suicide behavior and overdose reports (SBORs). The study cohort included 13Ã¢â‚¬Â¯180 rural tablet recipients (11Ã¢â‚¬Â¯617 [88%] men; 2161 [16%] Black; 301 [2%] Hispanic; 10Ã¢â‚¬Â¯644 [80%] White; mean [SD] age, 61.2 [13.4] years) and 458Ã¢â‚¬Â¯611 nonrecipients (406Ã¢â‚¬Â¯545 [89%] men; 59Ã¢â‚¬Â¯875 [13%] Black or African American; 16Ã¢â‚¬Â¯778 [4%] Hispanic; 384Ã¢â‚¬Â¯630 [83%] White; mean [SD] age, 58.0 [15.8] years). Tablets were associated with increases of 1.8 psychotherapy visits per year (monthly coefficient, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.13-0.17), 3.5 video psychotherapy visits per year (monthly coefficient, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.27-0.31), 0.7 video medication management visits per year (monthly coefficient, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.055-0.062), and 0.02 video CSREs per year (monthly coefficient, 0.002; 95% CI, 0.002-0.002). Tablets were associated with an overall 20% reduction in the likelihood of an ED visit (proportion change, -0.012; 95% CI, -0.014 to -0.010), a 36% reduction in the likelihood of suicide-related ED visit (proportion change, -0.0017; 95% CI, -0.0023 to -0.0013), and a 22% reduction in the likelihood of suicide behavior as indicated by SBORs (monthly coefficient, -0.0011; 95% CI, -0.0016 to -0.0005). These associations persisted for the subcohort of rural veterans the VA identifies as high-risk for suicide. This cohort study of rural US veterans with a history of mental health care use found that receipt of a video-enabled tablet was associated with increased use of mental health care via video, increased psychotherapy visits (across all modalities), and reduced suicide behavior and ED visits. These findings suggest that the VA and other health systems should consider leveraging video-enabled tablets for improving access to mental health care via telehealth and for preventing suicides among rural residents.","Gujral, Van Campen, Jacobs, Kimerling, Blonigen, Zulman","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.6250","20220406","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29752,""

"Innovative Management of Nursing Student COVID-19 Cases and High-Risk Exposures","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created significant disruption in higher education, especially in health science colleges where in-person and hands-on patient-facing learning environments are essential. Student monitoring and follow-up was an essential aspect of in-person learning for the fall 2020 semester. Senior leaders and faculty in a college of nursing developed and implemented an innovative college-based COVID-19 management system to ensure real-time response to prolonged pandemic-related student absences. Decisions made from this management system allowed leaders within the college to implement programmatic changes to ensure student and faculty well-being. Furthermore, the COVID-19 management system allowed for close student follow-up through phone calls with a faculty member to ensure student well-being. Monitoring helped ensure appropriate physical and mental health services were accessible to students undergoing quarantine or self-isolation while also fostering positive student satisfaction throughout their prolonged absences. <b>[<i>J Nurs Educ</i>. 2022;61(4):217-220.]</b>.","Gedney-Lose, Daack-Hirsch, Nicholson","https://doi.org/10.3928/01484834-20220209-07","20220406","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29754,""

"Challenges faced by healthcare workers at a central hospital in Zimbabwe after contracting COVID-19: An interpretive phenomenological analysis study","Ã‚Â Healthcare workers play a critical role in the delivery of healthcare services. Because of the high risk of exposure to healthcare workers, the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a significant impact as they struggled to contain the pandemic. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the challenges they faced after contracting COVID-19. Ã‚Â An interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) design was employed to gain insight into the lived experiences of healthcare workers who contracted COVID-19 in the course of their duties. This study involved participants who were healthcare workers based at a central hospital in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Data were collected through in-depth interviews that were audio recorded. A sample size of ten was reached based on data saturation. Ã‚Â The study showed that healthcare workers lacked psychosocial support, experienced economic challenges as they incurred diagnostic and treatment costs. The study also found that the healthcare workers experienced stigma and discrimination both at work and in the community. Findings also indicate that healthcare workers did not receive institutional support. The study demonstrated lack of preparedness at the institution evidenced by inadequate testing for COVID-19 and shortage of personal protective equipment. Ã‚Â This study's findings will be critical for health authorities, programmers and policymakers to facilitate planning and preparedness for pandemics. The researchers recommend setting up a differentiated service delivery support system for healthcare workers to cater for their mental health and well-being and that of their families.","Moyo, Ndou-Mammbona, Mavhandu-Mudzusi","https://doi.org/10.4102/safp.v64i1.5428","20220406","COVID-19; IPA; healthcare workers; phenomenology; psychosocial challenges; support system","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29756,""
"The impact of a gratitude intervention on mental well-being during COVID-19: A quasi-experimental study of university students","Previous research suggest that gratitude interventions are effective in improving mental well-being, which might be beneficial to university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. This quasi-experimental study sought to investigate if a gratitude intervention will lead to higher mental well-being of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°47) mental well-being was assessed before and after 10 weekly gratitude reflection journals and statistically compared with a control group (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°40).

"Depression and anxiety among nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Tohoku region, Japan: A cross-sectional survey","Restrictions such as physical distancing and online learning for college students were implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Owing to this, students may experience psychological distress from social isolation and loneliness. Nursing students are subjected to an exacerbated level of distress during the pandemic due to their role as health professionals. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the level of anxiety and depression among Japanese nursing students, according to their perceived vulnerability to COVID-19. A total of 281 college students (104 nursing students and 177 other college students) responded to a web-based anonymous questionnaire survey from 18 August to 31 October 2020. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to evaluate anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D). Perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 was assessed using the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale. In both groups of students, the prevalence of both anxiety (30.5% in nursing students; 69.5% in others) and depressive symptoms (31.1% in nursing students; 68.9% in others) were remarkably high. There were no significant differences in anxiety and depression between nursing and other students after adjusting for perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 plus socio-demographic characteristics and stress coping styles. Perceived vulnerability and its interactions with nursing did not show a significant association with either depression or anxiety. This study highlights the need for greater support and preventive strategies for mental health problems for college students during the COVID-19 pandemic regardless of perceived vulnerability.","Sakai, Nakanishi, Yu, Takagi, Toshi, Wakashima, Yoshii","https://doi.org/10.1111/jjns.12483","20220406","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; epidemiology; nursing students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29758,""
"The prevalence and influencing factors for compassion fatigue among nurses in Fangcang shelter hospitals: A cross-sectional study","We aim to investigate the prevalence and associated factors for compassion fatigue among nurses in Fangcang Shelter Hospitals in Wuhan. Studies have shown that compassion fatigue was more common among nurses than other health-care providers, and its predictors were also different. In recent years, most studies have investigated compassion fatigue in emergency and oncology nurses, whereas there is little information on compassion fatigue among nurses from the frontline of Fangcang Shelter Hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive, cross-sectional design was used in this study. An online survey was conducted among nurses (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°972) of five Fangcang Shelter Hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, from 6 March to 10 March 2020. A self-administered questionnaire including demographic information, work-related information, General Health Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale and Compassion Fatigue Scale was used. The prevalence of compassion fatigue among nurses in Fangcang Shelter Hospitals was moderate, and most cases were mild. There was a significant relationship between compassion fatigue and work-related factors, mental health and perceived stress among nurses working in Fangcang Shelter Hospitals. Various factors contribute to compassion fatigue, including lower job satisfaction and job adaptability, less praise from patients, more fear of infection and more perceived stress. A good working atmosphere, organizational support and psychological consultation are essential to alleviate nurses' compassion fatigue during the anti-epidemic period.","Zhan, Liu, Chen, Liu, Zhang, Yan, Yu, Li","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijn.13054","20220406","COVID-19; Fangcang shelter hospital; compassion fatigue; cross-sectional studies; mental health; nurses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29759,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating disorders: A systematic review","A growing body of evidence suggests that individuals with eating disorders (EDs) have experienced deteriorating symptoms, increased isolation, and an increase in hospital admissions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, no systematic reviews have been conducted examining the COVID-19 and ED peer-reviewed literature. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to synthesize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with EDs. Database searches of the peer-reviewed literature were completed in the subsequent databases: CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO (from November 2019 to October 20, 2021). All research reporting on the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with EDs were included. Fifty-three studies met the inclusion criteria, including 36,485 individuals with EDs. The pooled hospital admissions across the studies demonstrated on average a 48% (preÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 591, postÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 876, nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°10 studies) increase in admissions during the pandemic compared to previous pre-pandemic timepoints. In this review, 36% of studies (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°19) documented increases in eating disorder symptoms during the pandemic, this increase in eating disorder symptoms were documented in AN, BED, BN, and OFSED patients. Studies also demonstrated increases in anxiety (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°9) and depression (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°8), however patterns of change appeared to be diagnostic and timing specific (e.g., lockdowns). We found a large increase in the number of hospitalizations and an increase in ED symptoms, anxiety, depression, and changes to BMI in ED patients during the pandemic. However, these changes appeared to be diagnostic and timing specific. Many qualitative studies described deterioration in ED symptomatology due to decreased access to care and treatment, changes to routine and loss of structure, negative influence of the media, and social isolation. Future studies are needed to focus on pediatric populations, new ED diagnoses, and severity of illness at presentation. The scientific literature suggests that individuals with eating disorders have experienced deteriorating symptoms, increased isolation, and an increase in hospital admissions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study synthesized 53 articles and explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with eating disorders. We found increases in eating disorder symptoms during the pandemic; this increase in eating disorder symptoms was documented in patients with common eating disorders including anorexia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and other specified feeding and eating disorders. This review also demonstrated changes in body mass index (an index used to classify underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults) and increases in anxiety and depression during the pandemic compared to previous timepoints; patterns of change appeared to be related to timing of lockdowns. This review provides important information on the impact of COVID-19 on the physical and mental health of individuals with eating disorders. Un creciente conjunto de evidencia sugiere que las personas con trastornos de la conducta alimentaria (TCA) han experimentado sÃƒÂ­ntomas de deterioro, mayor aislamiento y un aumento en los ingresos hospitalarios como resultado de la pandemia de COVID-19. A pesar de esto, no se han realizado revisiones sistemÃƒÂ¡ticas que examinen la literatura revisada por pares de COVID-19 y TCA. Por lo tanto, esta revisiÃƒÂ³n sistemÃƒÂ¡tica tuvo como objetivo sintetizar el impacto de la pandemia de COVID-19 en las personas con TCA.

En esta revisiÃƒÂ³n, el 36% de los estudios (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 19) documentaron aumentos en los sÃƒÂ­ntomas del trastorno alimentario durante la pandemia, este aumento en los sÃƒÂ­ntomas del trastorno de la conducta alimentaria se documentÃƒÂ³ en pacientes con AN, TpA, BN y OSFED. Los estudios tambiÃƒÂ©n demostraron aumentos en la ansiedad (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 9) y la depresiÃƒÂ³n (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8), sin embargo, los patrones de cambio parecÃƒÂ­an ser diagnÃƒÂ³sticos y especÃƒÂ­ficos del momento (por ejemplo, encierros). DISCUSIÃƒâ€œN: Encontramos un gran aumento en el nÃƒÂºmero de hospitalizaciones y un aumento en los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de TCA, ansiedad, depresiÃƒÂ³n y los cambios en el IMC en pacientes con TCA durante la pandemia. Sin embargo, estos cambios parecÃƒÂ­an ser diagnÃƒÂ³sticos y especÃƒÂ­ficos del momento.

"A Mixed Method Study of Teachers' Appraisals of Student Wellness Services and Supports During COVID-19","Understanding teachers' appraisals of student wellness services and supports during COVID-19 is essential to strengthening services and improving student health outcomes. This mixed-method study aimed to examine US PK-12 teachers' appraisals of student wellness services and supports during COVID-19. This study focuses on qualitative data from 291 teachers' open-ended responses to the question: ""What do you wish your school leaders knew about this (wellness support) aspect of your work?"" and whose responses described wellness services and supports. A qualitative content analysis was conducted by an interdisciplinary research team using open- and axial coding. Three main themes emerged. (1) insufficient access to mental health professionals and programming at schools, (2) concern about the quality of available services, and (3) a need for teacher professional development and support on student wellness. Statistically significant differences in teacher appraisals of insufficient access to mental health professionals and programming were found based on grade level taught and percentage of immigrant students in the school. With amplified student wellness needs, school personnel, including school leaders, must consider ways to allocate additional resources/staffing, assess the quality of services and supports, and design professional development opportunities to support teachers' involvement in supporting student wellness needs.","Childs, Brown, Brown, Iachini, Phillippo, Galib, Parker, Fujimoto","https://doi.org/10.1111/josh.13186","20220406","COVID-19; access; quality; student wellness; teacher","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29761,""

"Should new operating procedures arising from COVID-19 make us re-think our management of deep caries?","COVID-19 has impacted heavily on the delivery of dental services within the UK, particularly in regards to aerosol generating procedures (AGPs). However, it has created an opportunity to reflect on how operative dental procedures, such as the management of dental caries, are undertaken. In light of recent evidence in favour of speed increasing contra-angle handpieces in combination with an electric micromotor to eliminate the generation of aerosols at certain speeds while still allowing the cutting of hard tooth tissue, albeit at a slower rate than the traditional air-turbine, this article explores the evidence for partial caries removal using the electric micromotor system. Aspects of maintaing the health of the pulpal tissue using this system and adopting a logical approach to placing adhesive direct resin composites to faciliate an optimum outcome for the patient are also explored.","Melo, Blum, Foxton","https://doi.org/10.1177/20501684221085872","20220406","COVID-19; dental caries; minimally interventive dentistry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29763,""
"Have News Reports on Suicide and Attempted Suicide During the COVID-19 Pandemic Adhered to Guidance on Safer Reporting?","<b/> <i>Background:</i> Associations between sensational news coverage of suicide and increases in suicidal behavior have been well documented. Amid growing concern over the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates, it is especially important that news coverage adheres to recommended standards. <i>Method:</i> We analyzed the quality and content of print and online UK news reports of possible COVID-19-related suicides and suicide attempts in the first 4 months of the pandemic (<i>N</i> = 285). <i>Results:</i> The majority of reports made explicit links between suicidal behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic in the headline (65.5%), largely based on statements by family, friends, or acquaintances of the deceased (60%). The impact of the pandemic on suicidal behavior was most often attributed to feelings of isolation (27.4%), poor mental health (14.7%), and entrapment due to government-imposed restrictions (14.4%). Although rarely of poor overall quality, reporting was biased toward young people, frontline staff, and relatively unusual suicides and, to varying degrees, failed to meet recommended standards (e.g., 41.1% did not signpost readers to sources of support). <i>Limitations:</i> This analysis cannot account for the impact of reporting on suicide. <i>Conclusion:</i> Careful attention must be paid to the quality and content of reports, especially as longer-term consequences of the pandemic develop.","Marzano, Hawley, Fraser, Harris-Skillman, Lainez, Hawton","https://doi.org/10.1027/0227-5910/a000856","20220406","COVID-19; media; media guidelines; newspaper; reporting; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29764,""
"Gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of COVID-19: Disorders of gut-brain interaction are an outcome","Many of the studies on COVID-19Ã‚Â severity and its associated symptoms focus on hospitalized patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between acute GI symptoms and COVID-19Ã‚Â severity in a clustering-based approach and to determine the risks and epidemiological features of post-COVID-19 Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction (DGBI) by including both hospitalized and ambulatory patients. The study utilized a two-phase Internet-based survey on: (1) COVID-19 patients' demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, complications, and hospitalizations and (2) post-COVID-19 DGBI diagnosed according to Rome IV criteria in association with anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9). Statistical analyses included univariate and multivariate tests. Five distinct clusters of symptomatic subjects were identified based on the presence of GI symptoms, loss of smell, and chest pain, among 1114 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. GI symptoms were found to be independent risk factors for severe COVID-19; however, they did not always coincide with other severity-related factors such as age &gt;65Ã‚Â years, diabetes mellitus, and Vitamin D deficiency. Of the 164Ã‚Â subjects with a positive test who participated in Phase-2, 108 (66%) fulfilled the criteria for at least one DGBI. The majority (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 81; 75%) were new-onset DGBI post-COVID-19. Overall, 86% of subjects with one or more post-COVID-19 DGBI had at least one GI symptom during the acute phase of COVID-19, while 14% did not. Depression (65%), but not anxiety (48%), was significantly more common in those with post-COVID-19 DGBI. GI symptoms are associated with a severe COVID-19 among survivors. Long-haulers may develop post-COVID-19 DGBI.

"Facial recognition law in China","Although the prevalence of facial recognition-based COVID-19 surveillance tools and techniques, China does not have a facial recognition law to protect its residents' facial data. Oftentimes, neither the public nor the government knows where people's facial images are stored, how they have been used, who might use or misuse them, and to what extent. This reality is alarming, particularly factoring in the wide range of unintended consequences already caused by good-intentioned measures and mandates amid the pandemic. Biometric data are matters of personal rights and national security. In light of worrisome technologies such as deep-fake pornography, the protection of biometric data is also central to the protection of the dignity of the citizens and the government, if not the industry as well.

"Perspectives on factors influencing transmission of COVID-19 in Zambia: a qualitative study of health workers and community members","To explore the health professionals' and community members' perspectives on the factors influencing transmission of the novel COVID-19 in Zambia. An exploratory qualitative study using in-depth interviews as data collection technique. Four primary healthcare facilities and local communities of Lusaka city and Chirundu international border town under Lusaka province, Zambia. Purposive sampling of 60 study participants comprising health professionals (n=15) and community members (n=45). Health staff were health inspectors and surveillance officers. Community members included public market traders, civic and religious leaders, immigration officers, bus and international truck drivers. Both health professionals and community members were aware of the COVID-19 pandemic, the preventive and control measures. Nevertheless, stark differences were observed on the two groups' perspectives on COVID-19 and the factors influencing its transmission. Most health staff expressed high personal risk and susceptibility to the disease and a positive attitude towards the prevention and control measures. Conversely, myths and misconceptions influenced most community members' perspectives on the disease and their attitude towards the COVID-19 guidelines. Participants were unanimous on the low levels of adherence to the COVID-19 preventive and control measures in the community. Reasons for non-adherence included limited information on COVID-19, negative attitude towards COVID-19 guidelines, social movement and travel patterns, networks and interactions, living and work conditions, water and sanitation facilities, and observation of behaviours of important role models such as politicians and other community leaders. These factors were perceived to increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. These findings highlight important factors influencing transmission of COVID-19 in Zambia. Future interventions should focus on providing information to mitigate myths and misconceptions, increasing people's risk perception to the disease, and improving attitude towards the prevention and control interventions and mitigating structural and socioeconomic barriers.","Sialubanje, Sitali, Mukumbuta, Liyali, Sumbwa, Kamboyi, Ng'andu, Goma","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057589","20220406","COVID-19; INFECTIOUS DISEASES; Public health; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29767,""

"Survival After Severe COVID-19: Long-Term Outcomes of Patients Admitted to an Intensive Care Unit","Understanding the long-term sequelae of severe COVID-19 remains limited, particularly in the United States. To examine long-term outcomes of patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission for severe COVID-19. This is a prospective cohort study of patients who had severe COVID-19 requiring an ICU admission in a two-hospital academic health system in Southern California. Patients discharged alive between 3/21/2020 and 12/31/2020 were surveyed approximately 6 months after discharge to assess health-related quality of life using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMISÃ‚Â®)-29 v2.1, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and loneliness scales. A preference-based health utility score (PROPr) was estimated using 7 PROMIS domain scores. Patients were also asked their attitude about receiving aggressive ICU care. Of 275 patients admitted to the ICU for severe COVID-19, 205 (74.5%) were discharged alive and 132 (64%, median age 59, 46% female) completed surveys a median of 182 days post-discharge. Anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social activities, pain interference, and cognitive function were not significantly different from the U.S. general population, but physical function (44.2, SD 11.0) was worse. PROPr mean score of 0.46 (SD 0.30, range -0.02 to 0.96 [&lt;0 is worse than dead and 1 represents perfect health]) was slightly lower than the U.S. general population, with an even distribution across the continuum. Poor PROPr was associated with chronic medical conditions and receipt of life-sustaining treatments, but not demographics or social vulnerability. PTSD was suspected in 20% and loneliness in 29% of patients. Ninety-eight percent of patients were glad they received life-saving treatment. Most patients who survive severe COVID-19 achieve positive outcomes, with health scores similar to the general population at 6 months post-discharge.

"Real-world performance of Victorian hospitals during the COVID-19 lockdowns","Victoria has low numbers of general adult psychiatric beds per capita by Australian and international standards. Hospital key performance indicators (KPIs) such as bed occupancy rates, emergency department waiting times and inpatient lengths of stay are proximal measures of the effects any shortfall in beds. We investigate the real-world performance of Victorian hospitals during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extended lockdowns in 2020. The Victorian inpatient psychiatric system is characterised by high bed occupancies in many regions, extended stays in emergency departments awaiting a bed, and short inpatient lengths of stay, except for patients with excessively long stays on acute units (over 35Ã‚Â days) who are unable to be admitted to non-acute facilities. At the end of 2020, bed occupancies were high (above 90%) in 10 regions, with three regions having bed occupancies over 100%. However, state-wide average bed occupancy improved between 2019 (94%) and 2020 (88%). Other KPIs remained steady because acute hospitals did not experience the expected pandemic mental health demand-surge.

"Diagnostic value of platelet indices in COVID 19 infection: a case-control study from a single tertiary care center","Platelets are not only involved in hemostasis and coagulation, but play a significant role in innate immunity and inflammatory response. Excess production of cytokines and acute phase reactants affect megakaryopoiesis resulting in the release of immature platelets from the bone marrow altering platelet indices. To study platelet indices in RT-PCR-proven COVID patients and non-COVID patients. A case-control study was conducted on 199 COVID-19 patients and 198 normal individuals. Blood samples were analyzed in an automated hematology analyzer. The platelet indices like platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), platelet large cell count (PLCC), and platelet large cell ratio (P-LCR) were compared among two groups. Platelet count in COVID-19 patients were significantly low (p&lt;0.01) compared to controls, and a significant number of COVID-19 patients had thrombocytopenia. Plateletcrit (PCT) was also significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID individuals. MPV, PDW, and PLCR were significantly (p&lt;0.05) high in COVID-19 patients in comparison to controls, but was not significantly raised in a large number of cases. In contrast, there were no significant differences in platelet large cell count (PLCC) values between COVID-19 cases and non-COVID-19 controls. Platelet indices like platelet count, PCT, MPV, PDW, and P-LCR are significantly altered in COVID-19 infection and thereby can be used as biomarkers in COVID-19.

"Assessment of COVID-19 risk and prevention effectiveness among spectators of mass gathering events","There is a need to evaluate and minimise the risk of novel coronavirus infections at mass gathering events, such as sports. In particular, to consider how to hold mass gathering events, it is important to clarify how the local infection prevalence, the number of spectators, the capacity proportion, and the implementation of preventions affect the infection risk. In this study, we used an environmental exposure model to analyse the relationship between infection risk and infection prevalence, the number of spectators, and the capacity proportion at mass gathering events in football and baseball games. In addition to assessing risk reduction through the implementation of various preventive measures, we assessed how face-mask-wearing proportion affects infection risk. Furthermore, the model was applied to estimate the number of infectors who entered the stadium and the number of newly infected individuals, and to compare them with actual reported cases. The model analysis revealed an 86%-95% reduction in the infection risk due to the implementation of face-mask wearing and hand washing. Under conditions in which vaccine effectiveness was 20% and 80%, the risk reduction rates of infection among vaccinated spectators were 36% and 96%, respectively. Among the individual measures, face-mask wearing was particularly effective, and the infection risk increased as the face-mask-wearing proportion decreased. A linear relationship was observed between infection risk at mass gathering events and the infection prevalence. Furthermore, the number of newly infected individuals was also dependent on the number of spectators and the capacity proportion independent of the infection prevalence, confirming the importance of considering spectator capacity in infection risk management. These results highlight that it is beneficial for organisers to ensure prevention compliance and to mitigate or limit the number of spectators according to the prevalence of local infection. Both the estimated and reported numbers of newly infected individuals after the events were small, below 10 per 3-4 million spectators, despite a small gap between these numbers.","Yasutaka, Murakami, Iwasaki, Naito, Onishi, Fujita, Imoto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mran.2022.100215","20220406","COVID-19; infection risk; mass gatherings; novel corona virus; quantitative microbial risk assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29772,""

"Patterns of Potential Moral Injury in Post-9/11 Combat Veterans and COVID-19 Healthcare Workers","Moral injury has primarily been studied in combat veterans but might also affect healthcare workers (HCWs) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To compare patterns of potential moral injury (PMI) between post-9/11 military combat veterans and healthcare workers (HCWs) surveyed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional surveys of veterans (2015-2019) and HCWs (2020-2021) in the USA. 618 military veterans who were deployed to a combat zone after September 11, 2001, and 2099 HCWs working in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other-induced PMI (disturbed by others' immoral acts) and self-induced PMI (disturbed by having violated own morals) were the primary outcomes. Sociodemographic variables, combat/COVID-19 experience, depression, quality of life, and burnout were measured as correlates. 46.1% of post-9/11 veterans and 50.7% of HCWs endorsed other-induced PMI, whereas 24.1% of post-9/11 veterans and 18.2% of HCWs endorsed self-induced PMI. Different types of PMI were significantly associated with gender, race, enlisted vs. officer status, and post-battle traumatic experiences among veterans and with age, race, working in a high COVID-19-risk setting, and reported COVID-19 exposure among HCWs. Endorsing either type of PMI was associated with significantly higher depressive symptoms and worse quality of life in both samples and higher burnout among HCWs. The potential for moral injury is relatively high among combat veterans and COVID-19 HCWs, with deleterious consequences for mental health and burnout. Demographic characteristics suggestive of less social empowerment may increase risk for moral injury. Longitudinal research among COVID-19 HCWs is needed. Moral injury prevention and intervention efforts for HCWs may benefit from consulting models used with veterans.","Nieuwsma, O'Brien, Xu, Smigelsky, Meador","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-022-07487-4","20220406","COVID-19; burnout; healthcare workers; moral injury; veterans","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29776,""
"Sustaining the Australian respiratory workforce through the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping literature review","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019 and in 2020 presented challenges to healthcare workers (HCW) around the world that were unexpected and dramatic. The relentless progress of infection, starting in China and rapidly spreading to Europe, North America and elsewhere gave more remote countries, like Australia, time to prepare but also time for unease. HCW everywhere had to readjust and change their work practices to cope. Further waves of infection and transmission with newer variants pose challenges to HCW and health systems, even after mass vaccination. Respiratory medicine HCW found themselves at the frontline, developing critical care services to support intensive care units and grappling with unanticipated concerns about safety, risk and the need to retrain. Several studies have addressed the need for rapid changes in the healthcare workforce for COVID-19 and the impact of this preparation on HCW themselves. In this paper, we present a scoping review of the literature on preparing HCW for the pandemic, explore the Australian experience of building the respiratory workforce and propose evidence-based recommendations to sustain this workforce in an unprecedented high-risk environment.","Stone, Irving, Tonga, Thompson","https://doi.org/10.1111/imj.15718","20220406","COVID-19; SARS-CoV2; healthcare worker; mental health; pandemic; preparation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29777,""
"The workplace and psychosocial experiences of Australian junior doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic","Junior doctors experience high levels of psychological distress and emotional exhaustion. The current Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in significant changes to healthcare globally, with quantitative studies demonstrating increased fatigue, depression and burnout in junior doctors. However, there has been limited qualitative research to examine junior doctors' experiences, challenges and beliefs regarding management of future crises. To investigate the workplace and psychosocial experiences of Australian junior doctors working during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Australian healthcare workers were invited to participate in a nationwide, voluntary, anonymous, single time point, online survey between 27 August and 23 October 2020. A qualitative descriptive study of responses to four free-text questions from 621 junior doctors was undertaken, with responses analysed using inductive content analysis. Participants were predominantly female (73.2%), aged 31-40Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (48.0%) and most frequently reported working in medical specialties (48.4%), emergency medicine (21.7%) or intensive care medicine (11.4%). Most (51.9%) participants had 0-5Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of clinical experience since medical graduation. Junior doctors described experiences related to four key themes: a hierarchical, difficult workplace culture; challenging working conditions; disrupted training and career trajectories; and broader psychosocial impacts. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated longstanding, workplace issues and stressors for junior doctors and highlighted the threat that crises pose to medical workforce retention. There is an urgent need for authentic, positive workplace cultural interventions to engage, validate and empower junior doctors. Challenging workplace cultures and conditions, which have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, are associated with poor psychological well-being in junior doctors. There exists a need for long-term, widespread improvements in workplace culture and working conditions to ensure junior doctors' well-being, facilitate workforce retention and enhance the safety and quality of patient care in Australia.","Hunter, Willis, Smallwood","https://doi.org/10.1111/imj.15720","20220406","COVID-19; coronavirus; healthcare worker; junior doctor; mental health; psychosocial","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29778,""
"Inflammasome activation in infected macrophages drives COVID-19 pathology","Severe COVID-19 is characterized by persistent lung inflammation, inflammatory cytokine production, viral RNA, and sustained interferon (IFN) response all of which are recapitulated and required for pathology in the SARS-CoV-2 infected MISTRG6-hACE2 humanized mouse model of COVID-19 with a human immune system <sup>1-20</sup> . Blocking either viral replication with Remdesivir <sup>21-23</sup> or the downstream IFN stimulated cascade with anti-IFNAR2 <i>in vivo</i> in the chronic stages of disease attenuated the overactive immune-inflammatory response, especially inflammatory macrophages. Here, we show SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in lung-resident human macrophages is a critical driver of disease. In response to infection mediated by CD16 and ACE2 receptors, human macrophages activate inflammasomes, release IL-1 and IL-18 and undergo pyroptosis thereby contributing to the hyperinflammatory state of the lungs. Inflammasome activation and its accompanying inflammatory response is necessary for lung inflammation, as inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway reverses chronic lung pathology. Remarkably, this same blockade of inflammasome activation leads to the release of infectious virus by the infected macrophages. Thus, inflammasomes oppose host infection by SARS-CoV-2 by production of inflammatory cytokines and suicide by pyroptosis to prevent a productive viral cycle.","Sefik, Qu, Junqueira, Kaffe, Mirza, Zhao, Brewer, Han, Steach, Israelow, Blackburn, Velazquez, Chen, Halene, Iwasaki, Meffre, Nussenzweig, Lieberman, Wilen, Kluger, Flavell","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.461948","20220406","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29779,""

"An 18-month follow-up of the Covid-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study panel: survey design and fieldwork procedures for Wave 6","Abstract Objectives: The COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study was established in March 2020 to monitor the psychological and socio-economic impact of the pandemic in the UK and other countries. This paper describes the protocol for Wave 6 (August-September 2021). Methods: The survey assessed: COVID-19 related experiences; experiences of common mental health disorders; psychological characteristics; and social and political attitudes. Adults who participated in any previous wave (N=3170) were re-invited to participate, and sample replenishment procedures were conducted to help manage attrition. Weights were calculated using a survey raking algorithm to ensure on-going original panel (commencing at baseline) was nationally representative in terms of gender, age, and household income, amongst other factors. Results: 1643 adults who participated in any previous wave were re-interviewed at Wave 6 (51.8% retention rate). Non-participation at Wave 6 was higher amongst women, younger adults, those in employment, those born outside UK, adults living in cities, and those not living alone. Of the adults recruited into the C19PRC study at baseline, 54.3% (N=1100) participated in Wave 6. An additional 415 new respondents entered the panel at this wave, resulting in cross-sectional sample for Wave 6 of 2058 adults. The raking procedure re-balanced the longitudinal panel to within 1.3% of population estimates for selected socio-demographic characteristics. Conclusion: This paper outlines the growing strength of the publicly available C19PRC Study data for COVID-19-related interdisciplinary research.","Orla McBride et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E002E-A5E-BFF","20220406","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; mental health; survey; uk; psychological; attrition; longitudinal; pandemic; population; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-07","",29781,""
