"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of suicidal behaviors: a retrospective analysis of integrated electronic health records in a 75-million population","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a remarkable psychological overwhelming and increase of stressors that may trigger suicidal behaviors. However, its impact on the rate of suicidal behaviors has been poorly reported. We conducted a population-based retrospective analysis of all suicidal behaviors attended in healthcare centers of Catalonia (North-East Spain; 7.5-million inhabitants), between January 2017 and June 2022. We retrieved data from the episode, including an assessment of suicide risk and the individual's socioeconomic and clinical characteristics. Data were summarized yearly and for the periods before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain in March 2020. The analysis included 26,458 episodes of suicidal behavior (21,920 individuals); of them, 16,414 (62.0%) were a suicide attempt. The monthly moving average ranged between 300 and 400 episodes until July 2020, and progressively increased to over 600 episodes monthly. In the post-pandemic period, suicidal ideation increased at the expense of suicidal attempts. Cases showed a lower suicide risk; the percentage of females and younger individuals increased, whereas the prevalence of classical risk factors, such as living alone or lacking family network and a history of psychiatric diagnosis, decreased. In summary, suicidal behaviors have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with more episodes of suicidal ideations without attempt and younger and lower risk profiles.","DamiÃ  Valero-Bover; Marc Fradera; Gerard Carot-Sans; Isabel Parra; Jordi Piera-JimÃ©nez; Caridad Pontes; Diego Palao-Vidal","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.09.26.22280233","20220926","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-27","",38317,""
"Worries about the COVID-19 pandemic and the dynamic regulation of emotions in the general population: A network analysis study","Background: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health has been widely reported. Yet, little remains known about the psychological mechanisms associated with changes in mental well-being during the currently ongoing pandemic. Methods: Here, we use a network analysis to unravel complex relationships between COVID-19 related stressors and emotional states during the initial phase of the COVID-19 (April 2020). Adults living in the Netherlands and Belgium (N=1145, age 16 and older) (repeatedly) completed an online survey about COVID-19. Results: Partial correlations and contemporaneous networks illustrated that worries about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were primarily associated with distress and mood ratings, which were subsequently associated with other indicators of well-being. Temporal network analysis revealed that COVID-19 worries selectively associated with the reciprocal interplay between high distress and low affect (https://osf.io/vtdkr/). Limitations: Short-term temporal intervals were evaluated. The sample was self-selected. Conclusion: These results may point to one potential mechanisms by which initial worries about the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted psychological well-being.","Stella Voulgaropoulou et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0070-5B8-615","20220927","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-27","",38318,""
