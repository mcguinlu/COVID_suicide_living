"Financial Hardship and Social Assistance as Determinants of Mental Health and Food and Housing Insecurity During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: While social assistance through the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided expanded UI benefits during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic until July 2020, it is unclear whether social assistance was in subsequent months sufficient to meet everyday spending needs and to curb adverse sequelae of financial hardship. Among working-aged Americans with job-related income loss during the pandemic, this study explored the associations of financial hardship with mental health outcomes and food and housing insecurity after accounting for receipt of social assistance. Methods: Using multivariable logistic regression and pooled repeated cross-sectional individual-level data on working-aged adults from nationally-representative surveys administered from September to November 2020, this study investigated the relationships between financial hardship and depressive and anxiety symptoms, food insufficiency, and, among housing renters, the likelihood of being evicted, controlling for the receipt of social assistance and other demographic and socioeconomic factors. Results: Experiencing somewhat of a financial hardship (vs no hardship) was linked to approximately 3-4 times higher odds of depressive or anxiety symptoms and a likely eviction, and a 15 times higher odds of food insufficiency. Experiencing considerable financial hardship (vs no hardship) predicted a 6-fold higher odds of depressive or anxiety symptoms, a 24-fold higher odds of a likely eviction, and a more than 50-fold higher odds of food insufficiency (all P values <.001). Conclusions: Even after accounting for receipt of social assistance, working-aged adults experiencing financial hardship had markedly greater odds of anxiety or depressive symptoms, food insufficiency, and an anticipated housing eviction. Across outcomes, these relationships were stronger at each successively higher level of financial hardship, and more than offset any corresponding benefits from social assistance. Overall, the findings from the present study point to the urgent need for direct and sustained cash relief well in excess of current levels of social assistance, as well as the imperative of extending housing renter eviction protections among Americans.","Daniel Kim","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.20248835","20201226","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-28","",8542,""
"Mental health, personality and lifetime psychedelic use during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences represent a major challenge to the well-being of the general population. Some groups of individuals may be more vulnerable than others, depending on factors such as preexisting conditions, personality, and past life experiences. Building on previous work on the potential long-term benefits of psychedelics, we hypothesized that lifetime use of these drugs could be linked to better mental health indicators in the context of the ongoing pandemic. Methods: Two anonymous online surveys were conducted between April 2020 and June 2020, including questions about lifetime experience with psychedelics and other psychoactive drugs, and psychometric scales designed to measure personality traits, anxiety, negative and positive affect, well-being and resilience. Principal component analysis was applied to divide the sample into groups of subjects based on their drug use reports. Results: 5618 participants (29.15 {+/-} 0.12 years, 71.97% female) completed both surveys and met the inclusion criteria, with 32.43% of the final sample reporting at least one use of a psychedelic drug. Lifetime psychedelic use was linked to increased openness and decreased conscientiousness, and with higher scores of positive affect. The reported number of past psychedelic experiences predicted higher scores of the secondary personality trait beta factor, which has been interpreted as a measure of plasticity. No significant associations between lifetime use of psychedelics and indicators of impaired mental health were observed. Conclusion: We did not find evidence of an association between lifetime use of psychedelics and poor mental health indicators. Conversely, experience with psychedelic drugs was linked to increased positive affect and to personality traits that favor resilience and stability in the light of the ongoing crisis. Future studies should be conducted to investigate these results from a causal perspective.

"Home garden use during COVID-19: Associations with physical and mental wellbeing in older adults","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many aspects of people's lives. Lockdown measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have been more stringent for those aged over 70, at highest risk for the disease. Here, we examine whether home garden usage is associated with self-reported mental and physical wellbeing in older adults, during COVID-19 lockdown in Scotland. This study analysed data from 171 individuals (mean age 84 Â± 0.5 years) from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study who completed an online survey approximately two months after lockdown commenced (May/June, 2020), and reported having access to a home garden. The survey also included items on garden activities (gardening, relaxing), frequency of garden usage during lockdown, and measures of self-rated physical health, emotional and mental health, anxiety about COVID-19, and sleep quality. Ordinal regression models were adjusted for sex, living alone, education, occupational social class, anxiety and depressive symptoms, body mass index, and history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Neither gardening nor relaxing in the garden were associated with health outcomes. However, higher frequency of garden usage during lockdown was associated with better self-rated physical health (P = 0.005), emotional and mental health (P = 0.04), sleep quality (P = 0.03), and a composite health score (P = 0.001), after adjusting for covariates. None of the garden measures were associated with perceived change in physical health, mental and emotional health, or sleep quality, from pre-lockdown levels. The results of the current study provide support for positive health benefits of spending time in a gardenâ€”though associations may be bidirectionalâ€”and suggest that domestic gardens could be a potential health resource during the COVID-19 pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2020.101545","20210201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-28","",8544,""

"Receipt, spending, and clinical correlates of economic impact payments among middle and low-income US adults","This study examined characteristics and planned expenses of U.S. adults who received the economic impact payment (EIP) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Using a nationally representative sample of 6,607 low and middle-income U.S. adults, this study examined the proportion and correlates of EIP receipt among eligible adults; and associations between planned expenses using the EIP, problems paying expenses, and clinical characteristics. In the total sample, 79% reported they received the EIP and 82% of recipients reported the EIP had a positive impact on their life. Being a veteran (OR= 2.59), married (OR= 1.82), with a history of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (OR= 1.74) or posttraumatic stress disorder (OR= 1.51), and screening negative for recent suicidal ideation (OR= 0.49) were associated with EIP receipt. Planned expenses using the EIP for savings, paying debt, and rent accounted for 63% of the total amount. Greater planned expenses on substance use or gambling were correlated with lower rated impact of the EIP on life. Additionally, EIP receipt was associated with fewer problems paying daily expenses, but participants who screened positive for mental health or alcohol use problems were more likely to report problems paying daily expenses in the past month. Together, these findings suggest unconditional cash transfers, like the EIP, are important for low and middle-income populations to sustain their living situation. The management of funds are important to consider, especially among those experiencing mental health problems, and may represent opportunities for financial literacy and money management interventions.","Jack Tsai et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46171-D18-0CB","20201228","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; mental illness; economic impact payment; stimulus; coronavirus","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-28","",8546,""
