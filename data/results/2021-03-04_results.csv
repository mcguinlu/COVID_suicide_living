"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities: a qualitative study on the perspectives of BAME community leaders","Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the perspectives of BAME community leaders in relation to - the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their communities; and BAME community perceptions, understanding and adherence to Government guidelines on COVID-19 public health measures. Design: A phenomenological approach was adopted using qualitative semi-structured interviews. Settings: Community organisations and places of worships in the West Midlands region of England. Participants: Community leaders were recruited through organisations representing BAME communities and religious places of worship. Results: A total of 19 participants took part. Participants alluded to historical and structural differences for the observed disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Many struggled with lockdown measures which impeded cultural and religious gatherings that were deemed to be integral to the community. Cultural and social practices led to many suffering on their own as discussion of mental health was still deemed a taboo within many communities. Many expressed their community reluctance to report symptoms for the fear of financial and physical health implications. They reported increase in hate crime which was deemed to be exacerbated due to perceived insensitive messaging from authority officials and historical structural biases. Access and adherence to government guidelines was an issue for many due to language and digital barriers. Reinforcement from trusted community and religious leaders encouraged adherence. Points of support such as food banks were vital in ensuring essential supplies during the pandemic. Many could not afford masks and sanitisers. Conclusion: The study highlights the perceived impact of COVID-19 pandemic on BAME communities. Government agencies and public health agencies need to integrate with the community, and community leaders to penetrate the key messages and deliver targeted yet sensitive public health advice which incorporates cultural and religious practices. Addressing route cause of disparities is imperative to mitigate current and future pandemics.","Fesani Mahmood; Dev Acharya; Kanta Kumar; Vibhu Paudyal","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.03.21252286","20210303","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11451,""
"Importance of zero patient in pandemics","The patient zero is the first reported patient in a pandemic within a population, or the first documented patient incorporated in a pandemic study  Some scientists claimed that itâ€™s important to examine primary cases  The term patient zero refers to the person identified as the first carrier of a communicable disease in an outbreak of related cases  They act as a symbol for initial actions that have major downstream consequences The primary recorded victim of the Ebola infection was a 44 year old teacher named Mabola Lokela,who passed away on 8thSeptember 1970, 614 days after the clinical manifestation started An infant in the Lewis House at 40 broad Road is viewed as the patient zero in the 1854 cholera outbreak in the Soho neighborhood of London Pandemic is a disease outbreak that spreads across countries or continents and it affects more people and takes more lives than epidemic It is an epidemic which takes place on a scale that crosses universal limits, generally influencing individuals on an overall scale  Detection of patient zero gives new insight to epidemiologists about the nature of first transmissions into a population itâ€™s important to find the first person infected with the pathogen By knowing personâ€™s history of patient zero we can determine the outbreak of the disease and the route of transmission Discovering them might be significant in certain occasions, to know whether they are still alive and transmitting the infection  Identifying a â€œpatient zeroâ€ is a rife with potential to provoke blame and scapegoating  Patient zero triggers a â€œdesperate huntâ€ and is continuously giving expression to communal fears about dangerously reckless behaviour,Researchers have found people harbour negative attitudes towards Patient zero The patient zero issue comprises of finding the source of a pandemic outbreak given,perceptions at a later time Contemplating the patient zero issue we additionally tackle the issue of finishing and rectifying the observation to people and false test results","Preeja, R.

(2) What can be the impact of stringency policy (policy responses to the coronavirus pandemic) on the spread of COVID-19? (3) What might be the quantitative effect of development levelincome and number of hospital beds on the number of deaths due to the COVID-19 epidemic? By employing the methodologies of generalized linear model, generalized moments method, and quantile regression models, this article reveals that the shares of median age, age 65, and age 70 and older population have significant positive impacts on the spread of COVID-19 and that the share of age 70 and older people in the population has a relatively greater influence on the spread of the pandemic  The second output of this research is the significant impact of stringency policy on diminishing COVID-19 total cases  The third finding of this paper reveals that the number of hospital beds appears to be vital in reducing the total number of COVID-19 deaths, while GDP per capita does not affect much the level of deaths of the COVID-19 pandemic  Finally, this article suggests some governmental health policies to control and decrease the spread of COVID-19","Bilgili, F.; Dundar, M.; Kuskaya, S.; Lorente, D.

"Impact of COVID-19 on alcohol-related liver disease: An emerging public health issue in Australia","Background: Harmful alcohol use is a major cause of preventable disease, causing death and disability from injuries as well as from liver disease, and contributing to cardiovascular disease and cancers  During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, nationwide lockdowns in Australia and the USA, with financial uncertainty or hardship and depression, have provided conditions for harmful alcohol consumption to flourish  In contrast, the strict ban on alcohol sales and carriage in South Africa has led to a reduction in deaths from accidents and trauma attributed to alcohol use  Methods: We performed a retrospective audit comparing numbers of alcohol-related admissions to a tertiary hospital in Australia in the period of national lockdown for COVID-19 from 20 March to 30 May 2020 with admissions in the same period in 2019  Data using ICD-10 codes for alcohol-related admissions were retrieved: acute intoxication (F10 0), harmful use of alcohol (F10 1), alcohol dependence syndrome (F10 2), alcoholic psychosis (F10 3), alcoholic fatty liver (K70 0), alcoholic hepatitis (K70 1), and alcoholic cirrhosis (K70 3)  An audit was performed to confirm the diagnoses from hospital records  Data on patient demographics and length of stay were extracted  Comparisons of categorical variables were made with the chi-squared test and numerical variables with the independent t-test, with the significance level set at P &lt; 0 05  Results: The number of presentations with an alcohol-related diagnosis increased by 11% from 336 in 2019 to 372 in 2020  The mean age of patients was 50 years (IQR, 39-61) in 2019 and 47 years (IQR, 35-58) in 2020  The proportion of patients who were treated in the emergency department and subsequently discharged increased from 117 to 169 patients (P = 0 004)  Patients requiring an admission for alcoholic hepatitis increased by 11% from 13 to 17 (<U+03C7>2 = 0 21, P = 0 64)  Presentations with alcohol dependence syndrome and acute intoxication also increased by 34% (<U+03C7>2 = 3 16, P = 0 07) and 48% (<U+03C7>2 = 7 44, P = 0 006), respectively  Conclusion: During the lock-down period of COVID-19, there has been an increase in alcohol-related hospital presentations  In particular, there has been a significant increase in admissions with acute intoxication and alcoholic hepatitis  Flow-on effects would lead to an increased population at risk of complications from alcohol-related liver disease  Moreover, as alcohol-related presentations only represent a fraction of the true impact of alcohol, the implications on domestic violence and the economy would result in further increased health care costs in the future as this pandemic unfolds","Au, M.; Chinnaratha, M.

"Complex regional pain syndrome treated with combined stellate ganglion and axillary approach brachial plexus blocks-a case series","Purpose Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a taxonomic system representing two types of neuropathy  Type I CRPS represents regional sympathetic dystrophies in individuals with no proof of nerve damage  Type II CRPS represents those neuropathies in patients who have nerve damage, also termed causalgia  CRPS presents most commonly in middle-aged women with traumatic upper extremity injuries, though it can present in various ways in both children and adults of both sexes  Spontaneous CRPS is less common, though it is also possible  CRPS is most commonly associated with a constant and severe burning-like pain located at or near the affected limb, which is out of proportion to the initial injury or event  As the condition progresses, additional symptoms may include the spread of pain to surrounding areas, fluctuation in pain sensation, fluctuation in temperature, swelling, sweating, limb weakness or tremors, as well as changes in growth of hair, skin, and nails  Unfortunately, there is currently no specific test to confirm the diagnosis of CRPS  Chronic regional pain syndrome treatment is individualized to each patient based on his or her unique clinical presentation  Options include physical and occupational therapies, neuropathic and anti-inflammatory medications, as well as, interventional procedures, such as, nerve blocks and spinal cord stimulators  No treatment proves superior than another and some individuals may require treatments of varying frequency and modality  Based on current studies, most individuals who are diagnosed with CRPS see significant clinical improvement within the first year  Though, this is not guaranteed as the condition is highly variable and may persist despite treatment  The purpose of this case series is to identify and follow two unique cases of CRPS  This allows us to track the progression of the disease and symptoms in tandem with varying treatment modalities  In particular, these patients required escalating care, and both combinations of stellate ganglion blocks and somatic nervous system blockade with reported improvement in pain relief  More studies are needed on the treatment options of CRPS including those exploring the viability of combined sympathetic and somatic nervous systems blockade  Methods Two patients identified to have chronic regional pain syndrome type I were followed in clinic over the course of one and five years, respectively  During clinic visits patients underwent routine physical examinations and were asked questions detailing the development and improvement of their symptoms  When appropriate, medical therapies were adjusted as needed  Prior to any procedures, patients were informed of the risks and benefits in being treated with multi-modal therapies, including stellate ganglion and brachial plexus blocks  For the stellate ganglion block, patients were placed supine  The neck was sterilely prepped and draped  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 25-gauge needle was advanced to the anterior border of C6 vertebra  Aspiration was negative confirmed with contrast AP lateral view and no intravascular intrathecal uptake was ensured  Patients were injected with a varying formulation of dexamethasone, 0 5% bupivacaine, and 1 5% lidocaine with epinephrine  After that, needle was removed  For the axillary approach brachial plexus block, the axilla was sterilely prepped and draped in usual axillary approach and using a nerve stimulator the brachial plexus was located with a hand twitch  Once patient twitch persisted at appropriate voltage and aspiration was confirmed negative a formulation of 0 5% Marcaine, 1 5% lidocaine with epinephrine and dexamethasone was injected in divided doses  Needles were then removed, the area cleaned, and Band-Aid applied  Patients followed up at varying intervals as dependent on personal schedules, symptomatic improvement, and the outbreak of COVID-19  Results A 23-year-old femalewith Ehlers-Danlos and multiple joint dislocations requiring a total of 20 surgeries including, bilateral di-rotational osteotomies, open-reduction-internal-fixat on-left -knee-surgery, and hardware removals presented with sensations of temperature change, skin color changes (purple), and hypersensitivity to light touch in her right leg one year after her surgery in 2013 with resolution in 2015, and reappearance in 2017 in the left leg  She was diagnosed with CRPS-I, and she failed therapeutic measures with physical therapy, medical management, and multiple lumbar plexus blocks  In August 2019, a spinal-cord-stimulator provided adequate relief, but symptoms spread to her left-upper extremity  In September 2019, a left stellate ganglion block provided symptomatic relief for 1-week  She then underwent combined stellate ganglion and axillary brachial plexus blocks withcomplete resolution with slow recurrence after one week  The blocks were repeated with diminishing efficacy three weeks later with return of lower extremity symptoms At two-week follow-upanother set of blocks was performed and her spinal cord stimulator was reprogrammed with symptomatic improvement lasting three weeks  She then underwent a cervical spinal cord stimulator trial and presented two weeks later with CRPS-like symptoms in her right upper extremity  Combined blocks were performed for her right upper extremity to slow progression of CRPS  In April 2020, patient reported spread of CRPS to right leg and both upper extremities, and she underwent right lumbar sympathetic, stellate ganglion, and brachial plexus blocks with symptomatic improvement  The patient continues to be followed  A 31-year-old female with thoracic outlet syndrome statuspost left first-rib removal and veno-lysis in February 2002, presented with worsening left-sided neck and upperextremity pain, weakness, temperature-changes, and numbness for three months in July 2015  She was diagnosed with CRPS-I in her left upper extremity after failing therapy with a chiropractor, heat and cold, multiple physical therapy regimens, and medical management  She subsequently underwent and experienced good relief with a spinal cord stimulator and periodic brachial plexus and stellate ganglion blocks  She weaned off hydromorphone over the course of several months following several surgeries excising scar tissues developing around the original insult  Her other medical therapies included clonidine, occasional cyclobenzaprine, duloxetine, nortriptyline, and etodolac  Almost six months after her initial combination blocks, the patient underwent a repeat combination block in January 2020 with subsequent manageable pain control with spinal cord stimulator and adjustments to medical management  She eventually weaned off nortriptyline in May 2020  The patient continues to be followed  Conclusions Finding an algorithmic approach to treating chronic regional pain syndrome remains elusive  The complex nature of these cases require a multi-modal approach that should address both symptomatic improvement, as well as, restoration of function  Exercise and physical therapies act as foundational treatments to improve motion and strength of involved extremities  Pharmacological intervention provides pain relief to facilitate improvement in functionality  In our cases, various medications were used at varying time periods throughout treatment with fluctuating efficacy  Among the medications employed for our patients were, NSAIDs, steroids, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, alpha-2-antagonists, serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, muscle relaxants, anticonvulsants, and anti-arrhythmics  Failure to achieve symptomatic improvement with these therapies inspires the pursuit of alternative options  In our patients, we achieved significant symptomatic improvement with spinal cord stimulation  Furthermore, where spinal cord stimulation failed, we achieved symptomatic relief with combined stellate ganglion and axillary approach brachial plexus blocks, albeit with significantly different temporal efficacy  These blocks aimed at treating the sympathetic and somatic components of the symptoms of our patients  Further case reports outlining treatment methods and course of disease may h lp elucidate important clues that may help in understanding the pathophysiology of CRPS and improvement in its treatment","Tarzi, D.; Setaghian,

"Digging signatures modeling anxiety and OCD disorders in very old age and end-of-life Alzheimer's disease and the effect of social isolation: A translational neuroscience approach in times of coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19)","The severity of the current scenarios in this pandemic will leave important psychological traces  In fact, the first clinical reports available already refer to increased incidence of depression and anxiety disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder  At the translational level, modelling of such neuropsychiatric alterations in animal models relays in neuroethological perspectives since response to fearful situations and traumatic events, critical for survival and adaptation to the environment, are strongly preserved in phylogeny  In the wild, mice dig as a 'defensive behavior' which is considered to reflect the anxiety state of animals  In the laboratory, mice dig vigorously in deep bedding to bury food pellets or small objects they may find  Thus this behavior, initially used to screen anxiolytic activity was later proposed to better model meaningless repetitive and perseverative behaviors characteristic of OCD or autism spectrum disorders  In the present work, we have studied the digging ethograms in normal and advanced AD-related pathological aging using wildtype and the 3xTg-AD mice, a genetic model of Alzheimer's disease that presents AD-cognitive dysfunction but also a conspicuous BPSD-like phenotype  We also studied the effects of isolation in this respect, using very old (18 month-old) 3xTg-AD mice that survived to their cage mates, as mortality rates in this animal model are high after 13 months of age  Two digging paradigms, involving different anxiogenic and contextual situations were used to investigate the digging patterns in these very old males with normal and AD-pathological aging, as well as the effects of isolation  The temporal course and intensity of this behavior was found increased in those 3xTg-AD mice that had lost their 'room partner' and lived isolated  However, when they were tested under neophobia conditions, incidence of this behavior was smaller and the pattern of digging was disrupted  The results show that this combined paradigm unveils distinct features of digging signatures that can be useful to provide an animal model for these perseverative behaviors and their interplay with anxiety states, which represent an important part of BPSD or can now emerge as a result of the enhancement of obsessive-convulsive behaviors by social-isolation","Gimenez-Llort, L.; Alveal-Mellado, L.","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610220002719","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics;32(SUPPL 1):134, 2020.; Publication details: International Psychogeriatrics;32(SUPPL 1):134, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11483,""
"Rise in the number of geriatric patients attending psychiatric emergency services in a tertiary hospital during the COVID-19 lockdown period","Introduction: Older adults are at disproportionate risk of serious disease and mortality due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic  Further, the global response to the lockdown has rendered older adults particularly vulnerable to loneliness and social isolation due to the physical distancing and shelter in place mandate  We hypothesized that both these factors would lead to an increase in geriatric mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic  Material and Methods: We undertook a clinical audit of all geriatric patients (above 60 years of age) attending the psychiatry emergency services at a tertiary care hospital  This audit was conducted over a period of 52 days dating from the cessation of non-essential services at the hospital as part of the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic (lockdown)  We used descriptive statistics to summarize the number, age, sex, presenting complaint and diagnoses of our patients  We further compared the average number of geriatric patients attending the psychiatry emergency services in the hospital during the lockdown to that of geriatric patients attending the same in the year before the lockdown  Results: A total of 112 geriatric patients attended the psychiatry emergency services during the lockdown period  Of these, 62 were male and 50 female  The average number of geriatric patients attending the emergency services daily during this period (Âµ1 2 15) was significantly higher (z 5 36, p = 0 01) than the average number of patients attending the emergency services in the year preceding the lockdown (Âµ2 1 34)  The most common presenting complaint was agitation in the preceding weeks  The most common diagnoses were late onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders followed by affective disorders and major neurocognitive disorders  Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic and the global response to the same constitute life events for older adults  They may contribute to biological, psychological and social risk factors for mental health problems in older adults during this period  The increase in geriatric patients attending our emergency services, despite an increase in restrictions on mobility which act as barriers in the pathway to care, is worrying  Under stimulation in older adults during this period may contribute to an increase in agitation","D'Cruz, M.

To determine whether telephone-based reality orientation therapy (T-ROT) can improve cognition, mood, and neuropsychiatric symptoms among patients with major neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) who are forced to isolate and also whether T-ROT can relieve the burden of distress among their caregivers. Nonrandomized interventional comparison study. Individual telephone calls between practitioners and patients and their caregivers. Twenty-seven patients (14 in the experimental group, 13 in the control group) with a major NCD and their primary caregivers. Ten T-ROT sessions and a pretest-posttest neuropsychological evaluation over 4 wk. Outcomes measured included cognitive and behavioral symptoms of patients with major NCDs and correlations between changes in patient clinical condition and caregiver stress. Primary outcome measures were two measures of depressive symptoms, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire and the Telephone Mini-Mental State Examination, administered at baseline and program discharge. T-ROT significantly outperformed nontreatment on all measures of depression, behavior, cognition, and caregiver burden. T-ROT combined with emotional support appears to be an effective intervention for monitoring and managing the behavioral symptoms of patients with major NCDs who are forced to isolate. Occupational therapy practitioners can use T-ROT or similar procedures not only during a pandemic but also when it is not possible to treat patients in person at a hospital or at home. Telephone-based treatment may also represent a good practice to be integrated into traditional rehabilitation programs.","Panerai, Raggi, Tasca, Musso, Gelardi, Prestianni, Catania, Muratore, Ferri","https://doi.org/10.5014/ajot.2021.046672","20210303","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11507,""
"Commentary on 2 Cases of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms Occurring in Association With COVID-19","Two cases are presented involving neuropsychiatric symptoms occurring in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections. The first case involved a middle-age man with no known psychiatric history who presented with acute psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganization) after recovery from a recent respiratory illness. This patient tested positive for COVID-19 on admission. The patient's symptoms were not consistent with delirium and testing did not suggest a neurological etiology. The patient's psychosis eventually resolved 6 weeks after its abrupt onset with treatment with antipsychotic medication. The second case involved a 44-year-old man with a history of depression and psychotic symptoms who presented after a serious suicide attempt and tested positive for COVID-19 on admission. The patient had subsequent negative tests while on the inpatient psychiatric unit before again testing positive later in his admission. The patient's positive COVID-19 tests appeared to coincide with exacerbations in his mood symptoms, which led to the suicide attempt and psychotic episode that initially caused his admission. This patient was successfully treated with clozapine. In both of these cases, the question arose as to whether there was a link between the COVID-19 infections and the neuropsychiatric symptoms. Growing evidence suggests that severe neuropsychiatric sequelae can develop after COVID-19 infection.","Garakani","https://doi.org/10.1097/PRA.0000000000000527","20210303","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11508,""

All statistical analyses were performed using R. Results The study population included 241 community-dwelling participants, of whom 145 were women and 96 were males. The mean age was 49.16Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 8.01Ã‚Â years. Approximately two-thirds of participants (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 158) reported no history of comorbid illness. The mean scores of depression and stress were at a &quot;severe&quot; level, while anxiety levels were at an &quot;extremely severe&quot; level. The prevalence of severe and extremely severe depression readings was 51.45 and 38.17%, respectively. In the anxiety subscale, the prevalence of severe and extremely severe depression was 95.90 and 4.1%, and in the stress subscale the prevalence was 48.97 and 4.98%, respectively. Conclusion In this study, people reported experiencing severe and extremely severe psychological distress. Therefore, there is an urgent need to implement mental health intervention policies to cope with this ongoing challenge. We suggest that the incorporation of molecular biomarker tests into the algorithm could aid in assessment of patients and guide the most appropriate therapeutic response.","Moayed, Vahedian-Azimi, Mirmomeni, Rahimi-Bashar, Goharimoghadam, Pourhoseingholi, Abbasi-Farajzadeh, Babaei, Sathyapalan, Guest, Sahebkar","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59261-5_22","20210303","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Iran; Psychological distress; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11510,""
"Coronavirus (COVID-19)-Associated Psychological Distress Among Medical Students in Iran","Aim The COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in early 2020 and is associated with high public anxiety all over the world. The healthcare community is at the highest risk of infection and thereby prone to most distress. The aim of this study was to explore and evaluate the degree of depression, anxiety, and stress levels among medical college students during the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in February and March 2020, 3 weeks after the first reported COVID-19 infection was identified in Iran. All medical college students who entered clinical courses were eligible for the study. Depression, stress, and anxiety were evaluated in these students using the DASS-21 questionnaire. Participants were selected by using availability sampling. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.5.1. Results The total number of participants was 207, with 143 males and 64 females. More than half of the participants (57.97%) were married.

"The Impact of Work Loss on Mental and Physical Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Baseline Findings from a Prospective Cohort Study","Purpose To determine if losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with mental and physical health status. To determine if social interactions and financial resources moderate the relationship between work loss and health. Methods Participants were Australians aged 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°years that were employed in paid work prior to the COVID-19 pandemic who responded to an online or telephone survey from 27<sup>th</sup> March to 12<sup>th</sup> June 2020 as part of a prospective longitudinal cohort study. Outcome measures include Kessler-6 scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°18 indicating high psychological distress, and Short Form 12 (SF-12) mental health or physical health component scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°45 indicating poor mental or physical health. Results The cohort consisted of 2,603 respondents, including groups who had lost their job (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°541), were not working but remained employed (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°613), were working less (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°660), and whose work was unaffected (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°789). Three groups experiencing work loss had greater odds of high psychological distress (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.22-3.66), poor mental (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.78-2.27) and physical health (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.10-2.12) than the unaffected work group. Poor mental health was more common than poor physical health. The odds of high psychological distress (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.43-8.36), poor mental (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.92-4.53) and physical health (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.93-3.90) were increased in those reporting fewer social interactions or less financial resources. Conclusion Losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with mental and physical health problems, and this relationship is moderated by social interactions and financial resources.

"Impact of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic on number of patients and patterns of injuries at aÃ‚Â levelÃ‚Â I trauma center","The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirusÃ‚Â 2 (SARS-Cov-2) and its associated illness, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to aÃ‚Â global health crisis burdening frontline emergency departments, including orthopedic and trauma units. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the lockdown secondary to the pandemic on patient numbers and pattern of injuries at the department of traumatology of the Medical University of Vienna. This retrospective, descriptive study identified all patients admitted and enrolled onto the trauma registry at aÃ‚Â levelÃ‚Â I trauma center, between 15 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 (lockdown) and compared them to those between 15 March 2019 and 30 April 2019 (baseline). Variables collected included patient age, sex, reason for hospital admission, place of injury, death, injury severity score (ISS), as well as American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score. A total of 10,938Ã‚Â patient visits to the trauma emergency department were analyzed, 8353 presentations during the baseline period and 2585 during lockdown. Only 1869 acutely injured and 716 follow-up patients presented during lockdown, compared to 6178 and 2175, respectively, during baseline. Throughout the COVID-19 lockdown there were significant reductions in both workplace and traffic accidents, sports injuries, number of hospitalized patients, and overall visits to the trauma emergency department; however, the number of major traumas and hip fractures remained similar. Furthermore, there was aÃ‚Â significant increase in the frequency of injuries at home as well as hospital admissions due to attempted suicide. Despite the reduction in total number of patients, trauma departments should continue to provide adequate service during lockdown considering that severe injuries showed no change. Conditions such as breakdown of social networks and limited access to mental health care and support might account for the significant rise in hospital admissions due to suicides. We recommend that more attention and effort should be made to prevent this excess of suicide deaths.","Nia, Popp, Diendorfer, Apprich, Munteanu, Hajdu, Widhalm","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00508-021-01824-z","20210303","Coronavirus; Hip fracture; Suicide; Traumatology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11515,""
"Supporting people leaving prisons during COVID-19: perspectives from peer health mentors","Currently, people leaving prisons face concurrent risks from the COVID-19 pandemic and the overdose public health emergency. The closure or reduction of community services people rely on after release such as treatment centres and shelters has exacerbated the risks of poor health outcomes and harms. This paper aims to learn from peer health mentors (PHM) about changes to their work during overlapping health emergencies, as well as barriers and opportunities to support people leaving prison in this context. The Unlocking the Gates (UTG) Peer Health Mentoring Program supports people leaving prison in British Columbia during the first three days after release. The authors conducted two focus groups with PHM over video conference in May 2020. Focus groups were recorded and transcribed, and themes were iteratively developed using narrative thematic analysis. The findings highlighted the importance of peer health mentorship for people leaving prisons. PHM discussed increased opportunities for collaboration, ways the pandemic has changed how they are able to provide support, and how PHM are able to remain responsive and flexible to meet client needs. Additionally, PHM illuminated ways that COVID-19 has exacerbated existing barriers and identified specific actions needed to support client health, including increased housing and recovery beds, and tools for social and emotional well-being. This study contributes to our understanding of peer health mentorship during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of mentors. PHM expertise can support release planning, improved health and well-being of people leaving prison and facilitate policy-supported pandemic responses.","McLeod, Timler, Korchinski, Young, Milkovich, McBride, Young, Wardell, Condello, Buxton, Janssen, Martin","https://doi.org/10.1108/IJPH-09-2020-0069","20210303","COVID-19; Peer health mentor; Prison; Public health; Qualitative research; Throughcare","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11516,""

"COVID-19: Epidemiology, Pathology, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Impact","The pandemic, well-known as COVID-19, has been brought about by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and it has distinct characteristics from other coronavirus-related epidemics. This pandemic has been ravaging the whole world for more than a year now and no drugs or vaccines have been found to eliminate this virus from the infected people effectively; only physical measures like social distancing, hand washing and face-mask wearing have been taken to reduce its spreading and very recently Veklury (remdesivir) has been permitted by the USFDA to manage the critical patients. This disease can be asymptomatic but when it is symptomatic, it presents with respiratory problems and cold- or flu-like symptoms which can be diagnosed with a chest CT and confirmed with RT-PCR tests. In this review, the taxonomy and structure of SARS-CoV-2 and history, transmission, epidemiology, pathology, clinical features and impacts of the COVID-19 have been discussed. A summary of possible drug targets, attempted physical and chemical measures, as well as vaccine candidates, have also been provided.

"Continuous positive airway pressure for respiratory support during COVID-19 pandemic: a frugal approach from bench to bedside","We describe a frugal approach (focusing on needs, performance, and costs) to manage a massive influx of COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) using the Boussignac valve protected by a filter (&quot;Filter Frugal CPAP&quot;, FF-CPAP) in and out the ICU. (1) A bench study measured the impact of two filters with different mechanical properties on CPAP performances, and pressures were also measured in patients. (2) Non-ICU healthcare staff working in COVID-19 intermediate care units were trained with a video tutorial posted on a massive open online course. (3) A clinical study assessed the feasibility and safety of using FF-CPAP to maintain oxygenation and manage patients out of the ICU during a massive outbreak. Bench assessments showed that adding a filter did not affect the effective pressure delivered to the patient. The resistive load induced by the filter variably increased the simulated patient's work of breathing (6-34%) needed to sustain the tidal volume, depending on the filter's resistance, respiratory mechanics and basal inspiratory effort. In patients, FF-CPAP achieved pressures similar to those obtained on the bench. The massive training tool provided precious information on the use of Boussignac FF-CPAP on COVID-19 patients. Then 85 COVID-19 patients with ICU admission criteria over a 1-month period were studied upon FF-CPAP initiation for AHRF. FF-CPAP significantly decreased respiratory rate and increased SpO<sub>2</sub>. Thirty-six (43%) patients presented with respiratory indications for intubation prior to FF-CPAP initiation, and 13 (36%) of them improved without intubation. Overall, 31 patients (36%) improved with FF-CPAP alone and 17 patients (20%) did not require ICU admission. Patients with a respiratory rateÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°32 breaths/min upon FF-CPAP initiation had a higher cumulative probability of intubation (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001 by log-rank test). Adding a filter to the Boussignac valve does not affect the delivered pressure but may variably increase the resistive load depending on the filter used. Clinical assessment suggests that FF-CPAP is a frugal solution to provide a ventilatory support and improve oxygenation to numerous patients suffering from AHRF in the context of a massive outbreak.","Carteaux, Pons, Morin, Tuffet, Lesimple, Badat, Haudebourg, Perier, Deplante, Guillaud, Schlemmer, Fois, Mongardon, Khellaf, Jaffal, Deguillard, Grimbert, Huguet, Razazi, de Prost, Templier, Beloncle, Mercat, Brochard, Audard, Lim, Richard, Savary, Mekontso Dessap","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-021-00828-2","20210303","Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; COVID-19; Continuous positive airway pressure; Frugal innovation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11520,""
"The type 2 asthma mediator IL-13 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of bronchial epithelium","Asthma is associated with chronic changes in the airway epithelium, a key target of SARS-CoV-2. Many epithelial changes are driven by the type 2 cytokine IL-13, but the effects of IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown. We sought to discover how IL-13 and other cytokines affect expression of genes encoding SARS-CoV-2-associated host proteins in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and determine whether IL-13 stimulation alters susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used bulk and single cell RNA-seq to identify cytokine-induced changes in SARS-CoV-2-associated gene expression in HBECs. We related these to gene expression changes in airway epithelium from individuals with mild-moderate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We analyzed effects of IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2 infection of HBECs. Transcripts encoding 332 of 342 (97%) SARS-CoV-2-associated proteins were detected in HBECs (Ã¢â€°Â¥1 RPM in 50% samples). 41 (12%) of these mRNAs were regulated by IL-13 (&gt;1.5-fold change, FDR &lt; 0.05). Many IL-13-regulated SARS-CoV-2-associated genes were also altered in type 2 high asthma and COPD. IL-13 pretreatment reduced viral RNA recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and decreased dsRNA, a marker of viral replication, to below the limit of detection in our assay. Mucus also inhibited viral infection. IL-13 markedly reduces susceptibility of HBECs to SARS-CoV-2 infection through mechanisms that likely differ from those activated by type I interferons. Our findings may help explain reports of relatively low prevalence of asthma in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and could lead to new strategies for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bonser, Eckalbar, Rodriguez, Shen, Koh, Zlock, Christenson, Woodruff, Finkbeiner, Erle","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.25.432762","20210303","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11521,""

Consequently, the aims of the study were to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practice of pharmacy students towards the pandemic and to assess its psychological impact on them to provide future guidance. A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted via a web-based survey in May 2020. All pharmacy students enrolled at Unaizah College of Pharmacy, Qassim University, were invited to take part in the study. A total of 232 out of 460 students took part in the study, giving a response rate of 50.43%. The mean total knowledge score was 9.87 Ã‚Â± 2.04 (maximum attainable score, 12).

Moreover, the majority (93%) also believed that the lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic was necessary to contain the pandemic. Encouragingly, 86.6% reported that they did not go to any crowded places during the pandemic with more female students avoiding crowded places compared to male students (91.6% versus 78.7%, respectively, P = 0.005). The majority (91%) also reported that they were following the strategies recommended by the authorities to prevent the spread of the virus. Encouragingly, 54.3% reported that the pandemic either had no effect or just a limited effect on their studies. However, 38.5% reported that they always felt or frequently felt nervous or anxious during the pandemic. The study showed that pharmacy students had good knowledge as well as positive attitudes and good practices towards COVID-19 and the preventive measures. However, during the early months, the pandemic did have a negative psychological impact on a number of students. Consequently, proactive psychological and social support services to the students should be considered during the current and future pandemics.

This study aimed at screening a convenience sample in Germany during lockdown for perceived vulnerability to disease, knowledge about COVID-19, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and behavioral responses. In an online survey, 1358 participants completed the perceived vulnerability to disease scale (PVD), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), and questionnaires on knowledge about COVID-19 and self-perceived change in behaviors in response to COVID-19. Lower and upper quartiles of the PVD were used to classify individuals into low and high PVD. A confirmatory factor analysis supported three factors representing risk, preventive and adaptive behavior as behavioral responses to COVID-19 lockdown. A structural equation model showed that the score of the knowledge scale significantly predicted the self-reported increase in adaptive and preventive behavior. The score in the PVD-subscale Perceived Infectability predicted a self-reported increase in preventive behavior, whereas the Germ Aversion score predicted a self-reported increase in preventive and a decrease in risk behavior. The score in PHQ-4 predicted a higher score in the perceived infectability and germ aversion subscales, and a self-reported decrease in adaptive behavior. Low-, medium- and high-PVD groups reported distinct patterns of behavior, knowledge, and mental health symptoms. This study shows that perceived vulnerability to disease is closely linked to preventive behaviors and may enhance adaptation to COVID-19 pandemic.","Stangier, Kananian, SchÃƒÂ¼ller","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01456-6","20210303","COVID-19 pandemic; Fear of infection; Germ aversion; Preventive behavior; Risk behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11523,""

The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale were used to assess depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms, respectively. A total of 9554 and 3886 adolescents participated in the first and second surveys. During the initial survey, the prevalence of depression was 36.6% (95% CI: 35.6-37.6%) while the prevalence of anxiety was 19% (95% CI: 18.2-19.8%). Rates of depression and anxiety increased to 57.0% (95% CI: 55.4-58.6%) and 36.7% (95% CI: 35.2-38.2%), respectively, in the second survey. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that group membership in the second survey, female gender, senior secondary school enrollment, and concerns about entering a higher grade were positively associated with both depression and anxiety. Conversely, a sleep duration of Ã¢â€°Â¥6Ã¢â‚¬â€°h/day, an exercise duration Ã¢â€°Â¥30Ã¢â‚¬â€°min/day, having the same as typical or higher study efficiency during the COVID-19 outbreak, and living in provinces with 1000-9999 confirmed COVID-19 cases were negatively associated with depression and anxiety. In conclusion, compared to figures reported during the COVID-19 outbreak, the prevalence of depression and anxiety in Chinese adolescents significantly increased after the initial outbreak. Regular screening and appropriate interventions are urgently needed to reduce the risk for emotional disturbances among adolescents during and after the initial COVID-19 outbreaks.","Chen, Qi, Liu, Feng, Li, Xiang, Cheung, Jackson, Wang, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01271-4","20210303","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11524,""
"Do COVID-19-Related Treatment Changes Influence Fear of Cancer Recurrence, Anxiety, and Depression in Breast Cancer Patients?","The worldwide spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted the treatment of cancer patients. Treatment changes can negatively affect patients' prognosis and may be psychologically burdensome. The aim of this study was to explore whether COVID-19-related treatment changes (delays, cancellations, changes) influenced fear of cancer recurrence, anxiety, and depression in breast cancer patients. A convenience sample (n = 154) of patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer no longer than 2 years ago was obtained from an online community and social network site. The survey content included COVID-19-related treatment experiences and psychological status. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Ãâ€¡2 test, independent t test, and analysis of variance. Twenty-nine patients (18.8%) had experienced COVID-19-related treatment changes, and changes of the treatment plan had a significant correlation with depression (t = 2.000, P = .047). Fear of cancer recurrence was high (mean score, 84.31 Ã‚Â± 24.23). Fifteen percent had moderate to severe levels of anxiety, and 24.7% had moderate to severe levels of depression. Narrative reports also identified COVID-19-related unforeseen costs. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, breast cancer patients experienced treatment changes, and changes in treatment plans were significantly associated with depression. Fear of recurrence, anxiety, and depression were found at high levels. Oncology nurses should assess the psychological status of cancer patients in the early survivorship phase who appear to be especially vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Oncology nurses can also monitor whether patients are receiving timely supportive care to alleviate fears and anxiety and assess financial needs for COVID-19-related costs.","Kim, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1097/NCC.0000000000000937","20210303","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11525,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity, anxiety, and depression in patients with Parkinson's disease","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has yielded containment measures with detrimental effects on the physical and mental health of the general population. The impacts of lockdown on clinical features in Parkinson's disease are not well known. We aimed to compare the physical activity, anxiety-depression levels between Parkinson's disease patients and controls during lockdown. Forty-five Parkinson's disease patients and 43 controls were evaluated with the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) via telephone interview. The patients' disease-related symptoms were worsened during lockdown though regular Parkinson's disease medication use. The PASE scores were low in both groups. The HADS scores of groups were below the cutoff point of anxiety-depression presence. Pandemic restrictions could lead to worsening of the motor and nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease.","Balci, Aktar, Buran, Tas, Donmez Colakoglu","https://doi.org/10.1097/MRR.0000000000000460","20210303","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11526,""
"Centenarians in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic","Centenarians are known to be successful agers compared to other older adults. The objective of the present study was to compare coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptoms and outcomes in centenarians and other residents living in nursing homes. Design-Setting-Subjects-Methods: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted using data from 15 nursing homes in the Marseille area. Older residents with confirmed COVID-19 between March and June 2020 were enrolled. The clinical and biological characteristics, the treatment measures, and the outcomes in residents living in these nursing homes were collected from the medical records. A total of 321 residents were diagnosed with COVID-19 including 12 centenarians. The median age was 101 years in centenarians and 89 years in other residents. The most common symptoms were asthenia and fever. Three centenarians (25%) experienced a worsening of pre-existing depression (vs. 5.5% of younger residents; <i>p</i> = 0.032). Mortality was significantly higher in centenarians than in younger residents (50% vs. 21.3%, respectively; <i>p</i> = 0.031). A quarter of the younger residents and only one centenarian were hospitalized. However, 33.3% of the centenarians received treatment within the context of home hospitalization. Worsening of pre-existing depression seems to be more frequent in centenarians with COVID-19 in nursing homes. This population had a higher mortality rate but a lower hospitalization rate than younger residents.","Couderc, Correard, NouguerÃƒÂ¨de, Berbis, Rey, Daumas, Villani","https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.202743","20210303","COVID-19; centenarians; mortality; nursing home; symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11527,""
"Building a Community Partnership in a Pandemic: NJ Pediatric Residency Advocacy Collaborative","The New Jersey Pediatric Residency Advocacy Collaborative (NJPRAC) is a statewide collaborative with faculty leads from each of the 10 New Jersey pediatric residency programs. The 2 major goals of the collaborative were to build community partnerships between pediatric residency programs and local organizations and develop a core advocacy curriculum. In this article, we focus on how the NJPRAC built community partnerships with Family Success Centers (FSCs) across the state over the course of a 2-year period. FSCs are located within every county in the state and fall under the New Jersey Department of Children and Families, providing resources and supports for families in crisis, with a focus on child abuse prevention services. Amid this growing partnership, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced the NJPRAC to swiftly pivot its partnership and develop innovative programs to support families during the COVID-19 pandemic. As FSC leadership communicated families' concerns to the collaborative, we initiated the Virtual House Call webinar, which incorporated pediatricians, community leaders, and allied health professionals to answer COVID-19 questions. These webinars quickly expanded into weekly interprofessional series, with experts in mental health, law, nutrition, and dentistry partnering with pediatricians from various subspecialties. Key to the webinars' success was responding in real time to audience questions, collaborating with the FSC leadership on content, and garnering the support from the local New Jersey Chapter, American Academy of Pediatrics and the national American Academy of Pediatrics. A key challenge remains to meaningfully incorporate pediatric trainees into community partnerships. The NJPRAC plans to continue the Virtual House Call series with continuous input from the FSCs and participating families.","Traba, Pai, Bode, Hoffman","https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-012252","20210303","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11528,""

"Mental Health Burden of German Cancer Patients before and after the Outbreak of COVID-19: Predictors of Mental Health Impairment","The aim of this study was to analyze individual changes in cancer patients' mental health before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore predictors of mental health impairment. Over a two-week period (16-30 March 2020), 150 cancer patients in Germany participated in this study. Validated instruments assessed demographic and medical data, depression and anxiety symptoms (PHQ-2, GAD-2), distress (DT), and health status (EQ-5D-3L). All instruments were adapted to measure the individual mental health before the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19, and the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 were measured. Cancer patients showed a significant increase in depression and anxiety symptoms and distress, while health status deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. Increased depression and generalized anxiety symptoms were predicted by COVID-19-related fear. Trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 and COVID-19-related fear predicted increases in distress. Higher subjective levels of information predicted less increasing anxiety symptoms and distress. Present data suggests that cancer patients experienced a significant increase in mental health burden since the COVID-19 outbreak. Observed predictors of mental health impairment and protective factors should be addressed, and appropriate interventions established, to maintain mental health of cancer patients during the pandemic.","BÃƒÂ¤uerle, Musche, Schmidt, Schweda, Fink, WeismÃƒÂ¼ller, Kohler, Herrmann, Tewes, Schadendorf, Skoda, Teufel","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18052318","20210303","COVID-19; anxiety; cancer; depression; distress; mental health; predictors of mental health impairment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11531,""
"Protocol for an implementation study of an evidence-based home cardiac rehabilitation programme for people with heart failure and their caregivers in Scotland (SCOT:REACH-HF)","Despite evidence that cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an essential component of care for people with heart failure, uptake is low. A centre-based format is a known barrier, suggesting that home-based programmes might improve accessibility. The aim of SCOT: Rehabilitation EnAblement in CHronic Heart Failure (REACH-HF) is to assess the implementation of the REACH-HF home-based CR intervention in the context of the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland.This paper presents the design and protocol for this observational implementation study. Specific objectives of SCOT:REACH-HF are to: (1) assess service-level facilitators and barriers to the implementation of REACH-HF; (2) compare real-world patient and caregiver outcomes to those seen in a prior clinical trial; and (3) estimate the economic (health and social) impact of implementing REACH-HF in Scotland. The REACH-HF intervention will be delivered in partnership with four 'Beacon sites' across six NHS Scotland Health Boards, covering rural and urban areas. Health professionals from each site will be trained to facilitate delivery of the 12-week programme to 140 people with heart failure and their caregivers. Patient and caregiver outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 4-month follow-up. Assessments include the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), five-dimension EuroQol 5L, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Caregiver Burden Questionnaire. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with up to 20 health professionals involved in programme delivery (eg, cardiac nurses, physiotherapists). 65 facilitator-patient consultations will be audio recorded and assessed for fidelity. Integrative analysis will address key research questions on fidelity, context and CR participant-related outcomes. The SCOT:REACH-HF findings will inform the future potential roll-out of REACH-HF in Scotland. The study has been given ethical approval by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service (reference 20/WS/0038, approved 25 March 2020). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The study is listed on the ISRCTN registry with study ID ISRCTN53784122. The research team will ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with both General Data Protection Regulations and the University of Glasgow's Research Governance Framework. Findings will be reported to the funder and shared with Beacon Sites, to facilitate service evaluation, planning and good practice. To broaden interest in, and understanding of REACH-HF, we will seek to publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals and present at stakeholder events, national and international conferences.","Purcell, Daw, Kerr, Cleland, Cowie, Dalal, Ibbotson, Murphy, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040771","20210303","cardiology; heart failure; rehabilitation medicine; COVID-19; Cardiac Rehabilitation; Caregivers; Heart Failure; Humans; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; SARS-CoV-2; Scotland; State Medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11532,""
"Music as a factor associated with emotional self-regulation: A study on its relationship to age during COVID-19 lockdown in Spain","The purpose of this research is to reveal the possible relational influence of age on frequency and form of music consumption, its use, and value as a factor associated with emotional self-regulation in pandemic contexts. With this objective, this study applied a transversal, descriptive and analytical design in a sample of 1377 Spaniards during the confinement of COVID-19 from March 14 to June 20, 2020. The results report that music has been an essential generalized support for living with isolation and a powerful instrument for emotional self-regulation and relief from loneliness. Although an increase of 56% in the daily use of music for self-regulation of emotions was detected, higher frequencies of consumption, mainly in solitude, and a better conception of this artistic expression are identified in the population over 51 years old. However, young people between 18 and 40 years old stood out in the use of music as a resource to alleviate loneliness. These results confirm that music seems to have arisen as one of the most used artistic expressions to cope with loneliness, to relate to the outside or as a tool to endure psychological and emotional states catalogued as negative such as anxiety, anguish and depression, among others. Likewise, they evidence its role in personal and social wellbeing in distant age ranges, and the relational influence of music and age in contexts of isolation and loneliness.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06274","20210201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11533,""

"Objectively measured physical activity and symptoms of psychopathology in general population adolescents from the SIGMA cohort","Background: Less physical activity (PA) has been associated with the development of psychopathology in adolescence. Few studies, however, have focused on understanding the nature of the PA â€“ psychopathology relationship and existing research relies mostly on self-report PA measures, which are less reliable. In this study, we investigated the nature and potential dose-response relationship between objectively measured light physical activity (LPA) and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and psychopathology symptoms in adolescents. Methods: 1130 adolescents (67% female) aged 11-19 years from the SIGMA cohort wore the Fitbit Charge 2 measuring LPA and MVPA during at least three days. Participants completed the Brief Symptom Inventory-53, assessing general symptoms of psychopathology, depression, anxiety, and psychoticism. Model selection was conducted in a subset of the dataset (n = 566) to determine the best fit. The optimal model was then fitted to the remainder of the dataset (n= 564). Results: Results indicated that, compared to non-linear alternatives, a linear relationship between LPA/MVPA and psychopathology fits best. None of these linear associations were significant, however. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that LPA and MVPA are not significantly related to symptoms of general psychopathology, depression, anxiety, and psychoticism. Therefore, this study does not provide evidence that higher durations of LPA and MVPA alone relate to reduced symptoms of psychopathology in the general adolescent population. A more integrative approach considering the interdependency of multiple lifestyle factors, as well as the domain, context, and individual experience of PA may add value to the understanding of the PA- psychopathology relationship.","NoÃ«mi Hagemann et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46207-295-EDB","20210304","PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Behavioral Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11535,""
"Social behavior and youth psychopathology during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study","Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented changes to the lives of youth, including social distancing measures and stay-at-home orders resulting in a sudden and stark reduction in daily social interactions for children and adolescents. Given that peer relationships are especially important during this developmental stage, it is crucial to understand the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on social behavior and risk for mental health problems in children and adolescents. Method: In a longitudinal sample (N=224, aged 7-15 years old) assessed at three strategic time points (prior to the pandemic, during the stay-at-home order period, and again six months later), we examine the social lives of children and adolescents and whether certain social behaviors may protect against increases in internalizing and externalizing problems during the pandemic. Results: Youth who reported lower levels of in-person and digital socialization, greater social isolation, and less peer and parent support had heightened internalizing and externalizing symptoms during the pandemic, controlling for pre-pandemic symptoms. Youth who reported more social connectedness and increased use of digital socialization during the pandemic were less likely to develop psychopathology after experiencing pandemic-related stressors. In addition, children, but not adolescents, who maintained some socialization in-person were less likely to develop internalizing symptoms following exposure to pandemic-related stressors. Conclusion: Using a longitudinal design, we identify social factors that promote well-being and resilience in children and adolescents during this societal event. We provide practical recommendations to mitigate risk of psychopathology resulting from the dramatic changes in youthsâ€™ social experiences during the pandemic.","Alexandra M Rodman et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46249-00F-2C4","20210304","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-04","",11536,""
