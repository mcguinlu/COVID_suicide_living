"Outpatient and Home Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program Post COVID-19: A study protocol for clinical trial","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a widespread, highly contagious inflammatory process that causes respiratory, physical and psychological dysfunction. COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system and evolves in the acute phase from mild cases with common symptoms, such as fever, cough, and fatigue, to the moderate-to-severe form, causing massive alveolar damage resulting in dyspnea and hypoxemia that can rapidly progress to pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The acute form usually causes severe pulmonary sequelae such as pulmonary fibrosis or progression to organ failure, leading to worsening metabolic dysfunction and/or death. Purpose To verify the effects of an outpatient and home pulmonary rehabilitation program (PRP) on clinical symptoms, pulmonary function, physical activity level, functional status, autonomic activity, peripheral muscle strength, static and functional balance, functional mobility, anxiety and depression, post-traumatic stress, quality of life, and survival of patients with sequelae from COVID-19. Methods This study will be a cohort, parallel, two-arm multicentric study, to be carried out in three clinical centers, with blind evaluation, with 06 weeks of training and follow-up. This study was designed according to the recommendations of the CONSORT statement. To be involved in this clinical study, according to the inclusion criteria, women and men aged between 16 and 75 years affected by COVID-19. The proposed PRP is based on the guidelines recommended by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease and, consists of a combination of aerobic and muscle strengthening exercises, lasting six weeks, with a frequency of three times a week. Discussion In patients infected with COVID-19 with persistent symptoms and sequelae, PRP mainly seeks to improve dyspnea, relieve anxiety and depression, prevent, and reduce complications and/or dysfunctions, reduce morbidity and mortality, and improve health-related quality of life. Trial registration: This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (ID: COVID-19 PULMONARY REHAB NCT04982042).","Luis  V F Oliveira; MiriÃ£  C Oliveira; Maria Eduarda  M Lino; MarilÃºcia  M Carrijo; JoÃ£o Pedro  R Afonso; Ricardo  S Moura; LetÃ­cia  S GalvÃ£o; ElisÃ¢ngela  R P PÃ³voa; Luis Filipe  R J Oliveira; Bianca  M Reis; Raphael  H C O Diniz; Rubens  R Bernardes; Jean  C Coutinho; Anderson  S Silva; Daniela  R P Fonseca; Adriano  L Fonseca; Dante  B Santos; Guilherme  P Modesto; Vinicius  Z Maldaner; IransÃ© Oliveira-Silva; Rodrigo  A B L Martins; PatrÃ­cia  S L L Martins; Claudia  S Oliveira; Renata  K Palma; Gerson Cipriano Junior; Rodolfo  P Vieira; Larissa  R Alves; Giuseppe Insalaco","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.08.22273608","20220410","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-11","",29869,""
"THEMIS: A Framework for Cost-Benefit Analysis of COVID-19 Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions","Since December 2019, the world has been ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 150 million confirmed cases and 3 million confirmed deaths worldwide. To combat the spread of COVID-19, governments have issued unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), ranging from mass gathering restrictions to complete lockdowns. Despite their proven effectiveness in reducing virus transmission, the policies often carry significant economic and humanitarian cost, ranging from unemployment to depression, PTSD, and anxiety. In this paper, we create a data-driven system dynamics framework, THEMIS, that allows us to compare the costs and benefits of a large class of NPIs in any geographical region across different cost dimensions. As a demonstration, we analyzed thousands of alternative policies across 5 countries (United States, Germany, Brazil, Singapore, Spain) and compared with the actual implemented policy. Our results show that moderate NPIs (such as restrictions on mass gatherings) usually produce the worst results, incurring significant cost while unable to sufficiently slow down the pandemic to prevent the virus from becoming endemic. Short but severe restrictions (complete lockdown for 4-5 weeks) generally produced the best results for developed countries, but only if the speed of reopening is slow enough to prevent a resurgence. Developing countries exhibited very different trade-off profiles from developed countries, and suggests that severe NPIs such as lockdowns might not be as suitable for developing countries in general.","Dimitris Bertsimas; Michael Lingzhi Li; Saksham Soni","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.09.22273656","20220410","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-11","",29870,""
