"Health behaviours the month prior to COVID-19 infection and the development of self-reported long COVID and specific long COVID symptoms: A longitudinal analysis of 1,811 UK adults","Abstract Background Demographic and infection-related characteristics have been identified as risk factors for long COVID, but research on the influence of health behaviours (e.g., exercise, smoking) immediately preceding the index infection is lacking. Methods 1,811 UK adults from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study and who had previously been infected with COVID-19 were analysed. Health behaviours in the month before infection were weekly exercise frequency, days of fresh air per week, sleep quality, smoking, consuming more than the number of recommended alcoholic drinks per week (>14), and the number of mental health care behaviours (e.g., online mental health programme). Logistic regressions controlling for covariates (e.g., COVID-19 infection severity and pre-existing health conditions) examined the impact of health behaviours on long COVID and three long COVID symptoms (difficulty with mobility, cognition, and self-care). Results In the month before infection with COVID-19, poor quality sleep increased the odds of long COVID (odds ratio [OR]: 3.53; (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01 to 6.21), as did average quality sleep (OR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.44 to 4.12). Having smoked (OR: 8.39; 95% CI: 1.86 to 37.91) increased and meeting recommended weekly physical activity guidelines (3+ hours) (OR: 0.05; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.39) reduced the likelihood of difficulty with self-care (e.g., washing all over or dressing) amongst those with long COVID. Conclusion Results point to the importance of sleep quality for long COVID, potentially helping to explain previously demonstrated links between stress and long COVID. Results also suggest that exercise and smoking may be modifiable risk factors for preventing the development of difficulty with self-care.

"Psychological effects of COVID-19 phobia on industrial consumers: a case study in Turkey","Purpose This study aims to discover whether COVID-19 phobia has a positive and significant effect on the stress, depression and anxiety levels of industrial consumers in addition to reveal whether environmental awareness plays a mediating role between COVID-19 phobia and stress, depression and anxiety. Design/methodology/approach In this study, a quantitative method was used to reveal the role of anxiety, depression and stress (psychological effects) and environmental awareness caused by covid-19 phobia on industrial consumers. The universe of the study is small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the province of Sanliurfa, which is located in the southeast region of Turkey and the second largest city in the region, and are industrial customers. Questionnaire method was used in the study. In addition, data were collected from 406 people who agreed to participate in the study. In the study, in which intermediary and regulatory analyzes were made, the process macro program was used. Findings The results show that there is a medium relationship between COVID-19 phobia and environmental awareness;and COVID-19 phobia and stress, depression and anxiety. No relationship was found between environmental awareness and stress, depression and anxiety. COVID-19 phobia was found to have a positive and significant effect on environmental awareness and stress, depression and anxiety, while environmental awareness was found to have no effect on stress, depression and anxiety. Finally, environmental awareness was found to play a mediating role between COVID-19 phobia and stress, depression and anxiety. Research limitations/implications In this study, four hypotheses were developed. Of these hypotheses, three are for the simple effect and one for the mediation effect. Out of four hypotheses, three were supported. The most important inference obtained from the study was finding the mediation effect of environmental awareness between COVID-19 phobia and anxiety, depression and stress. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, no studies in the literature were made on the relationship among COVID-19 phobia, environmental awareness, stress, depression and anxiety. This study also examines the mediating effect of environmental awareness in the relationship between COVID-19 phobia and stress, depression and anxiety. The fact that the study is on the negative effects of the pandemic on one of the most affected occupational group also increases its original value.","Degirmenci, B.; Durmaz, Y.; Fidanoglu, A.; Degirmenci, S.","https://doi.org/10.1108/jbim-04-2021-0221","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing;: 18, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30065,""

"Acute relationships between mental health and cognitive function during the COVID-19 pandemic: Longitudinal evidence from middle-aged and older US adults","Background The acute impacts of COVID-19-related mental health concerns on cognitive function among middle-aged and older adults are unknown. We investigated whether between-person (BP) differences and within-person (WP) changes in loneliness, anxiety, and worry about COVID-19 were related to cognitive function and abilities in a longitudinal cohort of middle-aged and older United States (US) adults over a nine-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Data were from bimonthly questionnaires in the nationwide COVID-19 Coping Study from August/September 2020 through April/May 2021 (NÂ =Â 2262 adults aged =55). Loneliness was assessed with the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, anxiety with the 5-item Beck Anxiety Inventory, and COVID-19 worry on a 5-point Likert-type scale. Cognitive outcomes were assessed with the 6-item Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMISÂ®) Cognitive Function and Abilities scales. Marginal structural models incorporating inverse probability of treatment and attrition weights as well as sampling weights estimated the BP and WP relationships between the mental health predictors and PROMISÂ® cognitive scores over time. Results In any given month, experiencing a loneliness, anxiety symptom, or COVID-19 worry score higher than the sample mean (BP difference) or higher than one's personal mean across the nine-month period (WP change) was negatively associated with cognitive function and abilities in that month. The observed magnitudes of associations were stronger for BP differences than for WP changes and were the strongest for anxiety symptom scale scores. Conclusions Elevated loneliness, anxiety symptoms, and worry about COVID-19, both relative to other adults and to one's usual levels, were acutely associated with worse perceived cognitive function and abilities over a nine-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The long-term impacts of mental health symptoms experienced during the pandemic for population cognitive health should be explored.","Kobayashi, Lindsay C.; O'Shea, Brendan Q.; Joseph, Carly, Finlay, Jessica M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2022.100097","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: SSM - Mental Health;: 100097, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30067,""
"Is digitalization a driver to enhance environmental performance? An empirical investigation of European countries","This article is the first to analyze empirically the impact of digitalization on environmental performance, using a database of 25 European countries over the period 2015â€“2020. We use two dimensions, human health protection and ecosystem protection, to reflect environmental performance, which are collected from the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy. Digitalization is captured by digital connectivity, human capital with digital skills, use of the Internet, integration of digital technology in business, and digital public services, which are sourced from Eurostat - Community survey and eGovernment Benchmarking Report. Our results demonstrate that the digital transformation process, especially digital skills, business digitization, and digital public services, enhances environmental performance. We emphasize the importance of business digitization and digital public services on environmental health, and digital connectivity, digital skills, and business digitization on ecosystem vitality. The roles of digital skills and business digitization have been seen more clearly during the Covid-19 pandemic. By studying the short-run and long-run effects, we indicate that the digital transformation process has adverse effects in the short term, but positive effects appear in the long term. Finally, the investigation into the mechanism of the digitalization-environment nexus provides empirical evidence of the influence of digital transformation on the environment and sustainability in the European Union.","Ha, Le Thanh, Huong, Tran Thi Lan, Thanh, To Trung","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2022.04.002","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainable Production and Consumption;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30068,""
"Relationship between sleep duration and quality and mental health before and during COVID-19 pandemic: Results of population-based studies in Brazil","Objective This study aimed to evaluate the association between sleep duration and quality and mental health before and amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Data from two population-based cross-sectional studies conducted in 2019 and 2020 with adults in CriciÃºma, Southern Brazil. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to screen major depressive episodes, while the perceived stress scale was used to assess perceived stress. Sleep was evaluated through self-reported duration and quality. Crude and adjusted Poisson regression models were used to assess the association between sleep and mental health disorders. Results A total of 820 (in 2019) and 863 subjects (in 2020) were assessed. Sleep quality presented significant associations with depression and stress in both years, and the magnitude of the association with depression increased amid COVID-19 pandemic. In individuals with poor/very poor sleep quality, the risk of depression in 2019 was 2.14 (95%IC 1.48;3.09) higher when compared to those with good/very good sleep quality. This risk increased to 2.26 (95%IC 1.49;3.40) in 2020. The risk of stress was 1.90 (95%IC 1.42;2.55) in 2019 and 1.66 (95%IC1.34;2.07) in 2020. The sleep duration was not associated with mental health disorders in the adjusted analyses. Conclusion The results provide important evidence that sleep quality can influence mental health of adults. The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have had a considerable impact on this association.","SchÃ¤fer, AntÃ´nio Augusto, Santos, Leonardo Pozza, Manosso, Luana Meller, Quadra, Micaela Rabelo, Meller, Fernanda Oliveira","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2022.110910","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Psychosomatic Research;: 110910, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30069,""
"Nursing home workersâ€™ mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in France","Objectives The present study sought to examine mental health problems among nursing home workers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to investigate COVID-19 related fears, and to identify pre-pandemic factors associated with current mental health issues. Design A cross-sectional, online survey was used. Setting and Participants All employees among six nursing homes in southwestern France (N=455) were solicited between November, 2020 and June, 2021. Methods The survey instrument was developed within the World Mental Health consortium to screen for COVID-related fears, probable generalized anxiety, panic attacks, depression, post-traumatic stress and substance use disorders in the past 30 days. Results The survey was completed by 127 workers (89.0% female, mean age = 43.42 years, SD=11.29), yielding a 28.5% response rate. Overall, 48.03% reported experiencing fear of infecting others at least most of the time. One in eight (14.96%) indicated that close others feared being infected by them. One third of the sample (34.65%) met criteria for at least one probable current mental disorder. Panic attacks (22.05%) were the most frequently-reported mental health problem, followed by depression (16.54%). In multivariate analyses, the only factor associated with having a current probable mental disorder was the presence of any pre-pandemic mental health problem (AOR=4.76, 95%CI=2.08-10.89). Type of employment contract, full-time status, or medical vs non-medical staff status were not significantly associated with mental health status. Conclusions and Implications The study reveals that one third of nursing home workers in the sample report current probable mental disorders, and these were largely associated with pre-pandemic mental health status. Screening for common mental health problems and facilitating access to appropriate care should be prioritized in nursing homes.","Husky, Mathilde M.; Villeneuve, Roxane, Teguo, Maturin Tabue, Alonso, Jordi, Bruffaerts, Ronny, Swendsen, Joel, Amieva, HÃ©lÃ¨ne","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2022.04.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the American Medical Directors Association;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30070,""
"Effects of mental health interventions among people hospitalized with COVID-19 infection: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials","Objective We evaluated the effects of mental health interventions among people hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods We conducted a systematic review and searched 9 databases (2 Chinese-language) from December 31, 2019 to June 28, 2021. Eligible randomized controlled trials assessed interventions among hospitalized COVID-19 patients that targeted mental health symptoms. Due to the poor quality of trials, we sought to verify accuracy of trial reports including results. Results We identified 47 randomized controlled trials from China (NÂ =Â 42), Iran (NÂ =Â 4) and Turkey (NÂ =Â 1) of which 21 tested the efficacy of psychological interventions, 5 physical and breathing exercises, and 21 a combination of interventions. Trial information could only be verified for 3 trials of psychological interventions (cognitive behavioral, guided imagery, multicomponent online), and these were the only trials with low risk of bias on at least 4 of 7 domains. Results could not be pooled or interpreted with confidence due to the degree of poor reporting and trial quality, the frequency of what were deemed implausibly large effects, and heterogeneity. Conclusion Trials of interventions to address mental health in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, collectively, are not of sufficient quality to inform practice.

"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Perceived Stress and Eating Behaviors of Undergraduate and Postgraduate Students of the UWI, Cave Hill Campus, Barbados a Cross-Sectional Study (preprint)","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic-imposed restrictions contributed to negative mental health challenges and problematic eating behaviors among students and young adults. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on perceived stress and eating behaviors of the UWI, Cave Hill Campus students. Methods: An online survey questionnaire between June and July 2021 screened for COVID-19 vaccination status and intent, eating behavior and, anxiety and depression. Salzburg Stress Eating Scale, SCOFF and PHQ-4 questionnaires identified factors associated with eating behavior and eating disorders (EDs). Findings: Respondentsâ€™ mean age was 26 years;81.4% were female. Vaccine acceptance was 63.6%, and 42.9% had received the first dose. Relatively high proportions of students screened positive on the PHQ-4 for anxiety (46%) (95%CI: 42%-51%) and depression (43%) (95%CI: 39%-47%);22% (95%CI: 17%-25%) had scores suggestive of severe anxiety. 16.2% (95%CI 13.0-19.4%) screened positive for EDs (SCOFF score = 2);positive screen for eating disorder was more likely positive in obese (36%) vs underweight (15%) students (p&lt;0.0001). In bivariate analyses, eating behavior was positively associated with BMI, programme of study, anxiety, depression, and PHQ-4 score (p&lt;0.05). In multivariable regression analysis, BMI, anxiety, and depression remained significantly associated with eating behavior (p&lt;0.001) and positive screen for eating disorders (p=0.001). Interpretation: A high proportion of students screened positive for anxiety and depression. Prevalence of problematic eating behaviors reflects previously reported trends in the Caribbean, possibly accelerated during the pandemic.

"Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic Related Mental Health on State Anxiety in Thailand (preprint)","The objective of this academic article is to study the anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic situation which affects the mental health of people in Thailand. Since the pandemic has spread all over the world, including Thailand, has taken place over a long period of time and it is unlikely to end, the discovery of new knowledge both in terms of infection spreading and mutation still exists. As the recent mutation called Omicron has been found to spread faster than other strains, it results in the concern to the general public. According to the results of study collecting psychological information, it was found that the factors that drives high anxiety are overestimating threat, inflated sense of responsibility, and intolerance of uncertainty. Solving these factors will help reducing the anxiety about COVID-19. There should be continuously further studies of this disease. There should be an agency that provides accurate information quickly in a timely manner to help relieving the anxiety that arises. This allows the public to live a new normal life amidst the continuance to face this disease without risking mental health problems caused by anxiety from such situations.","Urairak, Buppachat","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effect+of+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+Related+Mental+Health+on+State+Anxiety+in+Thailand+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30073,""
"Did Suicide Numbers Diverge from Pre-Existing Trends During the First 9-15 Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic? Interrupted Time Series Analyses of Total and Sex- and Age-Specific Suicide Counts in 33 Countries (preprint)","Background When the COVID-19 pandemic began there were concerns that suicides might rise, but predicted increases were not generally observed in the pandemicâ€™s early months. However, the picture may be changing and patterns may vary across demographic groups. We aimed to provide an up-to-date, granular picture of the impact of COVID-19 on suicides globally.Methods We identified suicide data from official public-sector sources for countries/areas-within-countries. We used interrupted time series (ITS) analyses to model the association between the pandemicâ€™s emergence and total suicides and suicides by sex-, age- and sex-by-age in each country/area-within-country. We compared the observed number of suicides to the expected number in the pandemicâ€™s first nine and first 10-15 months and used meta-regression to explore sources of variation.Findings We sourced data from 33 countries (24 high-income, six upper-middle-income, three lower-middle-income). There was no evidence of greater-than-expected numbers of suicides in the majority of countries/areas-within-countries in any analysis;more commonly, there was evidence of lower-than-expected numbers. Certain sex, age and sex-by-age groups stood out as potentially concerning, but these were not consistent across countries/areas-within-countries. In the meta-regression, different patterns were not explained by countriesâ€™ COVID-19 mortality rate, stringency of public health response, level of economic support, or presence of a national suicide prevention strategy. They were also not explained by countriesâ€™ income level, although the meta-regression only included data from high-income and upper-middle-income countries, and there were suggestions from the ITS analyses that lower-middle-income countries fared less well.Interpretation Although there are some countries/areas-within-countries where overall suicide numbers and numbers for certain sex- and age-based groups are greater-than-expected, these are in the minority. Any upward movement in suicide numbers in any place or group is concerning, and we need to remain alert to and respond to changes as the pandemic and its mental health and economic consequences continue.","Pirkis, Jane, Gunnell, David, Shin, Sangsoo, DelPozo-Banos, Marcos, Arya, Vikas, Analuisa Aguilar, Pablo, Appleby, Louis, Arafat, S.

"The Social Scar of the Pandemic: Impacts of COVID-19 Exposure on Interpersonal Trust (preprint)","This paper employs a difference-in-differences strategy to examine the causal effect of exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic on interpersonal trust in China. Using a nationally representative panel survey, we find that COVID-19 exposure led to a decrease in the levels of generalized trust. We also show that the change in interpersonal trust varied across domains. Specifically, COIVD-19 exposure significantly decreased trust in parents, neighbors, and local government officials, but had small and insignificant effects on trust in doctors, strangers, and Americans. Empirical tests suggest that changes in income and physical health status are not likely to be potential channels.

This research was carried out in the Psychiatry Department,Civil Hospital Sector 6, Panchkula, Haryana to find the prevalence of depression and anxiety among the COVID-19 positive patients. COVID-19 positive patients (n=4120) were telephonically called for mental health screening to look for the manifestation of either depressive behavior or anxiety using PHQ-9 and GAD- 7 (respectively). The results showed the prevalence of anxiety (1.06%) among the infected population  to be higher than current prevalence rate (0.57%) among the general Indian population for Generalized Anxiety Disorder but lower rate of depression (1.35%) as compared to the prevalence rate among the general population (2.7%).

"Status of Post-Lockdown Mental Well-Being in Bangladeshi Adults: A Comprehensive Survey Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","It is evident that COVID-19 related lockdown has deleterious impacts on mental well-being of the general population;however, very little is known about the mental well-being when the lockdown has been relaxed or withdrawn. Our study aimed to measure the mental well-being of the general population when the lockdown was lifted in Bangladesh. A comprehensive cross-sectional survey was conducted from December 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021. Data from 3035 general Bangladeshi aged 18 and above were analyzed. Mental well-being was measured using Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. A multivariable linear regression model was employed to find the influential variables after controlling the confounders. The mean well-being score was 43.66. Well-being score was significantly lower among women (slope -2.171, p= &lt;0.001), low-educated (slope -2.485, p= 0.018), and currently not working (slope -2.263, p= &lt;0.001) population. However, we found significantly higher mental well-being scores among those with no comorbidity (slope 3.436, p= &lt;0.001). Though the withdrawal of lockdown improved the overall mental well-being, women, low-educated, not working, and the comorbid population was still suffering from low mental well-being problems.

"Changes in alcohol consumption, eating behaviors, and body weight during quarantine measures: Analysis of the CoCo-Fakt study","Public health measures enacted to reduce COVID-19 transmission have affected individuals' lifestyles, mental health and psychological well-being. To date, little is known how stay-at-home orders have influenced the eating behaviors, weight development, and alcohol consumption of quarantined persons. The CoCo-Fakt cohort study analyzed these parameters and their association with psychological distress and coping strategies. An online survey was conducted of all persons who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (infected persons = IP) between December 12, 2020, and January 6, 2021, as well as their close contacts (contact persons = CP) registered by the public health department of Cologne. 8,075 of 33,699 individuals were included in the analysis. In addition to demographic data, psychological distress, and coping strategies, information on changes in body weight, eating and drinking behaviors was collected. IP lost 1.2 Ã‚Â± 4.4 kg during the quarantine period, and CP gained 1.6 Ã‚Â± 4.1 kg. The reasons given by IP for weight change were mainly loss of taste and feeling sick, whereas CP were more likely than IP to eat out of boredom. Higher psychological burden and lower coping strategies were associated with both weight gain and loss. Of the 30.8% of participants who changed their alcohol consumption during the quarantine period, CP in particular drank more alcohol (IP 15.2%; CP 47.7%). Significantly less alcohol was consumed by individuals with higher coping scores. In this short but psychologically stressful period of stay-at-home orders, changes in eating and drinking behavior as well as weight development are evident; mainly in high-risk contacts. To avoid possible long-term sequelae, health authorities should take these findings into account during the quarantine period; in particular, general practitioners should consider these findings during follow-up.","Wessely, Tappiser, Eisenburger, Feddern, Gehlhar, Kilimann, Klee, Niessen, Schmidt, WiesmÃƒÂ¼ller, Kossow, GrÃƒÂ¼ne, Joisten","https://doi.org/10.1159/000524352","20220413","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30079,""
"Supporting Weight Management during COVID-19 (SWiM-C): A randomised controlled trial of a web-based, ACT-based, guided self-help intervention","Adults with overweight and obesity are vulnerable to weight gain and mental health deterioration during the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a web-based, guided self-help intervention based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) that aims to support adults with overweight and obesity to prevent weight gain by helping them to manage their eating behaviours, be more physically active and protect their emotional wellbeing (""SWiM-C""). SWiM-C is a guided self-help programme using non-specialist guides to enhance scalability and population reach while minimising cost. This study evaluated the effect of SWiM-C on bodyweight, eating behaviour, physical activity and mental wellbeing in adults with overweight and obesity over 4 months during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. We randomised adults (BMIÃ¢â€°Â¥25kg/m2) to SWiM-C or to a wait-list standard advice group. Participants completed outcome assessments online at baseline and 4 months. The primary outcome was self-measured weight; secondary outcomes were eating behaviour, physical activity, experiential avoidance/psychological flexibility, depression, anxiety, stress, and wellbeing. We estimated differences between study groups in change in outcomes from baseline to 4 months using linear regression, adjusted for outcome at baseline and the randomisation stratifiers (BMI, sex). The trial was pre-registered (ISRCTN12107048). 486 participants were assessed for eligibility; 388 participants were randomised (196 standard advice, 192 SWiM-C) and 324 were analysed. The adjusted difference in weight between SWiM-C and standard advice was -0.60kg (-1.67 to 0.47, p=0.27). SWiM-C led to improvements in uncontrolled eating (-3.61 [-5.94 to -1.28]), cognitive restraint (5.28 [2.81 to 7.75]), experiential avoidance (-3.39 [-5.55 to -1.23]), and wellbeing (0.13 [0.07 to 0.18]). SWiM-C improved several psychological determinants of successful weight management and had a protective effect on wellbeing during the pandemic. However, differences in weight and some other outcomes were compatible with no effect of the intervention, suggesting further refinement of the intervention is needed.","Mueller, Richards, Jones, Whittle, Woolston, Stubbings, Sharp, Griffin, Bostock, Hughes, Hill, Ahern","https://doi.org/10.1159/000524031","20220413","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30080,""
"The Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Smoking Behaviour: Evidence from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing","Smoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having higher odds of COVID-19 progression than never-smokers. This study presents novel findings on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on smoking behaviour in older adults. Panel data were obtained from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (N= 60160, 12% smokers, 55% women, 62% married, mean age = 67 years, 23% employed). Fixed effect regression models were used to estimate the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affected smoking behaviour. A separate model was estimated for men, women, employed, and retired. The findings suggest a significant and positive effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on smoking behaviour (ÃŽÂ²= 0.024; p&lt;0.001). The estimated effects were stronger for men and for the sample of individuals reporting being employed. In this study, I provide robust evidence of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on smoking behaviour using the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. This large and representative dataset is uniquely suited for the analysis. I find evidence that the proportion of smokers has increased significantly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the UK, the proportion of smokers increased significantly as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that smoking behaviour may have been used as a mechanism to cope with depression, stress, and anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak. To the extent to which smoking behaviour has been used as a coping mechanism to deal with job-related issues, targeted policy action to provide financial stability to those in worse economic situations may be have beneficial effects on smoking behaviour.","Gaggero","https://doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntac097","20220413","COVID-19; ELSA; pandemic; smoking behaviour","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30081,""
"Digital health literacy, online information-seeking behaviour, and satisfaction of Covid-19 information among the university students of East and South-East Asia","During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing interest in online information about coronavirus worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the digital health literacy (DHL) level, information-seeking behaviour, and satisfaction of information on COVID-19 among East and South-East Asia university students. This cross-sectional web-based study was conducted between April to June 2020 by recruiting students from universities in China, Malaysia, and the Philippines. University students who have Internet access were invited to participate in the study. Items on sociodemographic variables, DHL, information-seeking behaviour, and information satisfaction were included in the questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were conducted. A total of 5302 university students responded to the survey. The overall mean score across the four DHL subscales was 2.89 (SD: 0.42). Search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo) (92.0%) and social media (88.4%) were highly utilized by the students, whereas Websites of doctors or health insurance companies were of lower utilization (64.7%). Across the domains (i.e., adding self-generated content, determining relevance, evaluating reliability, and protecting privacy) higher DHL was positively associated with higher usage of trustworthy resources. Providing online information on COVID-19 at official university websites and conducting health talks or web-based information dissemination about the strategies for mental health challenges during pandemic could be beneficial to the students. Strengthening DHL among university students will enhance their critical thinking and evaluation of online resources, which could direct them to the quality and trustworthy information sources on COVID-19.","Htay, Parial, Tolabing, Dadaczynski, Okan, Leung, Su","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266276","20220413","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30082,""
"Adolescents, Suicide, and the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has vastly disrupted the lives of youth. Stressors related to the pandemic and related lockdown measures have increased the prevalence of adolescent depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts, with their mental and psychosocial development making them highly vulnerable to isolating restrictions. Research has demonstrated increased loneliness and decreased social support among adolescents during the pandemic. Increased social media usage has further affected depression among adolescents. Pandemic-related stressors such as fear of illness or life changes have negatively affected adolescent mental well-being. Health care use during the pandemic has involved disruption in primary care suicide screening, patterns of suicide-related presentations in emergency departments, and access to mental health services. Health care providers can support adolescent mental health through consistent screening, effectively coordinating referral for mental health evaluation, and providing family guidance on resiliency, pandemic-related mental health risks, and suicide prevention. <b>[<i>Pediatr Ann</i>. 2022;51(4):e144-e149.]</b>.","Durante, Lau","https://doi.org/10.3928/19382359-20220317-02","20220413","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30083,""

"COVID-19 and Adolescent Eating Disorders","Eating disorders can have serious consequences for adolescent patients. Early detection and coordination of treatment can improve outcomes. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has negatively affected mental health, and eating disorders are no exception. The reported increase in eating disorder behaviors and referrals for treatment, combined with the shortage of treatment options, has underscored the role of the outpatient pediatrician. Detection of eating disorders in the primary care setting starts with analyzing vitals and weight trends. If suspecting an eating disorder, one should complete a thorough history with pertinent review of systems, physical examination, and an initial laboratory evaluation. Upon confirming a diagnosis, it is important for a pediatrician to decide on the level of care needed. Given long wait times for treatment centers, utilization of local resources is helpful for coordinating a multidisciplinary approach. Increased funding for eating disorder treatment initiatives could help alleviate the current strain on our health care system. <b>[<i>Pediatr Ann</i>. 2022;51(4):e150-e153.]</b>.","Khot, Monge","https://doi.org/10.3928/19382359-20220321-01","20220413","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30085,""

"The Effect of COVID-19 on the Mental Health of Military Connected Children and Adolescents","With a growing body of literature describing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic's effect on children and adolescents, there remain few official reports regarding mental health in military connected youth. With sparse literature available specifically in youth associated with the Armed Forces, published studies on global child and adolescent mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic are first reviewed. Military connected youth have unique needs and experiences. Implications of pandemic-related stressors on their mental health are suggested based on analysis of disaster and deployment literature. Military members have continued to move and deploy throughout the pandemic. Uniformed families have high risk factors for mental health concerns. Managing the mental health of military connected youth will fall heavily on civilian providers, both in primary and subspecialty practices. As such, vigilance for psychological health concerns and familiarity with military resources are vital for the mental wellness of our military pediatric patients. <b>[<i>Pediatr Ann</i>. 2022;51(4):e138-e143.]</b>.","Lawson, Bowsher, Hansen","https://doi.org/10.3928/19382359-20220321-02","20220413","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30087,""
"Psychological Behavior, Work Stress, and Social Support of Frontline Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Using a cluster sampling method, 248 nurses from frontline departments of three large general hospitals in Sichuan Province, China, were selected as participants in the current study. Risk perception and coping methods during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, negative emotions and psychological workload, and awareness of social support among nurses were studied. Negative emotions among nurses increased significantly, with fear being the most common (73.4%, <i>n</i> = 182). Psychological workload of nurses in close contact with patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of nurses in other positions (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Family was the major source of social support. Social support was negatively associated with depression (-0.206, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), obsessive-compulsiveness/anxiety (-0.185, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and hypochondriasis (-0.234, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).

"COVID-19 Pandemic Factors and Depressive Symptoms Among Primary Care Workers in SÃƒÂ£o Paulo, Brazil, October and November 2020","<b>Objectives.</b> To investigate associations between COVID-19-related factors and depressive symptoms among primary care workers (PCWs) in SÃƒÂ£o Paulo, Brazil, and to compare the prevalence of probable depression among PCWs before and during the pandemic. <b>Methods.</b> In a random sample of primary care clinics, we examined 6 pandemic-related factors among 828 PCWs. We used multivariate Poisson regression with robust variance to estimate prevalence ratios for probable depression. We assessed the prevalence of probable depression in PCWs before and during the pandemic in 2 comparable studies. <b>Results.</b> Adjusted prevalence ratios were substantial for insufficient personal protective equipment; experiences of discrimination, violence, or harassment; and lack of family support. Comparisons between PCWs before and during the pandemic showed that the prevalence of probable depression among physicians, nurses, and nursing assistants was higher during the pandemic and that the prevalence among community health workers was higher before the pandemic. <b>Conclusions.</b> Our findings indicate domains that may be crucial to mitigating depression among PCWs but that, with the exception of personal protective equipment, have not previously been examined in this population. It is crucial that governments and communities address discriminatory behaviors against PCWs, promote their well-being at work, and foster family support.

"Association of COVID-19 and Endemic Systemic Racism With Postpartum Anxiety and Depression Among Black Birthing Individuals","The intersection of endemic structural racism and the global health crisis secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic represents a syndemic, defined as the aggregation of 2 or more endemic and epidemic conditions leading to adverse repercussions for health. Long-standing inequities have placed Black individuals at disproportionate risk for negative postpartum mental health outcomes. Studies are urgently needed to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has added to this risk (eg, syndemic associations). To examine the association between the syndemic and the postpartum mental health of Black birthing individuals. A longitudinal cohort of Black birthing individuals were followed up from pregnancy (April 17 to July 8, 2020) through the early postpartum period (August 11, 2020, to March 2, 2021) from urban university medical center prenatal clinics. Pregnant Black participants were recruited via email and completed 2 online surveys. Composite variables capturing negative experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and racism (structural racism [general], structural racism [neighborhood], and interpersonal racism) were created. Logistic regressions examined main and interactive associations between these variables and postpartum depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale). The mean (SD) age of 151 Black participants was 30.18 (5.65) years. The association between higher negative COVID-19 pandemic experiences and postpartum depression may be influenced by experiences of interpersonal racism and general systemic racism. Negative COVID-19 pandemic experiences were associated with greater likelihood of screening positive for depression only at higher levels of systemic racism (odds ratio, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.38-4.60) and interpersonal racism (odds ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.04-3.48) but not at lower levels of systemic or interpersonal racism. Similarly, negative COVID-19 experiences were associated with anxiety only at higher levels of interpersonal racism (odds ratio, 1.85; 95% CI, 0.86-4.01) but not at lower levels of interpersonal racism. Overall, 44 (29%) met screening criteria for postpartum depression and 20 (13%) for postpartum anxiety. In this longitudinal cohort study of Black birthing individuals, the experience of the syndemic was associated with negative postpartum mental health. Associations between interpersonal racism, structural racism, and negative COVID-19 pandemic experiences were associated with greater risk for postpartum depression and anxiety. Research is needed to address how systemic racism perturbs biobehavioral pathways to magnify associations between acute stressors and mental health. Such research can inform the creation of effective, culturally informed preventive interventions to improve the postpartum mental health of Black individuals.","Njoroge, White, Waller, Forkpa, Himes, Morgan, Seidlitz, Chaiyachati, Barzilay, Kornfield, Parish-Morris, Rodriguez, Riis, Burris, Elovitz, Gur","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.0597","20220413","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30090,""
"Monitored home-based with or without face-to-face exercise for maternal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Despite the known beneficial effects of exercise, most pregnant women do not exercise regularly. Most studies on exercise have been conducted on supervised exercise and there is limited evidence regarding the adherence and effect of other exercise programs on pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to investigate adherence to a face-to-face plus monitored home exercise program versus a monitored home-based exercise program on its own during pregnancy. In addition, effects of these two exercise programs on women's mental health during pregnancy and postpartum (primary outcomes) and on some other maternal and neonatal outcomes (secondary outcomes) will be assessed. In this superiority trial with three parallel arms, 150 women at 12-18Ã‚Â weeks of gestation will be randomised equally into three groups (face-to-face plus monitored home exercise, only monitored home-based exercise, and control). The exercise programs will be performed up to the 38<sup>th</sup> week of gestation during which participants will be assessed at specific intervals during the pregnancy, and post-partum and followed up until six months after childbirth. The exercise diary will be used to assess the adherence. The Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule will be used to assess prenatal and postnatal depression and affect, respectively. This study reflects the feasibility and acceptance of two exercise programs for pregnant women and their effects on important outcomes.

After adjusting for socio-demographic and health-related factors, changes in daily life due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic that affected depressive symptoms in older adults living in the community were observed. This study confirmed that changes in daily life due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic negatively affected the mental health of older adults. Thus, there is a need to improve social support and care systems, by including non-face-to-face programmes using remote communication technology. It will allow older adults to maintain their daily lives and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Chu","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.13008","20220413","COVID-19; aged; community health survey; depressive symptom; pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30093,""
"A better but persistently low health status in women with fibromyalgia during the COVID-19 pandemic: a repeated cross-sectional data analysis","Multiple overlapping and complementary theoretical arguments suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic could worsen health in fibromyalgia. The aim of this study was to determine mental and physical health in women with fibromyalgia before and during the pandemic. In a 3-sample, repeated cross-sectional design, we analyzed questionnaire data from Dutch women with fibromyalgia, collected in three independent samples: before the COVID-19 pandemic (2018; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°142) and during the first acute (2020; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°304) and prolonged (2021; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°95) phases of the pandemic. Eight dimensions of mental and physical health were assessed using The RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (RAND SF-36). Compared to norm group data, both before and during the pandemic, women with fibromyalgia showed high levels of fatigue and pain and low levels of general health, social functioning, physical functioning, role physical functioning (dÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.2, very large effect sizes), role emotional functioning, and mental health (0.71Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°dÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.2, medium to large effect sizes). Contrary to theoretical expectation, levels at five health variables before vs. during the pandemic did not differ (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), and levels of pain (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), role physical functioning (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and physical functioning (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03) (0.014Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°pÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.042, small effect sizes) reflected a healthier status during than before the pandemic. These findings indicate a somewhat better but persistently low health status in women with fibromyalgia during the pandemic. This suggests that the pandemic may include changed circumstances that are favorable for some women with fibromyalgia.","Koppert, van Middendorp, Geenen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-022-05127-y","20220413","COVID-19 pandemic; Fatigue; Fibromyalgia; Mental health; Pain; Physical health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30094,""
"A Systematic Review of the Impact of the First Year of COVID-19 on Obesity Risk Factors: A Pandemic Fueling a Pandemic?","Obesity is increasingly prevalent worldwide. Associated risk factors, including depression, socioeconomic stress, poor diet, and lack of physical activity, have all been impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This systematic review aims to explore the indirect effects of the first year of COVID-19 on obesity and its risk factors. A literature search of PubMed and EMBASE was performed from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 to identify relevant studies pertaining to the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (PROSPERO; CRD42020219433). All English-language studies on weight change and key obesity risk factors (psychosocial and socioeconomic health) during the COVID-19 pandemic were considered for inclusion. Of 805 full-text articles that were reviewed, 87 were included for analysis. The included studies observed increased food and alcohol consumption, increased sedentary time, worsening depressive symptoms, and increased financial stress. Overall, these results suggest that COVID-19 has exacerbated the current risk factors for obesity and is likely to worsen obesity rates in the near future. Future studies, and policy makers, will need to carefully consider their interdependency to develop effective interventions able to mitigate the obesity pandemic.","Daniels, Burrin, Chan, Fusco","https://doi.org/10.1093/cdn/nzac011","20220413","COVID-19; depression; diet; financial stress; obesity; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30095,""
"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Antibody Seroprevalence in Decedents Undergoing Forensic Postmortem Examination: Feasibility for Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Real-Time Pandemic Surveillance","Population-based seroprevalence studies offer comprehensive characterization of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread, but barriers exist and marginalized populations may not be captured. We assessed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody seroprevalence among decedents in Maryland over 6 months in 2020. Data were collected on decedents undergoing forensic postmortem examination in Maryland from 24 May through 30 November 2020 from whom a blood specimen could be collected. Those with available blood specimens were tested with the CoronaCHEK lateral flow antibody assay. We assessed monthly seroprevalence compared to the statewide estimated number of cases and proportion of positive test results (testing positivity). We used Poisson regression with robust variance to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of demographic characteristics, homelessness, and manner of death with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Among 1906 decedents, 305 (16%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Monthly seroprevalence increased from 11% to 22% over time and was consistently higher than state-level estimates of testing positivity. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with 2- to 3.2-fold higher seropositivity (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€¦&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€¦.05) irrespective of sex. Deaths due to motor vehicle crash were associated with 62% increased seropositivity (aPR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.15-2.28]) vs natural manner of death. Though seroprevalence was lower in decedents of illicit drug overdose vs nonoverdose in early months, this shifted, and seroprevalence was comparable by November 2020. Decedents undergoing forensic postmortem examination, especially those dying due to motor vehicle trauma, may be a sentinel population for COVID-19 spread in the general population and merits exploration in other states/regions.","Coburn, Manabe, Laeyendecker, Sherman, Baker, Quinn, Graham, Dennis Thomas, Southall, Weedn, Ehsani, Klock, Li, Shields, Michael, Li, Althoff","https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofac142","20220413","SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; decedents; drug overdose; motor vehicle crash; seroprevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30096,""
"Prevalence and Associated Factors of PTSD Symptoms After the COVID-19 Epidemic Outbreak in an Online Survey in China: The Age and Gender Differences Matter","The COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease belonging to the family of coronaviruses which can affect a great deal of people shortly. As a devastating event in the world, many people suffer the PTSD from this severe disease. The aim of study is to explore the prevalence and severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and discuss the possible factors among the general public in China after the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak. This is a cross-sectional study. We used the self-designed demographic questionnaire and the Posttraumatic Stress Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) of Chinese version as our screening tools to investigate 4872 subjects living in the communities in China from Nov. 8th, 2020 to Dec. 8th, 2020. Finally, we received 3705 effective respondents. The response rates of the questionnaire can reach 76.97 percentage. Peculiarly, the prevalence of PTSD mild and severe symptoms after the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak was 53.2%. Mild PTSD symptoms accounted for 24.9%, and severe PTSD symptoms (scores above 38) accounted for 28.3%. PCL-C mean scores were 41.4Ã‚Â±14.7. The females accounted for 67.7% of the total samples. Participants' mean age was 30.5Ã‚Â±11.2 years old. The PCL-C gross scores of females were all higher than males in four subject groups. Meantime, gender and age made differences not only in total PCL-C points but also in the four aspects of PCL-C (P&lt;0.001). The middle-aged group (ages from 45 to 60) got the lowest scores among the four groups. COVID-19 brought tremendous psychological pressure on the public in many ways, including people's work, social contact, study, and daily life. Results of our research discover that symptoms of the PTSD are severe, including the re-experiencing, avoidance/numbing, flashbacks, and hyper-arousal. Actions should be taken at society level to prevent and protect individuals from PTSD suffering. Special attention should be paid to females and young people. Further studies should be conducted to explore the dynamic and other risk and protection factors to prevent PTSD.","Mao, Wang, Teng, Wang, Zhou, Zhao, Ye, Wang","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S351042","20220413","COVID-19; age; female; mental health; post-traumatic stress symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30097,""

"Rapid, application-based survey to characterise the impacts of COVID-19 on LGBTQ+ communities around the world: an observational study","Emerging evidence indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the responses it has generated, have had disproportionate impacts on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) communities. This study seeks to build on existing information and provide regional insight. In response, a cross-sectional survey was administered to a global sample of LGBTQ+ individuals (n=13Ã¢â‚¬â€°358) between 16 April and 20 May 2020 via the social networking application Hornet. The survey contained questions that characterise the impact of COVID-19 and associated mitigation strategies on economics, employment, mental health and access to healthcare. 5191 (43.9%) individuals indicated they were somewhat, slightly or unable to meet basic needs with their current income, while 2827 (24.1%) and 4710 (40.1%) felt physically or emotionally unsafe in their living environment, respectively. 2202 individuals (24.7%) stated they are at risk for losing health insurance coverage. 2685 (22.7%) persons reported having skipped or cut meals as there was not enough money.

"Hidden systolic dysfunction of the right ventricle in patients with increased pulmonary vascular resistance 3 months after COVID-19 pneumonia","AimÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚ To study the relationship of echocardiographic right ventricular (RV) structural and functional parameters and indexes of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in patients 3 months after COVID-19 pneumonia.Material and methodsÃ‚ This cross-sectional, observational study included 96 patients aged 46.7Ã‚Â±15.2 years. The inclusion criteria were documented diagnosis of COVID-19-associated pneumonia and patient's willing to participate in the observation. Patients were examined upon hospitalization and during the control visit (at 3 months after discharge from the hospital). Images and video loops were processed, including the assessment of myocardial longitudinal strain (LS) by speckle tracking, according to the effective guidelines. The equation [tricuspid regurgitation velocity/ time-velocity integral of the RV outflow tract Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°10Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.16] was used to determine PRV. Patients were divided into group 1 (n=31) with increased PRV Ã¢â€°Â¥1.5 Wood units and group 2 (n=65) with PRV &amp;lt;1.5 Wood units.Results At baseline, groups did not differ in main clinical functional characteristics, including severity of lung damage by computed tomography (32.7Ã‚Â±22.1 and 36.5Ã‚Â±20.4Ã¢â‚¬Å %, respectively. Ã‘â‚¬=0.418). Echocardiographic linear, planimetric and volumetric parameters did not significantly differ between the groups. In group 1 at the control visit, endocardial LS of the RV free wall (FW) (-19.3 [-17.9; -25.8] %) was significantly lower (Ã‘â‚¬=0.048) than in group 2 (-23.4 [-19.8; -27.8] %), and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) according to C. Otto (32.0 [26.0; 35.0] mm Hg and 23.0 [20.0; 28.0]Ã¢â‚¬Ë†mm Hg) was significantly higher than in group 2 (Ã‘â‚¬&amp;lt;0.001). According to the logistic regression, only endocardial RV FW LS (odds ratio, OR, 0.859; 95Ã¢â‚¬Å % confidence interval, CI, 0.746-0.989; Ã‘â‚¬=0.034) and sPAP (OR, 1.248; 95Ã¢â‚¬Å % CI, 1.108-1405; Ã‘â‚¬&amp;lt;0.001) were independently related with the increase in PVR.

"Increasing COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Among Patients With Serious Mental Illness: A Pilot Intervention Study","This pilot project aimed to maximize COVID-19 vaccine uptake among patients with serious mental illness. Psychiatric providers were engaged to directly address COVID-19 vaccine-related concerns with patients during outpatient visits. A quality improvement project encouraged COVID-19 vaccinations in a cohort of outpatients treated with clozapine (N=193, ages 19-81 years, mean age=46.4 years) at a community mental health center. In-service education was provided to clinicians to identify vaccine-hesitant patients and build vaccine confidence. A vaccination-monitoring tool was created and embedded in patients' electronic medical records. Starting in February 2021, the tool guided semistructured interviews at each visit and supported population-based management. The full COVID-19 vaccination rate by June 30, 2021, was 84% among the outpatients, compared with the estimated state rate on the same date of between 62.1% and 77.3%. The active involvement of psychiatric providers in preventive health care can help increase vaccination rates among patients with serious mental illness.","Lim, Van Alphen, Maclaurin, Mulligan, Macri, Cather, Freudenreich","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202100702","20220413","Community mental health services; Coronavirus; Medical morbidity and mortality in psychiatric patients; Public health; Schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30101,""
"Teaching design thinking as a tool to address complex public health challenges in public health students: a case study","Developing a public health workforce that can understand problems from a population perspective is essential in the design of impactful user-centred responses to current population health challenges. Design Thinking, a user-driven process for problem-defining and solution-finding, not only has utility in the field of public health but stands as a potential mechanism for developing critical skills -such as empathy, creativity and innovation- amongst future professionals. Though the literature reflects the use of DT across many health sciences disciplines, less research has been published on how students apply learned concepts using real-world challenges of their choice and what difficulties they face during the process. This case study evaluates achieved learning outcomes after the introduction of a design thinking block into post-graduate public health curriculum at the University College Dublin. Two independent assessors evaluated student learning outcomes and observed difficulties during the process by assessing group presentations to identify and understand any learning difficulties using an ad-hoc designed tool. The tool consisted of twelve items scored using a 5-point Likert scale. Student feedback, in the form of an online survey, was also analysed to determine their level of enjoyment, perceived learning outcomes and opinions on the course content. The assessors evaluated thirteen DT group presentations and reports from 50 students. The groups chose a range of topics from socialization of college students during Covid-19 to mental health challenges in a low-income country. Independent assessment of assignments revealed that the highest scores were reached by groups who explored a challenge relevant to their own lives (more than 80% of total possible points versus 60% class average). The groups that explored challenges more distant to themselves struggled with problem finding with a mean score of 2.05 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.2) out of 5 in that domain. The greatest difficulties were observed in problem finding and ideation. Though most students found the design thinking block enjoyable and relevant to their education, they recommended that the DT block be a stand-alone module. Students recognized that groups who chose a familiar topic experienced fewer difficulties throughout the process. The study showed that DT learning outcomes were best achieved when students focused on challenges, they had either personally experienced or were familiar with. These findings provide insight for future iterations of DT workshops and support the teaching of user-centred approaches to future public health practitioners.","Ingram, Langhans, Perrotta","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03334-6","20220413","Design thinking; Human-centred design; Learning outcomes; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30102,""
"Single-Session, Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Improve Parenting Skills to Help Children Cope With Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Feasibility Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on families' daily routines and psychosocial well-being, and technology has played a key role in providing socially distanced health care services. The first objective of this paper was to describe the content and delivery of a single-session, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) intervention, which has been developed to help parents cope with children's anxiety and manage daily situations with their children. The second objective was to report user adherence and satisfaction among the first participants who completed the intervention. The Let's Cope Together intervention has been developed by our research group. It combines evidence-based CBT elements, such as psychoeducation and skills to manage anxiety, with parent training programs that strengthen how parents interact with their child and handle daily situations. A pre-post design was used to examine user satisfaction and the skills the parents learned. Participants were recruited using advertisements, media activity, day care centers, and schools and asked about background characteristics, emotional symptoms, and parenting practices before they underwent the iCBT. After they completed the 7 themes, they were asked what new parenting skills they had learned from the iCBT and how satisfied they were with the program. Of the 602 participants who filled in the baseline survey, 196 (32.6%) completed the program's 7 themes, and 189 (31.4%) completed the postintervention survey. Most (138/189, 73.0%) of the participants who completed the postintervention survey were satisfied with the program and had learned skills that eased both their anxiety (141/189, 74.6%) and their children's anxiety (157/189, 83.1%). The majority (157/189, 83.1%) reported that they learned how to organize their daily routines better, and just over one-half (100/189, 53.0%) reported that the program improved how they planned each day with their children. The single-session iCBT helped parents to face the psychological demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should determine how the participation rate and adherence can be optimized in digital, universal interventions. This will help to determine what kinds of programs should be developed, including their content and delivery.","Korpilahti-Leino, Luntamo, Ristkari, Hinkka-Yli-SalomÃƒÂ¤ki, Pulkki-RÃƒÂ¥back, Waris, Matinolli, Sinokki, Mori, Fukaya, Yamada, Sourander","https://doi.org/10.2196/26438","20220413","COVID-19; Internet; adolescent; anxiety; child; cognitive behavioral therapy; coping; mental health; parents; web-based","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-14","",30103,""
