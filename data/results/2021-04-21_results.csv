"The Mental Health Under the COVID-19 Crisis in Africa: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Objective: In this paper, we aim to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence rates of mental health symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among the major populations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources: We search and include articles using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and medRxiv databases between Feb 202 and Feb 6th, 2021. Eligibility criteria and data analysis: The meta-analysis targets the prevalence rates of mental health symptoms of major populations including frontline/general healthcare workers (HCWs), the general adult population, and medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. To estimate the prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and insomnia, we pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses. Results: In this meta-analysis, we identify and include 28 studies and 32 independent samples from 12 countries with a total of 15,072 participants in Africa. Ethiopia (7) and Egypt (6) had the largest number of studies. While many countries including, but not limited to, Algeria, Kenya, and Ghana had a high number of COVID-19 cases, as many as three quarters of African countries have no studies. The pooled prevalence of anxiety in 27 studies was 37% (95%CI: 31-43%, I2 = 99.0%) and that of depression in 24 studies was 45% (95%CI: 36-51%, I2 = 99.5%) and that of insomnia in 9 studies was 28% (95%CI: 20-41%, I2 = 99.2%). The pooled prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in North Africa (44%, 55%, and 31%, respectively) are higher than the rates in Sub-Saharan Africa (31%, 30%, and 24%, respectively). Our analysis indicated high heterogeneity and varying prevalence rates of mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. Discussion: We discuss our findings that a) a scarcity of studies in several African countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases, b) high heterogeneity among the studies, c) the extent of prevalence of mental health symptoms in Africa to be high, and d) the pattern of mental health symptoms in Africa differs from elsewhere, i.e., more African adults suffer from depression rather than anxiety and insomnia during COVID 19 compared to adult population in other countries or regions. Hence, our findings carry crucial implications for healthcare organizations and future research to enable evidence-based medicine in Africa. Our findings also call for increased scholarly attention on Africa, the least studied continent with a limited amount of research on mental health symptoms under the COVID 19 pandemic.

"A cross-sectional study of workplace measures against COVID-19 and psychological distress among Japanese workers","Objectives: This study examined the relationship between the status of infection control efforts against COVID-19 in the workplace and workers' mental health using a large-scale Internet study. Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on an Internet monitoring survey conducted during the third wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. Of the 33,302 people who participated in the survey, 27,036 were included in the analyses. Participants answered whether or not each of 10 different infection control measures were in place at their workplace (e.g. wearing masks at all times during working hours). A Kessler 6 (K6) score of [&ge;]5 was defined as mild psychological distress. The odds ratios (ORs) of psychological distress associated with infection control measures at the workplace were estimated using a multilevel logistic model nested in the prefectures of residence. Results: The OR of subjects working at facilities with 4 or 5 infection control measures was 1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.29, p=0.025), that in facilities with 2 or 3 infection control measures was 1.32 (95% CI: 1.15-1.50, p<0.001), and that in facilities with 1 or no infection control measures was 1.48 (95% CI: 1.30-1.68, p<0.001) compared to subjects whose workplaces had [&ge;]6 infection control measures. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that proactive COVID-19 infection control measures can influence the mental health of workers.","Yoshinosa Yasuda; Tomohiro Ishimaru; Seiishiro Tateishi; Hisashi Eguchi; Mayumi Tsuji; Akira Ogami; Koji Mori; Shinya Matsuda; Yoshihisa Fujino","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.16.21255640","20210420","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13060,""
"Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in chlorinated swimming pool water","SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains a global problem which exerts a significant direct cost to public health. Additionally, other aspects of physical and mental health can be affected by limited access to social and exercise venues as a result of lockdowns in the community or personal reluctance due to safety concerns. Swimming pools have reopened in the UK as of April 12th, but the effect of swimming pool water on inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been directly demonstrated. Here we demonstrate that water which adheres to UK swimming pool guidelines is sufficient to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infectious titre by at least 3 orders of magnitude.","Jonathan C Brown; Alex Blackwell; Maya Moshe; Wendy S Barclay","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.19.440446","20210420","","bioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13061,""
"Rapid assessment of mental health of Detroit-area health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact the mental health of health care workers (HCWs). To address this issue, it is essential to determine levels of anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress, and sources of stress, and to identify subgroups of HCWs at a higher risk of adverse mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional study of symptoms of mental illness in HCWs in the area surrounding Detroit, Michigan. The online survey included questions about demographics, health and clinical factors, and sources of stress. Several tools were used to assess psychiatric symptoms among HCWs, including the Perceived Stress Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item assessment, and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5. The adequacy of personal protective equipment, patient resources, and training for highly contagious diseases were rated. The sample (N = 129) was predominantly female (51.2%) and White (65.9%), with 30.2% screening positive for clinical follow-up to assess anxiety, 20.9% for moderate to severe depression, and 16.3% for elevated traumatic stress. Differences were found by self-reported psychiatric diagnosis and chronic conditions, and role on treatment teams. Frontline HCWs demonstrate high levels of stress and trauma symptoms. Timely screening and accommodations may be needed during health care crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Daviskiba, MacKenzie, Dow, Johnston, Balon, Javanbakht, Arfken","https://doi.org/10.12788/acp.0023","20210420","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13062,""
"Community knowledge, attitude and practices to SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19): A cross-sectional study in Woldia town, Northeast Ethiopia","SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19) is pandemic and currently becomes a serious cause of death worldwide. It is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 belonging to a family known as corona virus. The aim of this study is to assess the community knowledge, attitude and practice strategy implementation on SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19). A cross-sectional survey study was done from July to October, 2020 in Woldia town, Northeast Ethiopia. Interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 404 respondents. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square test with a 95% confidence interval to know the association of socio-demographic characteristics with the knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19. From a total of 404 responses collected (64.1%, n = 259/404), (50.7%, n = 205/404) and (39.6%, n = 160/404) of the respondents were between ages 18-39 years, males and were diploma and above, respectively. The majority of the respondents had good knowledge about the transmission mode and symptoms of COVID-19 and they obtained information mainly through mass media. The knowledge of the respondents about the transmission mode of COVID-I9 through coughing and sneezing, direct contact with infected person and touching contaminated materials was statistically associated with education and occupation (p &lt;0.001). Among the total respondents (53.7%, n = 217/404) had a negative attitude that COVID-19 pandemic will not be controlled. The attitude of the respondents towards successfully controlling of COVID-I9 was statistically associated in terms of age, marital status, education and occupation (p &lt; 0.001). Most of the respondents (63.1%, n = 255/404), (58.9%, n = 238/404), (66.8%, n = 270/404) and (63.9%, n = 258/404) did not wash hands with soap, avoidance of touching the nose and mouth, practicing social distancing and wearing of face masks in public or crowded places, respectively. The practices of the respondents towards COVID-19 were statistically associated with sex, marital status, education and occupation (p &lt; 0.01). COVID-19 is currently the cause of death and it has a great impact on the economy, politics and social interactions in the study area. The government should strength the health system by increasing surveillance activities in detecting cases. Our findings suggest that the community should practice the WHO and EMoH recommendations to minimize the spread of the virus.","Molla, Abegaz","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250465","20210420","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13063,""
"Distortions to the passage of time during England's second national lockdown: A role for depression","In attempts to control the spread of the Covid-19 virus, many governments have resorted to imposing national lockdowns on their citizens. Previous research has demonstrated the passage of time becomes distorted for many people during these lockdowns. To date, research has only examined how time was experienced early in initial lockdowns. The current study examined whether distortions to the passage of time were also present later into the global pandemic. An online questionnaire was used to collect passage of time judgments for the day, week and 8 month period since the first UK lockdown. In addition, measures of affect, social satisfaction, task-load, compliance and health status were also recorded. The results show that over 80% of people reported experiencing distortion to the passage of time during the second English lockdown in comparison with normal. Depression, satisfaction with social interaction and shielding status were found to be significant predictors of temporal distortion. A slower passage of time was associated with greater depression, shielding and greater dissatisfaction with social interactions. Feeling like it was longer than 8 months since the UK's first lockdown was associated with greater depression, increased dissatisfaction with social interaction and greater change of life as a result of lockdown. The results suggest that distortions to the passage of time are an enduring feature of lockdown life and that different factors predict temporal experience during different points in lockdown.","Ogden","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250412","20210420","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13064,""
"Positive Psychological Responses and Information Seeking Behaviors Influence Anxiety among the WeChat Users During the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Mainland China: A Cross-sectional Survey Study","The rapid outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) around the world has adversely affected the mental health of the public. The prevalence of anxiety among the public increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are few studies on the effects of positive psychological responses and information seeking behaviors on WeChat users' anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study evaluated the prevalence of anxiety and its associated factors among the WeChat users in mainland China during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. From February 10 to February 24, 2020, a nationwide cross-sectional survey was carried out online using convenience sampling in mainland China. Levels of anxiety, positive psychological responses, and information seeking behaviors were measured. Questionnaires were distributed to WeChat users via the WeChat smart phone platform. Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied to examine the factors associated with anxiety. This study found that the prevalence of anxiety (GAD-7 score Ã¢â€°Â¥7) among WeChat users in China was 446/2,483 (17.96%) during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cannot stop searching for information on COVID-19, concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic, and spending more than 1 hour consuming information about the COVID-19 pandemic were observed to be associated with increased levels of anxiety according to the results of multivariable logistic regression. Additionally, participants who chose social media and commercial media as the primary sources of information about the COVID-19 pandemic were found more likely to report anxiety in this study. Conversely, it was observed that participants who were confident or rational about the COVID-19 pandemic were less likely to report anxiety. This study found that positive psychological responses and information seeking behaviors were closely associated with anxiety among WeChat users during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. It might be paramount to enhance mental well-being by helping people respond to the COVID-19 pandemic more rationally and positively in order to decrease symptoms of anxiety.","Zou, Zhang, Sznajder, Yang, Jia, Ma, Cui, Yang","https://doi.org/10.2196/24412","20210420","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13065,""
"Experiences and attitudes of elementary school students and their parents toward online learning in China during the COVID-19 pandemic: Questionnaire Study","Due to the widespread infection of COVID-19, an emergency homeschooling plan was rigorously implemented throughout China. This study aimed to investigate the experiences and attitudes of elementary school students and their parents (two generations from the same family) toward online learning in China during the pandemic. A 16-item questionnaire was distributed at the 10 day- and 40 day-mark after the first online course to 867 parent-child pairs and 141 parent-child pairs, respectively. The questionnaire comprised of questions pertaining to the course and homework's completeness, effectiveness, reliability, and abundance as well as the students' enthusiasm to take part in online classes and their satisfaction with the courses. The findings indicate that more than 91% of students exhibited high or moderate enthusiasm for participating in online classes. However, most students performed poorly in online learning classes and after school homework. Regarding satisfaction, parents' and students' average scores were 7.35 and 7.25, respectively (10-point scoring system). During the second stage of the study, parents' positive evaluations of online learning declined, including the effectiveness and reliability of the courses. Furthermore, the proportion of students who completed the courses and homework on time decreased; this difference proved statistically significant. The overall satisfaction of parents and students with online learning also declined during this second stage (7.21 vs. 7.23); however, the difference between the two stages was not statistically significant. Several of the parents (36.2%) indicated that assisting and supervising the students' online learning caused increased stress. Thirty-six percent of parents expressed dissatisfaction or suggestions concerning online learning; most parents and students hoped to return to face-to-face classes (94.9% vs. 93.5%). Finally, the results presented six main issues that parents are most concerned about: (1) disappointment regarding timely interaction in courses; (2) apprehensive about students understanding of the course; (3) increased burden of annoying adult responsibilities; (4) concern about the children's eyesight; (5) teachers' explanations were not detailed enough; (6) concerned about the decline of students' interest and attention. Online learning could prevent the spread of infectious diseases while still allowing elementary school students to attain knowledge. However, children's completion of the courses and homework were not satisfactory. Furthermore, their parents often experienced stress and had many concerns and complaints. Measures such as increasing the interactivity of the courses and prohibiting teachers from assigning the task to parents could improve the effectiveness of these courses and the mental health level of parents and students.","Cui, Zhang, Wang, Zhang, Wang, Zhang, Yuan, Huang, Cheng, Zhang, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.2196/24496","20210420","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13066,""
"Suicide Prevention among College Students before and during COVID-19 Pandemic: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol","Suicide is the second leading cause of death for college-aged individuals worldwide and in the US. Recent studies have identified preliminary evidence of widening disparities in suicidal behaviors across sex, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status among college students. Few systematic reviews and meta-analyses offer a comprehensive understanding of on-campus and off-campus suicide interventions, nor is collated information available for different types of screening, assessment, treatment, and postvention plans. Further challenges have been identified since the COVID-19 pandemic, calling for cost-effective and innovative interventions to address increased rates of suicidal behaviors among college students facing unprecedented stressors. This research protocol describes the first systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the most effective and cost-effective intervention components for universal and targeted (indicated and selected) suicide prevention among college students in a global context. Special attention will be placed on disparities in suicide prevention across sociodemographic subgroups, inclusive interventions beyond campus, global context, and intervention responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. A sensitive search strategy will be executed across Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Embase.com), PsycINFO (EBSCO), ERIC (EBSCO), Cochrane Library (Cochranelibrary.com), Dissertations and Theses Global (ProQuest), Scopus (Scopus.com), Global Index Medicus, SciELO, African Journals Online, Global Health (CABI), and Google Scholar. Data extraction and evaluation will be conducted by three independent researchers. Risk of bias will be assessed. A multilevel meta-regression model and subgroup analysis will be used to analyze the data and estimate effect sizes. The initial search was completed in December 2020 and updated with additional other-language studies in March 2020. We expect the results to be submitted for publication in mid-2021. Despite increasing rates of suicidal behaviors among college students, few preventative efforts have targeted this population, and even less focus on factors that might place specific demographic groups at heightened risk. The impact of COVID-19 on suicidal behaviors among college students highlights and exacerbates the urgent need for rapid and effective interventions that might differ from traditional approaches. This equity-focused study will address these gaps and provide a valuable analysis of the effectiveness of suicide preventions and interventions. Findings will inform clinicians, researchers, policymakers, families, and organizations about evidence-based interventions to reducing the gaps in the suicide crisis among college students from different sociodemographic groups.

"Internet-Related Behaviors and Psychological Distress Among Schoolchildren During the COVID-19 School Hiatus","This study assessed the mediating roles of problematic gaming, problematic social media use, and problematic smartphone use in the associations between psychological distress and screen time use among primary school children during the school hiatus due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Students (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2,026; mean [standard deviation] ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.71 years [1.07]; 1,011 [49.9 percent] girls) in Sichuan, China completed a cross-sectional online survey, and this study was approved by the ethics committee of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (IRB ref: HSEARS20190718001). The Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form, Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, and Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale were used to assess problematic gaming, social media use, and smartphone use. The Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 was used to assess distress, and an item rated on a 0-10 scale was included to assess fear of being infected by COVID-19. Fear of being infected by COVID-19 was assessed because this could be a confounding variable in the association between psychological distress and screen time use. Increased time spent on gaming, social media, and smartphones was associated with greater problematic gaming, problematic social media use, problematic smartphone use, and psychological distress, but was not associated with fear of COVID-19 infection. Mediation analyses showed that problematic gaming, problematic social media use, and problematic smartphone use were significant mediators in the association between psychological distress and increased time spent on Internet-related activities during the COVID-19 outbreak period. Children who had psychological distress during COVID-19 outbreak might have spent longer time on Internet-related activities due to the school hiatus and problematic use of Internet-related activities. Parents/caregivers are recommended to monitor their children's use of Internet while encouraging children to engage in positive activities to ease the concern of negative psychological responses during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Chen, Pakpour, Lin, Griffiths","https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0497","20210420","COVID-19; problematic gaming; problematic smartphone use; problematic social media use; psychological distress; school hiatus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13068,""
"Patient and Provider Insights into the Impact of Multiple Sclerosis on Mental Health: A Narrative Review","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system, causing inflammation and neurodegeneration. People living with MS may experience a variety of symptoms as a consequence of this process, including many &quot;invisible&quot; symptoms that are internally manifested and not seen by others. Of the invisible symptoms of MS, which we have reviewed in a companion article, mood and mental health disorders are of particular concern due to their high prevalence and significant impact on patient quality of life. In this review, we showcase the experiences of patient authors alongside perspectives from healthcare provider authors as we promote awareness of the common mental health conditions faced by those living with MS, such as depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and suicidal ideation. Many of these conditions stem in part from the increased stress levels and the many uncertainties that come with managing life with MS, which have been exacerbated by the environment created by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A patient-centered interdisciplinary approach, routine screening for mental health changes, and referral to specialists when needed can normalize discussions of mental health and increase the likelihood that people living with MS will receive the support and care they need. Management techniques such as robust social support, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, and/or pharmacotherapy may be implemented to build resilience and promote healthy coping strategies. Increasingly, patients have access to telehealth options as well as digital apps for mental health management. Taken together, these approaches form an integrative care model in which people living with MS benefit from the care of medical professionals, a variety of support networks/resources, and self-management techniques for optimal mental health care.","Davis, Lakin, Binns, Currie, Rensel","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40120-021-00240-9","20210420","Anxiety; Cognitive behavioral therapy; Depression; Integrative care; Invisible symptoms; Mental health; Mindfulness-based interventions; Multiple sclerosis; Patient experience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13069,""
"Learning the Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 in the United States With Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Observational Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health, economic, and social fabric of many nations worldwide. Identification of individual-level susceptibility factors may help people in identifying and managing their emotional, psychological, and social well-being. This study is focused on learning a ranked list of factors that could indicate a predisposition to a mental disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we have used a survey of 17,764 adults in the United States from different age groups, genders, and socioeconomic statuses. Through initial statistical analysis and Bayesian network inference, we have identified key factors affecting mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Integrating Bayesian networks with classical machine learning approaches led to effective modeling of the level of mental health prevalence. Overall, females were more stressed than males, and people in the age group 18-29 years were more vulnerable to anxiety than other age groups. Using the Bayesian network model, we found that people with a chronic mental illness were more prone to mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new realities of working from home; homeschooling; and lack of communication with family, friends, and neighbors induces mental pressure. Financial assistance from social security helps in reducing mental stress during the COVID-19-generated economic crises. Finally, using supervised machine learning models, we predicted the most mentally vulnerable people with ~80% accuracy. Multiple factors such as social isolation, digital communication, and working and schooling from home were identified as factors of mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regular in-person communication with friends and family, a healthy social life, and social security were key factors, and taking care of people with a history of mental disease appears to be even more important during this time.","Jha, Awasthi, Kumar, Kumar, Sethi","https://doi.org/10.2196/25097","20210420","Bayesian network; COVID-19; artificial intelligence; disorder; explainable artificial intelligence; machine learning; mental health; susceptibility; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13070,""
"Depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia: a cross-sectional study","The emergence of the COVID-19 global pandemic, with a high transmission and mortality rate, has created an extraordinary crisis worldwide. Such an unusual situation may have an undesirable impact on the mental health of individuals which, in turn, may influence their outcomes. This study aimed to explore the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological disposition of residents of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia between 27 March and 27 April 2020. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of these. A total of 2,081 individuals participated in the study. The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the study participants was 9.4% and 7.3%, respectively. Non-Saudi residents, individuals aged 50 years and above, divorced people, retired people, university students, and those with an income between 2,000 and 10,000 SR were at higher risk of developing depression. Saudi individuals, married people, the unemployed, and those with a high income (&gt; 10,000 RS) were at higher risk of developing anxiety.

"Levels and Predictors of Anxiety, Depression, and Burnout Syndrome in Physicians During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study intended to observe mental symptoms among physicians in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate the factors leading to such symptoms. The study participants were contacted via their smartphones between April 23 and 27, 2020, and invited to fill out an online questionnaire which included questions from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). The mean age of the 406 physicians who participated in the study was 42.9Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.1Ã‚Â years, and 53.4% were men (<i>n</i>: 217). During the pandemic, 66.7% had decreased working hours. Lack of COVID-related training, difficulty obtaining personal protective equipment (PPE), working in a COVID unit, and current psychiatric disease were found to be among the predictors of emotional burnout. Female gender, lack of COVID training, difficulty obtaining PPE, working in a COVID unit, and current psychiatric disease predicted desensitization. Facilitating continuous and comprehensive support mechanisms aimed at protecting physicians' mental health is of great importance during epidemics.","Tuna, Ãƒâ€“zdin","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00505-2","20210420","Burnout; Depression; Mental health; Physicians; Risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13072,""
"The 5-factor model of psychological response to COVID-19: its correlation with anxiety and depression","The present study aimed to investigate the psychological response to COVID-19 on a community Egyptian sample and the correlation thereof with anxiety and depression. Further, we aimed to explore the differences in the psychological response and psychopathology in terms of demographics. We developed a COVID-19 Psychological Response Questionnaire (CPRQ). Further, we estimated the factor structure and internal consistency of CPRQ. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was utilized to assess Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) was utilized to assess Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The sample comprised 7015 participants whose ages ranged between 18 and 70Ã‚Â years. The present study results yielded a 5-factor model of psychological response to COVID-19 (the factors are Anxiousness, Social Support, Avoiding/Cleaning, Depressivity, and Medical Concern). In terms of reliability, the internal consistency of the above factors was acceptable except for Depressivity. There were significant positive correlations between two factors (Anxiousness and Depressivity) and both MDD and GAD. In terms of demographic characteristics, females had the highest values on Anxiousness, Avoiding/Cleaning, Depressivity, MDD, and GAD. Generally, the 5-factor model reflects the psychological response to COVID-19 during the period of the outbreak. Further, this model reflects several concepts regarding models and theories of health-related behaviors.

"&quot;Trying My Best&quot;: Sexual Minority Adolescents' Self-Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major life disruptions for sexual minority adolescents (SMAs), who already face and cope with pervasive and disproportionate rates of social, behavioral, and mental health challenges. Current research suggests that SMAs are struggling with COVID-19-related shelter in place orders navigating family proximity and dynamics and experiencing isolation from SMA-specific supports. Given identified challenges that may exacerbate known mental health disparities in SMAs, this work explores self-care practices among SMAs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study uses data from open-ended questions to understand SMA experiences of self-care within a nationwide sample of SMAs (NÃ‚Â = 770; MÃ‚Â = 17.48Ã‚Â years, SDÃ‚Â = 1.00) who are part of an ongoing prospective study. Data were collected via online questionnaire between May 13 and 31, 2020. Thematic analysis guided data exploration. Thematic analysis revealed five self-care practices among SMAs: (1) relationships, (2) routines, (3) body and mind, (4) rest and reset, and (5) tuning out. SMAs engaged in many positive coping strategies (i.e., exercise, establishing routine) and often linked these activities to positive well-being. Other SMAs engaged in activities to distract or disengage from stressors (i.e., excessive TV and alcohol and drug use). These findings highlight the resiliency of SMAs during the current pandemic, opportunities for providers to emphasize adaptive coping skills with youths, and the need for more research on adolescent self-care practices.","O'Brien, Parra, Cederbaum","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.03.013","20210420","Behavioral and mental health; COVID-19; Self-care behaviors; Sexual minority adolescents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13074,""
"Utilizing Rapid Research Implementation and Collaborations to Assess the Mental Health Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic among Community and Clinical Cohorts","A research initiative was launched during the initial COVID-19 outbreak by three New York metropolitan area institutions. Collaborators recruited community members and patients from previous research studies to examine COVID-19 experiences and mental health symptoms through self-report surveys. The current report descriptively presents findings from the initial survey characterized by both community and clinical cohorts, and discusses challenges encountered with rapid implementation. The clinical cohort exhibited higher rates of symptoms of mental health difficulties (depression, anxiety, and PTSD) as compared to the community cohort. COVID-19 positivity rates were similar among both groups and lower than the national average. While both groups reported low rates of job loss, community members reported higher rates of financial difficulty resulting from the pandemic. Findings indicate the need for further collaborative research on the mental health impact of COVID-19.","Corley, Gillezeau, Molina, Alpert, Eugene, Lieberman-Cribbin, Rapp, Ryniker, Shaam, Tuminello, Gonzalez, Taioli, Schwartz","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.121","20210420","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13075,""

"Influences of digital media use on children and adolescents with ADHD during COVID-19 pandemic","To explore the influences of digital media use on the core symptoms, emotional state, life events, learning motivation, executive function (EF) and family environment of children and adolescents diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 192 participants aged 8-16Ã¢â‚¬â€°years who met the diagnostic criteria for ADHD were included in the study. Children scoring higher than predetermined cut-off point in self-rating questionnaires for problematic mobile phone use (SQPMPU) or Young's internet addiction test (IAT), were defined as ADHD with problematic digital media use (PDMU), otherwise were defined as ADHD without PDMU. The differences between the two groups in ADHD symptoms, EF, anxiety and depression, stress from life events, learning motivation and family environment were compared respectively. When compared with ADHD group without PDMU, the group with PDMU showed significant worse symptoms of inattention, oppositional defiant, behavior and emotional problems by Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale (SNAP), more self-reported anxiety by screening child anxiety-related emotional disorders (SCARED) and depression by depression self-rating scale for children (DSRSC), more severe EF deficits by behavior rating scale of executive function (BRIEF), more stress from life events by adolescent self-rating life events checklist (ASLEC), lower learning motivation by students learning motivation scale (SLMS), and more impairment on cohesion by Chinese version of family environment scale (FES-CV). The ADHD with PDMU group spent significantly more time on both video game and social media with significantly less time spend on physical exercise as compared to the ADHD without PDMU group. The ADHD children with PDMU suffered from more severe core symptoms, negative emotions, EF deficits, damage on family environment, pressure from life events, and a lower motivation to learn. Supervision of digital media usage, especially video game and social media, along with increased physical exercise, is essential to the management of core symptoms and associated problems encountered with ADHD.","Shuai, He, Zheng, Wang, Qiu, Xia, Cao, Lu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00699-z","20210420","ADHD; COVID-19; Digital media; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13077,""
"COVID-19: challenges faced by Nepalese migrants living in Japan","Worldwide, COVID-19 has exacerbated the vulnerability of migrants, impacting many facets of their lives. Nepalese make up one of the largest groups of migrants residing in Japan. Crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could disproportionately affect migrants from low- and middle-income countries like Nepal, widening health and economic inequalities. An in-depth, comprehensive assessment is needed to appraise the diverse problems they encounter. Drawing upon qualitative interviews, this study aimed to identify challenges faced by Nepalese migrants in Japan as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and to discuss their needs to counter these challenges. This qualitative study employed an interpretivist approach to appraise the first-hand experience of Nepalese migrants living in Japan. Fourteen participants (8 males and 6 females, aged 21 to 47Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old) were recruited to participate in semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews (45-60Ã¢â‚¬â€°min) regarding: (a) their perceived current physical and mental health, (b) problems faced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and (c) perception of available and necessary support structures. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used to recruit the participants. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. Six themes were identified: 1) experiencing psychosomatic symptoms, 2) adoption of new healthy behaviors, 3) financial hardship, 4) family concerns, 5) reflections on discrimination and 6) reflections of existing support and expectations of support systems. The findings of our study illustrate the specific impact of COVID-19 among Nepalese migrants regarding their unstable employment conditions, perceived lack of social support, possible obligation to send money home, difficulty in accessing services due to the language barrier, and a lack of effective governmental support from Nepal. Pandemic-related adversity has negatively impacted migrants' mental well-being, exacerbating their vulnerability. Comprehensive and timely support should be provided to the vulnerable migrant population. Effective coordination among relevant parties in both countries, including the governments concerned, should be facilitated.","Bhandari, Kotera, Ozaki, Abeysinghe, Kosaka, Tanimoto","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10796-8","20210420","COVID-19; Financial hardship, migrant welfare, mental health, migrant health; Japan; Migrants; Nepalese","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13078,""
"COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in wellness behavior among older Americans","COVID-19 has taken its toll on citizens in all 50 states of the United States. The United States (U.S.) leads the world with 30,291,863 confirmed reported cases and 549,664 deaths as of March 29, 2021 compared to globally confirmed cases at 127,442,926 and 2,787,915 deaths as of March 29, 2021. The U.S. federal government primarily left the response to the virus to individual states, and each implemented varying measures designed to protect health of citizens and the state's economic well-being. Unintended consequences of the virus and measures to stop its spread may include decreased physical activity and exercise, shifting access and consumption of food, and lower quality-of-life. Therefore, our primary goal was to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on health and well-being by measuring changes in physical activity, mental health-quality of life, food security and nutrition in adults ages 40 and older. We believed shifts in health behaviors would be more prevalent in minorities, less educated, lower socio-economic status, older adults, and those with underlying health conditions, so a secondary goal was to determine the impact of COVID-19 on these sub-populations. We conducted an online survey with 9969 adults 40Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and older between 9 August and 15 September 2020 in urban areas across the four U.S. census regions. The survey included questions about demographic variables, pre-existing health conditions, physical activity, access to food, quality-of-life, and nutritional food status and asked participants to respond with information from pre-pandemic and pandemic conditions. We used paired-sample t-tests to detect changes in variables after the start of the pandemic and Cohen's d to determine effect sizes. Our main findings showed a decrease in physical activity since the onset of COVID-19 for minorities and non-minorities. Food security also slightly increased for minorities during the pandemic, but we found no other changes in food security, quality-of-life indicators, or nutritional status of those who responded to this survey. It is concerning that physical activity declined. Such activity helps maintain physical and mental health, and it is also an important time to socialize for many older adults. In many ways, our data indicate that the older adult population in U.S. cities may be more resilient than expected during the pandemic. However, the pandemic could have negative impacts that we did not detect, either due to the survey instrument or the timing of our survey, so the health and well-being of older adults should continue to be monitored in order to mitigate potential negative impacts.","Harrison, Monroe-Lord, Carson, Jean-Baptiste, Phoenix, Jackson, Harris, Asongwed, Richardson","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10825-6","20210420","Coronavirus; Food security; Nutrition; Physical activity; Quality-of-life; Resilience; Senior citizens","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13079,""
"&quot;Ask a Doctor About Coronavirus&quot;: How Physicians on Social Media Can Provide Valid Health Information During a Pandemic","In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the information stream has overflowed with accurate information, misinformation, and constantly changing guidelines. There is a great need for guidance on the identification of trustworthy health information, and official channels are struggling to keep pace with this infodemic. Consequently, a Facebook group was created where volunteer medical physicians would answer laypeople's questions about the 2019 novel coronavirus. There is not much precedence in health care professional-driven Facebook groups, and the framework was thus developed continuously. We ended up with an approach without room for debate, which fostered a sense of calmness, trust, and safety among the questioners. Substantial moderator effort was needed to ensure high quality and consistency through collaboration among the presently &gt;200 physicians participating in this group. At the time of writing, the group provides a much-needed service to &gt;58,000 people in Denmark during this crisis.","Furstrand, Pihl, Orbe, Kingod, SÃƒÂ¸ndergaard","https://doi.org/10.2196/24586","20210420","COVID-19; Facebook; coronavirus; digital health literacy; eHealth literacy; framework; health information; health literacy; health promotion; infodemic; infodemiology; mental health; misinformation; pandemic; patient-physician relationship; public health; social media; trust; web-based community","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-21","",13080,""
