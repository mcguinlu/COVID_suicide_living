"SARS-CoV-2 causes brain inflammation via impaired neuro-immune interactions","The brain inflammation that frequently occurs in SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of neurological complications and long COVID. However, many aspects of its pathogenesis mechanism remain unknown and no method of treatment has been established. By administering a non-proliferating adenovirus vector expressing SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein into the nasal cavity of mice, we developed a mouse model (S1 mouse) reproducing brain inflammation, fatigue, depressive symptoms, and lung inflammation. Having intracellular calcium elevating activity, S1 protein increased olfactory bulb apoptosis, and reduced the number of acetylcholine producing cells in the medial septal and the diagonal band of Broca as well as the amount of acetylcholine in the brain. This resulted in disrupting the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) and enhancing inflammation in the brain. Previously, nothing was known about anti-inflammatory factors in the CAP but we discovered that, in the inflammation occurring in the S1 mouse brain, the action of the RNA binding protein ZFP36 in degrading inflammatory cytokine mRNA was impaired. The symptoms exhibited by the S1 mouse were improved by administering donepezil, a drug with a cholinergic action used in the treatment of dementia. These findings clarify the mechanism of brain inflammation in COVID-19 and indicate the possibility of applying donepezil in the treatment of neurological complications in COVID-19 and long COVID.","Naomi Oka; Kazuya Shimada; Azusa Ishii; Nobuyuki Kobayashi; Kazuhiro Kondo","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.07.13.499991","20220715","","bioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34290,""

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdown on a population with serious mental illness A prospective cohort study Impacto psicolÃ³gico del confinamiento por COVID-19 en una poblaciÃ³n con trastorno mental grave Un estudio de cohorte prospectivo","Introduction COVID-19 has spread worldwide since its appearance at the end of 2019. In Spain, 99-day long home confinement was set from March 15th 2020. Previous studies about events requiring situations of isolation suggested that mental health problems may occur among the general population and, more specifically, vulnerable groups such as individuals with serious mental illness (SMI). This study aims to assess the psychological effect of confinement in patients with mental illness admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit. Method In this longitudinal study, IDER (State-Trait Depression Inventory) and STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) questionnaires were used at two different times (at the beginning and after the lockdown) of the pandemic to evaluate the depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively, in a population of patients who had been previously admitted to the Psychiatry Unit of the Basurto University Hospital. Results 95 participants completed the IDER questionnaire in the first measurement, with a mean score of 24.56 (SDÂ =Â 8.18) for state and 23.57 (SDÂ =Â 8.14) for trait. In the case of STAI, the mean score was 27.86 (SDÂ =Â 15.19) for the state and 30.49 (SDÂ =Â 14.71) for the trait. No differences between the first and the second time were found in anxiety and depression levels. People with personality disorders presented high levels of anxiety. Conclusions Individuals with a personality disorder showed the highest scores in anxiety and depression. Nevertheless, strict confinement did not affect this population, despite the literature that evidence that the pandemic has worsened people's mental health with SMI.","Pedruzo, Borja, Catalan, Ana, Aymerich, Claudia, Bordenave, Marta, Estevez, Olatz, GÃ³mez, Diego Aurofio, Herrero, Jon, Laborda, MarÃ­a, Mancebo, Gonzalo, MartÃ­nez, Ania, Pacho, Malein, Paniagua, Ana, PÃ©rez, JosÃ© Luis, GonzÃ¡lez-Torres, Miguel Ãngel","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+impact+of+COVID-19+lockdown+on+a+population+with+serious+mental+illness.+A+prospective+cohort+study+Impacto+psicolÃ³gico+del+confinamiento+por+COVID-19+en+una+poblaciÃ³n+con+trastorno+mental+grave.+Un+estudio+de+cohorte+prospectivo","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Revista de psiquiatria y salud mental;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34293,""

"The Impact of Indonesia's Higher Education Program on Improving Students' Competence in Achieving Global Employability","Teachers are asked to adopt innovative teaching approaches and use cutting-edge technology in their classrooms. This method is deemed necessary as technological advancement is fast and educational institutions must be agile and adaptive. The Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture has implemented the MBKM program focusing on building the students ' competencies through collaborative and participatory learning to increase global employability. The study was conducted at one of the reputable universities in Indonesia and gathered survey data from 5653 students, 523 faculty members, and 245 education personnel. The findings show that from implementing MBKM activities in student learning, 97% of student respondents stated that it is valuable enough to develop their competencies and skills as a provision to work after graduation. Therefore, this program is considered successful. However, this program 's socialization and dissemination of news need to be improved to increase program comprehension, especially among students, faculty members, and education personnel. Hence, the MBKM program is needed to prepare students socially, technologically and lead to better student competencies.","Mursitama, Tirta Nugraha, Noerlina, Setiawan, Reina, Princes, Elfindah, Chandra, Alvin, Tunardi, Yovita, Limto, Devinca","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Impact+of+Indonesia's+Higher+Education+Program+on+Improving+Students'+Competence+in+Achieving+Global+Employability","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice; 22(5):168-183, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34295,""
"Libraries as an Essential Wellbeing Resource in Schools","Merga outlines the key role school libraries can play to help tackle wellbeing and mental health issues among pupils (and staff). The school library can be a place where students feel a sense of belonging, where they can find sanctuary and recharge their resilience. For example, a primary school librarian described a vulnerable student who often sought refuge in the library. During the COV1D-19 pandemic, students need access to reliable health information, as well as skills lo source and interpret this information. Greater health literacy is related to better health outcomes, so the benefits of improving students' health literacy extend beyond the current pandemic conditions. Reading books can enable students to escape the stressors of everyday life, bringing enjoyment and peace, and my earlier international research with avid readers found that 'the escape of reading was often used in order to regulate emotion'.","Merga, Margaret K.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Libraries+as+an+Essential+Wellbeing+Resource+in+Schools","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: The School Librarian; 70(2):8-9, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34296,""

The aim of this study is to characterize the reasons for psychiatric urgent care of youth during COVID-19 pandemic in our hospital. Material and methods This cross-sectional study compare visits to the psychiatry emergency department and their characteristics in young patients in the province of Lleida before and after the pandemic with special attention to the two states of alarm and suicidal behavior. Information regarding sociodemographic status, chief complaints, diagnosis, characteristics of suicidal behavior, and other data were obtained from the electronic medical records. Results Within the total psychiatric emergency attendances, youth patients increased a 83.5% in the second state of alarm (pÂ =Â 0.001). In this period patients were younger (pÂ =Â 0.006), had less psychiatric history (pÂ =Â 0.017) and their living conditions changed with an increase of those living with relatives (pÂ =Â 0.004). Suicidal ideation care increased without statistical significance (pÂ =Â 0.073). Multiple logistic regression identifies independent risk factors for suicidal behavior being female (OR: 2.88 [1.39â€“5.98]), living with relatives (OR: 3.49 [1.43â€“8.54]), and having a diagnosis of depression (OR: 6.34 [3.58â€“11.24]).

"Literature Review â€“ Socio-Economic Impact of Covid-19 in India","In India, unemployment is not a new picture. Well, it increased tremendously during covid. We cannot imagine that how many people in India lost their jobs and was facing tough times both mentally and physically. The factories where the labors worked with their sweats and toils drove them away without thinking about their food and shelters. Though I understand that those companies were also facing cut throat situation as they were unable to make profits and pay their employees, but every company should treat their employees as their home members in work because employees are the responsibilities of a company or an organization. Tourism and travel business automatically got affected as we know that the whole world was in quarantine and as we all were quarantined, so for safety and precautions 96% of people preferred all the things delivered in home through online. So, in this way, the business through online gradually increased. Growth of pharmaceutical business occurred during covid throughout the world and not only India as medicines were the most necessity along with food. So, as the demand of medicines and food were the most that's why price also increased as the availability of those were decreasing. In a gig economy, large numbers of people work in part-time or temporary positions or as independent contractors. The result of a gig economy is cheaper, more efficient services, such as Uber or Airbnb. Covid-19 cases affected online job openings and online job filling affected the spread of pandemic. The Findings suggest that policymakers should make policies to support Gig economy because it has the potential to keep the world going even in the toughest of times. impact of Covid-19 on stock markets and economies of a country or a region but because the Gig economy platforms are global in nature so this study examines the impact of pandemic. Covid 19 had a very negative impact on mental health. Due to covid people behavior are affected very badly. It caused anxiety, depression, stress, mood swings and overthinking among each individual. Isolation and social distancing made people bound to stay away from each other. It has increased the barrier of communication. People are forced to stay in their home for longer period of time which made people frustrated and angry because before this they never had experienced this type of phase. Most probably children and youth had suffered from mental health problems. Away from the schools, colleges and offices actually affected them more. They were not able to meet their colleagues and friends which increased less concentration on their work and studies and their self- confidence was also fading. They were not able to focus on their work which made them annoyed which resulted in their lifestyle due to this it also affected their health. Older people are also affected which resulted in their behavior like they were shouting on smaller issue and have more anger issues. Emotional outburst is the one of the biggest challenges everyone had faced this during this pandemic. When one is upset or sad, he or she needed someone who actually understand them listen to them but one is leftall alone which resulted in emotional breakdown. Everyone faced this trauma and felt exhausted but at the end of the day everyone came out from this phase and they are stronger than before to face any challenges and hurdles. Covid-19 pandemic has created a havoc in our lives. During this turbulent time the ""Health care system"" is playing a very important role. Since the covid-19 outbreak health care professionals are working selflessly;doctors, nurses are working day and night to fight this pandemic and there are also medical cleaners, ambulance drivers, paramedics, pathologists who are helping them. Doctors and nurses are repeatedly cautioning us from the virus and also, they are treating the covid patients. While people across the world are home quarantined and schools, colleges, shopping malls, transportation system everything was closed in an attempt to contain the virus then these brave warriors are fi hting on the front line. Nearly 600 doctors across India have died of the covid-19 during the second wave of the pandemic, according to data compiled by IMA. Many nurses have also died. In India more than 50,000 civil defense volunteers are working effortlessly during this pandemic. They are continuously cautioning us ""to stay at home, get out from your house if necessary"";informing us about the covid-19 guidelines and made the lockdown successful. They are supplying medical equipment such as lifesaving medicines, masks, sanitizers, PPE kit, oxygen cylinder;helping to deliver food for needy people, setting up community kitchen and shelters for migrant workers. In this life-threatening situation when ""Home"" is the safest place, for your mental strength you need family members that time they have to stay far from their home, far from their families for their duties to protect us. Policemen are also playing an important role to keep people safe both in and outside the home;as in this time crime rate has increased very much, as well as domestic violence. Grocery and medical shopkeepers worked hard so that we could get food and necessary items during lockdown. The sacrifices this people are making continuously for humankind are priceless. Our utmost gratitude to the warriors for their subtle contribution. The covid pandemic has disrupted most of the aspects of our life. We the youth of the country are badly affected by the disaster named as covid 19 pandemic. Covid not only affected the people physically but also mentally. It not only affected the economic sectors but also affected the social sectors like school, colleges and other type of educational institutions. Before the pandemic most of us were habituated with the offline forms of education. As per the norms declared by the government, all educational institutions must be closed which not only affected the economy but also affected the daily routine of the students like us. During the lockdown period initially, online classes feel better as the exams are also taken online but finally came to know that the virus is not a blessing to the students but a foreshadow of the student's further life to adjust the online mode of education. We, the students felt a lot of difficulties while doing projects as many students don't have the facility of having computers in their home. Mainly the students coming from rural areas faced several problems in this online mode of education. We faced bunches of problems like power cuts during online classes, network issues, difficulties in submitting projects, face to face communication with the educational faculties, unable to go for educational excursions. The pandemic also affected the mental health of the students.","De, Soumyajit, Bhowmik, Laboni, Shikha, Swapnil, Chakraborty, Deep, Nath, Pronamita, Das, Dipta","https://www.google.com/search?q=Literature+Review+â€“+Socio-Economic+Impact+of+Covid-19+in+India","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Globsyn Management Journal; 15(1/2):254-266, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34301,""
"The Lockdown Effect on Fitness Industry: The Journey of Survival & Adaptability","This paper highlights the effect of covid-19 & the lockdown on Fitness industry. As we know, corona virus pandemic, an unwanted guest that shook the world. A rare disaster resulted in loss of large number of human lives. Countries tried to contain the pandemic by implementing quarantines and social distancing but they failed to break the chain. Lockdown was imposed, locking roughly 3.9 billion lives at their respective shelters, resulted in paralyzing the economy, job loss, migrant worker crisis, and many other challenges were faced. The only thing people were thinking about is their survival, we saw demand of sanitizers, masks, Ayurvedic medicines and other necessary goods were skyrocket. Apart of these, physical fitness and mental health was too on high demand. Many reputed gym owners and fitness experts transformed their business to online platform. The fitness industry was transforming for their survival but many gym owners and other fitness houses struggled for their survival, the small gym owners which comprises of 30% in each district in India were closed for several months. As we know many fitness centers operate their business from rented properties, Post lockdown nearly 30% of fitness centers in national capital were shut due to lack of funds. The fitness centers which somehow managed to survive two lockdowns are now allowed to operate their businesses but with limited capacity and strict adherence to COVID protocol. So, this research paper will focus on the struggle, transformation, survival and growth opportunities in fitness industry. The change is need for survival and success of any business.","Chakraborty, Milan, Batabyal, Sounick, Jain, Surbhi, Farheen, Sana","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Lockdown+Effect+on+Fitness+Industry:+The+Journey+of+Survival+&+Adaptability","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Globsyn Management Journal; 15(1/2):276-284, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34302,""

"Symptom severity and well-being of patients with mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic: a two-wave survey","To examine changes in symptom severity and well-being during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic among individuals with pre-existing mental illness. In February 2021, we conducted a follow-up questionnaire-based survey among adults with mental illness, who responded to a similar survey on mental health in June 2020. The participants completed the 18-item Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), the five-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and 14 questions evaluating worsening or improvement in mental health using the pre-pandemic period as reference. The survey data were merged with sociodemographic and clinical data from the medical records of all invitees to the first survey, enabling analysis of attrition and weighting of the results. A total of 613 of 992 (62%) invitees participated in the follow-up wave of the survey. The weighted mean WHO-5 and BSI-18 scores were 38 and 27, respectively, and did not differ statistically significantly from the first wave. Multivariate logistic regression showed that having a vocational education (skilled worker/craftsman) was positively associated with reporting deterioration in psychological well-being (OR: 2.95, 95%CI: 1.14-7.81), while being unemployed was negatively associated with reporting deterioration in psychological well-being (OR: 0.20, 95%CI: 0.07-0.56) from the first to the second survey wave. The most common reason for self-reported deterioration in mental health was loneliness (70%).

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for youth with a history of exposure to self-directed violence","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created a sudden shift in the social lives of youth with important negative impacts on mental health. The current article aims to understand how the pandemic may have differentially impacted the mental health of adolescents and young adults with recent (1 year or less) and past (&gt; 1 year) exposure to self-directed violence (SDV). Data were collected online from 990 youth and young adults, aged 13-23 years between November 27, 2020 and December 11, 2020. Participants who had recently been exposed to SDV reported being more impacted by the pandemic and had poorer mental health indicators. Participants with past SDV exposure who engaged in a high number of prosocial activities (e.g., talking with friends) were less likely to report depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ² = -.13, <i>p</i> = .01) than similarly engaged nonexposed participants; the same was true for recently exposed participants (ÃŽÂ² = -.14, <i>p</i> = .02). Findings highlight that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of young people are compounded by exposure to mental health concerns of people in their network.

"Supporting chaplains on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed-method practice-based pilot intervention study","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, chaplains have played a pivotal role in patient, family member, and staff care. However, little empirical attention has been given to (a) the potential toll of frontline spiritual care on chaplains' mental health and occupational functioning as well as (b) the development of interventions that can help ameliorate these risks and promote resilience. Using a mixed-method practice-based design, we conducted a pilot study (<i>n</i> = 77) to evaluate a novel spiritually integrated support group intervention for chaplains across multiple industries, which consisted of five Zoom-based sessions cofacilitated by psychotherapists. Participants completed pre- and postintervention measures of traumatic stress, burnout, spiritual/moral struggles, flourishing, resilience, and overall experience in the group. Qualitative findings elucidated the salience of peer support, therapeutic group processes, and key intervention components that warrant further study. Quantitative results indicated significant (a) decreases in burnout and spiritual/moral struggles from pre- to postintervention as well as (b) increases in sense of resilience and flourishing. Findings of this pilot study offer preliminary evidence for the use of a spiritually integrated group model to decrease isolation, address moral and spiritual distress, and promote resilience among chaplains.

"Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Depression in Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Roles of Feelings of Safety and Rumination","The study aimed to examine the mechanism underlying the effect of basic psychological needs satisfaction (BPNs) on depression via feelings of safety or rumination in adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-report questionnaires were distributed to 683 middle school students from Hubei province in China. Structural Equation Modelling was used to analyse the data. The results showed that basic psychological needs satisfaction exerted negative effects on adolescents' depression in both a direct and an indirect way. In specific, basic psychological needs satisfaction not only directly reduced depression, but also indirectly reduced depression by the mediating role of feelings of safety, but not by rumination. Moreover, autonomy and relatedness, but not competence need satisfaction, indirectly reduced depression by the multiple mediating path from feelings of safety to rumination. The findings indicate satisfaction of basic psychological needs is important in increasing adolescents' feelings of safety, reducing negative cognitions, and alleviating their depression level during the pandemic.","Liu, Shen, Wu, Zhen, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-022-01395-8","20220714","Basic psychological needs satisfaction; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Feelings of safety; Rumination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34314,""
"Long-COVID in immunocompromised children","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to an illness characterized by persistent symptoms which affect various organs and systems, known as long-COVID. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and clinical characteristics of long-COVID in children with immunodeficiency, in comparison to those without. A self-constructed questionnaire was created, which included questions regarding the child's general health, the course of their COVID-19, their symptoms of long-COVID and its impact on their daily functioning, the diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), and vaccination status. The questionnaire was completed by parents of 147 children - 70 children with a diagnosis of immunodeficiency (47.6%) and 77 who were immunocompetent (52.4%). Immunocompetent children were more significantly affected by long-COVID than those immunocompromised. Its prevalence in the first 12-week post-infection was 60.0% and 35.7% in these groups, respectively. Beyond this period, these percentages had dropped to 34.6% and 11.43%, respectively. Children who were immunocompetent reported more often symptoms of fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, and difficulty concentrating. Meanwhile, there was a slight increase in complaints of gastrointestinal symptoms in immunocompromised patients. The risk of developing long-COVID increased with age and COVID-19 severity in both groups. Furthermore, the daily activities of immunocompetent children were limited more frequently (41.8%) than for those who were immunocompromised (25%). Although immunocompromised children experienced long-COVID, its prevalence and impact on daily functioning were significantly lower than among immunocompetent children. However, as the pathomechanisms of long-COVID are not yet fully understood, it is not currently possible to fully explain these findings. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Long COVID is characterized by persistent symptoms following COVID-19, which can affect various tissues and organs, as well as mental health. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Due to the similar course of COVID-19 - mainly mild or asymptomatic - among children with and without immunodeficiency, the question arises, over whether the prevalence and severity of long-COVID is also similar in both groups. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Immunocompromised children also suffer from long-COVID, but the prevalence is significantly lower than in the immunocompetent group of children. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The potential causes of less frequent and milder long-COVID in this group may be the milder course of COVID-19 and the state of reduced immunity protecting against neuroinflammation.","Kuczborska, Buda, KsiÃ„â€¦Ã…Â¼yk","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-022-04561-1","20220714","Immunodeficiency; Long-COVID; Pediatric population; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34315,""
"Mental health status of adolescents after family confinement during the COVID-19 outbreak in the general population: a longitudinal survey","Few studies have examined the psychological impact on adolescents of family confinement and infection exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, these surveys lacked follow-up data to determine how the family confinement affects participants' depression and anxiety. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychological status and related risk and protective factors of adolescents after two months of family confinement for preventing COVID-19 in China, and compare them with baseline data. We surveyed teenagers in January 2020 before the COVID-19 outbreak (T1) and after home confinement (T2). We used the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Scale and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). 13,637 valid questionnaires were collected at T1, of which 22.34% reported depressive symptoms (PHQ-9Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°10) and 14.42% reported anxiety symptoms (GAD-7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°10). At T2, the rates decreased to 14.86 and 7.44%, respectively (all PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). Of the adolescents, 223 reported potential risk of exposure to COVID-19. We then compared them to the 9639 non-risk adolescents using a propensity score matching analysis. The adolescents with potential exposure risk had higher rates of depression (26.91 vs 15.32%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0035) and anxiety (14.80 vs 7.21%, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) than risk-free adolescents. Among adolescents with an exposure risk, psychological resilience was protective in preventing depression and anxiety symptoms, while emotional abuse, a poor parent-child relationship were risk factors. Long-term home confinement had minimal psychological impact on adolescents, but COVID-19 infection rates accounted for 50% of the variance in depression and anxiety among adolescents even with low community rates.","Qu, Yang, Cao, Xiu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-022-01459-9","20220714","Adolescents; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Family confinement; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34316,""
"Long-term effects of Coronavirus 2 infection after intensive care: a prospective study","While the multi-organ manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are now well-documented, the potential long-term implications of these manifestations remain to be uncovered. The aim was to study the level and predictors of post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression symptoms, quality of life and functional disability in COVID-19 survivors during the first year post intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. A prospective longitudinal study, reported following the STROBE guidance, was conducted in adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to an Italian ICU from March 2020 to March 2021 who were followed until March 2022. A total of 207 patients were included in the study, of which 145 (70.1%) were male. One hundred and six (51.2%) patients between six and 12 months after ICU discharge reported at least one physical or cognitive impairment. The concurrent prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD is present in 25/106 patients (23.6% of cases) at six months and increases in 29/106 patients (27.3% of cases) at 12 months. However, the prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD was observed in 86 patients (41.5%) at six months and it gets smaller in 78 patients (37.7%) at 12 months (p= .049). The EqVAS score (58.8 vs 72.3, p= .017) and the Barthel Index (61.5 vs 74.8, p&lt; .001) increased significantly between six and 12 months after ICU.

"Responding to COVID-19 While Serving Veterans Experiencing Homelessness: The Pandemic Experiences of Healthcare and Housing Providers","The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides essential care through transitional housing and healthcare for Veterans experiencing homelessness through the Grant and Per Diem (GPD) program and the Homeless Patient Aligned Care Team (HPACT), respectively. At the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, GPD organizations and HPACT clinics faced the challenge of being essential providers tasked with ensuring the well-being of Veterans under their care. Through semi-structured interviews with 13 providers (6 HPACT health care providers representing 2 HPACT programs, and 7 GPD staff members) across the U.S., this study explored their experiences navigating the tasks of keeping Veterans safe and providing ongoing care from the start of the pandemic up to the 2021 interview dates. Both GPD and HPACT providers reported amplified safety concerns about COVID-19 infection among staff at the start of the pandemic, which diminished to a lower, stable level after a few months as adaptations made for safety became embedded in their routines. However, ongoing challenges included isolation and mental health challenges among Veterans, inherent limitations of telehealth as a care delivery avenue, provider frustration and burnout due to increased workload and frequent change, and the logistics of administering testing for Veterans to enter GPD housing. Enhanced pandemic preparedness planning for GPD organizations, funding for personal protective equipment (PPE) and providing technology to facilitate Veterans' telehealth access, and strategies for preventing provider burnout are critical to both sustaining homeless providers' capabilities during this pandemic and enhancing readiness to respond to the next public health emergency.","Gin, Balut, Alenkin, Dobalian","https://doi.org/10.1177/21501319221112585","20220714","COVID-19; Veterans; access to care; clinician burnout; healthcare; healthcare providers; homelessness; primary care; transitional housing; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34319,""
"Mental health and coping with fertility treatment cessation during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK","This study examined experiences during the cessation of fertility treatment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including levels of mental health, coping strategies used to manage uncertainty about treatment due to the pandemic, sources of support, and predictors of mental health. One hundred and seventy-five participants in the UK completed an online survey. Half of the participants experienced clinical levels of anxiety and/or depression, and 20% reported suicidal feelings as a result of the uncertainty about treatment due to the pandemic. Support from friends, family and online forums were reported by more than half of participants, but support from fertility clinics or counsellors were reported by less than one quarter. The strategy used most frequently to cope with the uncertainty about treatment due to the pandemic was self-distraction, and this predicted reduced depression. However, self-blame, behavioral disengagement and venting predicted increased depression and self-blame, behavioral disengagement, and denial predicted increased anxiety. Fertility clinic communication and psychological support, such as counselling, which had substantially reduced during treatment cessation, could include some focus on personal coping, including what to avoid. Psychological support is likely to be more important now than ever. Despite resumption of treatment, the impacts of the period of cessation and of COVID-19 are likely to continue to reverberate.","Payne, van den Akker","https://doi.org/10.1080/0167482X.2022.2097475","20220714","COVID-19 pandemic; Fertility treatment; coping; counselling; mental health; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34320,""
"COVID-19 and Mental Health Among People Who Are Forcibly Displaced: The Role of Socioeconomic Insecurity","Forcibly displaced persons may be at elevated risk for poor mental health outcomes because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study sought to examine associations between COVID-19-related socioeconomic insecurity and mental health outcomes among asylum seekers. The authors evaluated the association between the degree of food, housing, and income insecurity related to the pandemic and mental health outcomes among East African asylum seekers in a high-risk, postdisplacement setting in the Middle East (i.e., Israel). Anxiety symptom severity (p=0.03) as well as the rate of suicidal ideation among women (odds ratio [OR]=2.81, p=0.016) were significantly elevated in a community sample of asylum seekers during the COVID-19 pandemic (N=66) relative to a similar sample (N=158) from the same community and context assessed before the pandemic. No differences between the two groups were observed for severity or rate of probable depression or posttraumatic stress disorders. In addition, among the sample assessed during the pandemic, socioeconomic insecurity due to the pandemic was strongly associated with elevated symptom severity and probable anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorders as well as suicidal ideation (R<sup>2</sup> range=0.19-0.35; OR range=4.54-5.46). Findings are consistent with growing evidence of a mental health crisis among asylum seekers that is linked to COVID-19 control policies and residential status policies. The results highlight the risk for suicidal ideation linked to intersectional marginalization among female asylum seekers. These findings may inform postdisplacement policy making, social justice advocacy, humanitarian aid, and clinical science and practice to mitigate poor mental health outcomes associated with COVID-19 among forcibly displaced persons.","Blay Benzaken, Zohar, Yuval, Aizik-Reebs, Gebremariam, Bernstein","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202200052","20220714","Asylum seekers; COVID-19; Food insecurity; Forced displacement; Housing insecurity; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34321,""
"Out from the shadows: What health leaders should do to advance the mental health and substance use health workforce","The mental health and substance use health (MHSUH) impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are proving to be significant, complex, and long-lasting. The MHSUH workforce-including psychologists, social workers, psychotherapists, addiction counsellors, and peer support workers as well as psychiatrists, family physicians, and nurses-is the backbone of the response. As health leaders consider how to address long-standing and emerging health workforce challenges, there is an opportunity to move the MHSUH workforce out from the shadows through full inclusion in health workforce planning in Canada. After first examining the roots and consequences of the long-standing exclusion of the MHSUH workforce, this paper presents findings from a recent study showing how the pandemic has compounded MHSUH workforce capacity issues. Priorities for MHSUH workforce action by health leaders include closing regulation gaps, engaging the public and private sectors in coordinated planning, and accelerating data collection through a central health workforce registry.","Bartram, Leslie, Atanackovic, Tulk, Chamberland-Rowe, Bourgeault","https://doi.org/10.1177/08404704221112035","20220714","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34322,""
"Effects of Cell Phone Dependence on Mental Health Among College Students During the Pandemic of COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Survey of a Medical University in Shanghai","To investigate the effects of cell phone dependence (CPD) on mental health among undergraduates during the COVID-19 pandemic and further identify the determinants that may affect their mental health in China. The data were collected from 602 students at a medical school in Shanghai <i>via</i> an online survey conducted from December 2021 to February 2022. The Mobile Phone Addiction Index (MPAI) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) were applied to evaluate CPD and mental health, respectively. Independent sample <i>t</i>-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were employed to compare the means of continuous variables among categorical groups. Correlations between continuous variables were detected using Pearson's correlation analysis. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were employed to identify the determinants of mental health. Among the 402 eligible students, 73.88% were women with an average age of 20.19 Ã‚Â± 2.36 years. On average, the DASS score was 32.20 Ã‚Â± 11.07, the CPD score was 36.23 Ã‚Â± 11.89, and the cell phone use duration was 7.67 Ã‚Â± 3.61 h/day. CPD was found to have a negative effect on mental health among college students in Shanghai. Additionally, cell phone use duration, age, being senior students, faculty-student relationship, insomnia, tobacco use, obesity, and life satisfaction were clarified as contributing factors to mental health among college students. High degree of CPD could have a negative effect on college students' mental health, which might lead to some psychological problems. Appropriate actions and effective interventions are highly needed to prevent severe psychological injuries among college students in China.","Xu, Sun, Jiang, Chen, Yue, Dong","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.920899","20220714","China; cell phone dependence; college students; effect; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34323,""
"Reflecting on earlier affected areas that shaped COVID-19 mental health efforts","The COVID-19 pandemic is a serious public health threat that many countries in the world are facing. While several measures are being taken to minimize the spread of infection, mental health efforts must address psychological challenges due to the pandemic. This commentary reflects on original research from earlier epicenters of COVID-19 and identifies effective practices and suggestions applicable to mental health interventions in the North American context.

"Stress, Personality, Attachment, and Coping Strategies During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The STERACOVID Prospective Cohort Study Protocol","Due to the lockdown linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, the French National Authority for Health has recommended reinforced follow-up of psychiatric patients, with particular attention to people over 65 years. Cross-sectional studies reported an increased risk of anxiety, depression, and suicide during this period. Older people with psychiatric disorders are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 and worsening their psychiatric symptoms. The main objective is to evaluate the link between coping strategies and the onset of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after lockdown. The secondary objective is to assess the psychological factors influencing lockdown experiences such as personality, attachment type, or coping strategies. this is a multicenter cohort study including 117 patients followed up by phone in two French geriatric psychiatry units. Sociodemographic variables, psychiatric diagnoses, lockdown conditions, coping strategies, anxiety, and depressive symptoms reported during the first lockdown will be collected retrospectively from the medical file. A first prospective assessment including personality traits, attachment type, and traumatic life events will be conducted at 12 months (T1). Follow-up visits assessing anxious-depressive symptoms and PTSD will be made 18 (T2) and 24 months (T3) after the first lockdown. The primary outcome measure is PTSD symptoms. Secondary outcomes measures are coping strategies, generalized anxiety, anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic, and quality of life. This study aims to determine if the type of coping strategies usually employed have an impact on the onset of PTSD after a lockdown period. It will also determine if these coping strategies are influenced by other factors such as sociodemographic variables, lockdown conditions, particular personality traits, attachment type, and traumatic life events. This study could help identify factors associated with a poorer experience of lockdowns and pandemic crisis in elderly patients followed in a psychiatric center, and guide support in future similar situations.

"The Prevalence of Fear of Childbirth and Its Association With Intolerance of Uncertainty and Coping Styles Among Pregnant Chinese Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Fear of childbirth (FOC) is one of the most common psychological symptoms among pregnant women and significantly relates to cesarean section, anxiety, and depression. However, it is not clear the prevalence and risk factors of FOC among Chinese pregnant women since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to examine the associations between coping styles, intolerance of uncertainty, and FOC. From December 2021 to April 2022, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in two hospitals in China through convenient sampling. The cross-sectional survey was conducted among 969 pregnant women, which included the Childbirth Attitude Questionnaire (CAQ), Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12 (IUS-12), and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). The total prevalence of FOC was 67.8%. The percentages of women with mild (a score of 28-39), moderate (40-51), and severe FOC (52-64) were 43.6, 20.2, and 4.0%, respectively. The regression results indicated that primiparas, unplanned pregnancy, few spousal support, intolerance of uncertainty, and negative coping styles were significant risk factors of FOC. Women who adopt positive coping strategies experienced a lower level of childbirth fear. These findings suggest that cultivating positive coping styles and obtaining sufficient childbirth information may be helpful for mothers' mental health. Regular screening assessment of perinatal psychological symptoms, such as the high level of intolerance of uncertainty and negative coping styles, should be adopted to reduce the risk of fear of childbirth.","Han, Bai, Lun, Li, Wang, Ni","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.935760","20220714","COVID-19; childbirth fear; coping styles; intolerance of uncertainty; pregnant women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34326,""
"Global Myocardial Strain in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, Kawasaki Disease, and Healthy Children: A Network Meta-Analysis","Nearly 6,000 multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) have been reported in the United States by November 2021. Left ventricular global myocardial strain has been proved to be one of the best evidence of the diagnostic and prognostic implications for cardiac dysfunction. The global myocardial strain change of MIS-C in the acute phase was still unclear. PubMed and other sources were searched. A network meta-analysis was conducted. MIS-C was divided into two groups according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): MIS-C with depressed ejection fraction (MIS-C dEF) and MIS-C with preserved ejection fraction (MIS-C pEF). Global longitudinal strain (GLS) and global circumferential strain (GCS) were compared among MIS-C, Kawasaki disease (KD), and healthy children. In total, nine case-control studies were included, published between 2014 and 2021. These studies involved 107 patients with MIS-C, 188 patients with KD, and 356 healthy children. After Bayesian analysis, MIS-C dEF group was found to have a lower LVEF, higher GLS and GCS than the KD groups. Both MIS-C pEF and KD had similar GLS and GCS, which were higher than healthy controls. There was no difference of LVEF among MIS-C pEF, KD, and healthy controls. MIS-C dEF was more severe than KD, both in LVEF and global myocardial strain. MIS-C pEF and KD were similar with mild impaired left ventricular myocardial strain compared with the healthy children. Global myocardial strain may be a monitoring index for MIS-C.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Healthcare Resource Utilization in Individuals with Major Depressive Disorder","To estimate the impact COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) among individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). A retrospective cohort study was conducted to compare HCRU in the twelve months prior to and six months following pandemic onset among 1,318,709 individuals with MDD and propensity-score matched controls. Outcomes were monthly rates of all-cause and MDD-specific outpatient, inpatient, and prescription medication HCRU. Piecewise random effects models were used to adjust for patient-level clustering, trends over time, and pre-pandemic factors. In the first month following onset, outpatient HCRU declined with primary care visits down 25.1%. Following this initial decline, outpatient HCRU increased, exceeding pre-pandemic rates within three months. By April 2020, three quarters of all psychotherapy sessions were delivered by telehealth, followed by psychiatry (62.3%), and primary care visits (30.1%). The use of telehealth remained highest for psychotherapy and psychiatry (representing 67.6% and 54.2% of visits, respectively, in September 2020). All-cause partial-day hospitalizations declined 50.5% and remained depressed through July 2020 (down 18.3%). Beginning in the first month post-onset, prescription medication HCRU increased for all antidepressant and antipsychotic medication classes: serotonin modulators (Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.8%), bupropion (Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.4%), SSRIs (Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.0%), SNRIs (Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.6%), and atypical antipsychotics (Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.5%). Following pandemic onset, individuals with MDD realized an immediate, but short-lived, reduction in primary care HCRU. Telehealth use remained elevated through the first six months. The most significant and sustained reduction in HCRU was noted for partial-day hospitalizations and all-cause ED visits.","Liberman, Bhattacharjee, Rui, Ruetsch, Rothman, Kulkarni, Forma","https://doi.org/10.1177/23333928221111864","20220714","COVID-19; access to care; major depressive disorder; medications; primary care; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34328,""
"The Perceived Impact of COVID-19 on Functional Activities Among Canadian Education Workers: A Cross-Sectional Study","This cross-sectional study examined the self-perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 2,378 education workers in Ontario, Canada, during the second wave. We examined six domains of functioning as per the short version of the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule-2.0. Participants selected if their functioning had improved, remained unchanged or worsened during the pandemic for each item. Educational workers described a general worsening of functional activities since the beginning of the pandemic. Moderate-to-extreme challenges were reported for all six functional domains. These challenges appeared to aggravate functional challenges for workers with disability, as indicated by pre-existing work accommodations. Older participants reported worse mobility than younger participants; however, they appeared to have better coping skills in learning new tasks and maintaining friendships. Women were more likely to report difficulties in maintaining household responsibilities. We consider the role of mental health challenges and pre-existing inequality as predictors of pandemic-related difficulties. Recommendations include more longitudinal research in this population and policymakers to incorporate a health promotion lens to support their education workers more proactively.","Serrano, Nowrouzi-Kia, Oddson, Bishai, Casole, Gohar","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.879141","20220714","COVID-19; cross-sectional; education workers; functional activities; perceived impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34329,""

"Hospital Outdoor Spaces as Respite Areas for Healthcare Staff During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has created considerable implications for healthcare staff around the globe. During the pandemic, the frontline healthcare workers experience intense anxiety, stress, burnout, and psychological breakdown, with severe implications on their mental and physical well-being. In addition to these implications, anxiety and stress can hinder their productivity and ability to perform their duties efficiently. The literature indicates that hospital gardens and contact with nature can help alleviate psychological distress among hospital staff. However, few studies investigated the role of outdoor spaces as areas for respite and work breaks in healthcare facilities during the pandemic. The present opinion paper highlights the challenges of job stress and psychological distress health workers face during the pandemic. This article also underscores the role of hospital outdoor spaces and garden facilities in coping with the challenges. While other measures to reduce stress among hospital staff and ensure their health and safety are important, hospital administrators and relevant government agencies should also emphasize the provision of gardens and open spaces in healthcare facilities. These spaces can act as potential areas for respite for hospital staff to help them cope with the stress and anxiety accumulated through working under crises.","Iqbal, Abubakar","https://doi.org/10.1177/19375867221111530","20220714","COVID-19; access to nature; gardens; healing gardens; healthcare workers; hospital outdoor spaces; landscape planning; mental health; staff safety; stress and burnout","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34331,""
"Household Financial Hardship Factors Are Strongly Associated with Poorer Latino Mental Health During COVID-19","Latinos have suffered disproportionate adversity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many studies have focused on comparing Latinos to other groups, potentially masking critical concerns within population. This study identifies potential pathways to poor mental health among Latinos during the pandemic. Data from US Census Household Pulse Survey, covering April 23, 2020, to October 11, 2021, were analyzed. Ordinal logistic regression evaluated categorical frequencies of problems with anxiety, loss of interest, worry, and feeling down. Findings were stratified by gender, poverty status, metropolitan location, and work. Demographic, household, financial, and work covariates were mutually adjusted, and jackknife replications and population weights applied. Adverse mental health was common, with higher frequencies of 2 or more adverse mental health symptoms for at least several days in the prior 2Ã‚Â weeks (59.1-76.3%, depending on stratified group). Food insufficiency was strongly associated with adverse mental health symptoms across all characteristics. Odds ratios of often not having enough to eat compared to enough of foods wanted being associated with adverse mental health ranged from 2.6 to 6.56 (depending on stratified group). Difficulty with expenses was also strongly associated with adverse mental health across characteristics, with odds ratios very difficult compared to not at all ranging from 2.7 to 7.7 (depending on stratified group). These observations suggest household financial hardship factors influence mental health regardless of other personal characteristics, and this could inform services for Latinos. Targeted programs to ensure food sufficiency and income may be necessary to improve mental health in US Latinos.","Cleaveland, Frankenfeld","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-022-01366-8","20220713","COVID-19; Latino health; Latino mental health; LatinoÃ‚Â COVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34332,""
"A Tale of Two Cities During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evaluating Food Insecurity in Chicago and New York City","COVID-19 revealed and broadened existing disparities in large cities. This article interprets the early impacts of COVID-19 on food insecurity (FI) in the Chicago and New York City (NYC) metropolitan areas for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) and provides a study using a Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) framework. A cross-sectional survey adapted from the National Food Access and COVID Research Team (NFACT) was deployed in Chicago (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°680) and in NYC (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°525) during summer 2020 and oversampled for race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Multivariate binary logistic regression generated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% CIs for FI and select SDOH variables, which was conducted on each dataset. The prevalence of FI in NYC increased to 66.8% (from 57.8%) and in Chicago to 44.8% (from 41.0%). While higher income protected against FI before, protection was diminished or eliminated since COVID-19. FI declined for households with children in NYC while odds increased and became significant in Chicago. Respondents with chronic health conditions experienced increased odds of FI since COVID. In Chicago, this variable had the highest odds of FI. Respondents with depression or anxiety had increased odds of FI. In NYC, depression had the highest odds of FI. Females in NYC were protected against FI. Hispanics in NYC lost protection against FI from before to since COVID-19. Results support the observed rise of FI for BIPOC and its association with health status. The analysis has multifaceted, structural policy implications for reducing FI in urban centers.","Mazzeo, Al Abdeen Qusair, Gadhoke, Freiberg, Brenton, Sedlacek, Torres","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-022-01355-x","20220713","COVID-19; Chicago; Food insecurity; New York City; Racial/ethnic disparities; Social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-15","",34333,""

"Clinical and Laboratory Differences between Delta and UK Variants of SARS-CoV-2: B16172 and B117","At the end of 2019, the world met with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which will affect all humanity. Later in the course, the genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged, bringing new questions and concerns. This study investigated differences between patients infected with the B.1.1.7 (UK variant) and the B.1.617.2 (Delta variant) regarding patient complaints, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and stay time, intubation, severe disease, mortality rates, and laboratory parameters. Hospitalized 205 patients infected with B.1.1.7 and 207 patients infected with B.1.617.2 were included in the study. Laboratory parameters, admission complaints, and the percent saturation of oxygen in the blood (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded on the same day as the diagnosis and clinical findings during their follow-up. Cough and fever were more common complaints in the B.1.1.7 infected group, whereas tiredness, joint pain, and gastrointestinal complaints were more frequent in patients infected with B.1.617.2.
