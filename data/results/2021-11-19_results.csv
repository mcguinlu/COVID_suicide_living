"Digitally Connecting Consumers Mental Health and Behavior amid Pandemic","The covid-19 pandemic is likely to have a profound impact on mental health globally. This paper aims to explore the psychological perspectives that have affected consumer behavior during the life-changing social environment as a framework in consumer mental health research. The paper offers a history of consumer behavioral health studies and applications in the field of marketing, as well as an introduction to the theoretical and empirical framework for the study of consumer behavior in later life concerning consumption-related problems throughout life. A sample of 254 millennial consumers is used to test hypothesized relationships derived from the life course perspectives. The approach to the life course, designed to analyze the various facets of consumer behavior, offers a basis for filling holes in prior analysis to study consumer behavior over time. The author introduces a life-course concept that offers an insight applicable to the life-course paradigm of consumer behavior research. In the present context, it has already increased feelings of stress, peers, economic status has given rise to a range of digital and other interventions to help people cope with the â€œnew normalâ€, the researchers need to illustrate how the life course approach might innovatively contribute to existing studies Â© Review Of International Geographical Education","Vijay, J.; Kumar, I.

"Coronavirus anxiety, fear of COVID-19, hope and resilience in healthcare workers: A moderated mediation model study","BACKGROUND In the era of the global health crisis, mental health and well-being of people have been severely affected because of experiencing high levels of anxiety, stress, fear, and uncertainty related to COVID-19. This study investigated a moderated mediation model in which resilience mediated the link between coronavirus anxiety and fear of COVID-19, and this mediation effect was moderated by hope. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE A cross-sectional study was conducted on 168 healthcare workers (Mage = 29.19 Â± 6.13 years and 63.1% women) working at a state hospital in the eastern part of Turkey. They completed measures of coronavirus anxiety, fear of COVID-19, resilience, and hope during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS The results indicated that resilience mediated the relationship between coronavirus anxiety and fear of COVID-19. Hope moderated the mediating path from coronavirus anxiety to resilience. Coronavirus anxiety had a stronger effect on resilience under the moderate and high levels of hope condition, compared to the low level of hope condition. CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that resilience is an important mechanism explaining how coronavirus anxiety is associated with fear of COVID-19 and that this relation may depend on the levels of hope. Future prevention and intervention programs should focus on increasing hope and resilience when addressing mental health problems in the face of adversity.

"Impact of Covid pandemic and working strategies on private practitioners","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is badly affecting more than 2 million population of 213 countries and has caused 1,952,976 deaths till January 12, 2020. India has also suffered a great loss in terms of economy and people. Furthermore, owing to the complete lockdown enforced in India, restricting humanitarian movement also affected day-to-day life of Indians with a huge impact. Objectives: The present clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on private practitioners. Furthermore, changes in their practice pattern were evaluated along with the perspective of their health, role, and response to the pandemic. Materials and Methods: The study includes a total of 120 health-care professionals of either gender. The stress and mental health of the participants was assessed using Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 in English format, also included the questions related to the demographic characteristics, use of technologies for providing virtual health care, changes in the working during the pandemic, and an opinion of their experiences during that period. The data collected were subjected to the analysis and were kept confidential and anonymous. Results: 16.6% of participants preferred virtual consultation before the pandemic in contrast to 83.3% during the pandemic. The most preferred method remained the phone call by 15.8% (n = 19) patients. Depression was seen severely in 35% of study participants (n = 42) and 13.3% of participants extremely severe depression was seen (n = 16). Severe and extremely severe anxiety was noticed in 31.66% (=38) and 15% (18) study participants respectively, whereas severe and extremely severe stress was found in 30% (n = 36), and 12.5% (n = 15) private practitioners. The most common factor that can be considered responsible for compromised mental health in private practitioners was the possibility of infecting the society seen in 59.1% (n = 71) participants. Conclusion: During the pandemic breakout, private practitioners suffered a great challenge both financially and mentally, especially during the lockdown. Furthermore, a significant increase was seen in the virtual consultation methods during the pandemic breakout.","Yadav, Ravi, Singh, Pinky, Askari, Mehdi, Sinha, Sonal, Kumar, Saurav, Mehta, Vini","https://doi.org/10.4103/jpbs.jpbs_231_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences; 13(6):1414-1417, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences; 13(6):1414-1417, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22175,""
"Perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthodontic practice in the Middle East","Background: With COVID-19 announced as a global pandemic, a countrywide lockdown was executed in many countries, including the Middle East. With no foregoing warning or expectation, orthodontic treatments were temporarily canceled as dental clinics and colleges were indefinitely closed. To the best of our knowledge, no study addresses the orthodontist perspective in such testing times, where they are entirely restricted to the confines of their homes. The study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19-related lockdown on orthodontists and orthodontic postgraduate students' treatment and psychology. Materials and Methods: The survey participants consist of 315 orthodontists and orthodontic postgraduate residents from different Middle East countries. A pretested self-administered questionnaire was sent to the consenting participants through an online data collection platform (Google forms), covering participants' sociodemographics and participants' perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A majority of the participants (87.61%) stated that the pandemic would permanently change their way of practicing orthodontics and also will lead to the reduction in the number of orthodontic patients in the future (78.73%), and a significant number of orthodontists (67.61%) has an opinion that the pandemic will not affect the viability of their profession. The majority of the respondents (88.57%) commented about the negative economic impact of COVID-19 on their income, and regarding the effect of COVID-19 on psychosocial well-being, 73.01% had experienced anxiety and depression, 88.25% were excited about the future of the profession, and 68.57% enjoyed the life with their family due to lockdown, and when asked about their social life with the family and friends, majority of the participants (66.34%) had an opinion that it has improved due to the increased free time.

Teams play a key role in todayâ€™s knowledge-based organization for overcoming challenges in our dynamic world. Drawing on social information processing theory, this study explores the effect of membersâ€™ humility and team environment within a leaderless team mainly based on virtual platforms. Their impacts on shared leadership, relationship conflict and team and individual performance were investigated. Surveying 219 students forming 61 virtual leaderless teams, our findings showed that a high level of humility and a positive team environment can help to improve shared leadership within a team, which contributes to team performance. Moreover, both humility and team environment have a negative relationship with relationship conflict, which depressed both team and individual performance. Our analysis also indicated that humility positively interacts with team environment on shared leadership.","Wu, C.; Tang, Valerie, Cho, Vincent, Roll, Lara","https://doi.org/10.4018/JGIM.290831","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Global Information Management; 30(4):1-23, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Global Information Management; 30(4):1-23, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22177,""
"The Influence of COVID-19 on Irrational Consumption Behavior in a Chinese Sample: Based on a Serial Mediating Model","Based on the scarcity theory, this study focuses on exploring the relationship between the severity of public health emergencies (i.e., COVID-19) and individual irrational consumer behaviors through the serial mediating variables of perceived scarcity (PS) and negative mentality (NM). An online questionnaire was used to collect data from participants in China and we obtained 466 effective (115 male and 351 female) questionnaires in total. The findings showed that the relationship between each pair of factors - perceived pandemic severity, PS, NM, and irrational consumption behaviors - was significantly positive. Although the perception of the severity of this public health emergency did not directly predict irrational consumer behavior, the effect was mediated by PS and NM independently and serially. These findings reveal that people who strongly perceive scarcity and are prone to negative attitudes are more likely to demonstrate irrational consumer behaviors (such as rushing to buy and hoard living supplies) once the public perceives a public health emergency as severe. This effect occurs because the PS that results from the epidemic affects people's cognition, emotion, and behavior.","Yue-Qian, H.; Piao, X.; Ying, W.; Zhi-Xin, H.; Yi-Ting, W.; Hai-Long, S.","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.718797","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Frontiers in Psychology; 12:718797, 2021.; Publication details: Frontiers in Psychology; 12:718797, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22178,""

"Assessing Individual Differences in Coping Mechanisms during the COVID-19 Pandemic","As the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a global public health emergency, many individuals are facing mental health issues due to the many challenges that accompany this pandemic. Previous studies report that many people around the world are experiencing high levels of stress and therefore struggling to manage their emotions and mental well-being. While there are numerous different factors that influence how an individual may be dealing with the pandemic related stressors, one factor that does seem to influence their stress level is their coping mechanisms. In this study, we aim to understand people's perceived stress level during the COVID-19 pandemic, their coping mechanisms, and whether these constructs were influenced by their personality and other individual differences. To investigate these questions, we conducted an online survey in the summer of 2020 where study participants were asked to report on their mental well-being. Study results obtained from statistical models, including Pearson Correlation Test, Regression models, and Random Forest model, show that there is a significant difference between individuals' stress level and their coping mechanisms. In addition, we found that individuals' personality traits seem to influence their stress level as well as what type of coping mechanism they may be using during the pandemic. These findings can provide awareness to individuals as well as for public and mental health professionals who may be working or providing support to different populations during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The Capabilities and Future Use of Facial Recognition Software on the Raspberry Pi - Exploratory System for Adolescent Mental Health Screening","This research project was conducted with the goal of creating an automatic facial detection and recognition system to be used in various areas, such as healthcare and security. By using the Raspberry Pi device and the OpenVINO toolkit, a facial recognition virtual environment was created, and programs such as the Human Pose Estimation Model and the Interactive Face Detection Demo were tested. Originally, the plan to test the Raspberry Pi and its capabilities was to collect images of initial random subjects for the device to learn, and have the subjects stand in front of the device to see if the connected camera could correctly identify them. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an extremely limited number of subjects available. Therefore, images of the members of the 13-member K-Pop group Seventeen were used, as there is a wide variety of content accessible through Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. Furthermore, members go through a large number of changes in hair color and hairstyle, and therefore a variety of images could be used to fully test the accuracy of the device. In order to test the Raspberry Pi, 6-8 different images of each member were shown to the device camera to be identified. Of these images, 4-5 had been entered into the device's image database, while 2-3 were unfamiliar. Of the 100 total pictures, 77 (77%) were recognized as having an identifiable face, while 23 (23%) had faces not recognized by the Raspberry Pi. Of the 77 images that the Raspberry Pi recognized to have a face, 24 (31.17%) were identified correctly, 52 (67.53%) were identified incorrectly, and 1 (1.3%) was identified as unknown. Though the device was largely inaccurate, it was determined that modifications involving the sensitivity in which the camera measures and detects facial features will improve the accuracy of the device. Through the experimentation process, the idea for utilizing the technology to detect symptoms of stress and anxiety in teenagers was created, and a method for integrating the device into the daily lives of people as a self-care reminder system was formed.

"Training and the future delivery of UK paediatric surgery in the NHS","A specialty service where this is already well practised is paediatric cardiac surgery and studies clearly show improvement in outcome metrics with a higher volume of complex index cases.3 Similarly, concentration of care of infants with biliary atresia and bladder exstrophy has led to marked noteworthy improvements in overall outcomes.45 While the effects of â€œsuper centralisationâ€ on patient clinical outcomes appears perhaps self evident, the â€œknock onâ€ effects on paediatric surgery specialty training are likely to be very significant. The first option, cited within the GIRFT report, follows ideologically and thematically the American surgical training model where a five year general surgery residency is undertaken with licence accreditation and then later competitive nationwide entry into a two year paediatric surgery fellowship programme.7 This system resourcefully promotes â€œthe pathway in surgical trainingâ€ as it crucially allows the resident to grow operative skills in general surgery with a likely higher volume of minimally invasive surgery index case numbers and gives opportunities to learn â€œcutting edgeâ€ innovative techniques rarely deployed in paediatric surgery (e.g. robotic surgery). Consultation and active dialogue with the surgical Royal Colleges, UK Paediatric Surgical Consultant Workforce, British Association of Paediatric Surgeons (BAPS), allied professional health care organisations, parents, patients, carers and the trainees themselves is key assurance that the new generation of consultant paediatric surgeons will provide the high quality care required for children and families whom they will faithfully serve in the future.9 Conflicting interests: PDL served as a Training Programme Director for Paediatric Surgery and a STEC Chair in the Liverpool-Manchester North West England Consortium.","Harwood, Rachel, Losty, Paul D.","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n2785","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: BMJ : British Medical Journal (Online); 375, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ : British Medical Journal (Online); 375, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22182,""
"A Novel Method for Multivariant Pneumonia Classification based on Hybrid CNN-PCA Based Feature Extraction using Extreme Learning Machine with Chest X-Ray Images","In this era of COVID19, proper diagnosis and treatment for pneumonia are very important. Chest X-Ray (CXR) image analysis plays a vital role in the reliable diagnosis of pneumonia. An experienced radiologist is required for this. However, even for an experienced radiographer, it is quite difficult and time-consuming to diagnose due to the fuzziness of CXR images. Also, identification can be erroneous due to the involvement of human judgment. Hence, an authentic and automated system can play an important role here. In this era of cutting-edge technology, deep learning (DL) is highly used in every sector. There are several existing methods to diagnose pneumonia but they have accuracy problems. In this study, an automatic pneumonia detection system has been proposed by applying the extreme learning machine (ELM) on the Kaggle CXR images (Pneumonia). Three models have been studied: classification using extreme learning machine (ELM), ELM with a hybrid convolutional neural network - principle component analysis (CNN-PCA) based feature extraction (ECP), and ECP with the CXR images which are contrast-enhanced by contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). Among these three proposed methods, the final model provides an optimistic result. It achieves the recall score of 98% and accuracy score of 98.32% for multiclass pneumonia classification. On the other hand, a binary classification achieves 100% recall and 99.83% accuracy. The proposed method also outperforms the existing methods. The outcome has been compared using several benchmarks that include accuracy, precision, recall, etc. Author","Nahiduzzaman, M.; Goni, M. O. F.; Anower, M. S.; Islam, M.

"Editorial - A crisis in social care: time for rethinking?","The post Brexit â€œpoints basedâ€ immigration system does not list â€œcare workerâ€ as an eligible occupation on the â€œskilled workerâ€ route;therefore, from January 2021, care workers cannot immigrate to take up these roles, and the pay for such workers falls well below the necessary salary threshold [1]. Relatively less attention has been paid to the crisis in support provided to older people in their own homes and to younger people with physical health conditions and impairments and learning disabilities, and relatively no attention has been paid to the social care needs of people with mental health challenges. (Wall, 2021, p. 2) The 2014 Care Act [4] imposes on local authorities a duty to promote an individualâ€™s well-being, where well-being is defined in terms of nine principles [5]: personal dignity (including treatment of the individual with respect);physical and mental health and emotional well-being;protection from abuse and neglect;control by the individual over day-to-day life (including over care and support provided to the individual and the way in which it is provided);participation in work, education, training or recreation;social and economic well-being;domestic, family and personal relationships;suitability of living accommodation;and the individualâ€™s contribution to society. (Crowther, 2019, p. 56) This vision very much resonates with recovery-focused transformation in the mental health sphere: a focus on the person in the context of their life and community where treatment and support are seen not as an end in themselves but as a means to enable people to live the lives they want to lead (see, Repper and Perkins, 2003, 2012).","Perkins, Rachel, Repper, Julie","https://doi.org/10.1108/MHSI-11-2021-096","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Mental Health and Social Inclusion; 25(4):321-325, 2021.; Publication details: Mental Health and Social Inclusion; 25(4):321-325, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22184,""
"EU-PEARL: Changing the paradigm of clinical trials in Europe","Issue Recently, innovative clinical trial designs have been proposed, which have the potential to revolutionize clinical research. Whereas classical trials mostly evaluate only one investigational drug, platform trials embed various trials under a shared master protocol to enable the evaluation of multiple interventions for a disease or condition. Platform trials have mostly been used to evaluate cancer therapies, but also recently for COVID-19. The EU Patient-cEntric clinicAl tRial pLatforms (EU-PEARL) project aims to expand the use of platform trials as the backbone of drug development. Description of Issue EU-PEARL is a Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking funded project (2019-2023), and a strategic public and private sector alliance, which aims to support the transformation of the classical trial approach into a cross-company collaborative, multi-compound platform, centred around patients, not diseases. How to operationalize and sustain this? A multi-stakeholder, mixed-methods approach is taken, focused around the concept of an integrated research platform (IRP), i.e., a common enabling framework for platform trials. The IRP will be established as a sustainable and scalable global solution, consisting of an infrastructure, workflows, and guidance on how to meet complex regulatory, ethical, legal, statistical and data requirements. Lessons from COVID-19 trials will be incorporated. Results A disease-agnostic IRP is being developed, as well as four disease specific IRPs in four areas of high public health relevance, i.e. major depressive disorder, tuberculosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and neurofibromatosis. Lessons Multi-stakeholder, multi-sector and multi-disciplinary collaborations are challenging in practice, but rewarding in outcomes. Given the complexity of setting-up these novel trials, clear communication and standardized terminology must be established, as well as continual awareness building of their components, challenges and benefits. Key messages EU-PEARL intends to stage the clinical trials of the future, which will be more adaptive, efficient and patient-centred by design and outcome.

"Organization of mental health services to face COVID-19 in Brazil","Issue/problem Covid-19 pandemic requires rapid responses. The reconfiguration of the psychosocial care network was needed to ensure access to all patients during this period. Description of the problem Psychosocial Care Centers (PCC) are strategic equipment for strengthening the mental health policy in Brazil. These services work with a multi and interdisciplinary team, aiming to assist crisis and rehabilitation processes of people with severe and persistent mental disorders or those with impairments due to the use of psychoactive substances. This work shares the experience of two PCC over the COVID-19 pandemic in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. In April 2020, in front of the increasing Covid-19 cases and hospitalization, lack of hospital beds for mental health care, suspension of PCC group activities, and restriction of face-to-face assistance, it was necessary to adjust the PCC work process and physical structure. Results Telemedicine was implemented to assure assistance and monitoring. An internal flow was implemented to identify and assess patients seeking the service with respiratory symptoms and proceed with case notification if confirmed. A station for respiratory symptoms screening was settled outside the PCC, an isolation room to symptomatic respiratory patients was defined to medical assessment, and referral criteria to the emergency care established. To reinforce beds for hospitals in the region, inpatient beds were created in the PCC to attend hospitalization of acute crisis cases. Further, professionals from Primary Health Care were relocated and trained to support PCC assistance. Lessons This experience reaffirms the role of PCC as an articulator of the psychosocial network. Reorganization of PCC work process enabled the continuity of mental health outpatient care as well as rearguard from inpatient beds.

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare leaders in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy","Introduction The current pandemic scenario may cause psychological distress among healthcare workers (HCWs). Although several studies highlighted this issue as particularly affecting frontline HCWs, no data are available regarding professionals dealing with the governance of healthcare organizations. This study aims to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare leaders (HeLs). Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out between October and November 2020, among HeLs working within Friuli-Venezia Giulia healthcare system (Italy). HeLs included: heads of surgical or medical department, deans of hospital, heads of doctors and nurses working at regional level or in hospital/community settings. We collected demographic data and assessed the presence of depressive (DS) and anxiety symptoms (AS), perceived stress (PS) and insomnia using internationally validated tools. Relationship between mental health outcomes and professional role was analysed using nonparametric tests. Results A total of 48 HeLs participated;their mean age was 53.4Â±7.9, women were 56.3%. Most (45.8%) were heads of department, 16.7% deans of hospital, 8.3% heads of doctors, 29.2% heads of nurses. The majority (60.4%) worked in hospital setting, 22.9% in the community and 16.7% at regional level. The prevalence of DS and AS was 14.6% and 12.5%, respectively. Moderate insomnia was found in 12.5% of HeLs, while severe insomnia in 6.3% of them. The 45.8% of HeLs showed moderate level of stress, whereas 4.2% high level. PS was significantly higher among deans of hospital. Moreover, lower PS correlated with lower DS, AS and insomnia (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions The high level of perceived stress, insomnia, depressive and anxious symptoms experienced by HeLs shows another issue of the COVID-19 pandemic psychological impact. Considered the key role of HeLs in leading healthcare organizations over the current crisis, mental health of these professionals is a major issue that needs higher attention. Key messages Psychological impact of COVID19 not only affects frontline HCWs, but also the professionals who are leading healthcare organization through the crisis. Promotion of mental well-being among HCWs should be improved at all levels of healthcare organizations, ensuring a healthier workplace for all professionals working for public health.","Scarpis, E.; Bravo, G.; Cocconi, R.; Brunelli, L.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab165.600","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22187,""
"Mental Health in times of COVID-19: Policy Brief","Issue The COVID-19 pandemic caused profound disruptive changes worldwide. Mental health (MH) and wellbeing (WB) have been particularly affected, namely with increased levels of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and burnout symptoms. Several factors can have contributed to individuals' vulnerability, including perceived uncertainty, the strict measures adopted, the socioeconomic hardship and the direct effects of the virus. Although the pandemic is primarily a public health and a socioeconomic crisis, it could turn into a serious MH crisis with all the associated implications. Description As a Health Observatory, National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge, in collaboration with Institute of Environmental Health of Lisbon School of Medicine, and Portuguese Society of Psychiatry and Mental Health, coordinated an observational study to characterize the MH and WB of general population and health professionals residing in Portugal, during pandemic's first wave. Anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, burnout and resilience were selected as main outcomes, measured using validated instruments with sound psychometric properties. Results High levels of psychological distress were observed among general population and health professionals. Women, younger, individuals with lower income or unemployed, lower educational level and frontline health professionals were most susceptible to psychological suffering. The research team produced a Policy Brief with a set of 14 recommendations for immediate action to ensure equal access to psychological and emotional support for all citizens, to reduce the impact of mental disorders and to promote MH. Lessons The mitigation of psychological suffering is of paramount importance, from an equitable perspective focus on identified vulnerable sub-groups. Particular attention should also be given to citizens infected with SARS-CoV-2 and patients with COVID-19, who faced direct consequences of the disease. Key messages In a pandemic context, monitorization of populationâ€™s mental health is of paramount importance. Health Observatories should have an active and reinforced role in this public health area to mitigate potential negative impacts of pandemics.","Almeida, T.; Heitor, M.

"Presence of resistance in building resilience of Health workforce in the COVID-19 crisis","In the extraordinary circumstances of the Covid pandemic, Group Analytic Society Belgrade (DGAB) devised and organized online support groups for health workers, health associates and student volunteers. Participation is devised to be voluntary, while respecting confidentiality and non-disclosure of content outside the group. Support groups for health workers aim to share experiences, feelings and mutual support that they invest in daily work. We assume that the groups as a space of integration understanding and common thinking, could impact the building of resilience of health workers in the given conditions of a pandemic crisis. Groups are organized two times a week - 1 h and 15' each. One may apply by filling out an online form, and choosing one of the offered dates, that provides access to the group once a week. Group leaders are experienced analysts, DGAB members and analysts in their final years of education. In the initial phase, they are open - it is enough to choose a day that suits the participant when filling out the application, and in the selected term to join via the link for the zoom meeting (the link is sent to the e-mail given in the application). The aim is to present challenges we encountered in forming the groups, from strong resistance in accepting the help offered, negating the need for support to the helplessness and hopelessness that any help is possible. Exploring ways to overcome noticed resistance and presenting experience in providing support to health professionals is vital to strengthen the capacity of human resources and health systems in general. The pandemic crisis has not only affected the conditions and needs of patients, but has created a need for complex approach and care for health workers (human resources), so health systems could achieve sustainability and overcome the crisis that has befallen them. Key messages The pandemic crisis has not only affected the conditions and needs of patients, but has created a need for complex approach and care for health professionals. Management of healthcare organizations should ensure to all health professionals support to overcome the crisis that has befallen them.","Jevtic, M.; Strizovic, M.

"When policy and opportunity meet: Barcelona's first gender responsive shelter for homeless drug users","Issue/problem Drug policies in Barcelona have been guided by the Barcelona City Drug Action Plan (PADB). This four-year plan aims to prioritise and evaluate drug policies. The need to have a low-threshold residential resource for homeless people using drugs (HPWUD) is an objective that had been present in successive plans, but unfortunately could not be realised so far. In Spain, the covid-19 pandemic led to a total country lockdown. A great intersectoral coordination effort involving Barcelona City Council and the Public Health Agency of Barcelona together with third sector organisations resulted in the opening of the first gender responsive low-threshold residential resource for HPWUD in Barcelona. Description of the problem Pending a broader evaluation, quantitative indicators are available for 6 months (3 April to 3 October 2021), informing about: How many people were accommodated? What are their profiles? What drugs do they use? How many overdoses were reverted? How many successful discharges? How many people confined/isolated due to covid-19? What are the challenges? Results Preliminary results showed that during first 6 months, 120 people (74 men, 42 women and 4 non-binary) were accommodated. All places reserved for women were covered. About 44% were Spaniards;being opioids and alcohol, the main used in the HPWUD. Thirty overdoses reverted (60% due to stimulants). There were 39 people confined and 2 residents isolated due to covid-19. The challenges are to continue to improve the new alcohol harm reduction program, work on adherence and mainstreaming gender. Lessons Barcelona PADB is instrumental to guide evidence-based interventions to reduce health and social inequalities in highly vulnerable and underserved population. This new gender-responsive residential setting for HPWUD with a comprehensive harm reduction program together with health and social care is unique in Barcelona.

"Wellbeing and anxiety among students during COVID-19 crisis: results from an initial survey in Israel","Background The COVID-19 crisis that has burdened the world for the past year posed a life threat and caused psychological implications for public well-being. Well-being is an essential element of mental health that affects learning and productivity. Students are vulnerable to suffering from low well-being and developing mental problems caused by various stressors such as the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis. In addition, the spread of the epidemic, quarantine requirements, and the delayed academic year have had significant psychological impacts on students. The purpose of the study was to evaluate anxiety and well-being among college students at the end of the first year of the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods On January 2021, during the third lockdown in Israel, 366 college students responded to an online survey that included demographics, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and a 14-item Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) measuring emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Results Findings revealed low self-rated well-being compared to the general population. The mean anxiety level was 8.89. 39% showed moderate to severe anxiety. Negative correlations were found between anxiety and well-being. Women expressed low levels of well-being and higher anxiety compared to men. A regression model showed that students living with parents diagnosed with Covid-19 and having low emotional well-being are at risk of suffering from anxiety (R2=0.32, F = 53, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions The mental health of college students is significantly affected by the pandemic, therefore should be monitored and requires attention: Further investigation of factors influencing mental health and well-being of students. Detecting students with a higher risk of developing mental health problems and providing timely psychological support. Develop initiatives to raise awareness among students and interventions to prevent negative implications of the COVID-19 crisis on mental health.

"Community nursesâ€™ roles in hoarding prevention and management: literature review","Background COVID-19's high infectivity and fatality rates have generated a plethora of mental health problems worldwide. Hoarders accumulate products such as masks and daily necessities due to anxiety and restrictions on going out, which further exacerbate their symptoms. Since community nurses often visit patients' homes, they can identify hoarding symptoms in the early stages and provide support. Community nurses' knowledge pertaining to the prevention and management of hoarding can provide insight for mental health professionals. Methods The terms â€˜hoarding', â€˜prevention', and â€˜public health nurse/community nurse/home nurse' were searched on PubMed, ProQuest, Science Direct, CINAHL, Medline Complete, and six Japanese databases (Ichushi Web, NDLonline, CiNii, J-stage, J-DreamIII, Saishin-kango-sakuin web) in April 2021. Results I selected 13 articles on community nurses' roles from the abstracts of 302 academic articles identified by the search results. The articles were categorised based on research objectives, research methods, and community nurses' roles. It was suggested that prevention requires supporting mothers, who are at risk for hoarding. Research on measures to prevent hoarding behaviour from becoming severe found that family-based interventions (harm reduction approach), education programs for collaborators, and group reminiscence therapy for elderly individuals with dementia are effective. It was also suggested that cooperation and hoarding education among non-medical providers are important. Conclusions Community nurses' roles in treating hoarding should be based on support and health education through cooperative relationships with families, neighbours, and establishment of related organisations. Key messages In the COVID-19 pandemic and aftermath, it is important to learn various practical activities for mental health. Community nurses may be able to help prevent hoarding behaviour to reduce psychological stress among hoarders, their families, and neighbours, thus prevent further hoarding deterioration.","Aso, Y.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab165.585","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22192,""
"Mental health needs assessment in the time of covid-19 pandemic: the Delphi study based consensus","Backgrounds The COVID-19 pandemic affected mental health of population around the world. To be able to address mental health field effectively evidence based solutions through needs assessment with inclusion of all stakeholders - politicians, service providers, users and caregivers is needed. Methods The first group of priority activities was listed within two professional groups. Additional 129 participants of all stakeholder groups were invited to participate in the Delphi study consequently. After the first round activities were meaningfully formed into set of activities. In the second round, participants rated the importance on a scale of 1 to 5 (5 means very important activity). Results Among the participants in the Delphi study (response rate 37.9%), half of them were professionals and the other half equally distributed among policy- or decision-makers and services' users or carers. The average score of activities was 4.3 (important) with high consensus level (84.3%). The study provided a list of important activities including COVID 19 pandemic in Slovenia recognised in the system and service levels. These are single entry point, establishment of appropriate and accessible psychological assistance to most exposed individuals and to infected ones, continuously implemented destigmatization campaigns, regular consultations among professionals in health, social and educational services also for needs assessment, strengthened services addressing domestic violence, strengthen advocacy and representation services for people with mental health disorders and others. Conclusions The Delphi study provided consensus based list of activities at the system and service levels, important in the time of COVID-19 epidemics that are in line with international standards. These measures are also in line with several already launched preventive measures in Slovenia that were established also regarding detected needs.

"Depression and anxiety symptoms among Slovenian tertiary students during COVID-19 pandemic","Background The COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures associated with it radically affected educational processes in Slovenia. Schools were suspended and teaching was shifted to home-based distance learning models, with higher education institutions carrying this out for the longest period of time. The pandemic has also had an impact on mental health, and tertiary students seem to be particularly vulnerable. Methods A cross-sectional internet survey was conducted in February and March 2021. The final sample consisted of 5999 respondents. The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among Slovenian tertiary students was assessed using the Patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire (GAD-7). Participants with and without more pronounced depressive and anxiety symptoms were dichotomized using a cut-off value of 10 points, with higher scores indicating higher presence of symptoms and categorized into 5 severity levels according to total scale scores. Suicidal ideation was examined using 9th item of the PHQ-9. Results Data show that 55% of respondents reported having more pronounced depressive symptoms (PHQ-9=10), with 16% reporting severe depressive symptoms. 5.1% of respondents reported having suicidal ideation more than half of the days and 5% reported having them almost every day. 51.3% of respondents reported having more pronounced anxiety symptoms (GAD -7=10), with 30.7% reporting severe anxiety symptoms. Females reported more depressive and anxiety symptoms than males. Conclusions The results of the present study are to some extent consistent with the findings of comparable studies, but show higher proportions of depressive and anxiety symptoms with the highest severity levels. The data suggest that there is a case for tailored public health interventions that respond to the identified mental health needs of tertiary students in Slovenia. Key messages 55% of respondents reported having depressive symptoms (PHQ-9=10), with 16% reporting severe depressive symptoms, and 10.1% reported frequent suicidal ideation. 51.3% of the respondents reported having more pronounced anxiety symptoms (GAD -7=10), with 30.7% reporting severe anxiety symptoms.","Selak, Å , Crnkovic, N.; Å orgo, A.; Cesar, K.; Gabrovec, B.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab165.579","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22194,""
"Anxiety and depression levels in Malta: A year into Covid-19 pandemic","Background Covid-19 pandemic resulted in a number of lifestyle changes and restrictive measures. The aim was to assess for the impact of Covid-19 on anxiety- depression levels and associated behavioural attitudes among the adult population of Malta. Methods An anonymous survey using Google Forms was disseminated on social media (1st to 26th of February), targeting the adult residents of Malta. The survey's questions assessed for socio-demographic characteristics, changes in physical activity levels, and body weight. The Generalised Anxiety Disorder assessment tool was used to evaluate the level of anxiety and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 assessment tool was used to evaluate the level of depression among the participants during the pandemic. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed. Results A total of 1,034 participants responded. Mild anxiety levels (41.20% CI95%:38.24 - 44.23) and minimal depression levels (54.23% CI95%:51.17-57.25) were generally reported. On stratification by employment status, students reported severe anxiety levels (p = &lt;0.01). Indeed, a participant reported, â€œCOVID-19 made me very anxiousâ€¦not knowing if I will be finishing my degreeâ€. Covid-19 also impacted on behavioural attitudes, â€œI am eating more, I put on weightâ€¦resulting in feeling a bit depressed and have nothing to look forward toâ€. Indeed, a proportional increase in body weight was reported among those with mild to severe anxiety levels (p = &lt;0.01). An inverse trend with an increase in anxiety and depression scores and decrease physical activity levels was observed (p = &lt;0.01 respectively). Conclusions The population's mental health has been impacted differently, with some societal groups more susceptible than others. An increase in body weight and a decrease in physical activity appears to be linked with both anxiety and depression levels. Key messages Increase in mental health burden and obesity prevalence is anticipated as a resultant effect of Covid-19. Enhanced psychological support and prevention strategies targeting mental health and obesity are recommended.","Cuschieri, S.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab165.570","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22195,""

"Comparison of face-to-face and online mindfulness-based public health interventions for older adults","Background Coping with everyday stress, maintaining well-being and building up personal competencies is essential to handle today's way of living. Additionally, the actual COVID-19 pandemic also impacted the overall health of global population because of reduced social contact and other epidemiological measures. The aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness of two different approaches in conducting mindfulness-based public health interventions focused on quality of life and mental health of older adults as well as their ability to self-manage their health. Methods In total, 450 participants aged 65 years and older will participate in the study. Participants will be residents living in the city of Rijeka and the wider urban area consisting of six local municipalities. All engaged participants will be divided into three groups: face-to-face intervention group, online intervention group and control group. Older adults engaged in the face-to-face and online mindfulness-based intervention will participate in a seven-week workshop program base on two existing evidence-based programs: Mindfulness-based Living Programme and The Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme. The study is based on a pre-post-test design which will assess the effectiveness of public health interventions on self-efficacy in health management, social support, stress, depression, sleep, fatigue, medication use, and quality of life. Results Research results will provide insight into the difference in effectiveness between two forms of implementation of public health interventions, which can be important in defining health policies regarding quality of life, mental health and health self-management of older adults. Conclusions This study will enable policy makers in defining future public health interventions and their adaptation to various epidemiological situations such as the one caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Key messages Mindfulness is known as an efficient tool in maintaining personal well-being. Mindfulness can be an effective tool for improving mental health and resilience even during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Juraga, D.; Vasiljev, V.; Bilajac, L.; Glavic, M.

"Changes on the Demand for Attention for a Mental Health Service During Social Isolation Measures","Background Most of the countries in the world adopted isolation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Kola L. et. al (2021), â€œin most settings in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), ongoing in-person mental health services have been disrupted and patients with severe mental conditions and substance abuse disorders are often unable to obtain medications, attend to treatment centres, or receive social servicesâ€. The aim of this paper is to describe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the demand for attention in a mental health service as reported by healthcare workers. Methods A quantitative cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted and a survey designed by the SecretarÃ­a de PolÃ­ticas Integrales sobre Drogas de la NaciÃ³n Argentina was applied to a total of 29 healthcare workers of a mental health centre in the Province of CÃ³rdoba, Argentina, during the month of November, 2020. Results The perception of healthcare workers towards the demand for attention shows that the 3 main reasons for consultation during the first three months of isolation measures were drug abuse (50%), request for treatment (10.3%), and order for medication (10.3%). During the three subsequent months, the reasons for consultation were drug abuse (62.1%), request for treatment (44.8%) and remote treatment modality (24.1%). Healthcare workers state that drug abuse consultations increased 65.5% and the self-inflicted violence consultations increased 44.8%. Conclusions The isolation measures generate a change in the demand for attention. There are differences between various phases of the isolation measures, where an increase in the drug abuse consultations and remote treatment modality could be observed. Key messages To develop predictability according to the variations in the demand for attention produced during public health crisis. To train healthcare workers in order to make interventions in public health crisis.","Piscitello, F.; Pizzi, R. D.; Cuneo, M. M.; Farias, M.

"Organization of specialized outpatient care in the context of integrated healthcare networks","Problem/Issue The Specialized Outpatient Care (SOC) organization is a worldwide concern, aiming to ensure integrality and equity of health care. Description of the problem Implantation of SOC services regionalized and integrated in a healthcare network coordinated by Primary Care (PC) seems to be a potential strategy to restore balance between demand and supply by SOC. The â€œHealth Care Planningâ€ (HCP) method, proposes a population-based management SOC model with horizontal and collaborative relation between SOC and PC, different from the conventional model focused on medical specialties. Thus, SOC assumes three functions besides assistance: educational, research and supervisory. In 2018, the PlanificaSUS project started the implantation of this model in 25 regions of 19 Brazilian states. Each region chose one SOC service and one priority line of care, based on local epidemiological indicators. Workshops and tutoring activities were conducted and SOC teams were trained based on the continuous care cycle, in an inter-professional and collaborative way. Results Priority lines of care were chosen as follows: maternal and child (n = 17);elderly health (n = 1);mental health (n = 1);and hypertension and diabetes (n = 6). Each SOC service mapped PC services in region, defined evidence-based clinical guidelines in the healthcare network and organized SOC portfolio, composed of multi-professional team, equipment and physical structure. Team training was concluded in 19 SOC services, in which educational function was introduced with PC through a risk stratification course. This course was based on common clinical guideline between PC and SOC, contributing to shared and resolutive care. Lessons The proposed model for SOC organization could be a potential strategy to integrate SOC with PC in different settings, in spite of important challenges, such as: covid-19 pandemic, necessity local health managers' protagonism and politics to support SOC integration in healthcare network. Key messages Organization of SOC integrated in healthcare networks must be promoted to ensure integrality, equity and longitudinally of shared and resolutive care. Population-based management and a horizontal and collaborative relation between SOC and PC should be encouraged to improve quality and effectiveness of care in the healthcare network.","Andrade, A.

"Burnout among health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic: prevalence and risk factors","Introduction During COVID-19 pandemic, health-care workers (HCW) have been exposed to multiple psychosocial stressors. Although the problem of burnout, which overlaps with the symptoms of depression, remains urgent, few studies have addressed it comprehensively. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and the factors associated with burnout among HCW. Methodes We conducted a cross-sectional study on March-April 2021 using a self-administered questionnaire distributed to HCW who were involved in COVID-19 management patients. The 22-item Maslach burnout inventory was performed to measure the prevalence of burnout defined as follows: high score of emotional exhaustion (=27) plus high score of depersonalization (=13) or low score of personal accomplishment (=31). Results Overall, 250 HCW were included in this study. The sex ratio was 0.17. Their median age was 34 years (interqurtile range (IQR) = [30-40 years]). The average number of work experience was 11.1Â±3.4 years. There were 46 cases (18.4%) with a chronic disease. Among the study population, 131 HCW (51.4%) were infected with covid-19. The overall burnout prevalence was 45.6%. Female gender (Odds ratio (OR)=4.3;p &lt; 0.001) and unmarried status (OR = 3.3;p &lt; 0.001) were statistically associated with burnout. Participants in the burnout group had statistically higher number of working hours per day (=6 hours) (OR = 3.2;p = 0.003), of night shifts per week (4Â±1 vs 3Â±1;p = 0.04), but lower number of working experience years (7Â±0.6 vs 12Â±1;p = 0.017). History of chronic diseases (OR = 1.8;p=0.021), witnessing a COVID-19 death while working (OR = 3.1;p &lt; 0.001) and suffering from sleep deprivation (OR = 1.9;p = 0.034) were statistically more frequent in the burnout group of HCW. Conclusions The findings of this study indicated that the burnout syndrome was highly prevalent among HCW. More psychological support should be provided for this population in order to provide a high-quality of care for patients. Key messages Highly prevalent of burnout syndrome. Psychological support should be provided.","Maamri, H.; Ayed, H. Ben, Hmida, M.

"Sustainable initiatives to limit the spread of corona-virus among Danish school teachers","Background Schoolteachers play an important role in limiting the spread of corona-virus among pupils while carrying out their core tasks. This double role affects teachers' mental health negatively. Still, open schools are important for pupils' learning and wellbeing. Hence, it is crucial to identify viable strategies for virus control that can be implemented in schools without draining teachers' resources. Thus, our aim was to analyze the sustainability of interventions aimed at hindering spread of virus in public schools. Methods The qualitative data consisted of 700 free text responses from a survey among 1332 Danish schoolteachers from Nov 25 to Dec 9, 2020, i.e. when facing the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using Thematic Network Analysis, we analyzed the participants' answers to the question â€œWhat initiatives to prevent the spread of infection would you be able to carry out for a longer period of time?â€ Results Most initiatives consumed resources (financial, staffing, time, mental, and relational) to an extend that was unacceptable for the participants. Improved hygiene and ventilation were sustainable initiatives given that the allocation of responsibility was clear. The sustainability of using visor/facemask was compromised by its negative effects on social interactions and by stigma. Isolation of teachers, when having been in contact with infected pupils, had major consequences for the teachers' private life. Finally, the sustainability of initiatives to keep a physical distance was challenged by implications related to the possibility of comforting younger schoolchildren and teaching activities demanding proximity to pupils. Conclusions It should be ensured that schools have the resources needed to hinder spread of virus while delivering high quality teaching. In addition, our findings suggest that school leaders clarify the prioritization between preventive initiatives and core tasks, and inform about responsibilities and academic expectations. Key messages Actions to make preventive initiatives sustainable within school environments are highly needed to keep schools open during this and future pandemics. Policies should ensure that schools have the resources needed in order to hinder spread of virus while delivering high quality teaching.","Poulsen, V. D.

"Health sciences studentsâ€™ perception on stigmatization related to COVID-19","Background The current COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge for the health sector all over the world. According to WHO, stigma related to COVID-19 can lead to underreporting, increased exposure and low adherence to standard safety precautions thus complicating adequate responses to the pandemic. The purpose of our research was to analyze students' perceptions on issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic with a special focus on relevant ethical issues. Herein, we present results related to student's perceptions on stigmatization. Methods A web-based questionnaire was distributed among 715 students;medical students from Medical University -Sofia, Bulgaria and midwifery students from the University of Western Macedonia, Greece. It included 21 questions on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge on the transmission, symptoms and treatment of COVID-19. The study was conducted between April and July 2020. All the students participated anonymously and voluntarily. Results Data collected show that the main reasons for stigma experience are the presence of cough or flu-like symptoms (67.4%) and travel from high-risk regions (72.6%). These perceptions were significantly higher among medical students (72.5% and 75.7%) compared to other specialties - midwives (59.1%, 67.6%). Asian origin, health professionals as first respondents and release from quarantine were also considered as significant stigma-related factors in about one-third of all participants, respectively. Conclusions Identification of the main public perceptions that may lead to stigmatization and discrimination of patients and vulnerable groups is important in a focused approach to counter its impact on societies. Providing up-to-date education to medical professionals, mitigating the spread of misinformation by real-time monitoring of digital resources, improving public literacy on COVID-19 and establishing a community-level dialogue through digital and social media platforms may raise awareness to reduce stigma. Key messages Long-term Public health strategies are required to combat misconceptions that perpetuate stigma, in order to achieve better outcomes and improved treatment, and protect mental health. As the global COVID-19 health emergency transforms into an unprecedented social crisis, special attention is necessary among vulnerable people to ensure social integrity.","Leventi, N.; Kazakos, E.; Vodenitcharova, A.; Popova, K.; Velikov, S.; Yanakieva, A.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab165.267","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22202,""
"Staying active during Covid-19 crisis: why it would have been important to keep public parks opened","Background In 2020, the Covid 19 pandemic and associated restrictions, including limited access to public urban green space (UGS), have led to a decrease in the ability of city dwellers to engage in physical activity. In France, more than 52% people reported being physically active in urban parks. Based on the GREENH-City research carried out in cities of the French network of WHO healthy cities, this presentation aims to show that UGS, depending on different drivers, can support a wide variety of physical activities, but also offer multiple other functions that contribute more or less directly to the health of the population. Methods A qualitative survey was conducted among users of 3 different parks in each of the 6 selected cities with both observations and semi-directive interviews and a thematic analyzes were performed. Observed activities were classified into 8 groups including physical activity (non-sport, sports). Interview's analysis aimed to describe the reasons for coming and the type of activity made. Results 186 observations and 591 recorded and unrecorded interviews with individuals or groups were conducted in the 18 parks. 24 types of physical activity have been described as possible uses of UGS. The most important, regardless of UGS location, is children activities in playgrounds. The most common activities are walking (with a social function) and jogging (individual function). Proximity and the accessibility are two reasons for use. Conclusions UGS are an open access amenity for physical activities. From a social justice perspective, policy makers should ensure that every neighborhood is sufficiently close to an UGS. In addition to promoting physical activity, UGS also serve an important social function and impact the collective physical and mental health of the population in many other ways (e.g., as environmental risk regulators). Their coping role during crisis for population would worth to be studied further. Key messages Proximity and accessibility should shape local policies related to UGS renewal towards more equity. Different typologies of urban parks at the city level can offer multiple functions, including facilitation of physical activity that contribute to the health of the population.","Porcherie, M.; Gall, A.

"Mental health and lifestyle changes during the first month of lockdown in Greece","Objective The current study aimed to explore the views and perceptions of Greek citizens regarding the impact of the pandemic on various health, mental health, and social behavior parameters. Methods An online questionnaire was distributed in April 2020 to the general population in Greece, via university networks and popular social media. Results A total of 1045 participants completed the questionnaire (men 34.0%;mean age 40.3 years) from all geographical regions of Greece. Satisfaction was high with the overall governmental response to the pandemic (71.0%). Lack of confidence was noted by many respondents regarding the national health system's preparedness to meet the increased needs of patients during the crisis (44.7%) and mistrust was reported by a high percentage of participants for the media with the way they delivered the news (80.0%). â€œFearâ€ and â€œsleep disordersâ€ were very prevalent psychological reactions to the pandemic (70.7%, 59.3% respectively). An increase was reported by many respondents regarding the use of new technologies (65.8%), social interactions via internet (54.8%), food consumption (32.7%) and care for personal health (31.0%). A decrease in sexual interaction with the partner (47.0%) and relaxation practices (31.0%) was reported by a significant number of respondents.

"Addictive behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic: results from a nationwide study in Portugal","Background Evidence shows that individuals can engage in maladaptive behaviours as a response to a pandemic context, which can compromise their health and wellbeing. This project aims to characterize self-reported changes in addiction-related behaviours and associated factors in the adult population during the first COVID-19 lockdown, in Portugal. Methods Cross-sectional study, with an online survey conducted between May 22 and July 20, 2020, targeting a non-probabilistic sample of adults (18 years of age or more) dwelling in Portugal (mainland and autonomous regions). The following data were collected: alcohol drinking, smoking, use of cannabis and other substances, gambling, and sugar-sweetened food intake, work-related variables, and sociodemographics. After data cleaning and weighting (by sex, age group, NUTS II and educational level), logistic regression models were conducted to assess potential determinants of addiction-related behaviours. Results Overall, 3.982 individuals participated in the study (79.1% women;mean age of 45.15 years). Women, young adults (18-34 years) and individuals with difficulties in work-life balance had higher odds for self-reported increase of sweets intake. Men, young adults (18-34 years) and those with work-life balance difficulties presented higher odds for alcohol drinking increase. Those unemployed (or with suspended activity or in layoff) and those with lower income had higher odds for gambling behaviour increase. Conclusions Some segments of the Portuguese population reported to have increased their engagement in addictive-related behaviours, during the COVID-19 lockdown, which can have negative consequences for mental health. The study of the correlates of maladaptive responses under this scenario is pivotal to inform public health interventions and alleviate the potential deleterious impacts of this pandemic. Key messages COVID-19 pandemic can increase maladaptive coping behaviours in some segments of the population. Public health interventions are needed to mitigate the negative consequences of this pandemic.","Virgolino, A.; Santos, O.; Fialho, M.; Heitor, M.

"COVID-19, Mental health and intervention-priorities among Northern Italian University students","During the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic, the most affected area in Italy was the southeast part of the Lombardy region. The University of Brescia is one of the largest in Northern Italy. The aim of this study is to investigate the psychological and somatic symptoms driven by lifestyle changes due to the lockdown among the students of the University of Brescia.15261 University students were enrolled through institutional email;14302 were Master's and Bachelor's Degreestudents,724 were Residents and 235 doctorates.3553 students (23.28% of total),aged on average 22 years, completed the survey. Physical health, dietary and sleep habits, physical activities, economic and social issues were investigated through an anonymous, online ad hoc form, available until July 2020 and approved by the local Ethic Committee. Five psychosomatic outcomes were assessed: digestive disorders, headache, panic-anxiety crises, depression-sadness, fear od COVID-19.Factor analysis was applied to reduce the number of variables while logistic and ordinal logistic regression models were used to test the association between the latent variables and each outcome. Female gender, medium-intensive use of telephone, worsening of sleep quality, mnemonic difficulties and performance reduction were associated with all the outcomes. Low physical activity, increased time spent watching television and the worsening of dietary habits represented a significant risk factor for at least three of the outcomes. Despite the relatively low compliance, the survey clearly identified few priorities of intervention to prevent psychological and somatic effects of pandemic in the next future: circadian rhythm, nutritional habits, physical activity, use of media, gender issues. The results of this study show the psychosomatic effects of social isolation and the pandemic on a population at risk of young adults and can promote interventions to minimize the occurrence of psychosomatic consequences on young adults. Key messages Analysis of the main risk and protection factors in a population of young adults in the development of psycho-physical symptoms during the period of isolation due to the covid-19 pandemic. Support the need to implement public health services also to reduce health costs with possible methods of intervention, in harmony with the findings.","Patrono, A.; Placidi, D.; Calza, S.; Brunelli, P.; Cagna, G.; Manco, A.; Renzetti, S.; Rota, M.; Moncada, S.; Lucchini, R.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab165.123","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22207,""

"Mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal","Background Mental health is being impacted by COVID-19, as a result of both the globalized perception of health risk and the massive social and economic measures, required to control the pandemic. A main goal of this study, the SM-COVID19, was to characterize the mental health of the general population and to identify vulnerable groups, during the first lockdown in Portugal. Methods Cross-sectional online survey, conducted between May 22 and July 20, 2020, with a nationwide non-probabilistic sample of adults residing in Portugal (=18 years old). Data were collected with sound psychometric scales for symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), work-life balance, resilience, work-related variables, and sociodemographics. Logistic regression models were used to assess risk and protective factors for mental health suffering. Results Overall, 3982 individuals participated in the study (female, 79.1%;mean age, 45.15Â±12.31 years;71.0% completed higher education studies). The prevalence of symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety was 26.5% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 24.0-29.1), of depression symptoms was 26.0% (95%CI, 23.6-28.7), and of PTSD symptoms was 26.5% (95%CI, 24.0-29.2). Moreover, more than one third of the respondents (41.2%;95%CI: 38.3-44.1) reported symptomatology for at least one of these three psychiatric disorders. Women, individuals who suspended their professional activity (or in layoff or unemployed) during the lockdown, and those with difficulties in managing work and family demands had higher odds for psychological suffering. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis with major interpersonal, social and economic impacts at the individual level. Mental health and wellbeing are being severely affected, as confirmed by the high prevalence of symptoms of psychological suffering herein. Mental health protection measures need to be defined and implemented, mainly targeting the most vulnerable groups. Key messages COVID-19 pandemic is associated with high prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD. Observed mental health inequities imply effective vulnerable-groups-focused mental health promotion programs.","Santos, O.; Virgolino, A.; Heitor, M.

"Knowledge and attitudes related to the COVID-19: role of media communication and emotional factors","Background The COVID-19 pandemic was characterized by difficult communication challenges due also to scientific uncertainty regarding the nature and management of the new coronavirus. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of media information on the population's COVID-19-related knowledge, behavior and emotional state. Methods In a cross-sectional study, data from July to September 2020 was collected via survey posted on social media (SM). It included also an analysis of participants' e-health literacy (e-HEALS), and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms using DASS-21 tool. Results Of the 2,140 subjects, as a main source of information, 69% indicated institutional websites and 26% SM. Fifty-four percent believed expert information to be crucial in changing their behavior. However 30% of health professionals (HP) and 37% of non-HP found expert (scientists) communication hard to understand. Despite high education level (44.3% graduates), 19% denied knowing of the virus origin. Others believed the human manipulation theory (33% of the total and 29% of HP). The e-HEALS score in these subjects was lower than those reporting the natural origin of virus (28.4 Â± 6.2 vs 30.5 Â± 6.1, p&lt;.001). Young people aged &lt;35 y reported signs of depression (41%), anxiety (28%) and stress (36%) more than older participants (p=.0001). As for infection concern, it was higher in females (58% p&lt;.001), those not living alone (56% p&lt;.01), those living with a senior (62% p&lt;.01) or with those at high risk of COVID-19 (64%p&lt;.001). Greater worry meant stricter guideline adherence (hand washing 56% p&lt;.0001;surface sanitation 42% p&lt;.0001;social distancing 77% p&lt;.0001) and mask usage before mandate (45% p&lt;.0001). Conclusions Although the sample was overall well informed and followed preventive measures, institutional communication was found to be confusing especially by experts. The findings highlighted the strong psychological impact on the community, young people especially. Key messages The study confirms the importance of putting effort on population health literacy and more effective institutional communication strategies. Proactive and timely psychological interventions should be provided to address the mental health needs of the population resulting from the pandemic.","Covolo, L.; Vedova, A. M.

"Perceived vulnerability to Covid-19 among health care workers in a Tunisian University Hospital","Background Health Care workers (HCWs) are constantly on the front line during the current pandemic, facing a permanent influx of patients with a significant risk of viral contamination. Our study aimed at estimating the corona virus disease high risk perception and evaluating determinant factors of the perceived vulnerability to Covid-19 among HCWs in the region of Mahdia (Tunisia). Methods We conducted a cross sectional study among HCWs in the University Hospital Tahar Sfar Mahdia in Tunisia in December 2020. The perceived vulnerability to disease was assessed using the validated perceived vulnerability to disease scale (PVDS). Results A total of 173 professionals were recruited with a mean age of 35.35 Â± 9.4 years. Among them, 66% were women. One third of participants (33.3%) were doctors. The majority of them (86%) have experienced a high level of risk perception. The older HCWs (p = 0.04), the nursing personnel (p = 0.02), as well as, those with pre-existing chronic diseases (p = 0.04) perceived greater vulnerability to Covid-19. It was also significantly associated (p = 0.01) with undressing faults. Being older (standardized ÃŸ = 0.193, CI = 0.601-7.707, p = 0.003), having pre-existing chronic diseases (ÃŸ = 0.184, CI = 0.478-8.888, p = 0.05), high risk perception (ÃŸ = 0.162, CI= -0.087-10.47, p = 0.02) and undressing faults (ÃŸ = 0.224, CI = 0.582-1.306, p = 0.008), were found to be the determinant factors of the perceived vulnerability to disease PVD in a multivariate linear logistic regression model (adjusted R2=0.129). Conclusions Perceived vulnerability to Covid-19 is mainly manifested by an atmosphere of fear of getting infected, but also by compliance with barrier measures. This fact is aligned with health authorities's strategies to ensure a society totally free of Covid-19. Key messages During the current Covid-19 pandemic the majority of health care workers worldwide have experienced a high level of risk perception which negatively impacts their mental health. Health care workers must be provided with the personal protective equipment PPE essential to protect themselves against the Covid-19 transmission.","Omri, N.; Mlouki, I.; Sfar, H.; Youssef, F.

"Prognostic factors of self-rated health deterioration during Covid-19 in the Baltic States","Background In order to implement the necessary measures to prevent the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemics, long-term assessment of health status is needed. The objective of the study - to determine the prognostic factors of self-rated health deterioration during the first wave of Covid-19 pandemics. Methods The study was based on a sample of individuals from wave 7, wave 8 and Covid-19 add-on of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) in the period from 2017 till 2020. The sample size was 4429 respondents - Latvia: 649, Lithuania: 1083, Estonia: 2697. Descriptive statistics as well as univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression was performed, including health determinants, demographics and factors associated with Covid-19. Results Based on univariate binary logistic regression analysis, the main predictors for deterioration of self-rated health (unadjusted OR;95%CI) were: age 80+ years (reference group 50-59 years) for Estonia (3.03;2.93-3.14), diagnosed with major condition since Covid-19 for Latvia (15.45;15.14-15.77) and Estonia (6.75;6.57-6.94), fair or poor health since Covid-19 for Lithuania (4.92;4.86-4.99), loneliness since Covid-19 for Lithuania (5.03;4.94-5.12), limited in activities due to health condition for Latvia (4.53;4.42-4.64), depression since Covid-19 for Lithuania (3.78-3.71-3.85), limited in activities due to age for Latvia (3.01;2.95-3.08), nervousness since Covid-19 for Lithuania (2.08;2.04-2.12). All predictors were statistically significant for all three Baltic countries. Conclusions The results in all three Baltic States indicated a similar trend that, taking into account the influence of other factors, the most important predictive factors were related to health and demographic indicators. Only one factor related to the first wave of Covid-19 (in Latvia - nervousness since Covid-19, in Lithuania and Estonia - less or no direct contact with children since Covid-19) predicts deterioration in health. Key messages The results indicate that deterioration in health cannot currently be considered to be caused by the first wave of Covid-19. Further research to assess long-term impact of Covid-19 to health is needed.","Mikelsone, M.; Reine, I.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab165.109","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22212,""
"The fear of Covid-19 and its predictive factors among health care workers in Mahdia Tunisia","Background The massive spread of the corona virus being relatively deadly, leads to psychological pressures dominated by an atmosphere of panic and worries mainly among Health Care workers (HCWs). Only few studies have evaluated this impact on HCWs mental health in Tunisia. Aim we aimed at determining the prevalence of corona virus fear and its associated factors among HCWs in the University Hospital Tahar Sfar Mahdia (Tunisia). Methods We conducted a cross sectional study among HCWs staff in the University Hospital Tahar Sfar Mahdia which is located in the Central-East part of Tunisia in December 2020. The fear of corona virus disease was assessed using the valid French version of the Fear of Covid-19 Scale (FCV-7). Results A total of 173 professionals were recruited with a mean age of 35.35 Â± 9.31 years. Among them, 66% were women. One third of participants (33.3%) were medical professionals. Almost, 68% have experienced a high level of fear. Our survey showed a significantly higher level of fear among females 70.1% and elderly people 60.8%. It was positively associated (p &lt; 0.05) with anxiety and depression, high risk perception and the responsibility degree of being a virus vector for their loved ones. Anxiety and depression disorders (standardized ÃŸ = 3.118, CI = 0.545-5.832,p=0.018), high risk perception (ÃŸ = 3.321,CI = 0.097-6.545, p = 0.044), knowledge about Covid-19 transmission (ÃŸ = 2.586, CI = 0.439-4.734, p = 0.019), degree of responsibility (ÃŸ = 3.130, CI = 0.373-5.887, p = 0.026), being a doctor (ÃŸ = -6.475, CI = -8.785- -4.165, p = 0.001) and Perceived Vulnerability to Disease (ÃŸ = 0.26,CI = 0.157-0.363, p &lt; 001) were found to be predictive factors of corona virus fear in the linear regression model (Adjusted R2 = 0.374). Conclusions Authorities should introduce a preventive strategy based on psychological intervention for HCWs to overcome their fear and worries. Key messages The high prevalence of the fear of Covid-19 among health care workers is alarming. Its impact on mental health cannot be ignored. The health authorities worldwide should not have as objective only the reduction of the transmission, but also the work on individual fears to ensure a society totally free of covid-19.","Omri, N.; Mlouki, I.; Sfar, H.; Youssef, F.

"Older peopleâ€™s aspirations for the aftermath of COVID-19: Findings from the WISE study","Background For many older people around the globe, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted accessibility issues and pervasive inequalities across multiple social, economic and health dimensions. The aim of the present study is to explore older people's perspectives about what we should learn from this pandemic and how to build a better future. Methods The Well-being, Interventions and Support during Epidemics (WISE) study is an exploratory qualitative project that has collected information from 46 individuals aged 65+, who live in Irish community settings. Data collection included in-depth interviews over the phone or videoconference platforms. Analysis is ongoing utilizing NVivo12 to identify themes and linkages within a socio-ecological framework. Preliminary Results Findings indicate that at the macrosystems level, several participants expect policymakers and researchers to commit to challenging ageist misconceptions of a homogeneous aging experience- such as the notion that older people are merely recipients of care with a high degree of needs. Upon reflection of their experiences with shelter-in-place restrictions and its consequences, at the exosystem level, many respondents called for older voices to be consulted in public health decisions and included in decision-making bodies. Concerning the microsystem, participants referred policymakers should further develop natural and built environments that enable physical, mental and social well-being for all. Cutting across all levels, participants advised for stronger political will and accountability, as they recognized some of their concerns had been addressed in past policies but were not being implemented. Conclusions Our preliminary findings are applicable to the Irish context but also provide relevant insights for those interested in creating inclusive age-friendly societies across the globe. Embracing this shared vision would provide significant opportunities to address present and future public health challenges. Key messages Older people are very diverse, so it is necessary to move on from one size fits all approaches.

"Perceived Stress related to COVID-19 among Tunisian adults during the lockdown period","Background Public health emergencies such as the Covid-19 pandemic can affect the health, safety and well-being of individuals and communities. This pandemic may lead to emotional reactions such as stress, anxiety and depression in the general population. Aim To evaluate the perceived stress among Tunisian adults during the period of lockdown. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during the lockdown period targeting adults using online social networks. The data was collected through a â€œGoogle Formâ€ questionnaire published on Face book. Perceived stress was measured using the â€˜Perceived Stress scale'. Results A total of 164 adults participated in our study with a majority of women (77.4%) and a mean age of 34.57 Â± 12.1 years. Almost half of our participants (48.1%) were from the Governorate of Sousse. Among the respondents, 58.5% felt in perpetual threat and only 15.4% knew how to manage their stress. Univariate analyses showed that perpetual threat was significantly associated with age (p = 0.015), being single (p = 0.03) jobless (p = 0.02), and spending more than one hour documenting on COVID-19 (p = 0.02). After adjusting to sex and age;the multivariate analysis showed a statistically significant association between stress level and anxiety p &lt; 10-3;OR: 8.62;IC [3.1-23.8]);fear of catching the virus (p = 0.031;OR: 3.10;IC [1.1-6.7]) and insomnia (p = 0.001;OR: 7.46;IC [2.4-24.7]).

"Factors associated with avoidance of emergency department visits in Portugal during the pandemic","Background Avoiding an emergency department (ED) visit risks irreversible negative consequences for patients' health. EDs are a frequent access point to the Portuguese health system. Previous studies have shown that patients may avoid visiting ED during the pandemic. This study aims to identify factors associated with avoidance of ED visits in Portugal during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We used data from a community-based survey, â€œCOVID-19 Barometer: Social Opinionâ€, which includes healthcare utilisation, health status, and risk perception in Portugal from 11th April 2020 to 16th April 2021. We included respondents that reported having needed ED care. Data were collected on sociodemographics, health status (comorbidities, mental health), risk perception (COVID-19 and complications), level of trust in health services and self-assessment of the severity of the reason for ED visit. The outcome of interest was the decision to avoid ED care. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with the decision to avoid ED. Results Preliminary data showed that 914 respondents reported needing ED care (74.8% female;mean age 43 years). From those, 224 (25%) decided to avoid ED care. ED visits avoidance was higher during lockdowns (28%). People reporting specific comorbidities (cardiac, autoimmune, respiratory) avoided ED more than those without them. Perception of no severe reason for ED visit, poor mental health, perception of higher risk of COVID-19 and complications, and low trust in health services response to the pandemic were associated with higher odds of ED visit avoidance. Conclusions People avoiding ED visits represented a considerable share. The decision to avoid ED visit was associated with clinical characteristics, but the perception of risk and assessment of the context and health system response also played a role in decision making. Key messages The effect of avoided ED visits on health should be a research and policy concern. People with certain comorbidities or perception of high risk of COVID-19 and complications may be closely monitored.","Lopes, S.; Soares, P.; Gama, A.; Pedro, A. R.; Moniz, M.; Laires, P.; Goes, A.

"Use of antidepressants during COVID19 outbreak: a real-world drug-utilization study","Background Lockdown measures implementation (LMI) to prevent COVID19 disease diffusion was associated to increased depression and anxiety cases. The main aim was to evaluate whether LMI affected prevalence and incidence of antidepressants (ADs) use, and ADs treatment interruption (TI) in the general population. Methods Adults (=18 years) with at least 1 dispensing of ADs between 01/01/2019-26/09/2020 were selected from a regional Italian healthcare administrative database. Patients presenting an AD dispensing in the year preceding the first observation were considered as prevalent otherwise as incident users. We divided the studied period into 3 parts: pre-lockdown (01/01/2019-08/03/2020), lockdown (09/03/2020-14/06/2020) and post-lockdown (15/06/2020-27/09/2020). The weekly prevalence (WP) and incidence (WI) per 10,000 inhabitants were compared among periods. Incidence of TI (no dispensing refill within 30 days of the end of its validity) was computed among prevalent AD users. Results The WP (mean of 552.3 per 10,000 pre-lockdown vs 505.5 lockdown phase;relative change: -9%) and WI (5.2 vs 3.7;-29%) of ADs use decreased after LMI. During the post-lockdown phase WP (505.5 vs 495.9;-2%) decreased whereas the WI (3.7 vs 4.3;16%) slightly increased in relation to the lockdown period, although differences were not statistically significant. Conversely, the incidence of TI increased during lockdown (344.7 vs 384.3;12%) and post-lockdown (384.3 vs 394.2;3%) periods, even not always statistically significant. Conclusions Our analysis showed a reduction of ADs use during the early phase of lockdown. Several factors might have impacted on the observed phenomenon (i.e, patient reluctance to start new AD treatment). Considering the mutation of the virus and the potential waves that might occur in the next months, a continuous monitoring of the impact of COVID19 on mental diseases onset and treatment adherence are suggested. Key messages In Italy, the implementation of lockdown measures was followed by a reduction in antidepressants use, even though evidences are that diagnoses of psychiatric disorders increased. Future studies should monitor if these phenomena led to an increase in adverse events potentially correlated with inappropriate treatment of depression.","Fornari, C.; Antonazzo, I.

"Mental Health, Wellbeing and Preventive Behaviors in 10 Western Pacific Countries during COVID-19","Background COVID-19 has shown varying impacts on different populations. In the Western Pacific (WP) Region with a relatively low COVID-19 burden, the variabilities of its impact on mental health, wellbeing and preventive behaviors across countries are unclear. Methods We analyzed repeated national-representative, cross-sectional data of 87,787 adults collected via the Imperial College London YouGov COVID-19 behavior tracker in ten WP countries-Australia, China, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia and Hong Kong during the pandemic (April-September 2020). Main outcomes were severe depression/anxiety (Patient Health Questionnaire-4 score=9), wellbeing (Cantril Ladder Scale 0-10), worries of contracting COVID-19 and prevalence of preventive behaviors. Monthly temporal trends were examined. Results Percentages of severe depression/anxiety were higher in Australia (12.9%), Hong Kong (11.8%) and lowest in Vietnam (6.8%);increasing trends were noted in the Philippines (5.9% to 12.3%, p &lt; 0.0001) and Malaysia (8.2% to 10.7%, p = 0.019). South Korea, China and Taiwan had the lowest levels of wellbeing (5.0-5.5) compared with their highest counterparts in the Philippines, Australia and Vietnam (6.2-6.5). Worries of COVID-19 remained high in Asia countries (Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines: 79.2%-81.6%), compared to that in Australia (41%). 83.5%-97.2% of the Asian respondents persistently wore face masks outside home, while the mean percentages were low in Australia (32.2%) despite the increasing trend observed (24.1% to 48.6%, p &lt; 0.000). Over half of the WP countries have significant decreasing trends (p &lt; 0.000) for avoid going out;Taiwan showed the lowest prevalence (45.7%). Conclusions Psychological and behavioral responses to COVID-19 in the WP region varied widely. COVID-19-related negative impact on mental health and wellbeing was universal. A Global effort to tackle the aftermath of the pandemic is crucial. Key messages The psychological and behavioral responses to COVID-19 in Western Pacific countries varied widely. Severe depression/anxiety and low levels of wellbeing were prevalent in Western Pacific Region.","Chen, Dt- H.; Wang, Y.

"Forecasting the economic consequences of COVID-19 on longstanding illnesses in Wales","Introduction The unemployment rate following the COVID-19 pandemic in Wales is increasing and there is a positive link between unemployment and longstanding illnesses. This study aimed to project the percentage of adults with longstanding illnesses and chronic health conditions following COVID-19 associated with the economic consequences. Methods We retrieved historical data on the unemployment rates and status of longstanding illnesses among adults from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and National Survey for Wales (NSW), and used time-series models to project the unemployment rates and percentage of adults with longstanding illnesses and chronic health conditions over a three year period (2020/21 - 2022/23). Results Without reparative interventions, the unemployment rate is expected to increase sharply from 3.8% in 2019 to about 7% in 2020 following COVID-19 and then gradually increase over the projected period. With increased unemployment, longstanding illness (LSI) would be expected to increase gradually following COVID-19, with an estimated increase of around or exceeding 4% over three years depending on the LSI measure. There would be a higher increment in the percentage of adults with limiting LSI compared with adults with any LSI, suggesting implications for wider health and social care services. With current unemployment predictions, the percentage of adults with chronic health conditions is projected to increase following the COVID-19 pandemic over the projected period, with a higher increment for mental health and endocrine/metabolic conditions Conclusions The longstanding illnesses and chronic health conditions are expected to increase in the coming years following COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, preventative measures for longstanding illnesses and chronic health conditions should be a priority for a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19. Key messages Without reparative interventions, the unemployment rate is expected to increase following the COVID-19 pandemic. The projected prevalence of limiting longstanding illness in adults following COVID-19 suggests implications for wider health and social care services.","Kadel, R.; Allen, J.; Dyakova, M.; Bellis, M.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab165.066","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22219,""
"Well-being and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background The COVID-19 pandemic greatly affected the lives of everyone. Some studies suggest that the incidence of mental health problems increased during the pandemic. The purpose of the study was to investigate the characteristics of mental well-being and the risk of developing depression among different age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovenia. Methods Data from eight waves of the Slovenian panel web survey SI PANDA was used, namely the 1st wave: from 4th to 6th December 2020 (n = 1001);8th wave: from 12th to 15th March 2021 (n = 1002). The sample included adults aged 18 to 74 years. In all eight waves, we used The World Health Organisation-Five Well Being Index (WHO 5), which is a short self-reported scale of current mental well-being and also has appropriate validity for screening for depression. Data were analyzed using the SPSS25, we applied the Mantel Haenszel linear trend test and the chi square test. Results The results show that from the 1st to the 8th wave of the study (from December 4th 2020 to March 15th 2021), mental well being in the whole sample improved slightly (M H test for trend, p &lt; 0,001), both in men and women, across all age groups. In addition, there was a declining trend in the risk of developing depression among the population aged between 30 and 64 years. However, this decrease was not observed in the 65-74 and 18-29 age groups in the mentioned time frame. In the youngest age group we could observe substantial fluctuations in the risk for depression between research waves, whereas in the eldest population a favourable decline in the risk for depression was not observed. Conclusions Risk of developing depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovenia is different among different age groups. Studies suggest that the occurrence of mental health problems increased during the pandemic, but not necessarily in parallel with the level of mental well being experienced by adults, which was also shown in the Slovenian sample. Key messages From December 4th 2020 to March 15th 2021 there was a declining trend in the risk of developing depression among the population aged between 30 and 64 years. The most vulnerable groups for depression symptoms in COVID-19 pandemic in Slovenia were 65â€“74 and 18-29 age groups.","Klanscek, H. Jericek, Grom, A.

"Environment related practices for emergency response to infectious disease outbreak on cruise ships","Issue/problem COVID-19 pandemic halted cruise operations globally. This project explored strategies and measures that could be adopted internationally for mitigating a disease outbreak on-board of a cruise ship by bringing evidence-based recommendations for an emergency response against current COVID-19 outbreak and future infectious threats. Description of the problem Research took place in October 2020-March 2021. Methods comprised of: a) consultation sessions with five international experts on public health, epidemiology, tourism and cruise management, b) both systematic and narrative literature reviews. Present guidance analysed why cruise ships promote an opportunistic environment for infectious outbreaks, along with a strategy for reducing the risks among passengers and crew. Results Results were organised under four main themes: a) advice on surface interactions and virus viability;b) prevention and control measures;c) suggestions on short and long term responses;d) advice on thermal and ventilation conditions and how they affect virus transmission. The guidance was very similar to other built environment contexts, ignoring the particularities of sociospatial interactions in cruise ships. Moreover, there was limited provision for the wellbeing and mental health during the outbreak. Lessons This project summarised recommendations for the preparedness of cruise ships during a pandemic from ports, off-board and on-board measures to repatriation. Demonstrated the importance of spatial characteristics in the preparedness of a ship. Pointed the effect pandemic can have upon crew and passengers. This needs to be taken into account when operations restart. Cruise experience would have to change due to covid-19, especially when social activity on board has to be restricted. The importance of future studies focusing on how this change will impact cruise industry arose, including crew hygiene, safety and supporting mental health during outbreaks. Key messages Multi-disciplinary approach on providing a set of recommendations for emergency response to infectious disease outbreak on cruise ships including environmental preparedness. Actions should include also the mental health of crew and passengers on copying with stress during infectious outbreaks.","Chrysikou, E.; Garcia, E.

"COVID-19 aftermath: Safe return to the office during the pandemic","Issue/problem COVID-19 has affected almost all aspects of our human activity globally. Changing our working norm is one of them. This project explored strategies and control measures that could be adopted in different countries for preventing or limiting the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in indoor office workplaces, focusing on space and the well-being of workers. Description of the problem Research took place in May-July 2020. Methods used comprised both systematic and narrative literature reviews as well as stakeholder consultations with executives involved in the office supply chain. Suggestions were split in: a) top-down suggestions, i.e. governmental and NGO guidance and b) bottom-up guidance, generated by industry. Surface contaminated? Protocols to reduce the psychological stress of employees returning to work, ventilation and virus transmission were indicative the questions along with a broader series of aspects involving employee wellbeing. Results Results were organised under four themes: a) advice on surface interactions and virus viability;b) behavioural advice focusing on the return-to-work effects on the psychological state of workers along with control measures;c) suggestions on preparing buildings to return-to-work during the pandemic and study of indoor environment parameters and their effect on office workers and d) advice on thermal and ventilation conditions and virus transmission. Lessons The public health effect of COVID-19 on workspace is more relevant than ever globally as people return to work. This review demonstrated the complexity of decision making and the series of conflicting priorities that arose, especially infection control vs employee mental health or increased business costs for modifications during economic recession. The necessity of future studies focusing on interdisciplinary knowledge arose.

"Changes of perceived risk and mental well-being during two waves of COVID-19 pandemic in Czechia","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has been negatively affecting many people's daily life. The strict preventive measures might have contributed to psychological distress, fear and fatigue. Therefore, it is crucial to build trust and ensure effective communication from the government to maintain public awareness. This study focuses on the comparative analysis of public health risk perception of COVID-19 during the pandemic. Methods The questionnaire surveys were conducted online during the first (April 2020) and second (November-December 2020) waves of the pandemics. The health risk concerns, perceived mental well-being and compliance with the adopted measures of the population were evaluate for potential development in time. The impact of age, gender and socio-demographic factors were tested. The average values of the 5-point Likert scale were tested for differences by Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests on the significance level 5% and analyzed using the SW STATA v.15. Results From a sample of 9,168 (1st survey) and 1,042 (2nd survey) Czech respondents aged 40 years, respectively 45 years in average, the present results showed that individual health concerns increased with age, while descending trend toward younger age was observed in terms of mental health. The perceived risk of COVID-19 substantially elevated over the observed period (p &lt; 0.001) as well as compliance with the measures (p &lt; 0.001). Further, 27% of the respondents self-evaluated their mental health as bad or very bad that was analysed as a significantly worsening (p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, 66% of respondents evaluated communication of the government as unsatisfactory that was in relation with a low compliance with measures. Conclusions This study contributes to understanding the development of the risk perception as a public response to COVID-19 pandemic. A divergence among the generation was observed. More focused communication of government might be required to enhance public trust. Key messages Compliance with the measures substantially elevated over the pandemics that is in relation with low government trust. Mental well-being has been significantly worsened over the COVID-19 pandemics.","DaleckÃ¡, A.; Å lachtovÃ¡, H.; TomÃ¡Å¡kovÃ¡, H.; Madar, R.; SkÃ½bovÃ¡, D.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab165.050","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22223,""
"Anxiety and depression among individuals in mandatory institutional quarantine in Tunisia","Background The COVID-19 pandemic is a challenging public health issue that have impacted people's health and livelihoods worldwide. Restrictive measures, such as quarantine, have been implemented in many countries in order to limit the spread of the virus. We aimed in this study to assess the impact of institutional mandatory quarantine on mental health in Tunisia and to determine factors associated with the occurrence of anxiety and or depression. Methods A cross sectional phone survey was conducted in Tunisia from April to November 2020 among people who were placed in mandatory institutional quarantine. Generalized anxiety disorder and depression were assessed using the Generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) and the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine factors associated with the occurrence of depression and or anxiety symptoms. Results In the present study, 506 participants were enrolled with an age ranging from 18 to 83 years and a sex ratio equal to 1.9. More than third of participants (38.3%) had experienced anxiety and/or depressive symptoms. Being a woman, younger age, being a student, spending longer time on COVID-19 news, fear of infection in the quarantine facility, having experienced stigma, financial struggle due to the COVID-19 pandemic and dissatisfaction by the accommodations conditions of the quarantine facility were independently associated with occurrence of depression and or anxiety symptoms. Conclusions A high percentage of participants have experienced anxiety or depressive symptoms during the quarantine period.

"Impact of mandatory institutional quarantine on sleep quality: A cross sectional Tunisian study","Background Given the COVID-19 pandemic, Tunisian authorities have imposed quarantine in dedicated centers mainly for travelers coming from countries with highest coronavirus infection rates. Such restrictive measures may have a detrimental impact on people's mental health and can thus affect sleep. We aimed in this study to assess the impact of mandatory institutional quarantine on sleep quality in Tunisia and to determine factors associated with clinical insomnia. Methods Data were collected through a cross sectional study conducted from April to November 2020 among individuals who were in quarantine for 14 days including at least a week in a Tunisian quarantine center. Sleep quality was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index. Factors associated with clinical insomnia were assessed using bivariate and multivariate analysis. Results In the present study, 506 participants were included with a mean age of 37.6Â±13.6 years. Majority (66.4%) were men. Nearly one fifth (19.2%) of surveyed individuals had symptoms of clinical insomnia. In multivariate analysis, we found that being a woman, spending longer time on covid-19 news per day, having experienced stigma during the quarantine period, financial difficulties due to the coronavirus pandemic and dissatisfaction by the accommodation conditions of the quarantine facility were independently associated with clinical insomnia. Conclusions Nearly one fifth of participants had clinical insomnia during the quarantine period. Providing a good sleep environment, educating sleep healthy behavior and giving adequate psychological support to quarantined individuals in quarantine centers is necessary.

"COVID-19 impact on the health and emotional well-being of the general population","A tremendous number of studies describe results on the evolution of the COVID-19 impact on infected patients, hospital admissions, deaths, mental health and well-being of the population. However, there are hardly any reports on its impact and evolution since the beginning of the pandemic with clinical, contextual and individual perception information. Our work describes the research project called Health Care and Social Survey (ESSOC, Encuesta Sanitaria y SOCial). It arises from the need to provide specific, reliable, early, and timely data on the impact of COVID-19 that can be considered when making decisions to prepare and provide an effective Public Health response in the different affected populations. It is linked to official statistical operations included in the Andalusian Regional Government and has also been granted a favorable opinion by the Research Ethics Committee. The ESSOC is based on a Real-World Data design. It integrates observational data extracted from multiple sources including information based on surveys and clinical, epidemiological, population, and environmental registries. The surveys have an overlapping panel design with a total of over 22,000 effective interviews being carried out over three years from the beginning of the state of alarm in Spain. Their geographical scope is the Autonomous Region of Andalusia (8.4MM people, the fifth most populated region in Europe), and the population scopes are general population, population residing in disadvantaged areas, and population over the age of 55. The conceptual approach of this study encompasses all aspects affecting health that will contribute to an extraordinary increase in the current knowledge of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its results will be very useful for cross-disciplinary comparisons in population-based studies, and the methodology developed will serve as a model to be applied in other epidemiological studies. Key messages It is needed to provide specific, reliable, early, and timely data on the impact of COVID-19 that can be considered when making decisions to prepare and provide an effective Public Health response.

"Dutch Public health Foresight Study, in the light of COVID-19","Background The future consequences of the corona pandemic for health are significant but uncertain. The Dutch Public health Foresight Study-2020 (PHFS-2020) analyses future trends in health status, determinants, prevention and care, in the light of COVID-19. The pandemic impacts health directly through COVID-19 and indirectly through changes in lifestyle, reduced regular care and socio-economic developments. Methods The Dutch PHFS-2020 applies a scenario approach which explores short- and long-term trends and their possible effect on health and health care. A Trendscenario is used, in combination with three scenarios for the future course of the pandemic and socio-economic developments. Based on these scenarios, societal challenges for the future are identified. Results In 2020, COVID-19 was the most important causes of death in 2020, life expectancy was almost a year lower and the disease burden of the first wave was almost five times higher than an average flu season. The increase in overweight and smoking will lead to more health loss in the future, including increased mortality. The negative impacts of reduced health care and mental health are already visible and might worsen in the future. The socio-economic and intergenerational divides might become more prominent. Conclusions The PHFS-2020 shows that indirect effects of the crisis might be taken into account when considering future policy interventions targeting COVID-19. Negative impacts on mental health, possible increase of health inequalities and the long term effects of changes in life style are important indirect effects to be considered by policy makers. Next, a further ageing population might increase the vulnerability for possible future outbreaks.

"Asylum seekers experiences with quarantine after arriving in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, newly arriving asylum seekers undergo mandatory quarantine in many European countries. Quarantine is likely to amplify pre-existing strains associated with asylum seeking, including limited autonomy and barriers for care-seeking. Our objectives were a) to elicit asylum seekers experiences with quarantine regarding their mental health and needs and b) to explore how they assess the measure. Methods We conducted 9 semi-structured interviews with asylum seekers in a German reception centre (July-December 2020). Individuals with quarantine experience who spoke German, English or French were invited to participate. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically with an inductive-deductive approach. Funding: German Federal Agency for Health Education (BZgA). Results The participants (2 women, 6 men and a couple from Syria, Algeria, Yemen, Bangladesh and Cameroon) experienced the quarantine as a difficult situation and described feeling locked-in and bored. Obsessive thinking, loneliness, sleeping problems and feelings of abandonment were repeatedly reported. Unmet basic needs (e.g. special foods, cleaning tools, shampoo, Wi-Fi) and unclarity about access to social or emergency help further impaired wellbeing in some cases. In view of negative PCR test results, the rationale of mandatory quarantine was questioned by some. Assessments of the quarantine varied: Some favoured individual responsibility, physical distancing and hygiene measures over quarantine, while others considered it necessary for health protection despite the strains entailed. Conclusions Quarantine can be a considerable stressor for asylum seekers. In this explorative study, shortcomings in the provision of daily necessities and information were visible. Potential adverse impacts of quarantine on wellbeing should be minimised through ensuring its comprehensibility, the supply of daily needs and low-threshold access to psychosocial support. Key messages Quarantine can be a significant stressor for newly arriving asylum seekers. Quarantine-induced stress should be minimised through appropriate information, the provision of daily necessities and psychosocial support.","Rast, E.; Perplies, C.; Biddle, L.; Bozorgmehr, K.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.863","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22228,""
"11H Workshop: Epidemiology of diseases and health inequalities in people with and without intellectual disabilities","All people have a right to equal healthcare without discrimination on the basis of disabilities. In practice, however, health inequalities still remain. Ideally we would define future public health having sufficient attention to minority groups and their specific needs. One of these groups is people with intellectual disabilities (ID), defined by severe limitations in adaptive and functional behaviour. As a result of these limitations, people with ID suffer from worse health, higher hospitalisation rates and higher premature mortality compared to people without ID. In reducing these health inequalities acquiring accurate information on disease epidemiology in people with ID compared to those without ID is crucial. However, this crucial information is still lacking. This workshop will dive into disease epidemiology in people with ID by highlighting different aspects of health and the difficulties that arise when researching people with ID. First, It has been proven difficult to identify ID in existing data sources. ID-diagnoses in medical records are not too reliable, physicians do not always recognise IDs, or people are embarrassed of their ID-diagnosis. By gaining information on received services or supports specifically for people with ID a more complete representation of the ID-population is gained. Second, prevalence rates on chronic diseases in people with ID are often inconsistent across the literature, probably due to different age and sex patterns of chronic diseases and chronic comorbidities compared to people without ID, but these patterns are often not taken into account. By reporting on chronic disease prevalence and comorbidity patterns in people with versus without ID, a novel insight is gained in comparative epidemiology of chronic diseases of people with and without ID. Third, although it is known that people with mild ID suffer more mental health disorders dan people with no ID, exact prevalence rates and data on the care provided to these people in mental health services is missing. A retrospect database study performed in Dutch mental health care gives insight in this knowledge gap, not only for those people whom are recorded with their mild ID in these mental health services, but also for those people who were not recorded as such. Fourth, the current pandemic of a novel infectious disease stresses the strong need for accurate knowledge of disease epidemiology, particularly concerning high-risk groups such as people with ID. A large-scale registration of COVID-19 in people with ID living in residential settings was developed in the Netherlands, to provide necessary insight in the medical impact of COVID-19 among people with ID and inform policy makers and care providers on specific risks and consequences of COVID-19 in the ID population as compared with the general population. Key messages Insight in disease epidemiology and disease care in people with intellectual disabilities compared to people without intellectual disabilities is crucial in reducing health inequalities. Although it is difficult to identify all people with intellectual disabilities in data sources, using multiple methods and data sources results in a more complete overview of this group of people.","","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.831","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22229,""
"Religiosity and mental health as aspects of comprehensiveness in care; Religiosidad y salud mental como aspectos de la atenciÃ³n integral; Religiosidade e saÃºde mental como aspecto da integralidade no cuidado","ABSTRACT  Objective: to understand how religiosity can influence the health of individuals diagnosed with mental disorders, based on comprehensive care.  Methods: this is an integrative literature review, with the inclusion of articles in Portuguese, English and Spanish, between 2010 and 2018.  Results: the critical analysis and qualitative synthesis of the 24 selected studies were categorized into two subtopics: The influence of religiosity in promoting comprehensive mental health care; Mental health versus religiosity: influencing conditions for effective access to comprehensive care.  Final considerations: a positive influence of religiosity was identified in the lives of individuals diagnosed with mental disorders; however, evidence shows that health teams do not feel comfortable and prepared to work with religiosity as an expression of spirituality. This being one of the dimensional aspects of health, it can be inferred, on the results, the existence of this gap in the comprehensive care approach.; RESUMEN  Objetivo: comprender cÃ³mo la religiosidad puede influir en la salud de las personas diagnosticadas con trastornos mentales, a partir de una atenciÃ³n integral.

"Inequalities in COVID-19â€™s collateral public health damage in Vienna","Background Although lockdown measures are effective in containing the spread of COVID-19, such societal shutdowns may be accompanied by collateral public health damage. We aimed to assess potential inequalities in the distribution of adverse health-related and socioeconomic outcomes related to this pandemic for an urban Central European context. Methods Using a stratified random sample of 1004 participants living in Vienna, the capital of Austria with approximately 2 million inhabitants, this study analysed the distribution of 10 adverse health-related and socioeconomic outcomes attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic across socioeconomic strata. Data were collected between April, 27th and May, 17th 2020. Outcomes comprised a worsened economic situation, worsened self-reported mental and physical health, and a suspected or diagnosed infection with COVID-19 of the participant or someone close. Socioeconomic position (SEP) was indicated by income, education, and household overcrowding. We estimated differences in the incidence rates of our 10 outcomes by SEP using zero-inflated Poisson and logistic regression models adjusted for age and gender. Results Analysing the total number of experienced adverse outcomes, participants in the lowest and second lowest SEP category experienced a higher incidence rate (IRR=1.333[95%CI: 1.079 - 1.639] and IRR=1.447[95%CI: 1.190 - 1.760] respectively) compared to participants in the highest SEP category. Inequalities were highest for the outcomes job loss, worsened financial situation, and worse mental health. Different measurements of SEP yielded similar results, however, inequalities were most visible across income groups. Conclusions These results add to the rapidly accumulating evidence on the unequally distributed burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased awareness about effect heterogeneity across SEP indicators will help to identify those in most urgent need of supportive policies. Key messages During the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Vienna, its health-related and socioeconomic burden has been disproportionately carried by people in low socioeconomic positions. Inequalities in the incidence rate of adverse COVID-19-related outcomes were highest across income groups and for the outcomes job loss, worse financial situation, and worse mental health.","Oberndorfer, M.; Dorner, T.

"11B Workshop: COPERS - an international longitudinal study on coping and resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Mental health and resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge for all indivduals. While evidence is emerging that the COVID pandemic has affected mental health of everybody, at this point, no comparable data about the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic impact on mental health and resilience on citizens in Europe are available. We aim to fill this gap in knowledge. Methods We conducted a longitudinal study in eight European countries including 18+ year old individuals using mixed methods sampling (e.g. convenience sampling, panel data sampling). Main outcomes were depression, anxiety, post-traumatic symptoms and resilience. Depression was assessed with the PHQ-9, anxiety with the GAD-7, substance use with the Audit, resilience with the BRS and the CD-RISK, stress symptoms with the Impact of Event Scale (IES-R). We assessed as potentially influencing factors socio-demographic factors (location, age, gender, education, profession, living situation), and COVID-19 specific factors, furthermore we investigated social support, social capital, loneliness, and domestic violence and alcohol consumption (AUDIT). We analyze every measurement point, starting from the baseline data, cross-sectional and longitudinally. For the longitudinal analyses, multiple linear regression analyses, simple logistic regression analyses, and multinomial logistic regression analyses are conducted to examine resilience trajectories. Furthermore, to simultaneously control for many variables that potentially confound the relationship between a mental health and resilience, propensity score matching is applied. Results In total as of 30. April. 2,442 individuals participated (female: n = 1,582 (64.8%), male: n = 672 (27.5%), diverse: n = 5 (0.2%), missing: n = 183 (7.5%) as well as an age bias (Median=33, Mean=36.30, SD = 14,46, age range=18years-80 years.

"Loss of meaning in activities during Covid-19 lockdown and association with low mental health in Belgian adults 50+","Introduction Engagement in meaningful activities (MA) is significantly associated with morbidity, mental health and mortality, regardless age. However, it is known that a gender difference occurs in daily activities: men choose significantly more for leisure activities, work or study, while women opt more for domestic work and social activities. During the covid-19 lockdown, it can be expected that men and women experience the severe restrictions differently. In this study we wanted to identify differences regarding restriction in MA and mental health in particular for men and women 50 y and older. Methods In Belgium, strict measures were imposed between March 13 and May 4th. During this lockdown, a large-scale web-survey with more than 2000 Belgian respondents, has been carried out. In total, 420 people 50+ participated (237 women/183 men). Results The lockdown had a major impact on the daily activities and mental health of everyone, but slightly more on those of women 50+. They scored significantly lower in engaging in MA as measured by the Engagement in Meaningful Activities Scale (EMAS) (31.36;sd 7.09 versus 33.78;sd 6.35;p.001) and experienced worse mental health measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) (13.80;sd 6.70 versus 11.59;sd 5.87;p&lt;.000) than men 50+. The correlation between EMAS en GHQ was respectively .510 and .540 (p &lt;.000). The MA women attach more importance to could no longer be continued while the typical male activities still could be practiced (even more). Moreover, the daily caring activities, in which women are already more active anyway, interfered much more with the other activities than usual. Conclusions The extent to which activities remained meaningful during the lockdown was crucial. It was obvious that 50-+ women found less meaning in their activities during corona and experienced less mental health. Subsequently, women 50+ turned out to be slightly more vulnerable than men 50+ during the Covid-19 crisis.","De Vriendt, P.; Cruyt, E.; Van de Velde, D.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.793","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22233,""
"Older adultsâ€™ daily activities during lockdown in France, spring 2020: a cross sectional survey","Background The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic prompted many countries to go into lockdown for varying periods. The French population was limited to 1km around their house, with the need to have a travel declaration when going out. According to the World Federation of Occupational Therapists (2020), â€œpopulations around the world have been required to adjust and make compensations to usual routines in order to participate in ongoing or newly acquired activities that are necessary for daily life.â€ AIMS. In this context, we aimed to describe changes in daily activities, social contacts, and mental health and wellbeing of older adults (i.e. aged 60 or more) living in France. Methods We performed an online cross-sectional survey, based on the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) for restriction of and satisfaction with daily activities, and the Cantril's ladder for mental health and wellbeing. RESULTS. Of the 512 respondents, 9% did not feel restricted at all in their daily activities, and 13% reported no change. About one third (31%) reported to have less diverse activities than usual but to be satisfied with it. Regarding social contacts, 72% of the respondents reported to have a lot more contacts than usual with their relatives. Concerning the type of activities, 2477 restricted activities could be identified, but also 2190 that were done more often during the lockdown. Most restricted ones concerned leisure (83%), especially active leisure, the most mentioned being walking. The more engaged activities also concerned leisure (73%), especially quiet recreation, the most mentioned reading. The median value of Cantril's ladder was 5 [4;7]. Conclusions Lockdown measures led to some activity restrictions for older adults, but also offered opportunities for new engagements. Remarkably was the increase in social contacts with relatives, probably related to the use of new technologies.","Engels, C.; SÃ©gaux, L.; Lafont, C.; CanouÃ¯-Poitrine, F.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.792","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22234,""
"Resilience and optimism associated with mental health to subjective well-being in older adults 65+ during pandemic outbreak","Background During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, older adults are more likely to experience limitations in activities for daily living and social isolation and thus at greater risk for decline in mental and cognitive health. The current study examined how older adults' resilience and optimism affected mental and emotional well-being in the midst of pandemic crisis. Methods The study used data sampled from two waves of the Eurofound COVID-19 survey collected from 27 European countries in April, during the first lockdown, and July 2020 when restrictions and measures were mildly lifted-up. The first round sample included 11,211 older adults (Mean age = 69.71 Â± 5.15, 70% females, 86% retired) and second round sample included 4,424 (Mean age = 69.93 Â± 4.47, 61% females). Analysis focused on resilience, optimism, WHO Well-being Index, psychological distress, and subjective well-being (self-rated health, life satisfaction, happiness). Covariates included socio-demographic information and financial and health care situations since pandemic crisis. Results Mental health, subjective well-being, and psychological distress in older adults tended to change over time, while resilience and optimism were relatively stable. Regression analysis indicated that older adults who scored higher for resilience and optimism reported greater life satisfaction and happiness, better health perception, higher levels of mental health, and lower psychological distress when controlled for socio-demographic variables and adversities related to pandemic outbreak. Conclusions Resilience and optimism might have a potential to help older adults cope with exposure to stressful life events and later life adversity, but inconclusive. Future studies should more precisely examine the role of resilience and optimism in promoting mental health in older adults, its formation and protective mechanism, to better incorporate these factors into life-long education and interventions for older adults.","Lee, S.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.791","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22235,""
"10P Workshop: Mental health of older people","Due to a general health deterioration, decline in functional ability, accumulated stressful events related to loss and bereavement, and unfavorable socio-economic circumstances, older adults are known to be vulnerable to the development of mental health problems, sometimes leading to serious mental disorders. Approximately 20% of adults aged 60 and over, suffer nowadays from a mental or neurological disorder. This problem is possibly even more distinct in the context of the recent Covid-19 pandemic where health protecting measurements like restricting physical and social contact, disproportionally affect the mental health of older people who are already at higher risk of social isolation and loneliness. However, according to the WHO, mental health impairment in older people is still a highly under-identified, and under-estimated public health issue, often surrounded by shame and stigma, which hinders an adequate mental health promoting approach in this population. This workshop wants to contribute to new findings in the role that certain factors can play in protecting and promoting the mental health of older people. Research during circumstances of a crisis, like the Covid-19 pandemic, may reveal new insights in this context, although the long-term effects are not yet clear, and longstanding factors may not be overlooked. Dr Sunwoo Lee (Czech Republic) performed a large survey about mental health of older adults in 27 European countries and will discuss the important role that resilience and optimism can play in promoting mental health in older adults in the midst of a pandemic crisis. Dr. Cynthia Engels (France) investigated changes in daily activities and mental health of older adults during the lockdown period in France. She will report about the most important changes found and what it meant for peoples' wellbeing and social contacts. Prof. Patricia De Vriendt (Belgium) further focused on the daily activities of older men and women during the Covid lockdown in Belgium and discovered a significant gender difference in the extent to which they succeed to engage in meaningful activities during this crisis. She will discuss how crucial this meaning in activities is for older adults to maintain in good mental health. Finally, Prof. Jutta Lindert (Germany and US) will share the rather surprising findings of a large nationwide study in the United States among older adults showing how daily discrimination is related to impaired cognitive functioning in older men and women. She points to the importance of reducing discrimination, especially when the Covid-crisis is behind us, as an important factor in supporting mental health in this older population. Key messages Resilience, optimism and meaningful activities are important factors in mental health promotion for older adults. Discrimination has a negative impact on older adults' cognitive function.","","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.790","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22236,""
"Mental health and access of care during Covid-19 pandemics: an italian cross-sectional study","Background COVID-19 emergency forced nations to introduce containment measures to reduce the spread of the virus. This study assessed the possible effects of the pandemic on mental health and care access. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Italy in two observation periods in 2020: April-May (first lockdown) and November-December (no lockdown). Categorical variables were compared with <U+03C7>2 tests. Mental health outcomes (PHQ-2 = 3;or GAD-2 = 3) and outcomes related to care access were considered. Multivariable logistic regression models were performed. Results Participants were 2673 (66.8% female;mean age=44 years, SD = 15). Depressive symptoms were found in 24.7% of participants, while 24.2% showed an anxious symptomatology. A total of 12.5% said they voluntarily gave up scheduled medical service, 6.4% avoided acute treatments, and 5% changed therapy themselves. Comparing the two periods, there were no significant differences in the outcomes under study. Students were at higher risk of depressive symptoms (OR = 2.23;95% CI 1.42-3.52;p = 0.001). Women and those who increased the time on internet presented an increased risk of developing depressive and anxious symptomatology. The scheduled medical service was mainly postponed by those who said they were afraid to go out of necessity (OR = 2.49;95% CI 1.87-3.32;p &lt; 0.001) or to cause themselves an injury (OR = 1.78;95% CI 1.32-2.40;p &lt; 0.001). Foreigners (OR = 4.24;95% CI 1.70-10.55;p &lt; 0.002) are more likely to avoid acute treatment. Workers and those with anxious disorders appear to be more inclined to self-medicate (OR = 2.05;95% CI 1.29-3.26;p = 0.003). Conclusions Compared to the pre-pandemic period, higher levels of anxiety and depression were observed. No differences in mental health and care access were shown between the two observation periods. Being afraid to go out of necessity and avoidance of physical activity for fear of injury is related to reduced access to care, but not to self-medication. Key messages The 24.7 % of the sample reported depressive symptoms, and 24.2 % anxious symptoms. Similar increases were observed in both periods: April-May (first lockdown) and November-December (no lockdown). During the pandemic, delayed access to planned and acute care, avoidance of physical activity for fear of injury, and self-medication pose a major public health challenge in the coming period.","Previti, C.; Gualano, M.

"Evaluating rapid review provision to inform policy during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Evidence based decision making is central to population health, particularly during a pandemic. Few studies examine the production and use of evidence in decision-making during crisis management. This study describes and evaluates the provision of rapid evidence products by a single agency to support national decision making. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of evidence providers (who gathered and disseminated the required evidence) and service users (policy makers). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. Quantitative data of work activity were summarised descriptively. Results Three themes were generated from the data: the work, the use and the future, with a fourth theme cross-cutting across these: the team. The work followed clear protocols and was centrally managed. The scope and changing nature of the evidence were highlighted as issues. The service providers reported a strong sense of team work and â€˜being in this together', however, the majority of the participants felt that the workload was huge and exhausting and not sustainable long-term. Overall the service users thought the rapid evidence synthesis was indispensable to the decision-making process and had trust and confidence in the work, largely based on existing working relationships with the team. While they recognised that the evidence synthesis support would be an essential component of the continued pandemic response, they did query the sustainability of the process and reflected on the amount of work the team performed. Conclusions This evaluation, drawing on qualitative data, has highlighted that, across the services users and evidence providers, the support provided by HIQA was generally perceived as positive. From the service users' perspective, having access to the team was indispensable to the decision making process. However, the sustainability of the work load was identified as a major challenge.","Clyne, B.; Byrne, P.; Smith, S.

"10E Workshop: SDGs as a roadmap for Citizens, Environment and Public Health","Sustainability, especially in an era of growth health inequality, is one of the most important challenges facing health systems around the world. Environmental sustainability is responsibly interacting with the planet to maintain natural resources and not jeopardize the ability for future generations to meet their needs. The SDGs put environmental sustainability at the center of sustainable development. Environmental health is the branch of public health concerning all aspects of the natural and built environment affecting human health. It is targeted towards preventing disease and creating health-supportive environments. It encompasses the assessment and control of those environmental factors that can potentially affect health, as pollution, poverty and inadequate energy solution. Urban health is an intersectoral arena that links both the public health and the urban planning sectors, mainly captured by SDG3 and SDG11. Cities as human settlements, recognizes the transformative power of urbanization and represents a pivotal step to empower cities., and making a city â€œsmarterâ€. Cities as human settlements, recognizes the transformative power of urbanization and represents a pivotal step to empower cities., and making a city â€œsmarterâ€. There is a tight relationship between the concepts of environmental health and urban health. Urban health could be considered as a complex system since it deals with 15 out of 17 SDGs. Huge global changes are occurring on our planet in natural and urban environments. The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is a strong reminder that urbanization has changed the way that people and communities live, work, and interact, and it is necessary to boost actions and policies aimed to transform our cities into healthier and â€œsalutogenicâ€ living environments.We shoudn't exclude energy issues -SDG 7, and presence of increasing poverty SDG1 in urban areas. It is essential to redesign the concept of public health in relation to the built environment and the contemporary cities adopting healthy urban planning and design strategies. The environment interacts with technology by providing the resources needed for technological development and is affected by the environmental impact of technology. Artificial intelligence (AI) might impact all aspects of sustainable development goals influencing the ability to meet all SDGs. Benefits from AI could be derived by the possibility of analyzing large-scale interconnected databases to develop joint actions focused on preserving the environment. The AI-based algorithms are now going beyond the provision of urban services and the maintenance of urban infrastructure, entering the realms of urban governance, planning, health, and safety. Thus, it is essential to leverage on the potential of AI and digital technologies in addressing the complex challenges of urban health. Smart Cities and AI brings a multidisciplinary, integrated approach, examining how the digital and physical worlds are converging. Key messages In pledging to achieve the SDGs, countries need to organize Urban Health initiatives to improve the built, social, economic, and physical environments promoting health and sustainability globally. Governments, private sector, civil societies and citizens alike to allow cities to become inclusive, safer, resilient and sustainable, which are driving forces to implement the development equation.","","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.730","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22239,""
"Stroke as an Antecedent Risk Factor for Depression among Post-Menopausal Women","Background As many as one out of every three individuals develop depression after stroke. Numerous studies have also shown a link between depression and increased rates of mortality after stroke. Additionally, the risk factors and characteristics of stroke are different between men and women. However, the association between stroke and depression has not been investigated in postmenopausal women in a nationally representative sample. Methods The association between currently active depression [score = 10 on a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 scale] and self-reported history of stroke were assessed among participants from the 2005-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). All post-menopausal women from the nationally representative NHANES study were included in the analysis. Multivariable complex samples logistic regression was used to calculate multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of depression. Results Out of the 3,636 (representative sample=44,110,822) postmenopausal women, the mean age was 62.6 Â± 0.33. The ethnic distribution was 77.3% non-Hispanic Whites, 10.9% non-Hispanic Blacks, 7.5% Hispanics, and 4.3% other nationalities. In age-adjusted analysis, individuals with a history of stroke had 2.5-fold higher odds of active depression than those without a history of stroke (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.57-4.19, p &lt; .001). Controlling for vascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, C-reactive protein, and BMI) of depression and socio-demographic risk factors (age, ethnicity, and income level) attenuated the effect (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.17-3.99, p &lt; .05). Conclusions A significant association between previous stroke and current depression was found in this population, independent of vascular disease risk measures among post-menopausal women. These findings highlight the possible importance of screening for and treating depression among stroke survivors. Longitudinal studies need to be conducted assessing the mental health impact of stroke. Key messages Occurrence of stroke may lead to an increased likelihood of depression, especially among post-menopausal women. Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, surveillance efforts should include mental health complication including those related to stroke.","Banerjee, S.; Huth, J.; Burkholder, G.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.729","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22240,""
"Research capacity strengthening in health and care delivery through housing for chronic diseases","Background From all buildings, houses are where we spent most of our lives. The impact of housing conditions on health was evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the 2018 Astana Declaration placing integrated delivery of primary health care and public health services across all sectors, a framework that explores health and care in relation to housing remains unexplored. The aim was to determine relevant evidence gaps to building capacity in supportive housing-health care research about chronic diseases and multimorbidity, identify ongoing strains and offer potential solutions. Methods An integrative review was conducted through multiple systematic searches in electronic databases. We employed an interdisciplinary approach integrating several research fields -built environment, clinical and human physiology, environmental health, and public health and health care services- around chronic illness and multimorbidity to understand the depth and scope of linkages. Inductive content analysis was used to describe emerging domains from evidence meeting inclusion criteria. Results We defined a multifaceted framework with priority eight building blocks for action: 1) expanding capacity for chronic care model into the primary care setting;2) scaling up environmental determinants to cover residential spaces;3) implementing acute methodologies for indoor environment risk assessment;4) increasing clinical research applicability into built environment studies;5) recognizing chronic conditions-promoting inflammation physiology;6) qualifying reliable surrogate disease biomarkers in human monitoring;7) enforcing technologies for new forms of outpatient care;and 8) renewing evidence-based healthcare design. Conclusions Future research needs to prioritise articulating these emerging insights through systematic, translational and multisectoral approaches to strengthen health and care delivery through housing design solutions for people living with chronic morbidity. Key messages Integrating the evidence-based design in future interventions may promote transformative changes in housing and public health programmes engaging primary healthcare services for chronic patients. This eco-biopsychosocial supportive framework informs practice to advance research capacity development in enabling health-conducive environments across various levels of care and health promotion.","Hernandez-Garcia, E.; Chrysikou, E.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.721","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22241,""
"Reliability and Validity of the Perception of Stigma due to COVID-19 in Physicians","Background Thinking that they are being stigmatized can negatively affect the mental health of healthcare workers, whose workload has already increased during the epidemic. The aim of the study was to develop the â€˜Perception of Stigma due to COVID-19 in Physicians' (PSCP) and to conduct a validity and reliability study. Methods A 5-point Likert-type 23-item question pool was created. In order to evaluate the content validity, CGI and CGO were calculated by taking expert opinions and 18 items were selected. It was tested with 303 physicians in Turkey to determine the psychometric properties. In order to evaluate the reliability of the scale, internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) analyzes, item analysis and test-retest reliability analysis were performed. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used for construct validity. Results Of the participants 59.1% were female. After analysis, the scale consisted of 10 items and 2 sub-dimensions. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.87 for the environmental stigmatization sub-dimension, 0.76 for the perception of personal stigmatization, and 0.88 for the whole scale. Scale items explained 61.56% of the total variance and factor loads varied between 0.66 and 0.85. Scale fit and fit index were found to be acceptable as a result of CFA. Pearson correlation coefficient calculated for test-retest reliability was 0.63, and intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.70 (95% CI 0.38-0.86, p: 0.001). In the final, the total score that can be taken from the scale was between 0-50. The mean total score obtained from the scale was 24.3 Â± 7.9. Of the physicians 46.9% scored above the average. It was accepted that as the score obtained from the scale increased, the level of perception of stigma caused by COVID-19 increased in physicians. Conclusions PSCP is a valid and reliable tool for assessing perception of COVID-19-induced stigma in healthcare workers. Key messages The scale developed is a tool that can be used in studies aimed at evaluating the stigma perceptions caused by COVID-19 in physicians. During the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians' level of stigma perception obtained with the PSCP scale was high.","Oktar, D.; Gedik, S. Aydogan, Sungur, S.; Onsuz, M.

"Changes in smoking, stress, and sleep duration among Israeli hospital workers during COVID-19","Background Mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among frontline health workers, have been widely noted. The aim of this study was to explore smoking behaviour changes and associations with perceived changes in stress levels and sleep duration among Israeli hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was conducted (May-June, 2020) among employees of a large tertiary medical centre. Data collected included socio-demographic characteristics, smoking status, perceptions of risk for COVID-19 infection and disease severity, presence of a chronic illness, COVID-19 exposure and infection status, involvement in treating COVID-19 patients, changes in stress levels, sleep duration, and in smoking behaviour during the pandemic. Multi-nominal logistic regression modelling assessed the effect of covariates on smoking behaviour changes. Results More than half (59%) of the 920 respondents, reported an increase in stress levels, and 28% reported changes in sleep duration. One-third (35%) of current smokers (n = 132) reported smoking more during COVID-19. Increased smoking was associated with increased stress (OR = 3.45;95% CI 1.2-9.4). In addition, a significant association was demonstrated between an increase in sleeping hours and a decrease in smoking (OR = 6.62, 95% CI 1.2-32). The negative association between changes in smoking and sleep duration was strongest among smokers who reported perceived levels of stress to be the same or slightly higher than pre-COVID-19. Conclusions The mental health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically for health workers, include negative changes in smoking behaviours and sleep patterns. Mental health support for health workers should address smoking behaviours alongside stress-management skills and coping strategies. Lessons learned from the current pandemic should guide us as the world prepares for a future health crisis. Key messages Increased stress was linked with increased smoking among Israeli hospital workers during COVID-19. Mental health support should target smoking together with offering stress-management skills.","Bar-Zeev, Y.; Shauly-Aharonov, M.; Neumark, Y.; Hirshoren, N.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.717","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22243,""
"COVID-19 workplace impacts - Irish OSH professionals experience and observations","Background COVID-19 has had a significant impact on workers, arising from adaptations to control measures and consequent behaviour changes that minimise disease spread in the workplace. From an occupational safety & health (OSH) perspective, understanding how adaptations and behaviour changes have impacted workers is relevant to how organisations can preserve the health of their workers when adapting to future health emergencies. Methods Semi-structured qualitative focus groups were conducted during April/May 2021. Participants were Irish OSH practitioners. Participants volunteered from industrial sectors (public & private) as defined by the Central Statistics Office. Participants (n = 60) partook in one of sixteen, two-hour focus groups (4-6 participants per focus group) with each comprising four themes for discussion: organisational preparedness;organisational impacts;worker impacts;and the future of OSH. Thematic analyses were performed using NVivo. Results Most participants started developing adaptation measures in February/March 2020. Organisations with an international presence started developing adaptation measures earlier. As OSH professionals, most participants felt personally prepared for the challenges induced by the pandemic but did not anticipate the impact it had on their workload. Nearly all participants indicated that isolation, loneliness, fear, and anxiety had a negative impact on their co-workers' mental health. Many OSH practitioners indicated that their co-workers had responded well to the pandemic, and that positive behaviour changes and new adaptation measures had been sustained from the first wave through the third wave of the pandemic in Ireland. Conclusions Workplace mental health evaluations and worker wellbeing initiatives must be prioritised post-pandemic. OSH will need to re-evaluate its relationship with organisational human resources in the future. Key messages Irish OSH practitioners responded well to the challenge presented by COVID-19 to protect their co-workers and maintain organisational continuity. COVID-19 has had a negative impact on the mental health of Irish workers as they respond to preserve their organisationâ€™s operations. This will need to be addressed by organisations post-pandemic.","Buggy, C.; Chen, Y.; Roe, M.; Ingram, C.; Buttner, F.; Perrotta, C.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.716","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22244,""
"The impact of resilience and loneliness during COVID-19 pandemic on youthâ€™s (18 â€“ 25 years old) mental health","Background Mental health, particularly among young adults, has been severely affected during the COVID-19 pandemic, partially because of both forced social isolation measures and loneliness. Numerous papers on the short-term consequences of lockdown measures reported high psychological distress, as well as an increase of depressive and anxiety symptoms and psychotropic drug use. This study evaluated potential risk and protective factors, such as resilience, loneliness, social and family context, in order to detect vulnerable individuals. Methods This prospective longitudinal study was carried out in a two-phase survey: the first one, during lockdown in Spring 2020 (T1), and, the second one, in Summer 2020 (T2), when restrictive measures were slackened. The main outcomes included the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) and the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale. The secondary outcomes included mental health care needs (MHCN), use of psychotropic drugs and family and social contacts. Results This study evaluated risks and protective factors in mental health in 825 emerging adults aged from 18 to 25 years old in Belgium and in Italy. Participants were divided into three groups according to their MHCN before and after lockdown measures. 5% of the participants experienced an increase in MHCN at T1, including the start of a psychotropic treatment. At T1, statistically significant differences were found in mean RSA total scores and RSA Perception of Self scores between groups. At T2, the group who experienced an increase in MHCN displayed a significant decrease of mean loneliness scores compared with the other groups. This decrease is linearly correlated with resilience competencies. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictive measures cause a negative impact on youth's mental health, particularly among vulnerable individuals. Resilience and social contacts are protective factors that need to be taken into account.","Reis, J.; Marchini, S.; Bouziotis, J.; Delhaye, M.; Delvenne, V.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.693","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22245,""
"Spanish adolescentsâ€™ and young adultsâ€™ coping strategies under severe lock-down due to COVID-19: a dialogical research study","Background During spring of 2020, millions of young adults throughout the world were sent home as a measure to contain the spread of COVID-19. In March 2020, Madrid became the city of the world with the highest incidence and mortality rates. By applying a phenomenological approach, this study aimed at gaining in-depth understanding of the subjective mental health experiences lived by Spanish young adults. Methods dialogical research was used to interact with AYA and young adults. AYA were recruited using the network of networks and snowball strategies. 36 were initially contacted and 35 decided to participate. All participants were informed of their right to stop the dialogue at any time without providing any further explanation to the researcher, and were informed of the data protection rules of the University of Copenhagen. All signed an informed consent. The 35 dialogues were held online using Zoom, recorded and saved in a secured folder.. The dialogues lasted on average 55 minutes, were transcribed with Nvivo Transcription software. The sociological theory on Resonance was used to shape specific segments of the dialogues and to analysis the data. Results 35 online dialogues with 20 adolescent girls and 15 adolescent boys aged from 17 to 23 were held from the second to the 28 of April 2020. The majority of youth did not leave their residences for 2 months. Three of them lost relatives due to COVID-19, one was admitted at the hospital and seven had relatives who contracted the disease. Different themes were brought up: 1) AYA' relations with their physical spaces and with time. 2) Relating with others. 3) Strategies to overcome sense of alienation, loss and fear and to re-find resonance. AYA living with chronic or mental diseases realized the importance of developing supportive habits and of adhering to treatments. Conclusions Dialogical research allowed youth to reflect upon their experiences and abilities to cope with the shock a provoked by COVID-19.","Arevalo, L.

"Mental health in Swiss university students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background University students were confronted with abrupt changes by the COVID-19 lock-down in their personal and academic lives. The â€œHealth in Students during the Corona pandemicâ€ study investigated the impact on mental health and health behaviors of Swiss university students. Methods April 2020 all students of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (N = 12,431) were invited to a repeated cross-sectional open cohort survey, participation ranged from T0 20% - T5 13%. Generalized anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS) and depression (PHQ-9) were investigated with descriptive and multivariate analyses. Latent class analyses (LCA) was applied to identify groups who differed in perception of impact on daily and student life. PHQ-9 results were compared with pre-pandemic data matched for age, sex and education. Results At T0 mean age was 26.5 (sd 5.6), 69% were female. Participants were similar across all surveys. LCA yielded three classes of perceived impact: 1 (low, n = 675), 2 (moderate, n = 1098), and 3 (strong, n = 656). At T0 adjusted proportion of moderate to severe anxiety was significantly higher in class 3 (45% (95% CI: 28.0-62.0), compared to 2 (15.5%, 95% CI: 13.1-17.9) and 1 (5.1%, 95% CI: 4.7-5.6). Class 3 showed significantly higher odds of high stress levels (class 3: OR = 28.4;95% CI: 15.5 - 52.0;p = 0.000;class 2: OR = 2.8;95% CI: 1.5 - 5.3;p = 0.002) compared to other students. Anxiety and stress levels declined with time. The adjusted prevalence of depressive symptoms in females (30.8% (95% CI: 28.6-33.0)) and males (24.8% (95% CI: 21.7-28.1) was substantially higher than in a matching pre-pandemic national sample of young women (10.9% (95% CI: 8.9-13.2)) and men (8.5% (6.6-11.0)). Depressive symptoms between T0 and T3 did not decline. Conclusions Students reported high anxiety, stress and depressive symptoms during the pandemic.

"9P Workshop: Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures on the mental health in youth","The Coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented public health crisis impacting all age groups and all areas of society, irrespective of the risk of exposure or disease severity. In fact, containment measures put into place, such as social distancing, limiting mobility or closing of schools, carry risks for health, especially for mental health. This is particularly true for youth, defined as the age-group that spans from adolescence into young adulthood (15 - 24 yrs.). In this life phase youth are expected to acquire important social and intellectual skills, make decisions on their professional path, as well as master the transition from adolescence into young adulthood. It is further characterized by increasing independence from family and a high relevance of peer-groups. While this age group is so far not considered to be at high risk for serious SARS-CoV 2 disease, the epidemiological data indicating high incidence, but mostly mild symptoms and a low mortality risk, they are impacted by containment measures and concern for their parents and grandparents. First evidence indicates a rise in mental health problems with potential long-term impact. We present four studies with data collected during the lock-down or pandemic, of which three are set in the setting â€œtertiary educationâ€. The workshop presents data from four European countries. While the first three studies present cross-sectional and longitudinal data on mental health outcomes in students during the pandemic and the uptake of treatment, the fourth presents qualitative data on coping mechanisms applied by youth. Key messages Young people are at risk to develop short and long-term mental health conditions due to the abrupt changes and challenges in their lives due to the Corona pandemic. Academic institutions offer a setting to reach young people, to provide low-threshold support and strengthen resilience to reduce the pandemic impact on young peoplesâ€™ health.","","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.689","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22248,""
"Prenatal mental and physical health, behaviours, and maternity care experiences during the COVID-19","Background During pregnancy, women's mental and physical health, health behaviours, and experiences of maternity care can have significant implications for obstetric, maternal and child outcomes. These factors can be impacted by adverse life-events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Aim This study examined pregnant women's mental and physical health, health behaviours, and experiences of maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An international online survey was conducted in June and July 2020. Pregnant women self-reported levels of general stress, pregnancy-specific stress and COVID-19 related stress. Women also self-reported their mental and physical health, general health behaviours and COVID-19 related health behaviours. Maternity care experiences were reported using closed and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics and thematic analyses were used for quantitative and qualitative data respectively. Results 573 pregnant women from 15 countries participated. Women reported high levels of pregnancy-specific and COVID-19-related stress, and low levels of mental and physical health, during the pandemic. Women reported distress related to restrictions implemented in their maternity care that limited in-person interactions with healthcare professionals and partner attendance at antenatal appointments. Lack of information on COVID-19 and pregnancy also led to uncertainty for women about pregnancy and birth. Encouragingly, pregnant women reported high levels of adherence to public health advice and healthy prenatal behaviours. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic is having significant adverse effects on the mental and physical health of pregnant women. Population level interventions targeting pregnancy- and pandemic-specific stress are needed to better support the mental and physical health of women during the on-going pandemic and minimise adverse outcomes for women and children. Key messages The COVID-19 pandemic is significantly adversely impact the mental and physical health of pregnant women, indicating need for population level interventions for prenatal mental and physical health. Restrictions in maternity care and uncertainty about COVID-19 impacts are key determinant of adverse prenatal physical and mental health outcomes.","Matvienko-Sikar, K.; Pope, J.; Olander, E.; Leitao, S.; Meaney, S.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.686","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22249,""
"COVID-19 in Central and Eastern Europe","Issue Countries of central and eastern Europe (CEE) are rarely accustomed to praise when compared to their western European neighbors. During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, as core European countries such as Italy, Spain, or the United Kingdom reported hundreds of confirmed cases and even deaths per day, all CEE countries managed to contain the disease with considerably lower rates of infection and deaths. Description This changed in late summer and fall of 2020, when many CEE countries overtook western Europe in the number of new COVID-19 cases, as well as deaths, per population, but for a few months the region could enjoy its unusual accomplishment. A number of hypotheses have been suggested to explain the surprising containment success in the spring, including the widespread prevalence of the bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin tuberculosis vaccine, lower population density and exposure to tourism, lack of trust in the healthcare system and government in general, low testing numbers (which may have led to underreporting of cases), and an autocratic advantage leaders of imperfect democracies, such as in CEE, enjoy when imposing lockdowns and other restrictive policies. Results In the spring, CEE governments implemented strict measures to protect public health at a time when their countries had few COVID-19 cases and deaths at most in the single digits. Lessons The Russian approach to addressing COVID-19 reflects the messiness of classifying â€œregime type.â€ Some of the responses used were more authoritarian in their approach. A greater flow of information and more transparency in the data would allow a more complete assessment of Russia's response to COVID-19. Main messages Creating a â€œvirus of silence,â€ short- cutting global standards for vaccine clinical trials, and not providing disaggregated and timely data make it difficult to evaluate the reasons for Russia's relatively low case count and low fatality rate.","King, E.; Loblova, O.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.679","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22250,""
"Healthcare service provision and injuries in the time of COVID-19 pandemic: A legal and regulatory perspective","This study will describe the current legal and regulatory frameworks implemented during the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, assessing how well they worked. It will offer insights regarding coverage and reimbursement for specific health and social care services for people having suffered severe injuries in the context of providing work under particular circumstances, often far removed from their regular working space. Working environments and spaces, as well as overall working conditions, have been radically changed in a sudden and unexpected way. Jobs have been placed at risk, with many disproportionally affected by the lack of supporting mechanisms. New working routines have impacted the lives of many, altering not only working, but also disrupting living patterns. There is a strong emerging need to adapt the legal and regulatory framework related to health and social care services provision, in terms of prevention but also in relation to coverage and reimbursement. New injury patterns and new forms of injury, incl. in relation to mental health, have arisen. They are coupled with burden-of-proof challenges and the need to rebalance social rights. Unprecedented legal and regulatory measures were required to mitigate the social and economic effects of this global health emergency on businesses, workers and citizens. In this context of limitation of individual rights and social freedoms, questions of implementation of EU and international conventions arose (TFEU, ECHR, ILO), while legal and regulatory measures had to be enacted in order to create effective framework for pricing and reimbursement of the specific injuries, during emerging circumstances. Balancing sustainability, burden-of-proof issues and social rights through a comprehensive methodological framework can help resolve ambiguities that often leaded to litigation and, at the same time, resolve the issues of proportionality and legitimate aim in terms of the adopted regulations.","Lingri, D.; Petelos, E.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.667","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22251,""
"Injury inequalities in the European Region: trends cross-country and within-country and potential COVID-19 impacts","We will provide a review of the knowledge base from studies on injuries in the WHO European Region from 2010 to 2019, both cross-country and within-country, for all causes and cause-specific. The focus is whether inequalities between countries and within countries persist such that people from low socioeconomic status and from less affluent areas tend to die by injury to a greater extent than others. This has previously been observed for most causes of injury (e.g., traffic, self-directed violence, interpersonal violence, poisoning, burns) but also for several settings (e.g., home, work, transport) based on a review of socioeconomic disparities in injury risks from 1990-2006. In addition, the pandemic touches upon factors with a known impact, directly or indirectly, on the risk and social distribution of injuries (e.g. social isolation, change in transportation mode and volume, alcohohol consumption, etc.). Until the 2020-2021GBD data are available at the regional level for Europe, we hypothesise on how the pandemic may have affected the social distribution of injuries in the Region. For example, we hypothesise a significant decrease in road traffic related injuries due to lockdown measures (reduced commuting to work, 24-hour curfews). There may also be an increase in unintentional injuries related to children spending increased hours in the home environment and an increase in do-it-yourself injuries in adults. We also see a possible increase in self-harm injuries due to the mental ill health burden related to confinement and social isolation, but data thus far from single EU countries do not report an increase in suicides. We will then present a research agenda for investigating how the pandemic has affected the injury burden in the Europe Region.","Sengoelge, M.; Laflamme, L.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.665","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22252,""
"9L Workshop: Injury epidemiology, treatment, costs and legislation during the COVID-19 pandemic","The recent lockdown and containment measures have brought about major changes in the daily routines of people and this resulted in profound changes in the cause of injury (e.g. traffic, falls, interpersonal violence) and nature of injury (e.g. hip fracture, traumatic brain injury). Despite the changes in the aetiologies, injuries remained frequent throughout the pandemic. Evidence from the COVID-19 period suggest a decrease in road traffic crashes, work and leisure injuries and a noteworthy increase in interpersonal violence and self-harm. These different causes and patterns of injury have brought about changes in the clinical characteristics and demand of health services. Hospitals have experienced organisational constraints with redeployment of medical staff in different units and suspension of non-emergency medical activity. At the same time, new priorities have been set for hospital admissions and new protocols have been developed to guide the emergencies' pathways and clinical/health services approach. Non-essential medical treatment has been postponed with increased risk of delayed treatment, late recovery and mortality from causes different than COVID-19, including injury complications. The impact of COVID-19 in the provision and coverage of health services needs to be urgently mitigated, including the treatment and rehabilitation from physical and psychological effects of untreated injuries. This is expected to place additional pressure on the health systems and increase health care costs. Hospital discharge data are a potentially valuable source of information for injury prevention planning yet there is much work to be done on the improvement of hospital and injury data quality. The workshop aims to discuss the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of injuries, as well as the barriers of maintaining (or even improving) data quality during the different phases of the pandemic. The workshop will further discuss hospital demand and will identify the challenges for the health systems in handling the complex needs of vulnerable patients under serious restrictions. The workshop will also highlight the legal and regulatory measures taken and their level of efficacy in promoting free movement of workers within EU but also the right to work guaranteed under ECHR and ILO Conventions and Declaration. The high human and societal costs as well as inequalities of injury mortality and burden will be highlighted based on comparisons with long-term trends. The workshop will contribute to the identification of evidence-informed strategies and will promote effective planning and optimization of health services response for future pandemics. Key messages The new map of injuries resulting from COVID-19 pandemic is likely to affect health care targets and priorities. Evidence-informed strategies are necessary to capture the magnitude and address the after-COVID effects and the health burden of untreated conditions.","","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.662","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22253,""
"Global comparison of mitigation and vaccine behaviours, motivators, and communication","Issue/problem In an unprecedented effort to end the pandemic, national mitigations strategies have been implemented and highly effective vaccines have been developed and rolled out in record time. Success of many of these public health endeavors is contingent upon people being willing to engage in proposed behaviours. Description of the problem The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 and ending the pandemic, is public adherence to the rapidly evolving behaviour-based government policies. However, adherence to these policies involves implementing behaviour changes that may come with significant personal, social and economic costs. In addition, public health vaccination campaigns are widely available, and the success of these initiatives is dependent on the behaviour of people getting the vaccine. Understanding the determinants of adherence at each phase of the infection curve around the world is critical for effective policy planning and communication. Results The results of the global iCARE study demonstrated a substantial level of national variations, when it comes to engaging in preventive behaviours (social distancing, mask-wearing, hand-washing, self-isolating). Moreover, we observed increasing levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy across several countries. Adherence to these behaviours seems to be driven by socio-demographic (e.g., age, sex, gender, ethnicity, parental status, employment/ student status, built environment, healthcare system factors), psychological (e.g., COVID-19 attitudes, beliefs and concerns), behavioural, physical/mental health, and economic factors. Lessons iCARE study offers deeper understanding and continuous assessment of the predictors of behavioural adherence globally. To this end, the study identified possible communication targets, and proposes tailoring the format and the content of the communication, which should be consistent, prioritize equity, foster transparency and trust-building in different communities.","Lavoie, K.

"Urban Green Spaces and Public Health Outcomes: a systematic review of literature","Background As stressed by COVID-19 pandemic, urbanicity might represent a risk factor for chronic non-communicable diseases or generally impacting on healthy lifestyle, among them physical activity. Methods In light of this, we performed a systematic review aimed to explore the association between urban greenspaces and two important health indicators for both mental and physical health. In particular, our aims were to analyze the association between publicly accessible urban greenspaces exposure, and mental health outcomes (MH) and objectively-measured physical activity (PA). The review was conducted from 2000/01/01 to 2020/09/30 searching in two electronic databases: PubMed/Medline and Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE). Only articles in English were included. Results Out of 356, a total of 34 studies were included in our review, of which 19 assessed MH outcomes, the remaining dealt with PA. Only a few included studies found a non-effect or a negative effect on MH outcomes, whereas, all the others demonstrated a positive effect of urban greenspace and both MH and PA. However, our results stressed not only the importance of green space presence, but also the importance of maintenance, renovation, closeness to residential areas, the presence of interactive activities, and perceived security aspects. Conclusions To conclude, even some methodological limitations of the included studies, results are concordant in demonstrating that urban greenspaces show potentially beneficial effects on mental health and physical activity. Our results are significant for public health experts and policymakers involved in urban planning, community health promotion, and improvement of health and social equity. Key messages Urban green spaces are important factors, impacting on both physical and mental health. Policymakers involved in urban planning should pay more attention in urban green spaces.","Gianfredi, V.; Buffoli, M.; Rebecchi, A.; Croci, R.; Oradini-Alacreu, A.; Stirparo, G.; Marino, A.; Odone, A.; Capolongo, S.; Signorelli, C.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.638","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22255,""
"8C Round table: Round table: COVID-19: What have we learned? What are the public health challenges?","If there ever was a public health problem where we could learn a lot about public health research, practice, policy and communication, it is the COVID-19 pandemic. With increased knowledge about the spread, the prevention measures, treatment and vaccination, a lot of research on COVID-19 has been and is being published. Looking for COVID-19 articles on google scholar leads to over 3.6 million articles found. Nearly all research published on COVID-19 has been made publicly accessible to allow the latest research to be available for politicians, policymakers, practitioners and laymen. The quality of the research is sometimes good, sometimes less good (see our recent viewpoints https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/issue/30/5?browseBy=volume). But with the increase in research, it becomes more difficult to find which research is old, outdated and which is new. Furthermore, all sorts of media have covered the pandemic extensively, in many journals one can find very good reviews and articles by serious journalists, but in many cases, also rumours, guesses and fake news. On top of becoming tired of information overload, it is also more and more difficult to keep track of the development of the research. EUPHA - therefore - decided to publish a supplement to the European Journal of Public Health looking at specific health issues and specific groups that were affected by the pandemic. The supplement aims to present short summaries and updates on some key issues of public health relevance. Topics included range from environment, mental health, legal and ethical issues, health workforce, health inequalities, accountability, opening up the economy and such. In this Round Table, we will have a number of authors from the EJPH supplement to discuss their findings and find some common grounds on what we have learned from COVID-19 and how to move forward.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emotional status of the adult and older population in Italy Data from the behavioural risk factor surveillance systems PASSI and PASSI dâ€™Argento, 2020-2021","PASSI and PASSI d'Argento are two nationwide ongoing population-based surveillance systems in Italy which targeting, respectively, adults aged 18-69 and over-65, aim at monitoring people health profile, as per health behaviours and their determinants. The Italian National Institute of Health is in charge of the central coordination, but the Local Health Units (LHUs) develop these surveillances. Specifically trained LHUs personnel conduct phone-interviews on gender and age-representative monthly samples of residents in Italy by using a standardised questionnaire. Within both systems, depressive symptoms are under investigation through the Patient Health Questionnaire-2. Since August 2020 to date, PASSI and PASSI d'Argento annexed a specific COVID module in addition to the standard questionnaires' sections. In this way, we have been studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic and working conditions, emotional status and other health-related aspects, as well as those concerning contagion risk perception and its outcomes or citizens compliance with pandemic control measures. In detail, two questions detect the impact of the pandemic on emotional status: â€˜intrusive thinking' as dimension of psychological stress associated to experiencing COVID-19 emergency, and â€˜degree of concern' about the current situation as a dimension of anxiety. Even if the two items are not precise tools to assess mental health symptoms, they are in the condition to give hints for an estimation of the pandemic impact on the psychological well-being in the general population. Preliminary findings, from the analysis of 5,000 interviews, show quite direct experience of COVID (bereavements in family or COVID-positive friends), worsened economic resources among the working-age individuals, and social isolation in the elderly, as the main determinants of intrusive thinking. Being worried about pandemic also correlates with experience of COVID, showing significant differences by gender.","Costa, G.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.544","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22257,""
"Mental health promotion in France during the Covid19 pandemic","Public Health France have put in place a psychobehavioural surveillance system quickly after the beginning of the first lockdown in March 2020. Aside questions about people's perceptions about the pandemic (worry, perceived level of risk...), and their protective behaviours (social distancing, hand washing...), a module of questions on mental health (anxiety, depression and life satisfaction) was introduced. 22 rounds of this survey called CoviPrev have now been undertaken. This survey has been instrumental in raising the awareness by the government on the negative impacts of the pandemic on the mental health of the French population. We have designed, scientifically tested a media campaign to support the population's mental health. This campaign is now on air. This is the first national mental health media campaign since 2007. We hope it will initiate a long-term communication strategy aimed at promoting the mental health of the population.","Arwidson, P.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.543","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22258,""
"Population wellbeing and psychosocial burden during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany â€“ results from (bi-)weekly monitoring data and the resulting health promoting activities on the national level","Since march 2020, data on risk perception, behavior and psychosocial wellbeing of the population with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic have been collected regularly (biweekly to weekly) in Germany as part of the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO). The data i.e. show that the psychosocial burden is higher in specific population subgroups, such as younger adults and families. Based on these data, the Federal Centre for Health Education as part of the federal government developed health promoting activities on the national level to maintain wellbeing and buffer the burden. Over the course of the pandemic, these activities changed dynamically according to the differing situation (lock-down, incidence). With the second wave, as incidences increased dramatically without vaccination available, the activities were expanded from a web-based platform â€˜Psychisch stabil bleiben' (Mind your mental health), supported by a nationwide telephone counseling service, to a nationwide mail distribution of postcards in five different languages, with links to the virtual platform and various telephone counselling services. The website offers information on coping strategies and psychotherapeutic services, edited for specific population groups (e.g. parents, people with preexisting mental illness, health professionals) in five different languages. The postcards were distributed through primary care providers, pharmacies and social services in socially disadvantaged geographical areas, trying to increase reach in vulnerable populations.","De Bock, F.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.542","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22259,""
"7P Workshop: Mental health during the Covid19 pandemic & corresponding national health promotion measures","Background To an initially non-expected degree, the wellbeing of the population in European countries has been affected by the containment measures during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The longer the pandemic holds the more visible become also the economic effects, which in turn will affect the populations mental health and wellbeing on the longer term and have the potential to dramatically increase health inequalities. Whether the psychosocial burden of containment measures will be followed by a significant increase of mental illness is hotly debated and yet to be determined. National institutions have the task to promote health during such crises. Therefore, mental health and wellbeing was monitored in most European countries, and in many countries, approaches to support the population and its subgroups under the burden were developed, acknowledging the monitoring data and dynamics within the pandemic and containment activities. In this workshop the data on population wellbeing during the pandemic from Germany, Italy and France will be presented and the different approaches to promote mental health explained and discussed. The input from the three countries will be the basis for a discussion with the audience: What similarities can be identified from the measures and programs presented? What lessons can be learned for their further development? What synergies could arise in the future? Objective The goal is to present, compare and critically review the mental wellbeing of populations and subgroups in the three countries since the beginning of 2020, to assess its association with the pandemic waves and the according containment measures and discuss the resulting health promotion activities (with a focus on national-level interventions and approaches). Selected interventions to promote mental health and wellbeing will be presented that were developed based on the monitoring data available in the countries. The interventions will be discussed in terms of their relevance to reach subgroups and improve wellbeing in the dynamic situation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Key messages The longer-term effects of the pandemic and its containments measures on mental health and wellbeing of populations is yet to be defined. The psychosocial burden is higher in certain subgroups and demands specific interventions that improve access to preventive (partly preexisting) mental health services.","","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.541","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22260,""
"Knowledge, perceptions and attitudes of university students regarding COVID-19, Cyprus","Background University students represent an active group with important implications in the novel coronavirus transmission. Elucidating their knowledge, attitudes and perceptions was important for customizing communication material and other information activities. Methods The cross-sectional online INTERACT survey targeted students in conventional programs in the five main Universities in the Cyprus Republic between 17-31 March 2020, a week either side of the first national lockdown (24 March). Results A total of 3641 students completed the survey (19% response rate): 65.5% female, 80.9% Bachelor, 41% Health/Life sciences. Amongst participants, 68.8% and 20.6% responded correctly to at least six and eight of 10 knowledge-related questions. Objective knowledge did not vary substantially according to self-evaluation of knowledge. Misconceptions were identified in 25-30%. Only 29.1% expressed positive attitude towards a hypothetical person with COVID-19 without also projecting judgement or blame. Odds of expressing positive attitude increased by 18% (95%CI 13-24%) per unit increase in knowledge. Studying at postgraduate level was predictive of better knowledge (OR of =score8 1.81;95%CI 1.34-2.46) and positive attitude (OR 1.35;95%CI 1.01-1.80). With average knowledge score 6.4 (SD 1.6) vs 6.1 (SD 1.6), Health/Life Sciences students performed marginally better, but were not any more likely to express positive attitude. Conclusions Although Cypriot University students appeared relatively knowledgeable, there were specific gaps and misconceptions, some of which may be attributed to changes in information provided to the public. Attitudes should also be interpreted in the local context where reporting, though seemingly neutral, was not characterised by empathy towards people affected. Findings highlight the importance of continuous and good communication, especially as guidance changes, both in terms of content as well as effect. Key messages Misconceptions and negative attitudes related to COVID19 were identified among Cypriot University students, including those in Health Sciences. Good quality communication is important both in terms of content as well as its effect on shaping attitudes.","Middleton, N.; Tsioutis, C.; Kolokotroni, O.; Heraclides, A.; Nobelos, P.

"Assessing COVID-19-related depression, anxiety and stress among European public health residents","Background In Europe, Public Health Residents (PHR) have participated in the response against COVID-19.The pandemic has had a profound mental health (MH) impact on healthcare workers, but little evidence has been accrued about the Public Health (PH) workforce.The current study aims at assessing prevalence and risk factors for pandemic-related depression (D), anxiety (A) and stress (S). Methods Between March 22 and April 11, 2021 we administered an online survey to PHR from France, Italy, Portugal and Spain, recruited through the national associations of PHR.We collected socio-demographic data and assessed changes in the working conditions due to COVID-19.We used the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21.Cut-off scores for D, A and S were: 9, 7, and 14.Multivariable logistic regression models were applied to determine risk factors for pandemic-related MH outcomes.Data analysis was performed with SPSS version 27. Results 443 out of approximately 2000 PHR completed the survey, response rate: 22.15%. Most responders (n = 226;51%) were from Italy, 87 (19.6%) from Portugal, 74 (16.47%) from Spain and 56 (12.6%) from France. Median age: 29 years (IQR 25 - 33). Female/male ratio: 1.6. PHR above the cut-offs for D, A and S were: 60.5%, 43.1%, 61.2%.DASS-21 scores were 13.3 (Â± 10.27), 8.13 (Â± 7.79), 19.06 (Â± 9.71), respectively.Across the multivariable logistic regression models, the main identified predictors were: for D - the COVID-19 impact on PH training (OR 1.78, 95% CI [1.12-2.80], p = 0.014);for A - the loss of research opportunities (OR 1.94, 95% CI [1.28-2.93], p = 0.002) and for psychological S - the year of residency (last year vs other years of residency: OR 2.3, 95% CI [1.20-4.38], p = 0.012). Conclusions Our sample featured mild-to-moderate levels of prevalent D, A and moderate levels of psychological stress.Overall, the main risk factors associated with negative psychometric outcomes were training challenges, loss of research opportunities and residency seniority.

"Prisons, drugs and COVID-19: Early releases and continuity of care","Introduction Detention settings are high-risk environments for the spread of infectious diseases. Since 2020, COVID-19 has posed unprecedented challenges for governments and prison administrations. In some jurisdictions, this has catalysed early release programmes to decongest prisons to minimise the harm of COVID-19 in prison systems. Methods From March to June 2020, HRI monitored the adoption of prison decongestion measures in response to COVID-19 in Europe and worldwide. HRI tracked criteria for eligibility and implementation of the measures and distributed online expert surveys as part of the Global State of Harm Reduction 2020 that included questions on harm reduction in prisons and the response to COVID-19. Survey data was supplemented by a review of academic, governmental, and non-governmental literature. A review to update the data will be carried out by mid-2021. Results and discussion Results show prison decongestion schemes initiated in 17 countries in Europe and 109 countries worldwide. Overall, by July 2020 decongestion measures reduced the global prison population by 16% in Europe and just 6% worldwide. In a quarter of countries (including at least four in Europe), people incarcerated for drug offences were explicitly excluded, regardless of whether they suffered from health condition or belong to a vulnerable group. We found no evidence of expanded access to harm reduction programmes to address the risk of overdose after release. Issues that exacerbate overdose risk included interruptions to the provision of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) and the unavailability in most jurisdictions of naloxone on release. Conclusions People who use drugs and are in detention settings have been inadequately served during the COVID-19 pandemic. To address the unique health risks of detention settings, there is a need for greater commitment to the adoption of non-custodial measures, and diversion from criminal justice towards a health-led response to drug use.","Shirley-Beavan, S.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.521","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22263,""
"Mental health among people in prison at the time of COVID-19: all bad news?","Introduction Institutional changes in prisons in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have affected the mental health of those who live and work in prisons. Infection prevention and control (IPC) measures have been implemented in prisons throughout the world to protect imprisoned people from COVID-19 and minimise harm to them and the communities in which they are situated. These efforts have been focused on minimising the risk of infection with an emphasis on individual's physical health. The current international evidence on the broader aspects of imprisoned people's wellbeing during the pandemic mostly comprises opinion pieces. These emphasise the likely negative effects of isolating imprisoned people;the picture however is likely to be more nuanced. Methods One national study across England used quantitative and qualitative methods to examine rates of self-harm in prisons and understand some of the underlying reasons. Another national study measured mental wellbeing, using the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), in staff and imprisoned people during the pandemic. Results and discussion Self-harm rates have varied across the prison estate with the most notable differences seen between men and women's prisons and this is explained by several factors, including perceived safety and support networks. There are notable differences between the mental wellbeing of prison residents and staff. Conclusions The implementation of IPC measures has been essential to control the spread of infection in prisons and so minimise morbidity and mortality. However, for many (but not all) imprisoned people, these measures have resulted in isolation for much of the day with negative impacts on wellbeing. In future it will be important to ensure mental wellbeing is maintained and to involve the imprisoned people themselves in the development of effective interventions.","Plugge, E.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.519","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22264,""
"7K Workshop: The impact of COVID-19 response measures on health and healthcare for people in detention in Europe","In the WHO European region alone, approximately 6 million people are incarcerated every year. Prison populations include many individuals belonging to socially deprived and marginalised communities and vulnerable groups such as women, older people, ethnic minorities, and foreigners, among others. Ensuring the right to health is a complex task, and the health status of people in detention (PiD) is often inferior to that of people who are not deprived of their liberty. Since the start of the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic, attention was called on the potential risk of COVID-19 outbreaks occurring inside prisons, and the impact on health and well-being of PiD. Proximity, overcrowding, infrastructural constraints and environmental circumstances pose PiD at higher risk of acquiring infection. The likelihood of COVID-19 introduction in detention facilities is notably high, due to high turnover, movement within prison and between prison and community of staff, PiD and external contacts (e.g. family/personal visits). COVID-19 prevention and control measures in prison settings, although heterogeneous across Europe, included: implementation of internal containment measures, including use of PPE and physical distancing, screening and testing followed by the establishment of internal quarantine zones and mechanisms of medical isolation and transfer of severe cases to hospital or specialised care, coupled with the introduction of non-custodial measures of incarceration and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines. While necessary, those measures impacted on the health status of PiD and on the internal prison organisation, including the provision of health services, as the already scarce resources were reduced or redirected towards mitigating the impact of COVID-19. Yet, the incidence of COVID-19 infections in prison has grown in the last months of 2020 in several European countries and there were reports of a general worsening of PiD mental health, including drug use disorders. COVID-19 pandemic calls on us to focus on the principle â€œprison health is public healthâ€ in order to protect the well-being of people in prison and the surrounding community, uphold equity and continuity of care whilst keeping a secure and safe environment. The main objective of this workshop is to describe COVID-19 prevention and control interventions implemented in prison settings across Europe, and analyse their impact on SARS-CoV2 transmission, mental health of PiD in prison, including drug use disorders and provision of health interventions. The workshop will be structured in 5 presentations of 5-10 minutes each. Together, they will provide participants with an overview of prison health during the COVID-19 pandemic era at European level. Presentations will be followed by a moderated questions and answers session, and participants will be invited to take part in varied activities at the beginning, during and at the end of the workshop to foster interaction. Key messages COVID-19 control measures impacted on the internal prison organisation, provision of healthcare services and the health of people in detention, including mental health and drug use disorders. We call for heightened global attention to prison health as part of a comprehensive public health approach addressing health inequalities.","","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.516","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22265,""
"7E Skills building seminar: (Re)Forming cities due to the COVID challenge: Urban, Environmental & Public Mental Health outcomes","According to the â€œUrban Health Rome Declarationâ€ at European meeting â€œG7 Healthâ€ that defines the strategic aspects and actions to improve Urban, Environmental and Public Mental Health into the cities, and referring to the Agenda 2030 in which the 11th SDG argue about â€œSustainable Cities and Communities. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainableâ€, one of the most expressive syntheses of the challenging relationship between urban planning and Public Health is stated by WHO (2016): â€œHealth is the precondition of urban sustainable development and the first priority for urban plannersâ€. Referring to the Healthy Cities & Urban Health definitions, we can consider Public Health not merely an aspect of individual health protection and promotion, but a collective condition, strongly influenced by the environmental context and by the strategies implemented by local Governments. The â€œHealth in All Policiesâ€ strategy, clearly underlines how health depend by the quality of outdoor and indoor living environments. In this scenario, the on-going COVID-19 pandemic is a strong reminder that urbanization has changed the way individuals and communities live, work, and interact, and that it's urgent to make the urban systems and local communities resilient, to prevent the spread of infectious diseases today and tomorrow. Certainly, the on-going urbanization is achieving an increasing attractiveness/appeal, considering that the urban population is expected to rise to the forecasted 70% by 2050 as stated by the UN Population Division Department. The increase in building density will be one of the main global trends, with significant impacts on Public Health and the increase in risk factors affecting the contemporary city, creating a gap between built and green environments, in terms of alarming living conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic is also an accelerator, revelator and amplifier of the on-going urban emergencies in terms of environmental sustainability and Urban Health, with particular reference to the social, environmental and digital issues. Aim of the skills building seminar titled â€œ(re)FORMING CITIES DUE TO THE COVID CHALLENGEâ€, organized by the three EUPHA Section URB+MEN+ENV, it would like to be to build the capacity and knowledge between participants about the main topics and urban features capable to have relevant Public and Mental Health outcomes, with a specific focus about the COVID-19 pandemic period. For this purpose, after the three presentations, 30 minutes will be used to create a discussion with the audience, using digital systems (like MENTIMETER, SOCRATIVE, etc.) to collect opinions and create a live discussion about a specific set of questions and topics. The qualitative approach of the second part of this skills building seminar is opposed to the first part, in which the three presentations will share scientific-evidences and data;both approaches can be further summarized in the drafting of a Position Paper. Key messages The WP would build the capacity and knowledge between the audience about the main topics and urban features capable to have relevant ENV, URB & MEN outcomes, focusing the COVID-19 pandemic period. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the on-going urban emergencies in terms of sustainability, Urban and Public Mental Health, with particular reference to social, environmental and digital issues.","","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.492","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22266,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on hospital care, employment and mental health of people with Cystic Fibrosis","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for many but especially for people with pre-existing co-morbidities such as people with cystic fibrosis (PWCF). The aim of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on hospital services access to essential medication, employment, and mental health of PWCF. Methods A cross-sectional survey developed by University College Dublin and Cystic Fibrosis Ireland was uploaded on SmartSurvey UK and advertised by CF Ireland to CF community via CFI website and social media in October 2020. Logistic Regression was used for analysis. Results 119 PWCF participated. 56 (47.5%) deferred hospital visits for CF care from 1-6 months: (57.4%) to 3 months;42.6% 4 months-over 6 months), due to hospital closure (11.5%) & fear (69.8%). When adjusted for gender and location, PWCF aged &lt;35 years were twice as likely to defer hospital visits as compared to those &gt;35 years (P = 0.048). Online consultation and prescription via email was new for &gt;50% of PWCF and &gt;80% found it useful. Amongst those who worked (46.2%), 87.2% (n = 48) worked from home during COVID19. More PWCF &lt;35 years (9.6%) worked onsite as compared to those &gt;35 years (1.9%). 95% of employers were sympathetic for PWCF who cocooned while working from home (41.7%), however, overall, approximately 1/3rd of all employers were considered unsympathetic. 24.4% found access to CF medications challenging and 7 (5.9%) had to find alternative. After adjustment for gender and working, PWCF &lt; 35 years were more likely to feel â€œnervousâ€ (OR: 3.28;P = 0.017), â€œnothing could cheer them upâ€ (OR: 3.24;P = 0.038) and â€œtiredâ€ (OR: 2.76;P = 0.016) compared to those &gt;35 years. Conclusions Fear was a strong reason for essential hospital visit deferrals in COVID19, but hospital closures played an important part also. Prescription by email was novel and popular. There has been a serious impact on the mental health of this vulnerable group. Key messages COVID-19 impacted hospital visits due to fear and hospital closures;younger PWCF deferred more and for longer. The negative impact of COVID-19 on mental health was more pronounced in older PWCF.","Bhatnagar, R.; Tecklenborg, S.; Segurado, R.; Fitzpatrick, P.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.477","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22267,""
"7A Round table: Multilateral Partnerships to achieve the SDG5: Gender Equality, and to combat COVID-19","Gender Equality is vital for a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable world for all individuals. Care- and help-seeking behaviour is strongly associated with health status, but, also gender, with women's health strongly correlating to that of the whole family and directly linked to the wellbeing of all members in our communities, and the resilience and sustainability of health systems. Health and social care delivery has been lacking a gender-centred approach, with a two-prong effect, on professionals/workforce (hierarchies and leadership imbalance) and on users/recipients/care seekers (lack of gender-sensitive care provision). The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health threat and societal challenge that has already exacerbated pre-existing structural gender inequalities. It is, therefore, imperative to rebuild a better, gender-equal society for the future. This crisis has highlighted the roles of women in the health workforce, incl. as informal carers for vulnerable adults and children. The increase in gender-based violence has also come to the spotlight, due to lockdown measures, implemented to combat COVID-19, resulting in serious physical and mental harm, as well as socioeconomic damages. Furthermore, sexual and reproductive health rights have been particularly affected due to pre-existing barriers across Member-States placing additional strain on individuals and systems. All these compounding factors also result in further limiting access to leadership positions for women. This roundtable aims to capture the perspective of our interdisciplinary panelists from leading European and global institutions to comprehensively map the needs, priorities, and key action areas of public health, in order to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls across the globe. Objectives Assess the roles of women in the health workforce, to highlight gender inequalities, and to discuss regional differences across the European Region;Present and discuss the new Gender Equality Index 2021 (to be released end of Oct 2021), which will focus on health in relation to gender equality, covering mental health, sexual and reproductive health and pandemics of communicable diseases, and in particular of COVID-19;Combine the perspective of academia, multilateral bodies, practitioners and NGOs, for concerted action to combat the increase in sexual and domestic violence, and to Bridge disparities and overcome barriers to gender-sensitive health and social care services for all women, incl., migrant and refugee populations. The roundtable brings together for the first time EUPHA, WHO, UN Women, and of the European Institute for Gender Equality, in a joint effort for European and global public health, to support our workforce and safeguard the future. Mindful of the role women in health and social care, we also include panelists from the International Confederation of Midwives and from NGOs working in the field of combating violence against women.

"6P Round table: Strengthening refugee aid workers resilience during the pandemic and beyond","The field of Humanitarian Aid is inherently demanding, stressful and often emotionally draining. Many refugee aid workers are confronted with emotional stories and suffering of refugees, have to make critical decisions, manage numerous demands and challenging situations with refugees and their families. Through different projects we have observed that for the majority of refugee aid workers, the current COVID-19 - pandemic has even exacerbated these challenges. Yet, only a strong and resilient workforce can build the necessary basis for supporting refugees and forcibly displaced migrants as best as possible. Providing mental support is thereby key in alleviating stress among refugee aid workers and to build up resilience. This roundtable discussion seeks to raise awareness to this neglected, but jet so important topic by convening individuals working across different sectors: public, private and academic in order to merge different perspectives and explore novel opportunities to support refugee aid workers. Panelists will discuss multi-sector and institutional solutions and collaborations needed to address these mental health support gaps. In addition, this panel will discuss recent experiences from the field, projects expanding educational and research partnerships and the development of tools and programs to promote mental health of refugee aid workers. Dr. Anne Jachmann from the Migration Medicine research division of the Emergency Department of the University of Bern will present results of a longitudinal, observational study investigating the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on refugee aid workers in Greece. Furthermore, as a result of an academic partnership, together with her colleague Dr. Evika Karamagioli, they will demonstrate current needs of refugee aid workers and how these can be met by training and activity offers, based on an online mental health week, as a model of good practice. Dr. Evika Karamagioli is a lecturer at the department of communication and media studies and a scientific collaborator at the faculty of medicine at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. She has experience with diverse refugee projects by scaling up the importance of digital media and creating new ways of communication. Additionally, Evgenia Thanou, the director of MÃ©decins du monde Greece will provide insights to the fieldwork of interdisciplinary teams with different backgrounds and what is needed to best support them, as her organization is providing medical care to refugees all over Greece in different settings. Finally, Dr. Nikos Gionakis, psychologist and head of Babel Day Centre, which provides mental health services to migrants and Dr. Lilian Markaki, psychiatrist at the Athens Medical Association will share their experiences and challenges from the field and introduce their approach on how to empower psychosocial skills of refugee aid workers. A discussion with the audience will follow the panelists presentations.

"Moral injury and moral distress","Individuals who are exposed to traumatic events that violate their moral values may experience severe distress and functional impairments known as â€œmoral injuries.â€ Despite interest, there is no consensus definition of moral injury. Research about moral injury, especially among military personnel, veterans, has proliferated. The scientific study of moral injury began 2009 with the definition that moral injurious events are those that entail â€œperpetrating, failing to prevent, bearing witness to, or learning about acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectationsâ€. These events include betrayal. Moral injury can have impact on symptoms of symptoms such as mental distress, posttraumatic symptoms, suicidal behavior, substance abuse, demoralization and hopelessness and interpersonal problems and loss of trust. For this study, conceptualize moral injury as both, the extent to which individuals appraise themselves as having committed moral violations and b) the extent to which individuals appraise themselves as victims of other betrayal or transgressive behavior. We reviewed scientific research about moral injury among healthcare personnel and the general public during the COVID - pandemic. Moral injury among healthcare personnel was related to exposure to severely ill patients and lack of support. Moral injury among the general public needs more research. To support healing in the aftermath of the COVID -19 pandemic it will be necessary to clearly define moral injury and identify potentially morally injuries events during the pandemic.","Lindert, J.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.454","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22270,""
"Psychological distress from the COVID-19 confinement is associated with unhealthy dietary changes","Background The confinement due to COVID-19 pandemic had adverse effects on mental health, but the relation between psychological distress resulting from lockdown measures and dietary habits needs to be elucidated. Methods We analysed 2,741 subjects (mean age 58.1Â±15.3 y) pooled from 2 retrospective Italian cohorts recruited from May to September 2020: 1) The Moli-LOCK cohort consists of 1,401 adults, a portion of the larger Moli-sani Study (n = 24,325) who were administered a telephone-based questionnaire to assess lifestyles and psychological factors during confinement;2) the ALT RISCOVID-19 is a web-based survey of 1,340 individuals distributed throughout Italy who self-responded to the same questionnaire by using GoogleÂ® forms. Psychological distress was measured by assessments of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-4), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Diet quality was assessed either as changes in consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF) or adherence to Mediterranean diet (MD). Results In a multivariable regression analysis controlled for major sociodemographic factors, depression (ÃŸ=-0.06, 95%CI -0.10, -0.01), anxiety (ÃŸ=-0.05, -0.09, -0.004) and PTSD (ÃŸ=-0.04, -0.08, -0.002) were inversely associated with MD and directly with UPF (ÃŸ = 0.13, 0.09, 0.18;ÃŸ = 0.12, 0.08, 0.16 and ÃŸ = 0.10, 0.06, 0.13, respectively);stress was associated with UPF (ÃŸ = 0.06, 0.02, 0.10) but not with MD (ÃŸ=-0.03, -0.08, 0.01). Conclusions Psychological distress resulting from confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic is directly associated with unhealthy dietary modifications in a sample of the Italian population. In view of possible future restrictive measures, particular attention should be paid to public health actions promoting psychological support to more vulnerable groups. Key messages Psychological distress resulting from confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic is directly associated with unhealthy dietary modifications. Particular attention should be paid to public health actions promoting psychological support to more vulnerable groups also in view of future restrictive measures to contain the pandemic spread.","Bonaccio, M.; Costanzo, S.; Bracone, F.; Gialluisi, A.; Castelnuovo, A.

"Building a federated research infrastructure for a policy-rapid response","Background Mobilizing real world data from multiple data hubs in multiple countries to carry out policy-oriented research, requires orchestrating the governance of workflows, being compliant with legal and ethical requirements, and semantic harmonization and technological interoperability. In the context of PHIRI, policy-oriented research has to provide insight to policy-makers to cope with pandemics. Methods PHIRI builds this concept on the deployment of four use cases throughout a federated research infrastructure. A central hub orchestrates all the elements encompassing the development of such an infrastructure;so, a common governance model, common methodology pursuing semantic interoperability, and the development and deployment of technological solution containing ETL processes, data quality assessment solutions and data analyses, all packaged to be rolled out in the different data hubs composing the federation. Results A prototype orchestrating those workflows is being followed in four use cases: indirect effects of the pandemic on vulnerable populations, delayed breast cancer treatments due to the pandemic, perinatal health affections along the COVID19 crisis, effects of the pandemic on mental health care. A prototype of the technological platform supporting interoperable federated analyses has been prepared.

"The other side of COVID-19: a cross-sectional study on mental health in a sample of Italian nurses","Background The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting drastic increase in the workload for healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, has had serious consequences on the psychological well-being of these professionals. Our study aimed at (i) identifying demographic, work-related factors, and clinical predictors of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in nurses employed during COVID-19 pandemic and (ii) assessing problem-focused coping strategies implemented by nurses. Methods We carried out a cross-sectional study between December 2020 and April 2021, addressed to nurses employed during the COVID-19 second wave (October - December 2020). PTSD and GAD were assessed by Social Readjustment Rating Scale, Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) and General Anxiety Disorder -7 scale. Results Overall, 359 nurses were included in the study, whose mean age was 31.75 years (SD Â± 9.77). Most were female (80.8%), unmarried (53.2%) and employed in the central (52.5%) and northern (36.4%) regions of Italy. A total of 59.7% of all participants had clinical predictors of PTSD, recording a mean score of IES-R of 38.2, SD Â± 19.2, range 1- 84 (cut-off &gt;33 for PTSD). Furthermore, 45.6% of respondents reported moderate - severe symptoms consistent with generalized anxiety disorder. Statistical significance was found between GAD and nurses being employed on the front line (Intensive care unit and emergency department) during the COVID-19 second wave (p = 0.016), and between GAD and clinical predictors of PTSD (p = 0.001). Furthermore, we found a statistically significant association between PTSD and nurses who were employed in hospitals or institutions dedicated to COVID-19 (p = 0.028). Conclusions PTSD and GAD represent a public health problem to be addressed in the post-pandemic period. Healthcare organizations need to activate specific support and rehabilitation networks and programs for healthcare professionals employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key messages The levels of PTSD symptoms and anxiety among nurses were high during the pandemic. It is necessary for health systems to differentiate between temporary and long-term mental disorders in order to provide the health workforce with appropriate rehabilitation.","Renzi, E.; Baccolini, V.; De Vito, C.; Migliara, G.; Marzuillo, C.; Villari, P.; Massimi, A.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.392","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22273,""
"Distress symptoms in older adults: results from the Survey for Health and Retirement in Europe","The enforced isolation that followed the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks led to widespread concern regarding its unintended consequences on the mental well-being of older adults. The onset and severity of the outbreak, as well as the restrictive measures varied widely across countries. We aim to identify both individual and contextual factors that may have affected the presence and worsening of distress symptoms among older adults in 27 European countries. 52,310 non-institutionalised participants were asked about feeling depressed, anxious, lonely, and having trouble sleeping in the 4 weeks preceding the interview. The answers were combined into a count variable measuring distress. Answers regarding worsening of these symptoms during the outbreak were treated as binary variables. Multilevel zero-inflated negative binomial and binary logistic regressions were used to analyse the outcomes. Increasing age is not associated with higher rates of distress (p = 0.12) and compared to those aged &lt;60, those aged 71-80 and 80+ are 33% and 46% less likely to report feeling more depressed than before the pandemic (p &lt; 0.001). Female gender, living alone, poor physical health, low education and reduced social contact were all linked to higher rates of distress (p &lt; 0.001). Living in a country with stronger restrictions is linked to higher distress p &lt; 0.031 while higher Covid-19 deaths/million are associated with worsening of all four symptoms [OR: depressed 1.14(1.01-1.29);nervous 1.15(1.03-1.28);sleep troubles 1.19(1.08-1.32) and loneliness 1.14 (1.02 - 1.28)] Individual factors associated with the presence and worsening of depressive symptoms during the pandemic are similar to the ones reported in the literature before the pandemic. These groups may require additional support and mental health services. The stringency of restrictions and Covid-19 death toll adversely affected mental health, but older adults seem to be more resilient than their younger peers. Key messages The negative impact of the outbreak has been stronger on socially disadvantaged older adults. Strong restrictions to contain the outbreaks may lead to increase in distress symptoms in older adults but older adults are more resilient than their younger peers.","Shahaj, O.; Ksinan, A.; Bobak, M.; Pikhart, H.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.390","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22274,""
"Policy interactions during the Dutch â€˜Public Health Foresight, in the light of COVID-19'","When the sense of urgency of the COVID pandemic increased, in March 2020, the Dutch Ministry of Health commissioned RIVM to do the study â€œPublic Health Foresight, in the light of COVID-19â€. The aim of this study was to analyze Impact of the corona pandemic on current and future health and health care, to support broader consideration of measures and to be better prepared in the future. This was done by addressing not only the direct impacts, e.g. the disease burden of COVID-19, but also the indirect impacts of the measures, e.g. mental health, health impacts of changed life styles and delayed health care provision. During this 8 months trajectory, interaction with policy makers was frequent and intensive. In the context of Parliamentary elections there were constant pressures on policymakers from the virologists and hospital and ICU ward managers;as well as non-health Ministers in the government cabinet and the general public questioning decisions on whether to act or not.

"The organisation of resilient health and social care following the COVID-19 pandemic â€“ A critical review","As second presentation, a recent Opinion by the Expert Panel on effective ways of investing in Health (EXPH) will be shared and used as point of reference to assess what the key components are of a future Partnership. This Opinion on the organisation of health and social care following the COVID-19 pandemic (1) identifies the building blocks of resilient health and social care systems, (2) explores the elements and conditions for capacity building to strengthen health system resilience, (3) addresses healthcare provision for vulnerable patient groups and how to sustain such provision in a system under stress, and (4) sets out an approach to develop and implement â€œresilience testsâ€ of Member State's health systems. The recommendations target a number of key areas, including: enhancing workforce training and resilience, identifying and reducing disinformation, fostering interprofessional and inter-sectoral collaboration with community health workers and informal care givers for example, strengthening primary and mental health care, and a number of other priorities. An overarching recommendation is to enhance investment from the European Commission in the development and implementation of (a) comprehensive resilience testing of health systems that use qualitative and quantitative data collection methodologies to generate meaningful, actionable results for health system transformation, and (b) corresponding learning communities within and across Member States to share lessons learned through this process. Based on this work, what are the priorities for a Partnership, and how can it add value to existing initatives?","Rogers, Heather L.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.323","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22276,""
"4O Workshop: Using data to save lives in times of COVID-19 and beyond","This presentation will comprise three notable European initiatives on the use and re-use of health data to save lives in times of COVID-19 and beyond the pandemic. Building a European Health Data Space and infrastructures supporting it The Commission will put forward a legislative proposal on European Health Data Space, supporting the use of data for healthcare, for research and policy making. As part of the European Health Data Space, it will also support the infrastructure allowing patients to share their health data with healthcare professionals when travelling abroad, in the language of the professional, thus avoiding repeating costs or diagnostic and medication errors stemming from misunderstandings. While aiming at creating a vibrant data ecosystem in the European Health Data Space, the Commission is exploring ways to overcome cross-border challenges on re-use of health data for policy, regulatory and research activities. Leveraging on the know-how and experience of national health data permit authorities and established data infrastructures, the EHDS pilot initiative aims at setting up a demonstrator for an overarching federated infrastructure enabling cross-country, cross-domain (health domains: mental health, genomic, cancer, rare diseases, etc.) re-use of health data. A set of use cases (observational studies) will be piloted to assess the value and impact that such overarching infrastructure would entail for EU-wide health data analytical studies. The European Digital COVID Certificate Following the start of the vaccination campaign in December 2020, a lot of hope was placed in the use of vaccination certificates as a potential tool for supporting the gradual lifting of travel restrictions. Later, test and recovery certificates were added in the scope of the system, named EU Digital COVID Certificate. A legal proposal was prepared by the Commission, and fast-tracked by both the Council and the European Parliament. Current state of play on the use of EU Digital COVID Certificate will be presented. A common European approach for digital contact tracing One of the key challenges during the early weeks of the pandemic was the establishment of an effective tracing system given the testing capacity limitations. Several research teams, in the EU and across the globe, started early on developing digital systems for contact tracing that would preserve privacy of users. This led soon to the deployment of the first contact tracing and warning applications that allow automatically alerting users at risk of COVID-19 infection. There are currently over 20 national contact tracing applications rolled out in the EU, and almost all of them are connected at European level enabling citizens to rely on a single mobile application when travelling across the connected countries.

"Intergenerational inequalities in COVID-19","COVID-19 as a disease mainly affects older people. However, the measures that governments have introduced to prevent the spread of the pandemic will mainly impact on the younger ones. The key challenges for countries are to respond to both: (1) reducing the spread of the pandemic and (2) managing its syndemic, psycho-social dimension. Governments should design cross-cutting measures to address both these dimensions, be sensitive to and targeting different groups to enable, on one hand, a new normal life with the virus for individuals, and on the other hand, to enable society to function normally. For that aim, countries have to establish effective monitoring and measuring of the situation in order to ensure appropriate, effective and targeted responses. PANDA is an example of a good practice in Slovenia. The PANDA findings indicate that there are differences between generations in perceptions of the pandemic, in vaccine acceptance and in pandemic experiences. Mental health for example is one of the most affected components of health status in individuals, with worse results for younger generations. For the age group 65 - 74 years, 9 % are reporting depression symptoms and 13.5% reporting problems in mental health, while for the 18 - 29 years group, 17.8% are reporting depression symptoms and 28.5% mental health problems. Even more serious are the differences we could observe in assessing the financial situation, with 34.4% of the surveyed participants aged 18-29 years assessing their financial situation as worse in the last three months, compared to only 9.9% of those in the age group 65-74. Observed intergenerational inequalities are bringing along the responsibility of the older members of the population to get vaccinated, not only to protect themselves and prevent the collapse of the health system, but also to enable younger generations to get their lives back to normal and allow them to live and eat, attend education and socialise normally.","Blenkus, M.

"Effects of covid-19 on cognitive functioning","We were interested in whether the covid-19 pandemic affects cognitive functioning in addition to emotional responses. To this end, we applied four questions related to everyday activities that inevitably involve fluid cognitive abilities, e.g., problems concentrating, remembering, and switching between different mental activities. Respondents self-assessed their cognitive abilities during the covid-19 pandemic compared to the period before the pandemic on a 7-point scale (1 - much easier than before, .. 4 - the same as earlier, .. and 7 - much harder than before). The results showed that, on average, respondents estimated slightly more cognitive problems during the covid-19 pandemic period than before the pandemic (4.21, where 4 means that the respondent does not notice changes). Nearly three-quarters of the respondents(72%) did not report changes in cognitive abilities. In comparison, 7% reported improved cognitive abilities, and as many as 21% of respondents self-assessed that their cognitive abilities deteriorated during the covid-19 pandemic. There were no differences between men and women in terms of self-assessment of cognitive abilities. More significant problems with their cognitive abilities during covid-19 pandemic reported younger as compared to older respondents, students as compared to other employment groups, less educated as compared to more educated, those living alone as compared to those living in the family, those whose financial situation had deteriorated, and, as expected, those with chronic illnesses, and those who also reported depressive and mental health symptoms. The results of the survey indicate the interdependence between different demographic factors, mood and mental health problems, and self-assessed changes in cognition. Therefore, interventions to mitigate the covid-19 pandemic should include peoples' emotional response and their cognitive problems.","Kovacic, V.; Lavtar, D.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.294","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22279,""
"Mental health problems and COVID-19 â€“ which came first, the chicken or the egg?","It was very clear that the COVID-19 pandemic will have an impact on mental health from the first day that it was declared.However, the scale and magnitude of the impact changed as the pandemic persisted, progressed, and transformed. After a year of social distancing, distance education, and virtual concerts, the societal fabric has changed to such an extent that it will most likely produce a long lasting impact on public mental health. The presentation will focus on the indicators of public mental health obtained from the SI-PANDA research, a bi-weekly web panel survey with a nationally representative sample of 1000 respondents per each wave of the survey. The 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) was used to measure mental health. A cut-off score of = 50 was used to screen for mental health problems, and a cut-off score =28 to screen for major depression. Results of the repeated cross-sectional surveys indicate continuation of trends that were present pre-pandemic. Namely, higher prevalence of mental health problems among people with lower education, adolescents and young adults, people with pre-existing chronic conditions, and people experiencing worsening financial situation during the pandemic. Trends from SI-PANDA research show that the differences (or inequities) in mental health are deepening as the pandemic progresses. People with mental health problems are at greater risk of experiencing worsening mental health during the pandemic as well as experiencing other adverse health outcomes - which are themselves a risk factor for worsening mental health. Is the downward spiral of poor mental health and COVID-19 the story of health inequities or is it a new phenomenon built on top of inequitable society?","Colakovic, A.

"4K Workshop: What is going on? New inequalities emerging from the COVID-19 syndemic","COVID-19 pandemic interacts with the pandemic of chronic non-communicable diseases and is exacerbated in different social and societal contexts through existing health inequalities - resulting in a syndemic. The socio-economically weakest groups of the population have been most affected (Bambra, 2020, Horton, 2020). In 2020, most activities were focused on controlling the epidemic through a biomedical approach, and only in the second half of the year, with the onset of the second wave, did the understanding that we are dealing with a syndemic, emerge in public health, societal and lately political discourse at the national and EU levels. There is increasing indirect damage to public health due to the loss of jobs and income, the long-term closure of certain activities, difficult access to health systems for those with non-COVID-19 health problems, and general uncertainty about the present and future. Different dimensions of syndemic inequalities (e.g. mental health, cognitive decline, lifestyles, gender, intergenerational) are the main focus of the workshop, including inequalities that were traditionally perceived in public health, as well as new emerging inequalities. In Slovenia we are conducting a study on the impact of the syndemic on people's lives (SI-PANDA 2020/2021), to (1) better understand human behaviour in COVID-19 pandemic and (2) to identify and address the impact of the governmental decisions, pandemic measures and recommendations. The workshop will aim to: Showcase the value of timely measurement and surveying of the COVID-19 syndemic's influences on society;Increase participants' understanding and awareness of the opportunities and challenges associated with different types of inequalities linked to COVID-19;Increase awareness of public health professionals on the importance of overcoming the difference between the biomedical approach and psychosocial paradigms;The workshop will offer an opportunity to: Present some of the outputs of the PANDA research and outline the influences of COVID-19 on lifestyle, mental health and cognitive changes Inform participants about the benefits of the comprehensive national approach in measuring COVID-19 syndemic consequences, embedded in a broader internationally comparative WHO measurement framework;Explore traditional inequalities with new dimensions, such as gender inequalities, newly emerging economic vulnerabilities and transformational inequalities, such as intergenerational inequality. Identify possible syndemic outcome measures at the national and EU levels, while identifying gaps between employing biomedical versus psychosocial approach in controlling conditions. Key messages Present new evidence on a wide range of inequalities emerging from the COVID-19 syndemic and its approach to mitigate it. Showcase an example from Slovenia (within the WHO internationally harmonized approach) of timely measuring the right data to inform a biomedical response as well as psychosocial measures.","","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.291","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22281,""
"Delivering public health interventions","Public health has faced unprecedented pressures from the dual demands of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining delivery of essential public health services such as screening and vaccinations. At the beginning of the pandemic, public health efforts turned towards implementing appropriate preventative health measures to control or mitigate transmission, while the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has started since late 2020. Preventative public health measures to control or mitigate transmission include observing hygiene guidelines;using personal protective equipment (such as masks);limiting contact through physical distancing measures, curfews, bans on non-essential persons' movement and closing schools, businesses, as well as regional and national borders. All these measures have been supported, with Find, Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support (FTTIS) services, but many countries have struggled to implement these successfully, even months into the pandemic. While organisations such as the ECDC have issued guidance on implementing such interventions depending on the epidemiological situation, national strategies have ultimately depended on the countries' priorities, political realities and weighing the benefits against the potential adverse effects (such as mental health, economic and social impacts) and there has been little coordination among the countries. International coordination in the area of vaccines has also not always worked effectively. This presentation will provide an overview of strategies on implementing effective public health measures, including FTTIS systems and COVID-19 vaccinations. A brief overview of key metrics to assess resilience in the area of public health delivery will also be provided.","Karanikolos, M.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.289","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22282,""
"Longitudinal data collection on an international level during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Different sampling approaches can be used in longitudinal surveys. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted possibilities to conduct random based longitudinal surveys. However, longitudinal data on public mental health responses are urgently needed. Methods We conducted a longitudinal study in eight European countries (Albania, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia) including 18+ year olds with the goal to reach as many people as possible and generate robust data. We used various sampling approaches (convenience sampling, snowball sampling, panel data) utilizing social media, professional organisations, educational institutions and personal direct contact. To gather robust data, focus was on multiperspectivity rather than representativeness. A mix of sampling approach is possible. Digital sampling methods were feasible in the European region. Results In total 2,426 participants filled out &gt;50% of the questionnaire in the overall sample, which is, also due to the rapidness of survey development, a good result for data on mental health and resilience during COVID-19 pandemic. COPERS study has shown that a mix of various sampling approaches is possible and a good option to generate datasets in a relatively short time span. However, no responses rates can be calculated using. Conclusions Online surveys are a good tool to reach people in times of crisis. Furthermore, they can be adapted directly in case of changes, if necessary and desired. Using different ways of recruitment, a diverse group of people can be recruited. However, online surveys require a certain technical understanding, which not all potential participants have. Question remains how multinational research is evolving and being shaped. This asks for possibly new methods to define and detect sampling bias.","Sisenop, F.; Lindert, J.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.256","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22283,""
"Data collection during time of crisis â€“ experiences from the COPERS study","Background The pandemic situation has been present for more than a year all over the world. In almost all countries actions were taken following WHO recommendations of social distance, smart work, online lectures, using of masks, etc. These procedures reduced physical distance but increased social isolation, encouraging virtual connection among people and eventually, increasing psychological repercussions. In many countries, equivalent measures were taken, but the cultural vulnerability to the virus could be dissimilar, influencing on social disruption and economic inequalities among countries. COPERS study aims to examine the association between the exposure and depression, perceived stress, anxiety, suicidal ideation, social capital in different cultural contexts. Methods We carefully focused on measuring exposure. Exposure can be described and assessed by intensity and by duration. We assessed both intensity and duration of exposure to the pandemic itself and to the containment measures. IES-R was used to assess the impact of the pandemic Covid-19 among people, assessing among others, feelings, sleeping troubles, stressful life events and emotional reactions. Results The assessments included specific issues on exposure range to Covid-19 in different countries. Specifically, could be mentioned the mandatory isolation policy in specific hours, freely vaccination willingness and high suicidal occurrences as the Albanian case. Despite the high mortality and suicidal cases in Albania, many people acted as if virus was not around. However, it was possible to obtain data in a cultural environment which was reluctant to participate. Conclusions The measure to overcome skepticism to participate was mainly possible due to building trust to key persons. More measure how to conduct studies in populations which are reluctant to participate in research will be discussed. To obtain results in times of crises it is necessary to get data as well in difficult to reach populations.","Begotaraj, E.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.255","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22284,""
"Mental health policy response to COVID-19: lessons learned","Background Good mental health is critical to the functioning of society and recovery from COVID-19 pandemics. Corona pandemics is considered as crisis, causing uncertainty and unpredictability resulting in fear and high levels of psychological distress in populations. Mental health impacts occur as an impact of the virus or as the consequences of physical isolation. Mental health of other specific (vulnerable) populations affected by the COVID-19. Mitigating the hazardous effects of COVID-19 on mental health is an international public health priority. The aim of the study is to review mental health policy responses to COVID-19 crisis internationally and present successful examples as well as learned lessons. Methods A rapid clustered review of evidences reflecting mental health policy responses in the face of COVID-19 pandemics has been conducted. Results COVID-19 pandemics is an indisputable emergency for health systems and challenge for mental health care. Major mental health policy response measures should be based on whole of society approach and include access to remote mental health service provision as well as emergency mental health and psychosocial services especially to vulnerable populations in order to strengthen social cohesion and social support. COVID-19 crisis, on the other hand, might also be considered as an opportunity to improve the scale and effectiveness of mental health services and increase funding to mental health care and psychosocial services. It raised concerns and stimulated discussion about the re-shifting institutional long term care more into community based service approach. Conclusions Ensuring preparedness and planning of mental health service is an important for staying ahead of mental health impacts that will be long term, complex, and may take time to fully emerge. Further transdisciplinary research on mental health system, policy and COVID-19 epidemics prevention, preparedness, responses and impacts is needed.","Jakubauskiene, M.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.254","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22285,""

"Access to services among migrant origin persons during COVID-19 pandemic: Finnish MigCOVID Survey","Background Compared with the general population, migrant origin persons had more difficulties in access to services already prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examines the impact of the pandemic on the need and access to healthcare and social services among persons of migrant origin. Methods Data from the population-based Impact of the Coronavirus on the Wellbeing of the Foreign Born Population (MigCOVID) Survey was used. The survey was conducted in Finland among persons aged 20 to 66 years (n = 3 668 participated in the survey, participation rate 60%) between October 2020 and February 2021 with electronic and postal questionnaires and telephone interviews. Logistic regression was applied to examine age and sex-adjusted prevalence and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for self-reported need and sufficiency of services (physician, nurse, dentist, mental health services and family services). Results Healthcare and family services were needed by 69.2% (95% CI 66.3-72.0). Services provided by the physician, dentist and nurse were needed most frequently. Women (74.5%, 95% CI 70.6-78.1) were more likely to report the need for health and family services than men (64.4%, 95% CI 60.0-68.5). Out of those who needed services, 34.9% (95% CI 36.1-38.3) reported that the received services were insufficient. Highest barriers were observed for mental health (45.5%, 95% CI 36.4-55.0) and dentist (33.9, 95% CI 29.6-38.6) services. Although difficulties were highly prevalent in a number of regional groups, persons originating from East, South and Central Asia had persistently high barriers in access to services. Conclusions Findings suggest that barriers in access to services have at least somewhat increased among persons of migrant origin during the COVID-19 pandemic. This may have both short and long-term consequences on the health and wellbeing of the migrant origin population. Of particular concern were high perceived barriers in access to mental health services. Key messages Barriers in access were reported by a third of persons of migrant origin who needed services. Particular difficulties were experienced in access to mental health services. The gap in access to needs to be acutely addressed to reduce both the short and long-term consequences of COVID-19 on the health and wellbeing of the population.","Skogberg, N.; Kuusio, H.; Lilja, E.; Austero, S.; Castaneda, A.

"The importance of mental health literacy in times of crisis: Adolescent mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Many adolescents do not seek appropriate help when they experience mental health problems (MHP). Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, this has become an increasingly pressing public health problem as more adolescents experience MHP due to social isolation, problematic home environments, and lack of future outlooks. Strengthening adolescents' competencies to cope with MHP (so called mental health literacy (MHL)) has the potential to prevent worsening of problems and delayed help-seeking. However, the implementation of MHL interventions remains absent or short-lived. To stimulate its implementation, this study explored attitudes of adolescents regarding mental health, help-seeking, and MHL interventions. We used a mixed-methods design including online focus group discussions and interviews, and surveys. Data collection took place since April â€˜20. Participants were recruited online, through social media. So far, 58 adolescents (ages 13 and 19) attending secondary school in the Netherlands participated in this study. The data collected includes mental health status pre-, during, and post-lockdown as well as attitudes on mental health support and education. Our qualitative data analysis follows the principles of thematic analysis. We found that adolescents experience a lack of attention for mental health in secondary education as well as stigma and negative attitudes towards mental health treatment and help-sources, in general and during COVID-19. The participants voiced that they would like to know more about mental health and illness, help-sources and normalize the conversation of mental health. The attitudes of adolescents aided in shaping ideas for the implementation of mental health education.

"Risk and protective factors related to childrenâ€™s symptoms of emotional difficulties and hyperactivity/inattention during the COVID-19 related lockdown in France: results from a community sample","Objective To contain the COVID-19 epidemic preventive measures including social distancing, economic shutdown, and school closures were introduced, carrying risk of mental health burden in adults and children. Although the knowledge base regarding children's response to trauma and adverse events has broadened, descriptions of their mental health during epidemics remain scarce. In particular, the role of family socioeconomic characteristics and parental mental health are poorly understood. Methods We assessed the correlates of children's emotional difficulties and symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention during the COVID-19 lockdown in a French community-based sample. 432 community-based parents (27-46 years, TEMPO cohort) and their children (mean age 6.8 +/- 4.1) were interviewed online. Children's symptoms of emotional difficulties and hyperactivity/inattention were assessed using the parent reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire during the 5th week of home confinement. Family socioeconomic characteristics and parental mental health and substance use were assessed weekly during the first 5 weeks of home confinement. Data were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression models. Results 7.1% of children presented symptoms of emotional difficulties and 24.7% symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention. The presence of psychological difficulties was significantly associated with family characteristics including financial difficulties (OR = 4.3) and parental symptoms of anxiety and depression (OR = 2.5). Children's sleeping difficulties and screen time were statistically significant in bivariate analyses but lost statistical significance in multivariate models. Conclusions Children's emotional and behavioural difficulties are associated with parental mental health and socioeconomic difficulties. In the COVID-19 epidemic, parents and professionals involved in caring for children should pay special attention to mental health needs.","Melchior, M.; Moulin, F.; El-Aarbaoui, T.; Bustamente, J.

"Symptoms of emotional difficulties and hyperactivity/inattention among children during the COVID-19 epidemic and associated lockdown: data from the SAPRIS project","Background COVID-19 limitation strategies led to widespread school closures around the world. The present study aims to provide a description of children's mental health and associated factors during the COVID-19 school closure in France. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis in the SAPRIS study during the COVID-19 pandemic in France, relying on 2 ongoing national birth cohorts, ELFE and EPIPAGE 2. Using weighted multinomial logistic regression models, we estimated associations between children's mental health (i.e., hyperactivity/inattention and emotional symptoms;assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), children's health behaviors, schooling, as well as sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics of children family. Results The sample consisted of 5702 children aged 8 - 9 years and 49.3% girls. Sleep disturbance and parents' dominant socio-professional category were associated with both hyperactivity-inattention (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR)=2.10 95%Confidence Interval [1.85-2.38];aOR=0.45 [0.33-0.61] respectively) and emotional symptoms and (aOR=6.33 [5.26-7.63];aOR=0.62 [0.39-0.98] respectively). Specifically associated with hyperactivity/inattention were: male sex (aOR=2.51 [2.24-2.82]), presence of regular care and its pursuit during school closure (aOR=1.69 [1.33-2.15]), emotional symptoms (aOR=2.74 [2.23-3.37]), school situation (aOR=2.19 [1.69-2.82]), presence of tutoring and difficulties with it (aOR=2.56 [2.13-3.08]), type of housing (aOR=0.79 [0.70-0.89]). Factors associated with emotional symptoms were: presence of covid cases in the household (aOR=2.33 [1.92-2.82]), hyperactivity/inattention (aOR=2.94 [2.45-3.52]) and financial difficulties (aOR=1.71 [1.39-2.11]).

"3O Workshop: Children and adolescentsâ€™ mental health during the corona pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented public health crisis impacting all age groups and all areas of society, irrespective of the risk of exposure or disease severity. In fact, containment measures put into place, such as social distancing, limiting mobility or closing of schools, carry many risks for health, especially for mental health. It is also said, that the pandemic accentuates existing health risks. Childhood and adolescence is characterized by ongoing physical, social, emotional and academic developments and dependencies, and is therefore considered a population of increased vulnerability. While this age group is not a high risk group for SARS-CoV 2 diseases, they are heavily impacted by the containment measures, which caused a drastic change to their everyday lives with closures of schools and recreational activities, social distancing and stay at home orders. Loss of day structure and contact to friends can be destabilizing. Children and adolescents rely on their parents for stability and security. However, the general and specific fears related to health and economic situation during the pandemic may affect parents' ability to provide this support. First evidence indicates a drastic rise in mental health problems in children and adolescents with potential long-term impact. The workshop addresses mental health in children and adolescents during the pandemic and will provide the opportunity to discuss public health reactions to this mental health crisis. We present four studies with data collected during the lock-down or pandemic, of which two present data on psychological difficulties and associated risk factors, underlining the role of parents in mental health of children and adolescents, while the other two address solutions, namely interventions for improving mental health literacy in adolescents and parental support groups. While the workshop topic relates to COVID-19 pandemic, the lessons-to be learned go beyond the current public health crisis. Key messages Covid-19 containment measures come with serious side-effects for mental health in children in Europe, strongly associated with parental health and economic situation. Public health must address the rise in mental health problems in children during and after the pandemic to ensure a healthy development of this generation.","","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.234","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22292,""
"Individual and organizational perceptions of hospital workers during COVID-19: the link with burnout","Background The COVID-19 crisis poses challenges to healthcare systems and their employees. Medical staff are at the front of the battle against COVID-19. They must cope with a crisis accompanied by personal health and occupational ramifications and ongoing job stressors, which may lead to adverse mental health symptoms and may affect the quality of medical care provided to patients. This study evaluated health workers' perceptions and concerns about the COVID-19 crisis and its management in an Israeli hospital. Methods At the end of the pandemic's first wave in Israel, 547 healthcare workers responded to an online survey, which inquired about COVID-19 concerns at the individual and family level, perceptions at the national and organizational level, perceptions of the way the crisis was managed, self-assessment of coping with the crisis and burnout, and demographics. Results Findings showed that healthcare workers expressed deep concerns for family members and apprehension at a national level. Respondents noted that they were coping well with the crisis while expressing negative perceptions of how the crisis was managed. The regression model showed that concerns for family members, perceptions at the system level, working directly with COVID-19 patients, and having negative perceptions towards the crisis management at the national level, were associated with burnout. Conclusions The findings of this study deepen our understanding of issues that require systemic attention to strengthen mental resilience among hospital staff. Several actions are recommended to improve healthcare systems' ability to continue fighting the virus and confront future health crises: Further examination and monitoring of healthcare workers' concerns and job stressors. Providing psychosocial support plans for frontline workers to ensure their safety and health and prevent burnout. Strengthening supportive organizational culture. Key messages Healthcare workers express deep concerns and perceptions associated with burnout. Health services management needs a good understanding of workers' concerns and develop strategies to address them.","Bashkin, O.; Davidovitch, N.; Asna, N.; Schwartz, D.; Dopelt, K.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.225","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22293,""
"Increasing the capacity of community health workers to manage the COVID-19 pandemic","In Romania, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the community healthworkers faced high risks of infection in their efforts to protect communities, due to exposure to psychological distress, fatigue and stigma, especially as they are the grass-root healthcare delivery workers. No proper training had been delivered to community health workers. We describe an intervention aimed at increasing Romanian community health workers skills and competencies. The objective of the training was to increase the capacity of community health workers and health mediators to adequately manage the COVID-19 pandemic in their communities, through the delivery of online training sessions focused on managing their communities and themselves. The courses addressed up-to-date information on SARS-CoV-2 virus, transmission, symptoms and methods of prevention and treatment of COVID-19, to community case management and addressing cross-cutting issues such as: disability, immunization, violence against children. A total of 144 sessions were delivered, totaling 288 hours, divided between eight trainers. During these 288 hours, 1658 community health workers and health mediators were trained, accounting for 75% of the community health workers and health mediators in Romania. The overall feedback was extremely positive, as the training provided the participants very useful information. Nonetheless, several learning points have been made regarding the provision of more hands-on examples and cases, an increase in the length of the course and in the number of courses, the delivery of the course - on site courses were demanded. The training contributed to increasing the capacity of community health workers and health mediators to adequately manage the COVID-19 pandemic. The training offered the basic knowledge and skills for community healthworkers and it offered a basis for offering large scale, online training for the Romanian health workforce, which could be used as a case study for other European settings.

"3F Round table: Advancing the sustainable development goals through intersectoral actions: using co-benefits","Objectives The aim of the workshop is to analyze how health can contribute to the attainment of the non-health related sustainable development goals (SDGs). To this end, we will discuss two separate though interrelated specific objectives: analyze the ways in which improved population health contributes to attaining other SDGs (co-benefits), with a method and a ranking of â€˜best buys';analyze specific ways in which improved health policy can contribute to attaining other SDGs (co-benefits) by analyzing intersectoral governance their contexts and politics. Background Country responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated that large scale intersectoral action for health is possible- if the policy issue is of high importance and sufficiently consensual. The problem this workshop addresses is how to keep this invaluable intersectoral work flourishing long after the COVID-19 pandemic has passed. Put differently, how can intersectoral work with the health sector continue to lead to increased health benefits as well as increased benefits for other sectors? One way to do this is the use of co-benefits in intersectoral action. Co-benefits are substantial and specific benefits to the other sectors that can be gained by investing in health-related programs. Co-benefits can be referred to as the intended positive side effects of a policy or intervention. Co-benefits avoid imposing its health objectives on other sectors but rather aims at contributing to the other sectors objectives. The panel will discuss the following cross-cutting issues the economics of co-benefits in intersectoral actions the governance and politics of co-benefits in intersectoral action To make the discussion as concrete as possible the panelists will focus on the following SDGS: SDG4 Quality education SDG9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure SDG10 Reduced inequalities SDG13 Climate action Added value The SDGs progress is uneven and sluggish. They have, however, become a benchmark for solving the most pressing issues humanity, the environment and the planet are confronted with. Discussing co-benefits as a way to advance intersectoral action and the attainment of the SDGs adds therefore great value. Coherence between presentations and the topic of the workshop: four SDGs have been selected to discuss exemplary the economics, governance and politics of intersectoral action based on co-benefits. Each of the panelist will therefore tie their contribution very closely to the topic of the workshop even though they are speaking on different SDGs. Interactivity After introducing the topic the panel discussion will go in three rounds addressing different aspects: a) the economics of co-benefits (magnitude, low hanging fruits);b) the intersectoral structures used to advance intersectoral actions c) the political force field and contexts in which to advance intersectoral action. In between these rounds the chair will pick up questions coming through the chat-box and feed them to the panelists. Speakers/Panelists Charley E.

"European Green deal and Climate Pact: A roadmap for digital public health","The Covid-19 pandemic crisis caused a serious â€˜tectonic' disturbance in all sectors, especially pointed out weaknesses of the healthcare systems. The recently adopted European Green Deal (EGD). It should take into account the Covid-19 pandemic challenge and maintain its primary objectives. The pandemic crisis has shown not only individual health risks, but also global health threats (direct and indirect). The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes an insufficiently known infectious disease. The subsidiary health effects are still countless: mental health, health-economic costs, deadlock in the other diseases treatment, etc. One of the main messages regarding environment, is that society should find new economic models less damaging to the environment and to biodiversity, implying circular economy, a less consumerist and active society: e.g. a 4 days-working week. Covid-19 took us to the extreme of being confined at home, either working or taking care of our families. However, the Covid-19 global quarantine and confinement (and huge reduction of travelling, mainly flights) had a great impact on decrease of CO2 levels, on the quality of air and on biodiversity. Vulnerability and lack of efficient action in many countries, is a strong warning for Europe (and globally) to insist in strengthening public health and convert lessons learned into action. The Coronavirus, originating from destruction of wildlife and intensive animal farming, will bring more pandemics in the future. We need more public health consideration towards effects of climate change on public health. It is possible to keep economy functioning by promoting remote work supported by digital platforms and innovation for international networks. Strategically, the European recovery plan should be aligned with the EGD. These challenges open the way to digital health, and as such, can be defined a roadmap to tackle climate change.","Jevtic, M.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.191","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22296,""
"3E Workshop: The Role of Digital Public Health in the European Climate Pact and Green deal","Europe is facing two major structural changes: the climate crisis, having a significant impact on public health, and digitalization of the economy, that could play a role in mitigating climate change and its impacts on public health. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our lives in many ways including how we see public health, the climate change and has created the conditions for the almost exponential growth for telemedicine and digitalization in healthcare. Underlining that the world is facing an increasing innovation and integration of digital tools to address public health and environmental problems, as the UN Secretary-General and the Director-General of the World Health Organization both declared that we are currently fighting a climate â€œpandemicâ€ in the same way as we are fighting COVID-19. Digital solutions have been implemented to address COVID-19 and impacted by reducing CO2 emissions and improving quality of life. Digital systems, including Artificial Intelligence, robots and drones, are now changing the paradigm of public health and environment management. Due to the complex nature of the information ecosystem our societies and communities live in, a digital public health approach can be managed to reduce harm to individual, community and population health, support social cohesion and trust in emergency response and interventions to deal with climate change. Digital health could, within 10 years establish a new paradigm in public and environmental health. Public health professionals need urgently to tackle digital health to bridge the gap with others areas of healthcare. During the COVID-19 crisis, national public health authorities have been challenged in the way they communicate with the public, engage with communities in collecting data to improve response, providing the scientific evidence, the day-to-day facts and figures. Likewise, The European Climate Pact provides a space for collectively develop and implement climate solutions. The Climate Pact is an open, inclusive and evolving initiative for climate action through an online platform and citizen dialogues and exchanges, it will foster the link between the digital and green transition. This workshop aims to share the experiences of digital public health interventions with significant impact on climate change mitigation during the pandemic. It will be organised as a round table, starting by setting the scene with an introduction to key digital health concepts and challenges. Each speaker will give a short pitch on how they have experienced the challenge of using digital systems in public health and how they approached its management during the crisis. This will be followed by a panel discussion. Participants will have ample time to ask questions to the panellists. The workshop will end with a summary of a selection of tools participants can use in their own environmental management activities and key take home messages from the panellist will be provided as a conclusion. Key messages Digital Public Health has been establishing evidence on interventions with significant effects on reducing the impact of climate crisis. A Partnership is needed across the health system and society to manage this crisis. European Green Deal and Climate Pact could be used as a roadmap in digital public health.","","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.189","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22297,""
"Mental wellbeing and engagement in health risk behaviours in German university students during the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings of a cross-sectional study","Background Daily life of higher education students across the world changed profoundly in 2020 with the implementation of governmental and institutional measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated mental wellbeing and engagement in health risk behaviours (HRB) in German university students at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Data stem from the COVID-19 International Student Wellbeing Study (C19 ISWS). The web-based survey was conducted in May 2020 at four German universities. HRBs included tobacco and cannabis use, alcohol consumption, and engagement in physical activity. All HRBs were assessed retrospectively and at the time of data collection. Mental wellbeing was assessed using the 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D 8). We conducted multinomial regression analyses to investigate factors associated with changes in HRBs and latent transition analysis to identify substance use profiles. Results 5021 students completed the survey (69% female;mean age 24.4 years, SD = 5.1). The mean score for depressive symptoms was 9.25 (SD = 0.67, range 0-24). Sixty-one percent of students reported consuming alcohol, 46% binge drinking, 44% inactivity, 19% smoking and 11% cannabis use. While smoking and cannabis use remained unchanged during the COVID-19 pandemic, 24% reported a decrease in binge drinking. Changes to physical activity were frequently reported, with 31% reporting an increase and 19% reporting a decrease in vigorous physical activity. Higher depressive symptoms were found to be associated with changes in HRBs. Five substance use behaviour profiles were identified, which remained fairly unchanged. Conclusions Engagement in HRBs remains at high level during the COVID-19 pandemic among German students. Depressive symptoms were found to be associated with changes in HRBs. Efforts to promote student health and wellbeing are needed in times of the COVID-19 pandemic and thereafter to prevent longer-term consequences.","Busse, H.; Fialho, P. M.; Stock, C.; Pischke, C.

"Gender differences in the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on socio-economic and psychological wellbeing of students in Russia","Background Pandemic of COVID-19 had strong impact on young people in high education whose life plans, education prospects and personal networks were threatened. Based on theoretical framework of differential consequences of catastrophic events for less privileged groups, we explore the impact of pandemic (IP) on genders in student communities. Methods The C19 ISWS survey was conducted in spring 2020 by web-survey method among students of Russian universities (2738 cases). IP was measured in five domains: 1) socio-economic: subjective evaluation of economic wellbeing before and during the pandemic;2) psychological (Depression Scale CES D8);3) social ties: change in frequency of contact with family and friends, intensity of contacts in hours per day;4) physical health (experience of COVID symptoms);5) academic workload in hours before and during pandemic. ANOVA analysis was used to investigate strength of impact on gender groups after controlling for other factors (age, city, grade). Results Change of financial wellbeing experienced 39% of students with 4% significant difference between male and female students. Male and females had different mental reaction to COVID on few aspects - anxiousness (13 points difference), apathy (12 points), restlessness (9 points) and general depression (7 points), but not on social aspects as loneliness and isolation. IP was not differential for health (22% in average experienced the symptoms of COVID), academic workload (decreased hours per day on 5% for both genders) and social ties (strong decrease in contacts with friends, small decrease in contacts with family but similar by genders). Conclusions IP is strong and differential by gender for socio-economic and socio-psychological wellbeing, but similar for social communication and social ties, health and academic workload. These results may serve as a basis for forming more effective communication strategies and social support to mitigate IP for male and female students.","Andreenkova, A.; Andreenkova, E.

"Depression among higher education students in Greece during the first C19 lockdown","Background The imposition of containment measures internationally during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has indicated the need for data on the psychological impact of quarantine. We use the C19 ISWS Greek dataset to examine self-reported depression in relation to alcohol and tobacco use, social contacts, relationship status and perceived risk of infection. Methods Online survey data was collected between May-June 2020. Eligible participants were higher education students in Greece and 889 students participated. We performed frequency analysis on the participants who completed the questionnaire (N = 585). Weights were applied to eliminate response bias and adjust the sample survey means and proportions to the student population in the country. Results Findings suggest that depressive symptoms are more frequent among female students, first generation migrant students and those in their first year of study. Students who were anxious about getting infected with COVID-19 reported higher rates of depressive symptoms. However, students with slightly higher rates of depression were not very worried about getting severely ill from an infection. The share of students who drunk systematically did not change during the COVID-19 outbreak, their rate is low (0% - 2.2%) and they do not report high rates of depressive symptoms. Depression scores seem to be affected by relationship status, the degree of contacts with friends, and the availability of a trusted person. Results indicate that the fewer the contacts with friends are, the higher the mean depression score is. Conclusions The results confirm the gender-gap in depression and are in line with evidence indicating the high prevalence of depression among women in Greece in the aftermath of austerity and recession. As Greece was one of the South-European countries hardest hit by economic crisis, it is possible that negative effects of the crisis have had a cumulative effect on students' mental health in the pandemic.","Stathopoulou, T.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.180","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22300,""
"Research use cases measuring the impact of COVID-19 on population health","Background Wide variations in COVID-19 infection and outcomes exist across Europe and within countries. PHIRI will look at COVID-19 impacts in specific subgroups by conducting research through use cases of immediate relevance for public health policies focusing on indirect effects of the pandemic related to healthcare and other policies to contain the pandemic. Furthermore, the use cases represent pilot activities for the benefits and added value of a research infrastructure by bringing together data from different European countries. Methods Four research use cases will focus on selected aspects of vulnerable population groups and risk factors, delayed medical care in cancer, perinatal health outcomes, as well as mental health outcomes and are selected based on public health importance, geographic coverage, feasibility of producing actionable insights and relevance for the PHIRI infrastructure. The use cases will demonstrate how a broad variety of secondary data (e.g. administrative and survey data) can be pooled and/or reused in a distributed way across Europe. Results The outputs of the use cases will be processed by formalizing data models, data management processes and analytical pipelines in an interoperable way to feed in the federated research infrastructure. The use cases facilitate research by making scalable, reproducible methods available within PHIRI and by publishing the FAIRified use cases analysis results on the Health Information Portal. They will provide outcomes to guide policy makers in preparedness and response scenarios and will ensure the development of a format for the timely dissemination of use case results to the targeted groups. Conclusions PHIRI will provide insights in real life use cases to generate immediate results on key health impacts of COVID-19 on population health to underpin decision making and will drive the development of the federated research infrastructure that allows rapid cycle analysis.","ThiÃŸen, M.; Bernal-Delgado, E.; Rodriguez-Blazquez, C.; EstupiÃ±Ã¡n-Romero, F.; Forjaz, J.; Gonzalez-GarcÃ­a, J.; Lyons, R.; Schmidt, A.; Seeling, S.; Zeitlin, J.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.176","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22301,""
"Research methodologies to assess the impact of COVID-19","Background PHIRI WP5 aims at identifying the research approaches, data uses, pathways, indicators, and new methodologies to assess the impact of COVID-19 on Population Health. Methods Based on a collaborative work of researchers from 20 European institutions, several literature reviews were planned using automatized strategies to map the research methods analysing the impact of COVID-19 and data pathways: i) a scoping literature search to identify indicators of direct and indirect impact;ii) systematic literature reviews on determinants of severity for short and longterm health outcomes;and iii) a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness and impact of tracking COVID-19 patients using digitals tools. Results In November 2020, more than 73,000 papers about COVID-19 were published. About 16,000 (22%) reported data aspects, and approximately half reported both data aspects and methodologies. The most used indicators of direct impact are incidence and prevalence, mortality, severity and sequelae. To explore the etiological and prognostic effects of frailty, multimorbidity and socioeconomic status, the main identified outcomes were: infection, hospitalization, ICU admission, mortality by COVID-19 (etiological);as well as ICU admission, hospitalization, survival, functional decline, quality of life, disability, mental health difficulties and work absence (prognostic). The search generated 10,139 records. The initial literature search about mobile applications and electronic devices for tracking of COVID-19 patients yielded 2500 records. Conclusions The use of machine learning tools to synthesize the research about methods and data pathways on COVID-19 impact is feasible, as the amount of published evidence is very large. The vast amount of available literature on COVID-19 requires specific methods of literature search and synthesis, and an integrated effort of an extensive network of researchers.","Nogueira, P.

"Mental health impact of the COVID disaster on older people â€“ how does it feel to be a burden?","The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a disaster that has impacted lives globally. The purpose of this paper is to understand the linkage between the COVID 19 disaster and its impact on mental health of older people 70+. To reach this aim we reviewed the literature on disasters, COVID and mental conditions of older people (70+). The mental responses of the COVID disaster are multidimensional and potentially long-lasting. Rates of mental conditions of older persons vary widely due to exposure to COVID, country, population groups and methods used when conducting the study. We identified a multitude of factors contributing to mental conditions in older people, in general. We identified COVID-19 specific factors which have an impact such as threat to own life and threat to life of loved ones, interruption of behaviors and services, and physical as well as social isolation. Additionally, in older age, life events and feelings of being a burden contribute to mental conditions. To better understand the long impact of the COVID disaster on older people`s mental health we need to understand also the impact of past life events which may exacerbate the impact of the COVID disaster on mental conditions as well the impact of the current exposure to the pandemic.","Lindert, Jutta","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.161","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22303,""

"2P Workshop: Disasters and mental health","Objectives To better understand the mental health impact of disasters in general and specifically the mental health health impact of the COVID pandemic. Humanity has witnessed disasters of all forms and from all causes across the globe in recent decades;we have seen the consequences on people, their health and on their mental wellbeing. The presentations of the workshop will present knowledge to answer the following questions: Could we have known and planned for what to expect when a pandemic like this was to hit? How were people's lives really affected by this pandemic and the subsequent measures taken? We do know that COVID 19 as a disaster had a wider scale of social impacts than it did physical ones. How does the isolation, inability to work as usual and general downturn of ordinary life impact on people? What if those persons already have a history of serious life events or of mental illness? We search for answers to these and other questions in this workshop of 3 differing perspectives: First, Prof. Sandro Galea will present knowledge on disaster and mental health, second we will identify specific impacts on mental health on older persons (Jutta Lindert) and third a view point from practice will help to better understand perspectives of those involved in giving care in the community during times of disaster such as the Covid-pandemic (Julian Mamo).

"A conceptual framework for supporting the mental health of the health workforce and key determinants","EXPH members and Opinion collaborators A conceptual framework was developed to guide the Opinion. The visual representation shows how determinants of mental health interact and displays the evolution of various mental health profiles of an individual over time under different stressful scenarios. Mental health is a continuum of two dimensions - mental wellbeing and mental health-illness. Mental health is influenced by a complex interplay of determinants. At work, these include both non-occupational and occupation-specific factors that interact. Following a particularly stressful event, an individual may face a possible deterioration in their mental health. There are various trajectories. The individual can respond or cope effectively and maintain his/her current level of mental health. If the stressor is intense, severe, and/or prolonged, deterioration in mental health may result. The level of deterioration depends on prior mental health and the interaction of non-occupational and occupation-specific factors. A recovery in mental health from the stressor may occur spontaneously or some form of intervention may be needed. Intervention could help to mitigate the appearance of a stressor (primary prevention), to mitigate impact of the stressor on mental health and/or ensure a rapid recovery from the stressor (secondary prevention), and/or decrease the rate of deteriorating mental health (tertiary prevention). Work-related risk factors related to mental health in the health workforce include issues related to role, relationships, control, demand, job-related factors, organizational environment, career-related factors, and interaction with non-work factors. Exposure-related concerns, burnout, and moral injury have received considerable attention during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lionis, Christos","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.148","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22306,""
"2M Round table: Supporting mental health of the health workforce: Recommendations from an EC Expert Panel (EXPH)","The Expert Panel on Effective ways of investing in health (EXPH) is an interdisciplinary and independent group established by the European Commission to provide non-binding independent advice on matters related to effective, accessible and resilient health systems. In a prior opinion on resilient health and social care following the COVID-19 pandemic, the EXPH recommended that aggravated levels of psychological distress should be recognized as a public health priority. In January 2021, EXPH received a mandate to examine what is known about interventions to support the mental health needs of essential workers, with a particular emphasis on the health workforce. The objective of this workshop is to present and discuss the findings and recommendations from the Opinion on this matter. The value added offered by this workshop is three-fold. First, it offers a multidisciplinary perspective on the mental health of the health force. Second, its findings on promising and/or effective interventions are evidence-based. Third, it provides a pan-European consensus opinion on a path forward towards providing support to this vulnerable group at multiple levels - from European and national policy to senior managers to occupational and mental health practitioners. The workshop will consist of 4 5-to-10-minute presentations from EXPH members and Opinion collaborators. After the first two presentations, there will be a brief 7-minute reaction session with the audience. After the last presentation, 15-20 minutes will be spent engaging in interactive discussion between the workshop panel members and the audience using a series of prescribed discussion questions. In the first presentation, the chair of the Opinion will introduce the EXPH and its collaborators and provide an overview of the mandate. In the second presentation, the conceptual framework for responding to the questions posed by the European Commission and key determinants of mental health in the health workforce will be presented. The third presentation will describe cost-effective and promising interventions relative to mental health of the health workforce and then detail conditions for the cost-effective, affordable, and inclusive. The fourth and final presentation will address the recommendations and corresponding action points garnered from this work. The interactive discussion questions to be posed to the audience include: To what extent do you see these recommendations as valuable? Has anything important been overlooked? What changes in public health research and practice are needed to effectively support the mental health of the health workforce? Key messages Appropriate guidance frameworks needs to be established, in some cases deserving legal status, to clearly establish mental wellbeing as an important workplace responsibility within organisations. The organisation, as opposed to the individual worker, is to be held accountable for worker wellbeing.","","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.146","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22307,""
"Evaluation of a school-based intervention to promote mental health literacy Preliminary results","Background Mental illness is one of the leading causes of ill-health and disability. The current COVID-19 pandemic poses an additional challenge on mental health, e.g., through increased levels of anxiety, depression and fears about the future. As most mental illnesses develop before the age of 25, young people are a critical target group for prevention. Mental health literacy (MHL) is considered to be a key determinant of positive mental health, thus, being crucial for mental health promotion and dealing with the aftermath of the pandemic. This project aims at (i) adapting an evidence-based MHL curriculum for German schools, as school-based interventions are suitable in reaching most young people, and (ii) evaluating its acceptance and effectiveness regarding MHL and stigmatizing attitudes. Methods An interdisciplinary team including representatives from self-help groups for mental health translated and adapted the Canadian â€œTeenMentalHealthâ€ curriculum for German schools. The evaluation design includes a pre, post, follow-up assessment of MHL, stigmatizing attitudes, and help-seeking efficacy. Results For better applicability of the curriculum, the original program was shortened, while keeping its core contents such as knowledge and myths around mental health and illness. Written and digital material was developed and distributed to teachers, which were trained to deliver the intervention. Preliminary results show high acceptability, a significant increase in MHL and a decrease in stigmatizing attitudes, while help-seeking efficacy remained unchanged. Conclusions An MHL intervention was successfully adapted for the German school setting. While evaluation is ongoing, first results indicate its effectiveness in promoting MHL among students, decreasing stigmatizing attitudes and high acceptability, even during the times of the pandemic. Further evaluation is necessary to confirm the preliminary findings and to gain insight into the missing effect on help-seeking efficacy.","Kirchhoff, S.; Fretian, A.; Wahl, P.; Bauer, U.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.144","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22308,""
"2L Workshop: Health literacy in childhood and adolescence (HLCA): A focus on health literacy in schools","Enhancing health literacy of children and adolescents is a critical means for health promotion and sustainable development. This is mainly because childhood and adolescence represent key stages for addressing health, social, cognitive, emotional and educational development and influencing health behavior and healthy lifestyles over the life-course. The education sector is particularly important, and schools represent a critical setting to facilitate health literacy teaching and learning, for example in health education classes or whole-of-school approaches. Regarding the question of what makes health literacy so important for children and adolescents these days, there are three key themes and recent developments which amplified the meaning and relevance of health literacy for public health and societies: (i) A globalizing world: Globalization and digitalization change the ways in which health is negotiated and promoted, including that today health information is almost limitlessly accessible in everyday life. (ii) The information overload: The overload of information - a.k.a. infodemic (short for information epidemic) - makes health literacy a critical skill-set in managing the overabundance of information that is available through digital communication channels;while at the same time children and adolescents are increasingly turning to the Internet and social media as sources of health information and for communication about health issues with their peers or social contacts. (iii) The COVID-19 pandemic: The pandemic has once again underlined how important health literacy is not only for understanding public health recommendations, applying health behaviours, avoiding unnecessary risks, and protecting individual, family, and population health, but also to learn about the importance of vaccination, to become knowledgeable and skilled in navigating the infodemic, and to identifying fake news and disinformation about COVID-19. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together five contemporary projects on health literacy from Germany in and with schools that reflect the above issues: (i) A cross-sectional pen-and-paper survey in primary schools on children's health literacy;(ii) A survey on adolescents health literacy;(iii) The development of a toolbox for health literacy interventions in schools;(iv) An intervention for improving adolescent's mental health literacy in schools, (v) A whole school approach and organizational health literacy in schools. Each project will be given ample time to present their findings, which will be followed by Q&A and an open discussion with the audiences. This workshop offers a forum for researchers, practitioners and policymakers interested in school related health literacy and school health promotion. By dialogue and two-way communication, vivid interaction will be ensured, allow building synergies, and facilitate networking and capacity building. Key messages Health literacy contributes to promoting and maintaining child and adolescent health in times of crisis like the COVID19 pandemic. Health literacy needs to be strengthened through investments in the education sector and school health promotion programs.","","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.140","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22309,""
"Changes in the utilisation of acute hospital care in Ireland during the first wave of COVID-19","Background Reduced and delayed presentations for non-COVID-19 illness during the COVID-19 pandemic have implications for population health and health systems. The aim of this study was to quantify and characterise changes in acute hospital healthcare utilisation during the first wave of COVID-19 in Ireland to inform healthcare service planning and public health policy. Methods A retrospective, population-based, interrupted time-trend study was conducted, using two national datasets, from 6th January to 5th July 2020. Results Comparison between time periods pre- and post-onset of the COVID-19 pandemic within 2020 showed that there were 81,712 fewer Emergency Department (ED) presentations (-18.8%), 19,692 fewer admissions from ED (-17.4%) and 210,357 fewer non-COVID-19 hospital admissions (-35.0%). Reductions were greatest at the peak of population restrictions, at extremes of age and for elective admissions. In the period immediately following the first wave, healthcare utilisation remained below pre-COVID-19 levels however, there were increases in emergency alcohol-related admissions (Rate Ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.03, 1.43, p-value 0.016), admissions with self-harm (Rate Ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.01, 1.91, p-value 0.043) and mental health admissions (Rate Ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.03, 1.60, p-value 0.028). Conclusions Public health implications of delayed and lost care will become fully apparent over time. In the short-term, backlogs in care need to managed and population health impacts of COVID-19 and associated restrictions, particularly in relation to mental health and alcohol, need to be addressed through strong public health and health system responses, including the adoption of a pandemic recovery plan. In the long-term, COVID-19 has highlighted weaknesses in the health system and is an opportunity to progress reform towards a universal, high-quality, sustainable and resilient health system, capable of meeting population health needs and responding to future pandemics. Key messages The COVID-19 pandemic impacted non-COVID-19 healthcare utilisation in Ireland with evidence of delayed and lost acute hospital care and increased need for emergency mental health and alcohol services. Population health and health system recovery from COVID-19 is a public health priority.","Marron, L.; Burke, S.; Kavanagh, P.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.133","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22310,""
"Assessing the health impact of staying at home, social distancing and lockdown measures during the Covid-19 epidemic","Objectives To systematically review the evidence published in systematic reviews on the health impact of staying at home, social distancing and lockdown measures. Study design We followed a systematic review approach, in line with PRISMA guidelines. Methods In October 2020, we searched the databases Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, and Web of Science, using a pre-defined search strategy. Results The literature search yielded an initial list of 2172 records. After screening of titles and abstracts, followed by full-text screening, 51 articles were retained and included in the analysis. All of them referred to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The direct health impact that was covered in the greatest number (25) of systematic reviews related to mental health, followed by 13 systematic reviews on healthcare delivery(1-13)(1-13)(1-13), and 12 on infection control. The predominant areas of indirect health impacts covered by the included studies relate to the economic and social impacts (15 and 7 articles respectively.

"Mental health inequalities in disruptions across multiple domains during COVID -19: an investigation in 12 population-based longitudinal studies","Disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated virus suppression measures have affected many worldwide but those already suffering from psychological distress may have been especially vulnerable. We investigated associations between pre-pandemic psychological distress and disruptions to healthcare, economic activity, housing, and cumulative disruptions. Data were from 59,482 participants in 12 UK longitudinal adult population surveys with both pre-pandemic and COVID-19 surveys. Participants self-reported disruptions since the start of the pandemic to: healthcare (medication access, procedures, or appointments);economic activity (negative changes in employment, income or working hours);and housing (change of address or household composition). Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between pre-pandemic standardised psychological distress scores and disruption outcomes. Findings were synthesised using a random effects meta-analysis with restricted maximum likelihood. Approximately one to two thirds of study participants experienced some form of disruption during the pandemic. One standard deviation higher pre-pandemic psychological distress was associated with: increased odds of any healthcare disruption (odds ratio: 1.30 [95% CI: 1.20-1.40];I2: 65%);increased odds of experiencing any economic disruption (1.11 [1.03-1.16];I2: 61%);no associations with housing disruptions;and increased likelihood of experiencing a disruption in at least two domains (1.25 [1.18-1.32];I2: 38%) or one domain (1.11 [1.07-1.16];I2: 32%) compared to no disruptions. Associations did not differ by sex, ethnicity, education, or age. Individuals suffering from psychological distress pre-pandemic may need additional support to manage stressful life disruptions. Considering mental ill-health was already unequally distributed in the UK population, this may exacerbate existing inequalities related to sex, ethnicity, education and age.","McElroy, E.; Gessa, G.

"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on population mental health policy: A Swiss case study","This presentation will explore the mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland with a focus on prevention and early intervention. To describe the pandemic context, the continuous literature screening on the secondary health impact of the pandemic measures on the mental health of children, adolescents and young adults in Switzerland will be used that Julia Dratva and the author lead on behalf of the Swiss School of Public Health and the Federal Office of Public Health. These findings will be complemented with selected results from the longitudinal Swiss Corona Stress Study that focuses on stress, anxiety and depression, the longitudinal COVID-19 Social Monitor that contains indicators on well-being and mental health, and the longitudinal &lt;&lt;Health in Students during the Corona Pandemic &gt;&gt; study that assesses student depression and anxiety during the pandemic. As a major finding, all three studies observed significant increases in psychological stress during the second Covid-19 wave. In the Swiss Corona Stress Study, for instance, 18% of participants reported severe depression symptoms in November 2020 relative to 12% in May, 9% in April during the lock-down, and 3% prior to the pandemic. The presentation will then describe the specific mental health responses. For instance, psychiatrists and psychotherapists were allowed to bill treatment by telephone and the recommendations and billing options have been regularly adapted in response to the developments. However, these changes have not yet affected medium-term mental health policies. Similarly, the continuous screening of the scientific literature is established as a short-term measure. It is reviewed periodically and extended only as needed. The presentation will discuss policy changes in relation to the long-term strategies and their present implementation state. Finally, it will draw initial comparisons with other European countries discuss implications for the future mental system in Switzerland.","Wieber, F.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.082","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22313,""
"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on population mental health policy: A Scottish case study","The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged many mental health systems across Europe. As whole populations experienced extended social restrictions of various levels, there has been an emerging appreciation of the importance of prevention and early intervention to population mental health. In response some countries and nations produced COVID-19-specific mental health plans or updated existing strategies. Mental health policy development can play an important role in countries' recovery from the effects of the pandemic. Policy can be defined as the position that a government takes on a particular issue including descriptions of how the government will respond, statements of scope, values, responsibilities, resource allocation, delivery, engagement and governance structures, as well as detailed commitments to actions. Policy frames the allocation of resources and effort in the direction of agreed social goals. Scotland had a progressive history regarding mental health service delivery, but less focus on prevention in its policy. This workshop will explore the mental health response to the pandemic in Scotland with a focus on prevention and early intervention. It will describe the pandemic context in Scotland, drawing on findings from the Coronavirus: Mental Health in the Pandemic study led by the Mental Health Foundation in partnership with Cambridge, Swansea and Strathclyde Universities and Queens University Belfast. This study has utilized repeated cross-sectional surveys of a representative sample of adults in Scotland to explore the emotional and psychological responses of adults to the evolving circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. The workshop will then describe the process of developing Scotland's COVID-specific mental health policy and highlights of the policy. It will report on implementation of the preventative and early intervention policy elements to date and discuss the implications of the pandemic for Scotland's medium-term mental health policy landscape.","McDaid, S.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.081","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22314,""
"Public Mental Health services in the European region during the COVID-19 pandemic","The European Public Health Association (EUPHA), in conjunction with the Mental Health Foundation UK, conducted a purposely designed online survey of public and mental health professionals from across Europe, exploring public mental health responses to the pandemic in different regions, nations and localities. Participants were recruited from EUPHAs mental health division and through snowballing. Four broad areas were explored, namely;(1) perceived changes in available mental health supports during the pandemic;(2) whether or not a public mental health response plan had been developed;(3) if any demographic groups or priority areas had been given particularly consideration in this response and (4) how the response had been developed (i.e. whether intersectoral approaches had been adopted and the perceived degree to which service users and carers had been included in its development). Forty-four survey responses from twenty different European nations were collected and grouped according to whether respondents were practising in countries with low, medium or high COVID-19 incidence rates. The majority of responses were from public health professionals with over 20 years of experience. Results indicated wide variations in policy responses to the crisis and in the way mental health services have adapted to date. However, in the majority of countries surveyed, while an increase in online mental health supports during the pandemic was reported, no change in long term funding for mental health supports was observed. In addition, in the majority of countries, several vulnerable groups were rarely given specific attention in policy responses, namely low-income families, people with long-term health conditions or disabilities and ethnic minorities. In this workshop we will discuss the findings from this survey and explore what insights might be learned from experiences across Europe to date.","Wilson, N.; McDaid, S.; Wieber, F.; Lindert, J.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.080","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22315,""
"1P Workshop: European Public Mental Health Responses to COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in multiple known risk factors for mental health problems globally. As such, evidence-based, intersectoral public mental health responses to reduce and mitigate the pandemic-related consequences are critical. However, studies exploring variations in public mental health responses to the pandemic from across Europe are limited. In order to shape and inform future public mental health responses to the crisis, there would be great value in knowing how mental health support systems have adapted to date. To fill the gap in knowledge of Public Mental Health responses, we organized this workshop in three parts: First, Naomi Wilson will give an overview on Public Mental Health service responses in the European region, second Shari McDaid will provide insights on the structure of Public Mental Health in Scotland and third Frank Wieber will give an overview on structures of Public Mental Health responses in Switzerland. Key messages Evidence-based, intersectoral public mental health responses to reduce and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic-related consequences are critical given the increased risk factors for mental health problems. The workshop will provide an overview how mental health support systems in Europe have adapted to date.","","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.079","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22316,""
"Health workforce protection and preparedness during COVID-19: a rapid assessment of EU countries","Background Healthcare workers face high pressures and new threats during the COVID-19 pandemic, and health systems and governance are key to improve preparedness and protection. This study aims to introduce a tool for rapid assessment based on an integrated multi-level governance approach and to empirically explore preparedness and protection. Methods The study is explorative in nature and applies a comparative approach. The assessment tool comprises four major dimensions of governance: system, sector, occupational and sociocultural issues (focus on gender issues and migrant healthcare workers) of protection and preparedness. Secondary sources and expert information serve the empirical exercise, using material from Denmark, Germany, Portugal and Romania. Results We revealed similar developments across countries: action has been taken to improve physical protection, vaccination of healthcare workers and digitalisation, while social and mental health support programmes were poor or lacking. Developments were more diverse in relation to occupational/ organisational preparedness: some ad-hoc transformations of work routines and tasks were observed in all countries, yet skill-mix innovation and collaboration were strong in Demark and weak in Portugal and Romania. We are able to identify major governance gaps in relation to integration of education and health systems, social and mental health support programmes, gendered issues of health workforce capacity, integration of migrant healthcare workers, and comprehensive surveillance and monitoring. Conclusions There is a need to step up efforts and make health systems more accountable to the needs of healthcare workers during global public health emergencies.","Kuhlmann, E.; BrÃ®nzac, M.; Burau, V.; Correia, T.; Ungureanu, M.

"How are countries supporting health workers? Data from the COVID-19 Health System Response Monitor","Background Health workers have been at the forefront of treating and caring for patients with COVID-19. They were often under immense pressure to care for severely ill patients with a new disease, under strict hygiene conditions and with lockdown measures creating practical barriers to working. This study aims to explore the range of mental health, financial and other practical support measures that 36 countries in Europe and Canada have put in place to support health workers and enable them to do their job. Methods We use data extracted from the COVID-19 Health Systems Response Monitor (HSRM). We only consider initiatives implemented outside of clinical settings where COVID-19 patients are treated, and therefore exclude workplace provisions such as availability of personal protective equipment, working time limits or mandatory rest periods. Results We show that countries have implemented a range of measures, ranging from mental health and well-being support initiatives, to providing bonuses and temporary salary increases. Practical measures such as childcare provision and free transport and accommodation have also been implemented to ensure health workers can get to their workplace and have their children looked after. Other initiatives such as offering continuing professional development credits for knowledge learnt during the crisis were also offered in some countries, albeit less frequently. Conclusions While a large number of initiatives have been introduced, often as ad-hoc measures, their effectiveness in helping staff is unknown in most countries. The effectiveness of these initiatives should be evaluated to inform future crisis responses and strategies for health workforce development.","Williams, G.; Scarpetti, G.; Bezzina, A.; Vincenti, K.; Grech, K.; Kowalska-Bobko, I.; Sowada, C.; Furman, M.; Galazka-Sobotka, M.; Maier, C.

"Occupational inequalities during the pandemic: epidemiological evidence","COVID-19 infection risks at work as well as psychosocial risks following the fundamental changes in the economy during the pandemic were equally distributed across the workforce. Obviously, certain occupations (e.g. health care) had particular high health risks but apart from that it has also been hypothesised that workers in precarious employment or with low occupational positions are also disproportionally affected. This contribution summarizes the epidemiological evidence on the association between occupational inequalities and COVID-19 related burden of disease. It will also comment on the possible mechanisms linking different aspects of precarious work with health during the pandemic - including social protection and occupational safety and health policies at the company level. The presentation relies on an unsystematic literature review conducted in Spring 2021 and on the results of statistical analyses of different datasets including hospitalisation data, official data on COVID-19 cases and a large German cohort study. Briefly, preliminary results suggest occupational inequalities in a) infection risks, b) risk of severe disease in COVID-19 patients, and c) non-COVID-19 outcomes such as depression or anxiety. It has to be noted, howewer, that the number of empirical studies on that issue is surprisingly low - in particular in regard to direct infection risks. The reasons for this lack of data and the possible implications for a timely policy responses have to be discussed.","Dragano, N.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.052","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22319,""
"The effect of COVID-19 on schoolteachersâ€™ emotional reactions and mental health","Background Schoolteachers play a major role in the society's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. When schools are open teachers are responsible for hindering spread of SARS-CoV-2, while carrying out their core task of teaching. This double role as well as the risk of infection may affect mental health in this occupational group. Therefore, we investigated schoolteachers' emotional reactions to COVID-19 and mental health during three phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark. We further analyzed if teachers, who belonged to a COVID-19 risk group, had more emotional reactions and poorer mental health than â€œnon-riskâ€ groups. Methods We collected questionnaire data in May, June, and November-December 2020 and used data from 2665 teachers employed at public schools (871 individuals participated in all three surveys). Participants reported their fear of infection, fear of transmission of infection to their home or pupils, perceived burnout and stress, and worries about their ability to manage the working conditions. We also had information about COVID-19 risk group status, sex, age, organization of teaching (physical presence or remote teaching), and the pupils' grade. We estimated prevalence ratios and took repeated measures into account. Results Fear of infection and transmission of infection as well as burnout, stress, and worries increased statistically significantly with 27-84% from May to November-December 2020 (p &lt; 0.05). We also found that teachers, who were particularly vulnerable to the adverse consequences of COVID-19, had the highest prevalence of fear of infection and poor mental health. Conclusions The dual role of teaching and virus control along with concerns regarding the health consequences of an infection may contribute to the observed increase in emotional reactions to COVID-19 and poor mental health from the beginning of the pandemic to the beginning of the second wave. Key messages The results raise attention to the working conditions, exposure to infection and mental health of teachers being in the frontline when schools were open during the COVID-19 pandemic. School teachers play a major role in pandemic control along with teaching obligations, which warrants allocation of resources, clear guidelines, and possibilities for protection from infection.","Nabe-Nielsen, K.; Christensen, K.

"Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy","Introduction Social restrictions imposed by the Italian Government during the COVID-19 emergency might have had a significant impact on mental health. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of depressive and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTDS) symptoms in a sample of Italian citizens during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. Materials and methods A cross-sectional survey was carried out between April and June 2020 using a snowball sampling. Depressive symptoms were explored through the Patient Heath Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), while the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTDS) was investigated through the SPAN (Startle, Physical arousal, Anger, Numbness) questionnaire. Poisson regression models were used to explore the association between the outcomes under study and sociodemographic/housing characteristics. Results A total of 10.758 interviews were collected and 7.847 (73%), complete for a minimum set of indicators (age, sex, area of residence), were included in the final analysis. The majority of the respondents were females (71%). Sample mean age was 48.6 years. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 21.2% and that of PTDS was 43.8%. Symptoms of depression and PTDS significantly diminished across age groups, in particular in people over 70 years compared with people aged 14-29 years (PR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49-0.86). A higher prevalence was found in students compared with retired people, both for depressive symptoms (PR 1.49, 95% CI: 1.05-2.10) and PTDS (PR 1.31, 95% CI: 1.02-1.69). Conclusions Prevalence of depressive and PTDS symptoms was high, in particular among younger people and students. That could potentially lead to adverse mental health outcomes in the future, with serious public health consequences. As the pandemic emergency is not solved yet, it is necessary to implement preventive strategies in order to protect the mental well-being of particularly vulnerable subgroups in the population. Key messages The prevalence of psychological symptoms was high in this sample during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. The subgroups of the population at higher risk for adverse psychological outcomes were younger people and students.","Rousset, S.; Camussi, E.; Piccinelli, C.; Senore, C.; Armaroli, P.; Giordano, L.; Ferrante, G.; Bert, F.; Siliquini, R.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.013","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22321,""
"Mental health in the general population over 1 year of the Covid-19 pandemic: findings from Ireland","Background The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and associated public health measures on mental health is a cause of increasing concern. We have measured indices of mental health among adults in the general population in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) during the period of May 2020-April 2021. Methods Nationally representative cross-sectional telephone survey with data collected in ROI during four study waves involving 3,920 participants: Wave 1: May 26-June 17, 2020 (N = 969), Wave 2: July 1-23, 2020 (N = 1014), Wave 3: September 5-28, 2020 (N = 1008), Wave 4: April 16-28, 2021 (N = 929). Participants were recruited from adults resident in RoI, aged 18 years+ using random-digit-dialling of land lines and mobile phones and interviewed by a professional market research organisation (Ipsos MRBI). Data from Waves 1-4 will be presented including trends over the 12-month period. Finding from Waves 1 and 2 are presented here. Mental health was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS), including standard questions on self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts. Results Of the 1,983 participants from Waves 1-2, 27.7% (n = 549;95%CI:0.26%-30%) reported symptoms of depression and anxiety, 74 (3.8%;95%CI:3%-5%) disclosed self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts. Female participants (RR:1.60, 95%CI:1.37-1.87), employed individuals experiencing work change (RR:1.50,95%CI:1.24-1.82), participants cocooning due to a health condition (RR:1.34,95%CI:1.08-1.66), those self-isolating (RR:1.25,95%CI:1.03-1.51) and those reporting moderate-heavy drinking (RR:1.27,95%CI:1.09-1.47) were at increased risk of depression and anxiety symptoms. Participants aged 18-29 and those in the two lowest income categories were most likely to report self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts. Conclusions The prevalence of <U+021B>anxiety and depression in the general population has increased relative to pre-pandemic estimates in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and associated public health measures. Key messages In nationally representative telephone surveys of Irish adults conducted following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the prevalence of anxiety and depression is estimated at approximately 30%. Higher than average levels of anxiety or depression were reported in females, those who had experienced a change in their work, individuals cocooning and those with moderate to heavy drinking.","Troya, M.

"Did the COVID-19 pandemic impact populationâ€™s mental health?","Background Sanitary, societal and economic effects due to the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to an impact on population's mental health. SantÃ© publique France (SpF), the French public health agency set up a specific monitoring based on emergency department (ED) and GP's associations (GPs) SOS MÃ©decins (SOSMed) data to early assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. Methods Since 2004, SpF daily collects data from ED participating to the OSCOURÂ® network (93% of French emergency attendances) and from SOSMed network. For both data sources, visits for several mental health disorders were analyzed for different age groups in 2020 and 2021 (until Week 16) and compared to years 2018 and 2019 (mean) with a focus on the two lockdown periods (resp W11 to W19-2020 and W45 to W51-2020) Results During the first lockdown period, while a major decrease of all-cause activity was observed in both networks, the number of SOSMed visits for anxiety increased in adults with a peak of + 115% in W13-2020 compared to 2018-19 and remained higher than the 2 previous years until W12-2021. An increase in ED visits for mood disorders (including depression) for children (especially 11-17yo) were also observed from W36 (back to school) and reinforced at the beginning of the 2nd lockdown period to reach +111% in W12-2021 compared to 2018-19. 11-17yo children were also concerned by an increase in ED visits for suicide ideation since W36 (peak of + 170% in W12-2021) and suicide attempt from W04-2021 to W12-2021 (peaks of + 45% and +41% in W05 and W10-2021). Discussion ED and SOSMed visits are the most reactive data sources to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of French population. These results confirm that the impact concerns all age groups. For children, the condition seems to worsen in 2021 and highlight the need of a close follow-up of the situation and the reinforcement of preventive measures in order to prevent long-term impacts.

"Alcohol and drug abuse as a manifestation of social stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic","During the pandemic, deaths associated with mental health deterioration due to social stress have contributed to excess mortality. The purpose of the study is to evaluate changes in mortality from causes associated with social stress during the pandemic in Moscow. The analysis is based on the Rosstat statistics and RFS-EMIAS database (Medical death certificates issued by the Moscow health institutions) in 2019-2020. Deaths from mental disorders and suicides during the maximum and minimum excess mortality in Moscow in 2020 were compared to 2019 (May and December, when mortality exceeded the 2019 indicators by 57.2% and 56.7%, and July with the 7.1%) excess. First, the excess mortality from mental disorders in these months was almost entirely due to disorders related to alcohol and drug abuse. Second, alcohol and drug abuse also results in deaths from poisoning. This necessitates a joint evaluation of deaths associated with alcohol and drugs (from mental disorders and poisoning). The evaluation shows that excess deaths from alcohol abuse in men in May 2020 compared to May 2019 equaled to 65%, falling down to 52.3% in July, followed by its maximum (2.5-fold) in December. Females show a steady increase: 52.9%, 76.5% and 2.1-fold, respectively. Distribution by sex of the total deaths associated with drug addiction (mental disorders and poisoning) was reversed: a steady increase in males (55.4% in May, 67% in July and 2.1-fold in December) and a significant decrease in females: 63.6%, 31.6% and 2.7-fold, respectively. Third, the pandemic has paradoxically affected deaths from suicide (including hangings, falls and undetermined intent poisoning). In men, excess deaths equaled to zero in May, 1.2% in July and decreased by 20.6% in December. The female excess suicidal mortality increased: 13.5%, 30.6% and 36.7%, respectively. Thus, the male reaction to social stress caused by the pandemic was passive (alcohol and drug abuse), while the female reaction was aggravated by suicides. Key messages During the pandemic, deaths associated with mental health deterioration due to social stress contributed to excess mortality. Alcohol and drug abuse results in deaths not only due to mental disorders.","Semyonova, V. A.; Sabgayda, T. P.; Zubko, A. V.; Ivanova, A. E.; Evdokushkina, G.

"Addressing inequalities and research funding in the post-COVID-19 era","The panelist will provide insights on how a charitable foundation focused on health research assess priorities to tackle global health challenges. The Wellcome Trust is also a member of the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT), which funds R&D for anti-infectives and diagnostics for diseases primarily affecting developing countries. COVID-19, related comorbidities, and their overall impact affect communities across the world. Global collaboration and real-time sharing on pathogen surveillance, sharing data/samples is key to ensure equitable access, particularly as the effects of COVID-19 are not be felt evenly across the world's population. Furthermore, the effects of mental health problems, escalating infectious diseases and COVID-19, can devastate communities for generations. It is important to consider both cross-country, as well as intra-country variations, and set clear priorities for LMICs, as well as for vulnerable groups and those most at risk in developed countries. Coalescing priorities and capturing narratives are key elements into brokering dialogue and establishing innovative partnerships to overcome long-standing and emerging challenges. At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, and with more people living with its long-term effects, incl. suffering loss and trauma, and we need to both get infectious diseases under control, as well as to fund discovery research in a context-relevant manner. Beyond the current crisis, we also need to consider how to build resilience in our communities, factoring in the effects of other parameters, as for example, climate change.

"The role of socioeconomic and educational determinants in the context of COVID-19","The Ministry of Health has committed a health inequalities impact assessment of the pandemic and policy response to the pandemic in Italy. The document reviewed the knowledge available to estimate the effect of the main mechanisms for generating health that primarily deserve mitigation. The results recommend to give priority to interventions of proportionate universalism that avoid in short term the social discrimination related to a) the recovery of non-COVID-19 treatments that have been displaced due in the lockdown, b) the access to prevention, immunization and territorial care for people most susceptible to unfavourable outcomes of COVID-19 due to comorbidity and most vulnerable to social disadvantage due to lockdown;c) the loss of social support for fragile and disabled people. In the medium to long term priorities are to protect those with low income and precarious work from social exclusion and the effects on mental and physical health;enable children from families at risk of poverty to benefit from suitable development opportunities;promote resilient and inclusive local communities to reduce isolation and generate help resources;also valuing the beneficial aspects of the pandemic: trust assets to health and adherence to health promotion, more physical exercise, etc. The report has also identified priorities for research including mechanisms that are more difficult to investigate, such as studying the interaction between environmental risks and the risk of COVID-19 infection and progression and the unequal mental health effects of the pandemic and confinement.","Costa, Giuseppe","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.005","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22326,""
"1B Round table: Biological, socioeconomic, legal and environmental health determinants in the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 represents a concrete global health threat that has resulted in exacerbated inequalities, threatening progress towards SDG3, and particularly SDG 3.8, i.e. UHC - leave no one behind. Underlying differences in terms of health and social care system organisation, service provision models and pre-existing epidemiological context have resulted in heterogeneous scenarios for burden of disease (BoD) distribution, both in terms of COVID-19-specific outcomes, and because of collateral damage, not only across, but also within countries and regions. Individual proximal factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, underlying comorbidities and perception of risk have contributed to increased individual risk of acquiring the infection and of developing severe disease complications, including death. In addition, systemic issues, i.e., individual financial capacity, legal status, and acute versus chronic care needs have affected access both to care and commodity. From the global health perspective, we are also witnessing determinants threatening sustainable development, with tremendous differences in terms of capacity to combat the disease and deploy disease control measures, as well as ensure financial stability, economic growth and societal resilience. Ensuring equitable allocation of test, vaccines and medicines, and the development of comprehensive strategies necessitates a deeper understanding of those at most at risk, with due protection to those most vulnerable across the world. A comprehensive approach to tackle all these challenges, whilst ensuring due consideration is paid to ethical and legal issues, necessitates sound understanding of determinants, vulnerability with systematic measurement and interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral collaboration. This RT will bring the perspective of academia, researchers and practitioners in the field, and NGOs, offering insights on emerging research, practice and strategies. It aims to broker dialogue, to identify key steps to counter the damaging effect of inequities to social cohesion and system resilience, and to inform policy making and global public health actions. Key messages Biological, socioeconomic, legal and geographical determinants are at interplay, affecting the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics both in terms of immediate and delayed health outcomes. Assessing and weighing the links of various determinants and COVID-19 is essential to inform current and future policy decisions towards attaining UHC and to ensure an equitable, resilient society.","","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.003","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Public Health; 31(Supplement_3), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22327,""

With a mix of research and development papers, the strength of this collection lies in the multidisciplinary teams of Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers working in academic, government and non-government settings and using knowledge and evidence created by and with Indigenous peoples to address areas of primary health care that remain underdeveloped in mainstream services, or where services have been missing in action for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.","Marriott, Rhonda, Reibel, Tracy","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1463423621000712","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Primary Health Care Research & Development; 22, 2021.; Publication details: Primary Health Care Research & Development; 22, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22328,""
"Learning from Teaching Graduate Students How to Design Climate Change Education Programs","This chapter discusses lessons learned engaging my graduate students in education policy analysis at the Harvard Graduate School of Education in designing climate change education curricula in partnership with educational institutions around the world. Studying those programs developed by my students, I draw out seven cross-cutting themes about what such an approach yields for students, for the educational institutions they partnered with and for my own institution, while drawing parallels between those curricula and the graduate course in comparative education policy analysis in which these curricula were developed. In addressing those themes the chapter revisits some of the central arguments presented in the introductory chapter about the urgency and the challenges of enhancing the effectiveness of climate change education, and some of the key conclusions of critical reviews of the literature on education and climate change about the limitation of existing approaches to the subject. Those themes are:Educating students to address climate change is about engaging them in active problem solving, not contemplation.While learning from doing is valuable, to advance the field of climate change education, it is necessary to conceptualize and theorize practice.The need to think broadly about learning outcomes in climate change educationThe power of contextually situated learningA Signature project-based pedagogy to Change Climate through EducationAugmenting the capacity for climate change education among teachers and schoolsThe limitations of infusing climate change education in existing courses The chapter concludes examining some blind spots in the climate change curricula presented in the book and drawing parallels between the education response to the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020 and the education response to Climate Change.

"Training Clinicians to Care for Patients Where They Are","Homelessness remains a pervasive, long-standing problem in the United States and is poised to increase as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals experiencing homelessness bear a higher burden of complex medical and mental health illnesses and often struggle to obtain quality and timely health care. The United States desperately needs to train a workforce to confront this large and growing crisis, but few health professional schools currently devote curricula to the clinical needs of people experiencing homelessness. This article discusses educational and curricular strategies for health professional students. Understanding the health needs of--and the social influences on the lives of--people experiencing homelessness is crucial for addressing this health equity challenge.

"Understanding the public sentiment and discourse on COVID-19 vaccine","The novel Coronavirus disease has negatively impacted human lives in various aspects leading to the global health crisis and economic fallout. The availability of vaccines in the U.S. is a relief. However, many people are not in favor of the COVID-19 vaccine. The study aimed to identify the emotions and themes of discourse related to the COVID-19 vaccine posted on Twitter. Sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques were employed to discover the sentiment and prevalent themes. The findings suggest that overall, the public has positive opinions towards the vaccine. Those people that show positive opinions appreciate the efforts of leadership, medical experts and pharmaceutical companies in developing the COVID-19 vaccine. They are feeling hopeful and relieved as the vaccines are/will be available. There are also people that hold negative attitudes towards the vaccines because of disbelief in the government and concerns about the efficacy and adverse reactions caused by the vaccines.

"The development of virtual fashion in the global clothing industry","Affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, the global economy has declined. However, the overall clothing industry has been hit hard. Virtual fashion has taken this opportunity to develop rapidly. Due to the pandemic, consumers behavior has changed to become more susceptible to the influence of social media and paying more attention to the social responsibility of brands. Virtual fashion represented by game collaboration, mobile apps, virtual avatars, and virtual clothing has gained traction in the post-epidemic era. In this paper, ten international brands related to virtual fashion were compared and analyzed by data collection. It indicates that the traditional clothing industry has ushered in a new transformation point with the help of modern cutting-edge technology, and the new virtual fashion will also enter our daily life from the experimental field.

"Providing Mental Health Services for the Formerly Homeless During COVID-19: An Autoethnographic Study","COVID-19 has led to a global pandemic that affects many industries and population. Homeless individuals are adversely affected by COVID-19 and are subject to higher risk of infection and serious symptoms. COVID-19 exposed many gaps in treatment for formerly homeless individuals (FHIs) who currently reside in permanent supportive housing (PSH). This autoethnographic report seeks to analyze the gaps in services for agencies that serve FHI from the perspectives of both the mental health specialist (MSH) and the FHI. MSHs can include social workers, nurses, and case managers. Due to COVID-19 being highly infectious and potentially fatal to older people and others with preexisting health conditions, agencies were forced to implement safety protocols such as social distancing and shelter in place. Researchers documented the new protocols implemented by agencies to abide by shelter in place and social distancing guidelines to protect the community and the agencies' employees. Researchers analyzed the common themes that emerged from MHS while serving FHI in PSH while working under shelter in place.","Lam, Brian PhD Lcsw, Giang, Jason M. S. W.; Tena, Socorro Iritzel B. S.

"Mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic: Analysis of twitter discourse","This study analyzed Twitter discourse to understand the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with mental health. The study compared tweets' volume over time, tweets' volume per mental health category, emotions, and the top hashtags on mental health before and after November 2019, the month on which the first COVID-19 case was reported. We analyzed a total of 273 million English tweets on mental health collected from 56 million unique users. Results and analysis showed a significant shift in trend for the volume of tweets on mental health over time. There was also a notable increase in the volume of tweets on depression, anxiety, stress, and suicide mental health groups. The volume of tweets posted by males and females was comparable. Finally, there was a noticeable increase in the average daily tweets that mention suicide prevention and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Rates of cognitive dysfunction, psychiatric distress and functional decline following COVID-19","There is a limited understanding of the cognitive and psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 during the post-acute phase, particularly among racially and ethnically diverse patients. Approximately four months after COVID-19 diagnosis, patients in the Johns Hopkins Post-Acute COVID-19 Team (JH PACT) Pulmonary Clinic underwent a clinical telephone-based assessment of cognition, depression, anxiety, trauma, and function. The majority of JH PACT patients assessed were women (59%) and members of racial/ethnic minority groups (65%). Of 82 patients, 67% demonstrated Ã¢â€°Â¥1 abnormally low cognitive score. Patients requiring ICU stays displayed greater breadth and severity of impairment than those requiring less intensive treatment. Processing speed (35%), verbal fluency (26-32%), learning (27%), and memory (27%) were most commonly impaired. Among all patients, 35% had moderate symptoms of depression (23%), anxiety (15%), or functional decline (15%); and 25% of ICU patients reported trauma-related distress. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional decline did not differ by post-ICU versus non-ICU status and were unrelated to global cognitive composite scores. At approximately 4 months after acute illness, cognitive dysfunction, emotional distress, and functional decline were common among a diverse clinical sample of COVID-19 survivors varying in acute illness severity. Patients requiring ICU stays demonstrated greater breadth and severity of cognitive impairment than those requiring less intensive treatment. Findings help extend our understanding of the nature, severity, and potential duration of neuropsychiatric morbidity following COVID-19 and point to the need for longitudinal assessment of cognitive and mental health outcomes among COVID-19 survivors of different demographic backgrounds and illness characteristics.","Vannorsdall, Brigham, Fawzy, Raju, Gorgone, Pletnikova, Lyketsos, Parker, Oh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaclp.2021.10.006","20211118","COVID-19; anxiety; cognitive impairment; critical illness; depression; functional decline","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22348,""

Here, we describe a pediatric multidisciplinary post-COVID-19 rehabilitation clinic model as well as a case series of the initial cohort of patients who presented to this clinic. A consecutive sample of nine patients (pediatric patients &lt;21 yrs of age) who presented to our clinic are included. The most common presenting symptoms were fatigue (8 of 9 patients), headaches (6 of 9), difficulty with schoolwork (6 of 8), ""brain fog"" (4 of 9), and dizziness/lightheadedness (4 of 9). Most patients had decreased scores on self-reported quality-of-life measures compared with healthy controls. In the patients who participated in neuropsychological testing, a subset demonstrated difficulties with sustained auditory attention and divided attention; however, most of these patients had preexisting attention and/or mood concerns. There were also some who self-reported elevated depression and anxiety symptoms. Pediatric patients with postacute/long COVID may present with a variety of physical, cognitive, and mood symptoms.

Objective of the research: to study the effect of self-isolation on the mental health of university students in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic; to identify the most vulnerable groups of students and the reasons of anxiety and stress. Materials and methods. The survey involved 872 students (68% - girls, 32% - boys) 1-4 years of bachelor's degree and 1-2 courses of master's degree at the age of 17-23 years old, enrolled in full-time education in three universities in Moscow. Results. The most vulnerable categories of students for mental health disorders, experiencing the highest level of anxiety and stress, are 3rd-4th year undergraduate and 1th year graduate students with an average level of academic performance. In this regard, the question arises about the need to develop and introduce programs into the educational process of universities to identify and provide psychological assistance and support to students who are acutely experiencing the consequences of the pandemic to maintain their psychological health.","Besschetnova, Kadutsky, Borisov, Magomadov","https://doi.org/10.32687/0869-866X-2021-29-s2-1412-1416","20211118","COVID-19 pandemic; mental health; self-isolation; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22350,""
"Adherence to systemic therapy in patients with psoriasis during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multicenter study","Adherence to treatment is important in chronic dermatological diseases. There are limited data regarding the adherence to treatment in patients with psoriasis during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to determine the rates of adherence to systemic treatments in patients with psoriasis and to identify the causes of non-adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional multicenter study from May 2021 to August 2021. A questionnaire including items regarding sociodemographic characteristics of the patients, disease-related characteristics, and treatment-related characteristics were filled out by the physicians. The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), Hospital Anxiety, and Depression Scale, and the Dermatology Life Quality Index were calculated. The rate of adherence and non-adherence to treatment and reasons for non-adherence to treatment were examined. A total of 342 patients with psoriasis were included (182Ã‚Â male/160 female) in the study. The mean age of the patients was 45.9Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 14.2Ã‚Â years. The average duration of psoriasis was 192Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 134.7Ã‚Â months. While the rate of adherence to treatment was 57.6%, the rate of non-adherence to treatment was 42.4%. There were no significant differences with respect to adherence to treatment in comparison with oral and injection-therapy groups. The most frequent reasons for non-adherence to treatment were inability to go to the hospital (19.2%), concern about the COVID-19 infection (16.3%), discontinuation of the treatment by the doctor (13.7%), inability to reach the doctor (7.3%), and inability to have access to the medication (7.3%). Adherence to oral and injection therapies was fairly high among our patients with psoriasis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psoriasis severity and duration of medication use had a negative impact on adherence to treatment.","Oguz Topal, Kara Polat, ZindancÃ„Â±, KÃ„Â±vanÃƒÂ§ Altunay, Akbulut, ArÃ„Â±kan, TopaloÃ„Å¸lu Demir, Sivaz, KaradaÃ„Å¸","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.14610","20211118","COVID-19; adherence; psoriasis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22351,""
"Reexamining COVID-19 Self-Reported Symptom Tracking Programs in the United States: An Updated Framework Synthesis","Early in the pandemic Koehlmoos et al (2020) completed a framework synthesis of currently available self-reported symptom tracking programs for COVID-19. This framework described the programs, partners/affiliates, funding, responses, platform, and intended audience, among other considerations. This current study seeks to update the existing framework with the aim of identifying developments in the landscape and highlighting how programs have adapted to changes in pandemic response. Our team developed a framework to collate information on current COVID-19 self-reported symptom tracking programs using the 'best-fit' framework synthesis approach. All programs from the previous article were included to document changes. New programs were discovered using a Google search for keywords. The time frame for the search for programs ranges from March 1, 2021, to May 6, 2021. We screened 33 programs; 8 were included in our final framework synthesis. We identified multiple common data elements, including demographic information like race, age, gender, and affiliation (all were associated with universities, medical schools, or schools of public health). Dissimilarities included questions regarding vaccination status, vaccine hesitancy, social distancing adherence, testing, and mental health. At this time, the future of self-reported symptom tracking for COVID-19 is unclear. Some sources have speculated that COVID-19 may become a yearly occurrence much like the flu, and if so, the data that these programs generate is still valuable. However, it is unclear if the public will maintain the same level of interest in reporting their symptoms on a regular basis if COVID-19 becomes more routine.","Janvrin, Korona-Bailey, Koehlmoos","https://doi.org/10.2196/31271","20211118","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22352,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Long-Term Care in Canada","The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected Canada's long-term care (LTC) sector, with residents of LTC and retirement homes accounting for 67% of all COVID-19-related deaths as of February 15, 2021. This study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on LTC residents across Canada during the first six months of the pandemic, including how care changed for residents, using data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information's LTC and acute care databases. The results suggest that LTC residents received less medical care, with fewer physician visits and hospital transfers compared with the same period in 2019. They also had less contact with family/friends compared with the same period in 2019, which was associated with higher levels of depression.

"Fatty Liver and the COVID-19 Pandemic: Health Behaviors, Social Factors, and Telemedicine Satisfaction in Vulnerable Populations","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted health-related behaviors that influence fatty liver disease (FLD) management. We evaluated the impact of the pandemic on FLD management and satisfaction with care delivery in this population. In the San Francisco safety-net hepatology clinics, we evaluated health-related behaviors and factors associated with self-reported weight gain during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as satisfaction with telemedicine in adults with FLD using multivariable modeling. From 06/01/2020-05/05/2021, 111 participants were enrolled: median age was 52 years, 30% men, 63% Hispanic, 21% Asian/Pacific Islander and 9% White. Eating habits were unchanged or healthier for 80%, physical activity decreased in 51%, 34% reported weight gain, and 5% increased alcohol intake. Forty-five percent had severe depressive symptoms, 38% in those without diagnosed depression and 60% of individuals with heavy alcohol use. On multivariable analysis, decreased physical activity (OR 4.8) and heavy alcohol use (OR 3.4) were associated with weight gain (all p&lt;0.05). Among those with telemedicine visits (N=66), 62% reported being very satisfied. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with 0.8-unit decrease in telemedicine satisfaction score (p=0.048) when adjusting for sex, age, and pandemic duration. Conclusion: During the pandemic, decreased physical activity and heavy alcohol use were most influential on self-reported weight gain in FLD. Maintenance of healthy eating and increased physical activity, alcohol cessation counseling and mental health services are critical in preventing poor FLD-associated outcomes during the pandemic recovery. Dissatisfaction with telemedicine should be explored further to ensure equitable care especially among the vulnerable Hispanic population.","Kim, Medina, Magee, Khalili","https://doi.org/10.1002/hep4.1873","20211118","NAFLD; alcohol use; alcohol-associated liver disease; obesity; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22354,""
"Ambivalent heroism? - Psychological burden and suicidal ideation among nurses during the Covid-19 pandemic","During the Covid-19 pandemic, the risk for nurses' mental health has rapidly increased. The two main goals of this study were the examination of (1) the psychological burden and (2) of suicidal ideation and its associated risk factors oneÃ‚Â year after the Covid-19 pandemic begun. This was a cross-sectional online survey. NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1311 nurses (96.9% female) aged 18-63Ã‚Â years (MÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 30.96, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8.48) were assessed for various symptoms of psychological burden, suicidal ideation and behaviour and its risk factors. Almost half of participants (41.5%) reported heightened levels of depressive symptoms, 691 (52.7%) reported a medium to high risk for burnout. One fifth of participants (21.7%) reported suicidal ideation in the past 4Ã‚Â weeks. The direct contact to people with Covid-19 was not related to the extent of the psychological burden. Depression, agitation, perceived burdensomeness and previous suicide attempt were associated with suicidal ideation.","HÃƒÂ¶ller, Forkmann","https://doi.org/10.1002/nop2.1130","20211118","Covid-19 pandemic; anxiety; burn-out; depression; nurses; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22355,""

"Examining Changes in Sleep Duration Associated with the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Who is Sleeping and Who is Not?","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in social isolation and reports of insomnia. However, reports of changes in sleep duration and associated factors are few. To determine the impact of COVID-19 on changes in sleep behavior, data were analyzed from an online survey of adults recruited via social media that included questions asking whether the respondent slept less or more after the onset of the pandemic as well as self-reported sociodemographic and occupational information; beliefs about COVID-19; and responses pertaining to loneliness, anxiety, and depression. There were 5,175 respondents; 53.9% had a change in sleep duration.17.1% slept less and 36.7% slept more. Sleeping more was related to greater education, being single/divorced/separated, unemployed or a student. Being retired, divorced/separated or a homemaker, and living in the Mountain or Central time zones were associated with less sleep. Beliefs that COVID-19 would result in personal adverse consequences was associated with both more and less sleep. However, the strongest associations for both more and less sleep were seen with depression, anxiety, and loneliness. In summary, changes in sleep duration since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were highly prevalent among social media users and were associated with several sociodemographic factors and beliefs that COVID-19 would have adverse personal impacts. However, the strongest associations occurred with worse mental health suggesting that improvements may occur with better sleep.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/08964289.2021.2002800 .","Batool-Anwar, Robbins, Ali, Capasso, Foreman, Jones, Tozan, DiClemente, Quan","https://doi.org/10.1080/08964289.2021.2002800","20211118","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; psychosocial beliefs; sleep duration","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22357,""
"Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery: a Special Risk Group for Lifestyle, Emotional and Behavioral Adaptations During the COVID-19 Lockdown Lessons from the First Wave","To determine how the COVID-19 lockdown influenced the lifestyle, eating behavior, use of substances, mental health, and weight in patients who had undergone bariatric surgery (BS) and explore the self-perception of one's own health and fears related to COVID-19. We performed a cross-sectional exploratory study in obesity patients who had undergone BS surgeryÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°1Ã‚Â year previously in a university hospital. Assessment was performed 40Ã‚Â days after initiating lockdown and included 2 periods: from April 24 until May 8 and during the initial de-escalation period: from May 9 until 22, 2020. A structured telephone interview and an online survey were administered. One hundred eighty-eight patients were interviewed; 156 also responded to the online survey (77% females, mean age 53.46Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.48Ã‚Â years, mean follow-up 5.71Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.30Ã‚Â years). Dietary habits were affected in 72% of the participants, with 15% reporting better diet planning; 83.5% reported having more sedentary behaviors; 27% and 36% showed depression and anxiety, respectively; and 45% of participants reported bad sleep quality. In relation to changes in the use of any substance, the use increased in the majority of patients who were previously users. Self-perception of one's own health and fears related to COVID-19 were only moderate. Finally, emotional eating and time since BS were statistically significant risk factors for predicting weight gain. Lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic negatively influenced the lifestyle, mental health, substance use, and weight in BS patients. These alterations were somewhat similar to those observed in the general population but more severe and with important clinical implications.","Andreu, Flores, Molero, Mestre, Obach, Torres, MoizÃƒÂ©, Vidal, NavinÃƒÂ©s, Peri, CaÃƒÂ±izares","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-021-05792-1","20211118","Bariatric surgery; COVID-19; Lockdown; Mental health; Obesity; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22358,""
"Needs of Children and Families during Spring 2020 COVID-19 School Closures: Findings from a National Survey","Despite extensive reports during the COVID-19 pandemic of the academic challenges facing students, and the effects of online learning on academic achievements, we have little information regarding the needs and difficulties of K-12 students and their families from a social work perspective. The present article shares findings from a nationwide survey of 1,275 school social workers (SSWs) reporting on their clients-schools, children, and families-during the spring 2020 COVID-19 school closures. SSWs indicated that the children and families they served had significant unmet basic needs, including for food, healthcare, and housing. Poverty and mental health compounded pandemic difficulties, which were associated with the sociodemographic makeup of schools. Student engagement in social work services during the closures was significantly lower than prepandemic levels, generally due to unmet material needs. Several policy and practice implications arise from these findings, including a need for additional services for students and families, a plan to address structural inequities in our schools and communities, coordinated outreach to reengage missing students, and recognition of the strong work being done by school staff coupled with a need for additional supports and resources to combat persistent inequality.","Watson, Astor, Benbenishty, Capp, Kelly","https://doi.org/10.1093/sw/swab052","20211118","COVID-19; basic needs; inequality; schools; social work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22359,""
"Shaping the Future of Social Work Practice in Healthcare: Addressing COVID-19 Needs through Integrated Primary Care","COVID-19 has illustrated the urgency of promoting integrated healthcare as the model of the future, with social workers not only supporting the physical and mental health of providers and patients, but also leading efforts to transform systems, policies, and social work education. Primary care, where the role of social workers is continuing to grow, is a central location for integrating the treatment of medical, social, and behavioral problems. In these settings, social workers can take the lead to meet community needs, assist in public health efforts, and bolster the frontline medical workforce. The following article reflects upon what we as social workers have learned a year into the global pandemic and how we can apply this knowledge to shaping the future of social work in primary care. Authors consider how the multiple medical and psychosocial needs of patients affected by COVID-19 are addressed in primary care through three core functions of social work: providing behavioral healthcare, coordinating care, and undertaking population health-based interventions. Article ends with a discussion about how social work can respond to the urgent task of transforming health within the context of social work practice, policy, and education for the next generation of healthcare social workers.","Dennelly, Sousa, Roberts","https://doi.org/10.1093/sw/swab046","20211118","COVID-19; integrated healthcare; primary care; social work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22360,""
"The Prevalence of Sexually Transmitted Infections and Sociosexual Behaviors in the South Korean Military Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study evaluated the epidemiological factors of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among South Korean troops including the prevalence, therapeutic methods, and sexual risk behaviors. The medical records of the STIs diagnosed troops at the Armed Forces Capital Hospital (AFCH) for 36Ã¢â‚¬â€°months (between January 2018 and December 2020) were retrospectively reviewed. The data collection for the study began after obtaining research approvals from the institutional ethics committee of AFCH. The patients were classified into two subgroups, pre-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and COVID-19 groups. The clinical parameters of the patients including STI-related symptoms and underlying diseases were analyzed. The sociosexual conduct of the two study groups was evaluated and compared by using a survey questionnaire. Overall, 138 STI patients with mean age of 21.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years were included (pre-COVID-19: 106 patients/COVID-19: 32 patients). 32.6% of the patients received college education before the military service. Regarding previous history of STIs, 24 patients (17.4%) had previous experience of STIs, which occurred before participation in the current study. Initial urine analysis results showed that 95 (68.8%) and 79 patients (57.2%) showed pyuria and bacteriuria, respectively. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (29.7%) was the most commonly identified pathogen. Each pathogen was treated with the therapies recommended by the current treatment guidelines, and no patient showed any recurrence of the disease during follow-up. Both pre-COVID-19 (91.5%) and COVID-19 (93.8%) groups showed high rates of binge drinking during off-duty. The pre-COVID-19 group had a greater number of patients (21.7%) having multiple sex partners (during the past 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months) than the COVID-19 group (15.6%). The COVID-19 group had 18.8% of the troops involved in sexual activity even after the onset of STI-related clinical symptoms, whereas the rate was significantly higher than 2.8% of the pre-COVID-19 group (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). The COVID-19 groups showed a significantly higher number of patients (four patients, 12.5%) experiencing suicidal ideation than the pre-COVID-19 group (two patients, 1.9%) (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.010). Both groups showed &lt;40% of condom use rates at the last sexual intercourse. The soldiers with STIs showed high rates of binge alcohol consumption, while the rates of engaging in safe sex by using condoms are markedly low. Although the COVID-19 group was under influence of social distancing and military base lockdown, the soldiers' sociosexual conduct was not significantly different in the pre-COVID-19 group. The importance of education on alcohol misuse and safe sexual relationships should be taken more seriously within the military.","Oh, Baeck, Lee, Park, Yu","https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usab479","20211118","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22361,""
"Psychosocial effects of the quarantine during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on the residents of the island of BraÃ„Â","An unprecedented health and economic crisis in small island communities during the COVID-19 pandemic indicated the importance of studying its harmful effects on residents' mental health. To examine the differences in negative affectivity, perceived stressors, and social support both on the quarantined and not quarantined islands. A web-based survey and correlational cross-sectional research design were used, based on a nonprobabilistic convenience sampling method to select 613 Croatian islands' residents during May 2020. The participants completed the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the General Information Questionnaire, data on their exposures to stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic and the perceived social support. Compared with the nonquarantined residents of other islands, the island of BraÃ„Â residents scored significantly higher on the symptoms of depression (M = 11.61; t = 2.13, P &lt; 0.05) and stress (M = 13.06; t = 3.21, P = 0.001) subscales, receiving more support from religious communities (t = 2.34, P = 0.02) and less from the physicians (t = -2.68, P = 0.01). Lower sociodemographic status was associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need to protect mental health in isolated island areas specially for singles and people of low socioeconomic status. This study contributed to the recognition and understanding of the pandemicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impact on the mental health of the isolated island population. The aim was to examine the differences in perceived stressors, perceived social support, and negative affectivity (symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress) between residents of BraÃ„Â directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and residents of other islands not directly exposed to the pandemic. A total of 613 inhabitants of the Croatian islands were included in the analysis during pandemic in May 2020. All participants answered web-based survey about perceived stressors, social support, and psychological symptoms. Staying on the quarantined island during the pandemic significantly contributed to the levels of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms. It also highlighted the positive impact of connections with family members and the religious community as well as the negative impact of lower socioeconomic status on adaptation in times of pandemic. Despite the short duration, the psychological effects of a pandemic were more visible in residents of an island affected by a pandemic compared with residents of other islands not exposed to COVID-19 pandemic.","MrduljaÃ…Â¡-Ã„ÂujiÃ„â€¡, AntiÃ„ÂeviÃ„â€¡, BritviÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmab128","20211118","COVID-19 pandemic; family medicine; islands; mental health; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22362,""
"Latinx Sexual Minority Men's Behavioral, Psychosocial, and Medical Experiences during COVID-19: Differences across Immigration Statuses","Latinx sexual minority men (LSMM) are at the intersection of two communities disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. To develop and deploy appropriate resources to support LSMM, it is important to understand the behavioral, psychosocial, and medical experiences of this population during COVID-19, as well as for LSMM of different immigration statuses. The current study uses the Pandemic Stress Index (PSI) to describe LSMM's self-reported behavioral, psychosocial, and medical experiences during COVID-19. Logistic and linear regressions compared experiences during COVID-19 among LSMM across different immigration statuses (recent, established, and US-born as the reference group). LSMM's responses to the PSI indicated they experienced anxiety (64.4%), depression (59.0%), alcohol/substance use (27.6%), as well as loneliness (50.1%) and sleep problems (60.4%). Overall, over half reported personal financial loss, the odds of which were 2.75 times greater among LSMM who were recent immigrants compared to US-born LSMM (OR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.30, 5.82). Nearly 8% reported being diagnosed with COVID-19, with the odds four and a half times greater among established immigrants compared to US-born LSMM (OR = 4.52, 95% CI: 1.60, 12.81). The findings have implications for tailored support resources and public health interventions to reach LSMM in general and LSMM with immigration histories.","Harkness, Weinstein, Mayo, Rodriguez-Diaz, Safren","https://doi.org/10.1891/lgbtq-2020-0054","20211118","Health disparities; LGBTQ health; ethnic minority; intersectionality; sexual minority","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22363,""
"Prevalence of Depressive Symptoms in Patients With Psoriatic Arthritis: Have Numbers Changed During the COVID-19 Pandemic?","This longitudinal analysis compares the prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with psoriatic arthritis in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from a national patient register in Germany were analyzed regarding the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ-2) to identify cases suspicious for depression at two time points, i.e., before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Only patients with complete concurrent information on the Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis Score (DAPSA) were included in the analysis. The frequency of depressive symptoms in psoriatic arthritis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic did not differ from the prevalence rates measured before. In addition, prevalence rates for depressive symptoms did not differ when stratifying the patient sample for DAPSA levels of disease activity measured before the pandemic. These results were confirmed further in a sensitivity analysis, limiting the second PHQ-2 assessment to lockdown periods only. However, longitudinal data on the prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with rheumatic diseases, in general, and psoriatic arthritis, in particular, are scarce in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. For a sensible comparison of prevalence rates for depressive symptoms in the future, underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and resulting local healthcare disruptions need to be taken into account, besides the potential use of different depression screening tools to evaluate resulting numbers sensibly and draw corresponding conclusions for patient care.","Englbrecht, Bartz-Bazzanella, von der Decken, Gauler, Wurth, Aries, Karberg, Kuhn, Schuch, SpÃƒÂ¤thling-Mestekemper, VorbrÃƒÂ¼ggen, Wendler, Welcker, Kleinert","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.748262","20211118","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; arthritis; depression; depressive symptoms; psoriatic arthritis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22364,""
"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Mobile Phone Dependence, and Academic Boredom in Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has threatened adolescents' mental health and even elicited their academic problems. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most common negative psychological reactions, and academic boredom is a typical academic problem to the pandemic. PTSD might be related to academic boredom, but the underlying mechanism of this potential relation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic remains unclear. <b>Aims:</b> Under the framework of the job demands-resources model and the model of compensatory internet use, this study aims to examine the mediating role of mobile phone dependency in the relation between PTSD and academic boredom. <b>Methods:</b> Six hundred and thirty-one middle school students in Hubei Province were investigated using self-report questionnaires. SPSS19.0 and Mplus7.0 were used for data analysis. <b>Results:</b> PTSD symptoms were associated positively with academic boredom, and mobile phone dependence played a mediating role in the relation between PTSD and academic boredom. Specifically, adolescents with severe PTSD symptoms tended to report greater dependency on mobile phones, and hence show higher levels of boredom in learning. <b>Conclusion:</b> PTSD symptoms of adolescents directly aggravated their academic boredom, and indirectly affected academic boredom by increasing their dependence on mobile phones.","Shen, Wu, Zhen, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.724732","20211118","COVID-19; PTSD; academic boredom; adolescent; mobile phone dependence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22365,""
"The Role of Perceived Organizational Support in Mental Health of Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Background:</b> Data support the link between the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and mental distress in healthcare workers (HCWs).

"Mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic as revealed by helpline calls","Mental health is an important component of public health, especially in times of crisis. However, monitoring public mental health is difficult because data are often patchy and low-frequency<sup>1-3</sup>. Here we complement established approachesÃ‚Â by using data from helplines, which offer a real-time measure of 'revealed' distress and mental health concerns across a range of topics<sup>4-9</sup>. We collected data on 8 million calls from 19 countries, focusing on the COVID-19 crisis. Call volumes peaked six weeks after the initial outbreak, at 35% above pre-pandemic levels. The increase was driven mainly by fear (including fear of infection), loneliness and, later in the pandemic, concerns about physical health. Relationship issues, economic problems, violence and suicidal ideation, however, were less prevalent than before the pandemic. This pattern was apparent both during the first wave and during subsequent COVID-19 waves. Issues linked directly to the pandemic therefore seem to have replaced rather than exacerbated underlying anxieties. Conditional on infection rates, suicide-related calls increased when containment policies became more stringent and decreased when income support was extended. This implies that financial relief can allay the distress triggered by lockdown measures and illustrates the insights that can be gleaned from the statistical analysis of helpline data.","BrÃƒÂ¼lhart, KlotzbÃƒÂ¼cher, Lalive, Reich","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04099-6","20211118","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22369,""

Using multinomial logistic regression models, we estimated associations between children's mental health, children's health behaviors, schooling, and socioeconomic characteristics of the children's families. The sample consisted of 5702 children aged 8-9Ã‚Â years, including 50.2% girls. In multivariate logistic regression models, children's sleeping difficulties were associated with children's abnormal symptoms of both hyperactivity-inattention (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 2.05; 95% Confidence Interval 1.70-2.47) and emotional symptoms (aOR 5.34; 95% CI 4.16-6.86). Factors specifically associated with abnormal hyperactivity/inattention were: male sex (aOR 2.29; 95% CI 1.90-2.76), access to specialized care prior to the pandemic and its suspension during school closure (aOR 1.51; 95% CI 1.21-1.88), abnormal emotional symptoms (aOR 4.06; 95% CI 3.11-5.29), being unschooled or schooled with assistance before lockdown (aOR 2.13; 95% CI 1.43-3.17), and tutoring with difficulties or absence of a tutor (aOR 3.25; 95% CI 2.64-3.99; aOR 2.47; 95% CI 1.48-4.11, respectively). Factors associated with children's emotional symptoms were the following: being born pre-term (aOR 1.34; 95% CI 1.03-1.73), COVID-19 cases among household members (aOR 1.72; 95% CI 1.08-2.73), abnormal symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention (aOR 4.18; 95% CI 3.27-5.34) and modest income (aOR 1.45; 95% CI 1.07-1.96; aOR 1.36; 95% CI 1.01-1.84). Multiple characteristics were associated with elevated levels of symptoms of hyperactivity-inattention and emotional symptoms in children during the period of school closure due to COVID-19. Further studies are needed to help policymakers to balance the pros and cons of closing schools, taking into consideration the educational and psychological consequences for children.","Monnier, Moulin, Thierry, Vandentorren, CÃƒÂ´tÃƒÂ©, Barbosa, Falissard, Plancoulaine, Charles, Simeon, Geay, Marchand, Ancel, Melchior, Rouquette, Galera, Bajos, Carrat, Ancel, Charles, Jusot, Martin, Meyer, PailhÃƒÂ©, Rouquette, Severi, Spire, Touvier, Zins","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-01676-7","20211118","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22370,""
"Postinfection Irritable Bowel Syndrome","Following acute gastroenteritis (AGE) due to bacteria, viruses, or protozoa, a subset of patients develop new onset Rome criteria positive irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), called postinfection IBS (PI-IBS). The pooled prevalence of PI-IBS following AGE was 11.5%. PI-IBS is the best natural model that suggests that a subset of patients with IBS may have an organic basis. Several factors are associated with a greater risk of development of PI-IBS following AGE including female sex, younger age, smoking, severity of AGE, abdominal pain, bleeding per rectum, treatment with antibiotics, anxiety, depression, somatization, neuroticism, recent adverse life events, hypochondriasis, extroversion, negative illness beliefs, history of stress, sleep disturbance, and family history of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), currently called disorder of gut-brain interaction. Most patients with PI-IBS present with either diarrhea-predominant IBS or the mixed subtype of IBS, and overlap with other FGIDs, such as functional dyspepsia is common. The drugs used to treat non-constipation IBS may also be useful in PI-IBS treatment. Since randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of drugs to treat PI-IBS are rare, more studies are needed on this issue.","Ghoshal","https://doi.org/10.5009/gnl210208","20211118","COVID-19; Dysentery; Enteritis; Gastrointestinal disorders; Tropical sprue","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22371,""
"In the eye of the storm: impact of COVID-19 pandemic on admission patterns to paediatric intensive care units in the UK and Eire","The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic had a relatively minimal direct impact on critical illness in children compared to adults. However, children and paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) were affected indirectly. We analysed the impact of the pandemic on PICU admission patterns and patient characteristics in the UK and Ireland. We performed a retrospective cohort study of all admissions to PICUs in childrenÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã‚Â years during Jan-Dec 2020, using data collected from 32 PICUs via a central database (PICANet). Admission patterns, case-mix, resource use, and outcomes were compared with the four preceding years (2016-2019) based on the date of admission. There were 16,941 admissions in 2020 compared to an annual average of 20,643 (range 20,340-20,868) from 2016 to 2019. During 2020, there was a reduction in all PICU admissions (18%), unplanned admissions (20%), planned admissions (15%), and bed days (25%). There was a 41% reduction in respiratory admissions, and a 60% reduction in children admitted with bronchiolitis but an 84% increase in admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis during 2020 compared to the previous years. There were 420 admissions (2.4%) with either PIMS-TS or COVID-19 during 2020. Age and sex adjusted prevalence of unplanned PICU admission reduced from 79.7 (2016-2019) to 63.1 per 100,000 in 2020. Median probability of death [1.2 (0.5-3.4) vs. 1.2 (0.5-3.4) %], length of stay [2.3 (1.0-5.5) vs. 2.4 (1.0-5.7) days] and mortality rates [3.4 vs. 3.6%, (risk-adjusted OR 1.00 [0.91-1.11, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.93])] were similar between 2016-2019 and 2020. There were 106 fewer in-PICU deaths in 2020 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°605) compared with 2016-2019 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°711). The use of a high-quality international database allowed robust comparisons between admission data prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant reduction in prevalence of unplanned admissions, respiratory diseases, and fewer child deaths in PICU observed may be related to the targeted COVID-19 public health interventions during the pandemic. However, analysis of wider and longer-term societal impact of the pandemic and public health interventions on physical and mental health of children is required.","Kanthimathinathan, Buckley, Davis, Feltbower, Lamming, Norman, Palmer, Peters, Plunkett, Ramnarayan, Scholefield, Draper","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-021-03779-z","20211118","Admission patterns; COVID19; Case mix; Paediatric intensive care unit","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22372,""
"""Watch Me Grow- Electronic (WMG-E)"" surveillance approach to identify and address child development, parental mental health, and psychosocial needs: study protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated economic recession has increased parental psychosocial stress and mental health challenges. This has adversely impacted child development and wellbeing, particularly for children from priority populations (culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) and rural/regional communities) who are at an already increased risk of health inequality. The increased mental health and psychosocial needs were compounded by the closure of in-person preventive and health promotion programs resulting in health organisations embracing technology and online services. Watch Me Grow- Electronic (WMG-E) - developmental surveillance platform- exemplifies one such service. WMG-E was developed to monitor child development and guide parents towards more detailed assessments when risk is identified. This Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) aims to expand WMG-E as a digital navigation tool by also incorporating parents' mental health and psychosocial needs. Children and families needing additional assessments and supports will be electronically directed to relevant resources in the 'care-as-usual' group. In contrast, the intervention group will receive continuity of care, with additional in-person assessment and 'warm hand over' by a 'service navigator' to ensure their needs are met. Using an RCT we will determine: (1) parental engagement with developmental surveillance; (2) access to services for those with mental health and social care needs; and (3) uptake of service recommendations. Three hundred parents/carers of children aged 6 months to 3 years (recruited from a culturally diverse, or rural/regional site) will be randomly allocated to the 'care-as-usual' or 'intervention' group. A mixed methods implementation evaluation will be completed, with semi-structured interviews to ascertain the acceptability, feasibility and impact of the WMG-E platform and service navigator. Using WMG-E is expected to: normalise and de-stigmatise mental health and psychosocial screening; increase parental engagement and service use; and result in the early identification and management of child developmental needs, parental mental health, and family psychosocial needs. If effective, digital solutions such as WMG-E to engage and empower parents alongside a service navigator for vulnerable families needing additional support, will have significant practice and policy implications in the pandemic/post pandemic period. The trial (Protocol No. 1.0, Version 3.1) was registered with ANZCTR (registration number: ACTRN12621000766819 ) on July 21st, 2021 and reporting of the trial results will be according to recommendations in the CONSORT Statement.","Eapen, Woolfenden, Schmied, Jalaludin, Lawson, Liaw, Lingam, Page, Cibralic, Winata, Mendoza Diaz, Lam-Cassettari, Burley, Boydell, Lin, Masi, Katz, Dadich, Preddy, Bruce, Raman, Kohlhoff, Descallar, Karlov, Kaplun, Arora, Di Mento, Smead, Doyle, Grace, McClean, Blight, Wood, Raine","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07243-0","20211118","Child development; Developmental surveillance; Digital solution; Electronic platform; Online health service; Parent mental health; Psychosocial needs; Screening; Service navigation; Virtual care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22373,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on post graduate medical education and training","The novel Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) has had a significant impact worldwide that led to changes in healthcare. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on trainee's mental health and educational preparedness. Trainees at the Indiana University School of Medicine were surveyed regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their training. Using a Likert scale, participants were asked questions pertaining to educational preparedness, mental health, and clinical work during the pandemic. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 27. The study was approved as exempt by the Institutional review Board (IRB). 324 of the 1204 trainees responded to the survey. The respondents were 76% white with an equal distribution of males and females. A majority of the respondents were first year residents with an equal distribution of second, third, and fourth year residents. Twenty-three percent of respondents were in a procedural residency or fellowship program. Better perceived educational preparedness was associated with an improved home-work balance during COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 0.506, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001) and having a department that advocated/supported focus on mental health during COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 0.177, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). Worse perceived educational preparedness was associated with being in procedural vs. non-procedural dominant training program (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.122, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the training experience of residents and fellows. Departmental support increased mental well-being and perceived education preparedness in trainees. Trainees that felt they had a better home-work life balance had better educational preparedness compared to their peers. Also, trainees in procedural programs had less educational preparedness compared to their peers in non-procedural programs. This study highlights the importance for programs to find avenues to increase educational preparedness in their trainees while being attuned to the mental health of their trainees.","Enujioke, McBrayer, Soe, Imburgia, Robbins","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-03019-6","20211118","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-19","",22374,""
