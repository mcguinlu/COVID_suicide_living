"Longitudinal Assessment for Anxiety and Depression among Frontline Medical Staff at a Specialized Hospital to Admit Patients with COVID-19","Longitudinal alterations of mental health problems still lack clarity among frontline medical staff treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Mental health surveys were conducted from February 19 to 23 (n = 222), from March 3 to 10 (n = 364), from March 15 to 22 (n = 446), and from March 25 to April 3 (n = 174), 2020, of medical staff working at medical staff at a specializ ed hospital to admit patients with COVID-19 in China. The rate of reporting anxiety remained unchanged within 6 weeks, but the rate of reporting depression increased at week 3 and remained unchanged afterwards. Age was an independent risk factor for symptoms of anxiety and depression, and working days were independent risk factors for symptoms of depression. These results highlight the importance of dynamic assessment. Copyright Â© 2022, Universidade de Sao Paulo. Museu de Zoologia. All rights reserved.","Wang, X. H.; Wang, D. B.; Wang, Y.; Cui, L.

"Risk Perception In Practice Of Polish Mncs In Kazakhstan During Covid-19 Time","Motivation: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a major crisis in global economy. The year 2020 will be remembered in the history of global economy as the year of a massive supply and demand shock, and, consequently, a slump in economic growth in most countries. The effects of the pandemic will be felt to varying degrees by the majority of the worldâ€™s economic entities. One such effect is the radical decrease in global foreign direct investment (FDI). It is hard to assess now how heavily the pandemic will influence the long-term FDI trends. The perception of the pandemic risk is, however, likely to heighten. This article deals with foreign direct investment risks, and more specifically, with the pandemic risk seen as one of natural risks in COVID-19-related contexts. Aim: The article aims to identify how the enterprises with Polish capital in Kazakhstan perceive the pandemic risk in comparison with other FDI risks. The authors of this paper were co-investigators on a scientific research project concerning FDI in Kazakhstan as exemplified by the investment intensity of Polish enterprises. The project was carried out from 2019 to 2021, i.e., when the pandemic started and during its course. The research concept was, however, created before there were any signs of the pandemic. Therefore, the research questions regarding FDI risk in Kazakhstan were not to any extent inspired by this occurrence. Nevertheless, the question about the pandemic risk was included in the research tool. Thus, the perception of this risk became the subject of research. The findings of partial research that are presented in this article are original in nature, because the assessments constituting their basis were formulated at a time when Kazakhstan, like other countries around the world, struggled with the pandemic and when its effects were unknown. Results: According to the enterprises with Polish capital in Kazakhstan, the main areas of risk entailed in their operation in this country were, most importantly, the risks of the investment country and global risks. Local currency exchange risk ranked 1st;as many as 70% of respondents said that this risk perception was high. This was followed by global economic events (e.g. depression), performance risks (e.g. product price, transfer risks, the price of capital) and government policy risks (e.g. tax reforms, monetary reforms, price controls, trade restrictions, nationalisation, government regulation, barriers to earnings repatriation). The 5th most distinctly perceived risk by the studied enterprises was global social events risks, including the pandemic risk. 40% of the surveyed entities defined this risk perception as high, and 30% each as medium and small. The fact that the pandemic risk ranked 5th among other FDI risk components in Kazakhstan indicates its great significance to the enterprises operating there at an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., when the level of uncertainty caused by the pandemic in terms of both its economic and its social effects was very high.","Jaworek, Malgorzata, Karaszewski, Wlodzimierz, Kuczmarska, Magdalena","https://doi.org/10.12775/EiP.2022.031","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Ekonomia i Prawo; JOUR(3):583-601, 21.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-21","",41298,""
"Analysis of Distress in Patients with Gynecological Cancers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Telephone Survey","Objective: To investigate distress levels in patients with gynaecological cancers during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and identify factors associated with distress. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 193 patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery for gynaecological cancer were included in our research. The patients were contacted by phone and provided detailed information about our study and the questionnaire that was to be applied. We performed distress screening using The National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer and Problem List (PL), developed for cancer patients. Result(s): In the study group, 51% of patients were categorized in the high-stress group. As practical problems, childcare (p&lt;0.001), insurance/financial (p&lt;0.033), work/school (p&lt;0.001), treatment decisions (p&lt;0.001), have significant differences between 2 groups in the present study. As family problems dealing with children (p&lt;0.001), family health issues (p&lt;0.014) have significant differences between the low-stress group and the high-stress group. All the emotional parameters evaluated by PL questionnaire have significant difference between the groups. The emotional significance levels of the parameters are as follows: depression (p&lt;0.001), fears (p&lt;0.001), nervousness (p&lt;0.002), sadness (p&lt;0.001), worry (p&lt;0.012), loss of interest (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion(s): Our results send a message to the gynaecological cancer healthcare world about what conditions may plague the gynaecological cancer patient in COVID-19 pandemic.

"Anxiety, depression and physical activity in university students from the Peruvian jungle during the Covid-19 pandemic","Introduction: During the Covid-19 pandemic, university students go through stressful situations that lead to adaptive re-actions that generate anxiety and depression;on the other hand, the regular practice of physical activity seems to be related to beneficial effects that influence the reduction of negative emotions. Objective(s): The objective of this research was to determine the relationship between anxiety, depression and physical activity in university students in the Peruvian jungle during the Covid-19 pandemic. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a cross-sectional, non-experimental and correlational study. With a sample of 321 students of both sexes, selected by non-probabilistic sampling;a virtual survey was applied using the GAD-7 and HPQ-9 to assess the levels of anxiety and depression;and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to explore levels of physical activity. Data collection was carried out from September 20 to October 22, 2021. Result(s): The results showed significant inverse correlations between physical activity and anxiety and depression (Rho-0.172, p=0.00), (Rho-0.217, p=0.00). Conclusion(s): The greater the practice of physical activities, the lower the anxiety and depression in students from the Peruvian jungle, which suggests that the practice of physical activity in university students should be promoted.

"Burnout and parental emotional regulation strategies: A study in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic in Chile","COVID-19 has affected the population's mental health, increasing the risk of parental burnout (Griffith, 2020), defined as a syndrome resulting from long-term exposure to chronic stress of parents in their role as caregivers (Mikolajczak et al. 2019). This phenomenon can have serious implications for the upbringing and normal development of children and adolescents, since it affects multiple areas of parental functioning, as well as damage the bond they maintain with their children (Mikolajczak et al, 2018). This study included 693 participants, collected through a non-random sample that included 133 fathers and 560 mothers over 18 years of age who currently live in Chile, living with at least one child. Linear regressions were performed to understand the relationship between parental burnout-measured using the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA)-and the perceived negative impact of the pandemic on parenting practices;the role of emotional regulation strategies of suppression and reappraisal-measured through the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ)-;and gender. Higher levels of parental burnout were found in mothers, who reported a greater negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis, using more suppression strategies and less reappraisal.

"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms, Psychosomatic Symptoms, and Sleep Quality in Health Care Workers in Turkey During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Data From a Large Tertiary Care Hospital","The aim of this study was to examine psychosomatic symptoms, sleep quality, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms of health care workers actively fighting against Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19). Six hundred seventy-six health care workers were included in the study. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), Impact of Event Scaleâ€“Revised (IES-R), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) were applied to the participants. Of the participants, 55.4% were female health care workers. PTSD symptoms were observed in 24.3% of the participants and 42.55% had sleep disorder symptoms. The anxiety, depression, and stress, PHQ-15, and PSQI were determined to be the predictors for potential PTSD. Gender, job title, depression, PHQ-15, and IES-R were determined to be significant predictors for a sleep disorder. Gender, anxiety, IES-R, and PSQI were found to be significant predictors for psychosomatic symptoms. Determining which individuals are likely to be more affected in terms of psychosomatic symptoms, potential PTSD, and sleep disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic and detecting possible risk factors are of great importance.

"Cognitive Behavior Therapy Lowers Anxiety Levels of Pregnant Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic at Sikumana Health Center","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Pregnant women are a vulnerable group or at risk for COVID-19. Pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic can cause high anxiety for pregnant women. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) interventions used can prevent the occurrence of anxiety and depression of pregnant women. AIM: This study aims to know the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on the anxiety of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): This study used a quasi-experimental design with pre-design and post-test designs. The research site was the Sikumana District Health Center, Kupang City, Indonesia. The sample of 80 respondents consisted of 40 intervention group respondents and 40 respondents of the control group. Taylor Minnesota Anxiety Scale (TMAS) questionnaire was used as an instrument in this study. Intervention was held by giving CBT therapy for 10 sessions of meetings in an hour. The control group was given treatment in the form of minimum midwifery standard care (10T) while the intervention group was given therapy in the form of CBT and minimum midwifery standard care (10T). The control group was given CBT treatment twice a month in 10 encounters with stages of identification, cognitive restructuring, identification and correction, and mind notes. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used as data analysis techniques in this research. RESULT(S): There was a significant difference between the pretest TMAS score and after the CBT intervention. There was a decrease in the level of anxiety, namely, from the TMAS pretest score of 44.49-28.70 and the value Z pretest -1,769, Z post-test -5,204, and p = 0.001 (p &lt; 0.05). In the control group, there was no meaningful difference between the TMAS pre-test and post-test scores. CONCLUSION(S): Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) effectively lowers anxiety levels in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Attitudes toward harm reduction and low-threshold healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic: qualitative interviews with people who use drugs in rural southern Illinois","Chronic health conditions associated with long-term drug use may pose additional risks to people who use drugs (PWUD) when coupled with COVID-19 infection. Despite this, PWUD, especially those living in rural areas, may be less likely to seek out health services. Previous research has highlighted the increased disease burden of COVID-19 among PWUD. Our manuscript supplements this literature by exploring unique attitudes of PWUD living in rural areas toward the pandemic, COVID-19 vaccination, and the role of harm reduction (HR) organizations in raising health awareness among PWUD. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 PWUD living in rural southern Illinois. Audio recordings were professionally transcribed. A preliminary codebook was created based on interview domains. Two trained coders conducted iterative coding of the transcripts, and new codes were added through line-by-line coding and thematic grouping. Twenty participants (45% female, mean age of 38) completed interviews between June and November 2021. Participants reported negative impacts of the pandemic on mental health, financial wellbeing, and drug quality. However, the health impacts of COVID-19 were often described as less concerning than its impacts on these other aspects of life. Many expressed doubt in the severity of COVID-19 infection. Among the 16 unvaccinated participants who reported receiving most of their information from the internet or word of mouth, uncertainty about vaccine contents and distrust of healthcare and government institutions engendered wariness of the vaccination. Distrust of healthcare providers was related to past stigmatization and judgement, but did not extend to the local HR organization, which was unanimously endorsed as a positive institution. Among participants who did not access services directly from the HR organization, secondary distribution of HR supplies by other PWUD was a universally cited form of health maintenance. Participants expressed interest in low-threshold healthcare, including COVID-19 vaccination, should it be offered in the local HR organization's office and mobile units. COVID-19 and related public health measures have affected this community in numerous ways. Integrating healthcare services into harm reduction infrastructures and mobilizing secondary distributors of supplies may promote greater engagement with vaccination programs and other healthcare services.

"Temporal changes in health-related lifestyle during the COVID-19 epidemic in Finland - a series of cross-sectional surveys","Public health recommendations and governmental restrictions during the COVID-19 epidemic have affect everyday life. This study aimed to examine temporal changes in health-related lifestyle and the accumulation of positive and negative changes in the key lifestyle factors (vegetable consumption, leisure-time physical activity, sleeping, alcohol consumption, smoking) in the same individuals among Finnish adults during the epidemic. This study was based on a series of cross-sectional surveys conducted between April 2020 and June 2021 to investigate antibody levels for the new coronavirus in the population. In each survey, a random sample of adults (18 to 69Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) from five university hospital regions were invited. A total of 5655 (response rate 32%) responded to the questionnaire including questions on lifestyle changes during epidemic. On average one-sixth of respondents (17%) reported at least two negative changes in the key lifestyle factors during the study period. An increase in snacking and sleep problems and decrease in leisure-time physical activity and active commuting to work were the most common of individual negative changes. The proportion of negative changes in physical activity increased as the epidemic drags on. In contrast, on average every seventh of the respondents (14%) reported at least two positive lifestyle changes in the key lifestyle factors. The most common individual positive changes were increased consumption of fruit, berries and vegetables and decreased consumption of alcohol. More negative changes were reported on average, when both negative and positive changes in the key lifestyle factors were summed. The most negative changes were reported in the late 2020. The results of the present study suggest that the lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 epidemic have been diverse being on average more commonly unfavorable than favorable for health. The deteriorated epidemic situation in the late 2020 and, on the other hand, prolonged epidemic predisposed to negative lifestyle changes. Further studies are important to examine whether these changes are maintained over time and to identify the factors that contribute to changes and their accumulation in the same individuals. Health promotion actions are needed to prevent the long-term effects of the epidemic on health and welfare.","JÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤skelÃƒÂ¤inen, HÃƒÂ¤rkÃƒÂ¤nen, Haario, Isosaari, Lundqvist","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14574-y","20221119","Alcohol consumption; COVID-19 epidemic; Diet; Lifestyle; Physical activity; Sleep; Smoking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-21","",41306,""
"The association between video or telephone telemedicine visit type and orders in primary care","Telemedicine is increasingly relied upon for care delivery in primary care, but the impact of visit type on clinical ordering behavior is uncertain. Within Kaiser Permanente Northern California, we identified patients who self-scheduled and completed telemedicine encounters with their personal primary care provider or another available primary care provider in the same medical group, between April 1st, 2020, and October 31st, 2020, while physical distancing restrictions for COVID-19 were in place. We collected patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, measures of technology access, and categorized the most common primary encounter diagnoses. We measured proportions of patient-scheduled video versus telephone visits for each of eight diagnosis groups (Skin &amp; Soft Tissue, Musculoskeletal Pain, Back Pain, General Gastrointestinal, Hypertension &amp; Diabetes, Mental Health, Upper Respiratory, and Abdominal Pain), and compared physician orders for medications, antibiotics, lab and imaging studies by visit type within each diagnosis group. There were 273,301 included encounters, with 86,676 (41.5%) video visits and 122,051 (58.5%) telephone visits. Of the diagnosis groups, Skin &amp; Soft Tissue conditions had the highest proportion of video visits (59.7%), while Mental Health conditions had the highest proportion of telephone visits (71.1%). After adjusting for covariates, the overall rates of medication orders (46.6% vs. 44.5%), imaging orders (17.3% vs. 14.9%), lab orders (19.5% vs. 17.2%), and antibiotic orders (7.5% vs. 5.2%) were higher during video visits as compared to telephone visits (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The largest difference within diagnosis groups was for Skin &amp; Soft Tissue conditions, where the rate of medication orders was 9.1% higher than during video visits than telephone visits (45.5% vs. 36.5%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). We observed statistically significant differences in clinician orders by visit type during telemedicine encounters for common primary care conditions. Our findings suggest that, for certain conditions, visual information conveyed during video visits may promote clinical work-up and treatment.","Juergens, Huang, Gopalan, Muelly, Reed","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-022-02040-z","20221119","Clinical orders; Primary care; Telemedicine; Visit type","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-21","",41307,""
"Healthcare workers' heterogeneous mental-health responses to prolonging COVID-19 pandemic: a full year of monthly follow up in Finland","The COVID-19 pandemic strained healthcare workers but the individual challenges varied in relation to actual work and changes in work. We investigated changes in healthcare workers' mental health under prolonging COVID-19 pandemic conditions, and heterogeneity in the mental-health trajectories. A monthly survey over a full year was conducted for employees of the HUS Helsinki University Hospital (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°4804) between 4th June 2020 to 28th May 2021. Pandemic-related potentially traumatic events (PTEs), work characteristics (e.g., contact to COVID-19 patients), local COVID-19 incidence, and demographic covariates were used to predict Mental Health Index-5 (MHI-5) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) in generalized multilevel and latent-class mixed model regressions. Local COVID-19 log-incidence (odds ratio, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.21, with 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.10-1.60), directly caring for COVID-19 patients (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.33, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.10-1.60) and PTEs (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.57, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.85-5.43) were all independently associated with psychological distress, when (additionally) adjusting for age, sex, profession, and calendar time. Effects of COVID-19 incidence on mental health were dissociable from calendar time (i.e., evolved in time) whereas those on sleep were not. Latent mental-health trajectories were characterized by a large class of ""stable mental health"" (62% of employees) and minority classes for ""early shock, improving"" (14%) and ""early resilience, deteriorating"" mental health (24%). The minority classes, especially ""early shock, improving"", were more likely to live alone and be exposed to PTEs than the others. Healthcare workers faced changing and heterogeneous mental-health challenges as the COVID-19 pandemic prolonged. Adversity and mental ill-being may have accumulated in some employees, and factors like living arrangements may have played a role. Knowledge on employees' demographic and socioeconomic background, as well as further research on the factors affecting employees' resilience, may help in maintaining healthy and efficient workforce in the face of a prolonging pandemic.","RosenstrÃƒÂ¶m, Tuisku, Suvisaari, Pukkala, Junttila, Haravuori, Elovainio, Haapa, JylhÃƒÂ¤, Laukkala","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04389-x","20221119","Insomnia; Latent-class mixed models; Psychological distress; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep problems; Traumatic events","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-21","",41308,""
"Depression and Suicidal Behavior in Adolescents","Depression commonly onsets in adolescence, affecting approximately 1 in 4 female adolescents and 1 in 10 males in the United States. Adolescent depression is a significant risk factor for suicide, the cause of over a third of all American adolescent deaths. Adolescent depression is introduced alongside its developmental and gendered considerations with a focus on important risk factors of adolescent depression, including nonsuicidal self-injury, adverse childhood experiences, and substance abuse. Protective factors and contemporary special topics of the COVID-19 pandemic and social media use are reviewed.

"Music engagement is negatively correlated with depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic via reward-related mechanisms","The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected the mental health of millions of people. We assessed which of many leisure activities correlated with positive mental health outputs, with particular attention to music, which has been reported to be important for coping with the psychological burden of the pandemic. Questionnaire data from about 1000 individuals primarily from Italy, Spain, and the United States during May-June 2020 show that people picked music activities (listening to, playing, singing, etc.) most often as the leisure experiences that helped them the most to cope with psychological distress related with the pandemic. During the pandemic, hours of engagement in music and food-related activities were associated with lower depressive symptoms. The negative correlation between music and depression was mediated by individual differences in sensitivity to reward, whereas the correlation between food-related activities and improved mental health outputs was explained by differences in emotion suppression strategies. Our results, while correlational, suggest that engaging in music activities could be related to improved well-being with the underlying mechanism being related to reward, consistent with neuroscience findings. Our data have practical significance in pointing to effective strategies to cope with mental health issues beyond those related to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mas-Herrero, Singer, Ferreri, McPhee, Zatorre, RipollÃƒÂ©s","https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14931","20221119","COVID-19; music; pleasure; reward","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-21","",41310,""
"Adaptations of cognitive remediation therapy for adolescents with anorexia nervosa for delivery via telehealth","The COVID-19 pandemic hastened a transition to treatment delivery via telehealth. While barriers still exist, the increased uptake of telehealth has the potential to increase access to mental health treatment for all diagnoses, including eating disorders. Delivery of evidence-based treatment as well as adjunctive treatments, including those that are hard to find in-person, have been modified to virtual format to increase accessibility and allow for continuity of care for adolescents with anorexia nervosa. We describe how to modify and deliver Cognitive Remediation Therapy for youth with anorexia nervosa (CRT-AN) via a telehealth platform. Preliminary and practical guidance for best practice for both group and individual delivery is established. With minimal modifications, CRT-AN can be delivered via telehealth for both individual and group delivery. More disengagement in group delivery was noted; however, overall application of the treatment via a remote platform was observed. As more treatment moves to a telehealth format, highlighting how an adjunctive treatment like CRT-AN can combined with other treatments in a telehealth format has the potential to increase research in its implementation and furthermore increase its dissemination. Cognitive Remediation Therapy for Anorexia Nervosa (CRT-AN) requires significant manipulation of materials and supplementary human guidance. Suggestions for how to modify CRT-AN for remote delivery via telehealth are provided. Modifications grew out of immediate changes made during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and can be used to inform changes therapists and programs can make to continue to or begin to use CRT-AN in a remote fashion.","Orloff, McGinley, Lenz, Mack, Timko","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23850","20221120","adolescent; anorexia nervosa; cognitive remediation therapy; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-21","",41311,""
"Efficacy of traditional Chinese exercises in patients with post-COVID-19 chronic fatigue syndrome: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","Some patients develop long-term symptoms after Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is one of the main symptoms. CFS is characterized by fatigue lasting for more than 6 months accompanied by sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression, which causes a certain degree of harm to both physiological and psychological aspects of the individual. Traditional Chinese exercises (TCEs) are an ancient Chinese therapy and has recently been reported to be effective for CFS. Therefore, we will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to accurately evaluate the efficacy of TCEs on post-COVID-19 CFS and provide an alternative treatment for post-COVID-19 CFS. Seven databases (PubMed, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biology Medicine (CBM), and Wanfang) will be searched from establishment to August 2022, and we will only include randomized controlled trials of TCEs for post-COVID-19 CFS. Two reviews will independently include the research according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Review Manager 5.2 software will be used to analyze the accepted literature, and the relative risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) will be used as effect indicators for the outcome indicator dichotomous variables. For continuous variables, weighted mean difference (MD) and 95% CI will be used as effect indicators. The heterogeneity test will be assessed using the I2 statistic and Q statistic. The PEDro scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies. Subgroup analysis was performed according to different TCEs, age, gender, and duration of CFS. This systematic review and meta-analysis will evaluate the efficacy of TCEs in post-COVID-19 CFS. The results of this study will provide reliable evidence for the effects of TCEs for post-COVID-19 CFS on patients' fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep, and quality of life.","Liu, Lv, Zhou, Shi, Hong, Huang, Lv","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000031450","20221119","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-21","",41312,""
"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the oral health and nutritional status of Japanese older adults who underwent total hip or knee arthroplasty: A 3-year single-institution retrospective cohort study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected the physical and mental health, socioeconomic status, and community behavior of people worldwide. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the oral health and nutritional status of Japanese older adults based on the results of preoperative assessment in patients who underwent total hip or knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia. This study included older adults (Ã¢â€°Â§65 years) who underwent total hip or knee arthroplasty in whom orthopantomography was performed for preoperative oral health assessment, during January 2019 to December 2021. Gender, age, number of family members living together, number of teeth, body mass index, and serum total protein and serum albumin levels were collected for analysis of this study. A total of 201 patients aged 65 to 89 years participated in the study. While the COVID-19 pandemic has had no impact on the oral health status, there has been a drop in serum albumin level from the results of multivariable-adjusted regression analysis considering age, gender, number of family members, and time. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the serum albumin level of Japanese orthopedic patients aged 65 years or older.","Matsuda, Kawachi, Fujita, Yoshida, Oki, Kokubo, Matsumine, Yoshimura","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000031937","20221119","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-21","",41313,""
"Consensus elements for observational research on COVID-19-related long-term outcomes","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its long-term outcomes may be jointly caused by a wide range of clinical, social, and economic characteristics. Studies aiming to identify mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality must measure and account for these characteristics to arrive at unbiased, accurate conclusions. We sought to inform the design, measurement, and analysis of longitudinal studies of long-term outcomes among people infected with SARS-CoV-2. We fielded a survey to an interprofessional group of clinicians and scientists to identify factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent outcomes. Using an iterative process, we refined the resulting list of factors into a consensus causal diagram relating infection and 12-month mortality. Finally, we operationalized concepts from the causal diagram into minimally sufficient adjustment sets using common medical record data elements. Total 31 investigators identified 49 potential risk factors for and 72 potential consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Risk factors for infection with SARS-CoV-2 were grouped into five domains: demographics, physical health, mental health, personal social, and economic factors, and external social and economic factors. Consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were grouped into clinical consequences, social consequences, and economic consequences. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection were developed into a consensus directed acyclic graph for mortality that included two minimally sufficient adjustment sets. We present a collectively developed and iteratively refined list of data elements for observational research in SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. By accounting for these elements, studies aimed at identifying causal pathways for long-term outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be made more informative.","Admon, Wander, Iwashyna, Ioannou, Boyko, Hynes, Bowling, Bohnert, O'Hare, Smith, Pura, Hebert, Wong, Niederhausen, Maciejewski","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000031248","20221119","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-21","",41314,""
"Difficulty accessing supervised consumption services during the COVID-19 pandemic among people who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada","The overdose crisis in Canada has worsened since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this trend is thought to be driven in part by closures or reduced capacity of supervised consumption services (SCS), little is known about the factors that may impede access to such services during the COVID-19 pandemic among people who use drugs. This study sought to characterize the prevalence and correlates of having difficulty accessing SCS during the COVID-19 pandemic among people who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada. Cross-sectional data from two open prospective cohorts of people who use drugs were collected via phone or videoconferencing interviews conducted between July 2020 and November 2020. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to examine factors associated with experiencing difficulty accessing SCS. Among the 428 people who use drugs who participated in the study, 223 (54.7%) self-identified as men and the median age was 51Ã‚Â years (1st to 3rd quartile: 42-58). A total of 58 (13.6%) participants reported experiencing difficulty accessing SCS. In a multivariable analysis, factors positively associated with difficulty accessing SCS included daily crystal methamphetamine use (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-5.30), active injection drug use (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.06; 95% CI 1.38-11.90), recent non-fatal overdose (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.45; 95% CI 1.24-4.85), and unstable housing (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.14; 95% CI 1.08-4.23). Age was inversely associated with the outcome (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99) in multivariable analyses. The most commonly reported reasons for experiencing difficulty accessing SCS were: COVID-19-related site closure or shortened hours (42.9%) and having to wait too long to use a site (39.3%). We found that people who use drugs with markers of structural vulnerability and drug-related risk were more likely to experience difficulty accessing SCS during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings point to the need for strategies to support access to such services as part of pandemic response efforts.","Cassie, Hayashi, DeBeck, Milloy, Cui, Strike, West, Kennedy","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-022-00712-7","20221119","Addiction; COVID-19; Illicit drug use; Overdose crisis; Overdose prevention site; Supervised consumption site","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-21","",41315,""

"Perinatal depression and implementation of the â€œThinking Healthy Programâ€ support intervention in an impoverished setting of Lima, Peru: assessment before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Socios En Salud (SES) implemented the Thinking Healthy Program (THP) to support women with perinatal depression before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Lima Norte. Methods: We carried out an analysis of the in-person (5 modules) and remote (1 module) THP intervention. Depression was detected using PHQ-9 and THP sessions were delivered in women with a score (PHQ-9 =5). Depression was reassessed and pre- and post- scores were compared. Results: In the pre-pandemic cohort, perinatal depression was 25.4% (47/185), 47 women received THP and 27 were reassessed (57.4%) and the PHQ-9 score median decreased from 8 to 2, p < 0.001. In the pandemic cohort, perinatal depression was 47.5% (117/247), 117 women received THP and 89 were reassessed (76.1%) and the PHQ-9 score median decreased from 7 to 2, p < 0.001. Conclusions: Perinatal depression was higher during COVID-19. THPÂ´s modalities were effective in reducing perinatal depression.","Carmen Contreras et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01DE-7E4-87C","20221121","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Community Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; pregnant women; thinking healthy program; depression; peru; covid-19","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-21","",41317,""
