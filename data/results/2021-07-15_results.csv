"A systematic meta-analysis of immune signatures in patients with COVID-19","Currently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission has been on the rise worldwide. Predicting outcome in COVID-19 remains challenging, and the search for more robust predictors continues. We made a systematic meta-analysis on the current literature from 1 January 2020 to 15 August 2020 that independently evaluated 32 circulatory immunological signatures that were compared between patients with different disease severity was made. Their roles as predictors of disease severity were determined as well. A total of 149 distinct studies that evaluated ten cytokines, four antibodies, four T cells, B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils were included. Compared with the non-severe patients of COVID-19, serum levels of Interleukins (IL)-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor ÃŽÂ± were significantly up-regulated in severe patients, with the largest inter-group differences observed for IL-6 and IL-10. In contrast, IL-5, IL-1ÃŽÂ² and Interferon (IFN)-ÃŽÂ³ did not show significant inter-group difference. Four mediators of T cells count, including CD3<sup>+</sup> T, CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T, CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> CD127<sup>-</sup> Treg, together with CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells count and CD16<sup>+</sup> CD56<sup>+</sup> NK cells were all consistently and significantly depressed in severe group than in non-severe group. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG antibodies were significantly higher in severe group than in non-severe group, while IgM antibody in the severe patients was slightly lower than those in the non-severe patients, and IgE antibody showed no significant inter-group differences. The combination of cytokines, especially IL-6 and IL-10, and T cell related immune signatures can be used as robust biomarkers to predict disease severity following SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Liu, Yang, Peng, Lv, Ye, Zhao, Li, Shao, Lu, Li, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2195","20210714","COVID-19; antibody; cytokines; disease severity; innate immunity; meta-analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-15","",15958,""
"The mediating role of psychological distress on the link between socio-ecological factors and quality of life of Filipino adults during COVID-19 crisis","Anchored on the Ecological Systems Theory, this study aimed to determine how psychological distress operates as an underlying mechanism in the impact of socio-ecological factors on the quality of life of Filipino adults during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted to assess perceptions of 401 adults on socio-ecological factors (i.e., safety at home, trust in public institutions, and financial difficulties), psychological distress, and quality of life during the early phase of COVID-19 community quarantine in the Philippines. Using latent variable path analysis, all three socio-ecological factors have significant direct effects on both psychological distress and quality of life. More importantly, the proposed model was confirmed in terms of a significant partial mediation of psychological distress on the impact of safety at home, trust in public institutions, and financial difficulties on the quality of life of Filipino adults. The study offers novel insights into the role of psychological distress as an underlying mechanism that operates on the influence of socio-ecological factors on the quality of life of adults during a global health crisis. Implications on psychological interventions and policies in preventing mental health problems vis-ÃƒÂ -vis improving Filipinos' quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.","Aruta, Callueng, Antazo, Ballada","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22668","20210714","COVID-19; Philippines; psychological distress; quality of life; socio-ecological factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-15","",15959,""
"Perception towards E-learning and COVID-19 on the mental health status of university students in Malaysia","The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of all including university students. With the preventive measures to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, all face-to-face teaching and learning are converted to e-learning. The COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of e-learning may influence these students' mental conditions. This study aimed to determine the association of factors with mental health status (depression, anxiety and stress) among university students in Malaysia. Study participants were tertiary education students from both the private and public universities in Malaysia. Participants were recruited via university emails and social media. The survey was administered via the online REDCap platform, from April to June 2020, during the movement control order period in the country. The questionnaire captured data on socio-demographic characteristics, academic information, implementation of e-learning, perception towards e-learning and COVID-19; as well as DASS 21 to screen for depression, anxiety and stress. The levels of stress, anxiety and depression were 56.5% (95% CI: 50.7%, 62.1%), 51.3% (95% CI: 45.6%, 57.0%) and 29.4% (95% CI: 24.3%, 34.8%) respectively. Most participants had good perception towards e-learning but negative perception on COVID-19. From the multivariate analysis, participants with positive perception on COVID-19 were protective towards stress (aOR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.99), anxiety (aOR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90, 0.98) and depression (aOR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.91, 0.99). Older students were 14% (aOR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.79, 0.94) and 11% (aOR: 0.89: 95% CI: 0.80, 0.99) less likely for anxiety and depression, respectively. Students originated from the Malay ethnicity had higher odds (aOR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.05, 3.56) for depression. These findings demonstrated that the mental status of university students was greatly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Timely and credible information should be disseminated to alleviate their negative perception towards COVID-19.","Moy, Ng","https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504211029812","20210714","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; e-learning; mental status; stress; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-15","",15960,""

"Chemical design principles of next-generation antiviral surface coatings","The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated efforts to develop high-performance antiviral surface coatings while highlighting the need to build a strong mechanistic understanding of the chemical design principles that underpin antiviral surface coatings. Herein, we critically summarize the latest efforts to develop antiviral surface coatings that exhibit virus-inactivating functions through disrupting lipid envelopes or protein capsids. Particular attention is focused on how cutting-edge advances in material science are being applied to engineer antiviral surface coatings with tailored molecular-level properties to inhibit membrane-enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Key topics covered include surfaces functionalized with organic and inorganic compounds and nanoparticles to inhibit viruses, and self-cleaning surfaces that incorporate photocatalysts and triplet photosensitizers. Application examples to stop COVID-19 are also introduced and demonstrate how the integration of chemical design principles and advanced material fabrication strategies are leading to next-generation surface coatings that can help thwart viral pandemics and other infectious disease threats.","Wang, Ferhan, Yoon, Jackman, Cho, Majima","https://doi.org/10.1039/d1cs00317h","20210714","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-15","",15963,""
"Further evidence for motivated helplessness in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak: the case of Argentina before and during the pandemic","According to the motivated helplessness hypothesis, a sense of helplessness in coping with threats in a specific domain can serve an anxiety-buffering function. The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis in the context of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Argentina, using data collected before and during the pandemic. Findings supported the motivated helplessness hypothesis: Whereas feelings of helplessness to avoid being infected with COVID-19 were positively related to fear of being infected with COVID-19 and state anxiety before the pandemic, these feelings were negatively related to fear of being infected (and not directly related to state anxiety) during the pandemic. These findings demonstrate the specificity of the motivated helplessness effect and further establish this effect in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lifshin, Mikulincer","https://doi.org/10.1080/00224545.2021.1918618","20210714","Anxiety; Covid-19; fear; health behavior; helplessness; motivation; threat","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-15","",15964,""
"Financial distress and suicidal behaviour during COVID-19: Family identification attenuates the negative relationship between COVID-related financial distress and mental Ill-health","COVID-19 provides a 'perfect storm' of social and economic suicide risk-factors.

"Revisiting pulmonary rehabilitation during COVID-19 pandemic: a narrative review","There has been an apparent association between the risks of complications with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (<i>SARS-CoV-2</i>) infection in patients with a history of existing chronic respiratory diseases during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). <i>SARS-CoV-2</i> poses a severe risk in cardiopulmonary management. Moreover, chronic respiratory diseases may further amplify the risk of morbidity and mortality among the afflicted population in the pandemic era. The present review outlines the importance of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in persons with chronic respiratory diseases (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and Asthma) during the COVID-19 era. In this context, amongst the population with a pre-existing pulmonary diagnosis who have contracted <i>SARS-CoV-2</i>, following initial medical management and acute recovery, exercise-based pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) may play a crucial role in long-term management and recovery. The energy conservation techniques will play a pragmatic role in PR of mild to moderate severity cases to counter post-COVID-19 fatigue. Moreover, there is also an urgent need to effectively address post-COVID-19 anxiety and depression, affecting the PR delivery system.","Dixit, Borghi-Silva, Bairapareddy","https://doi.org/10.31083/j.rcm2202039","20210714","Asthma; COPD; COVID; Exercise; Pulmonary rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-15","",15966,""
"Did social isolation due to COVID-19 interfere with the quality of sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness in individuals with grade III obesity about to enter a surgical prehabilitation program? An observational study","Social isolation (SI) can have negative effects on health, although little is known about the SI consequences on patients with grade III obesity and even less if they are entering a prehabilitation program. the present study analyzes the effects of SI determined by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in people with grade III obesity who about to enter a prehabilitation program for bariatric surgery. Five patients with grade III obesity who entered a prehabilitation program or which had to be stopped on March 17th, 2020 were evaluated. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) (Epworth Sleepiness Scale - ESS) and sleep quality (SQ) (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index - PSQI) were investigated. Data collection took place in the week before the SI government decree and after 30 and 90 days of SI. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0 and GraphPad Prism 8.0. The Friedman test was used to verify the difference between the times and a significance level of pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05 was adopted. with SI, EDS improved by 8 points after 30 days and 3 points after 90 days (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). The PSQI did not change (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.819). the SI improved the EDS of individuals with grade III obesity entering the prehabilitation program, but did not change complementing their SQ. The improvement in EDS may be related to a longer daily sleep time provided by the SI and the lower number of daily work commitments. Measures to improve the SQ of these patients should be considered, including remote forms.","de Medeiros, Artismo, Coelho, da Silveira, Ponte Souza Filho, Lorenzetti Branco, Matte","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metop.2021.100104","20210714","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Disorders of excessive somnolence; Obesity; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-15","",15967,""

Vaccination programs are adversely affected by misinformation, fake news and vaccine hesitancy fuelled by social media. MHPs can enable this vital public health strategy by prioritizing vaccination for individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) and substance use disorders, promote awareness and public education, debunk misinformation and integrate psychosocial care into the vaccination drives. In order to target the health inequity and discrimination faced by people with SMI coupled with their additional risks, the authors urge the global mental health fraternity to tailor these crucial roles with respect to COVID-19 vaccination based on the regional needs and contexts.","Banerjee, Mukhopadhyay, Sahana Asmeen, Javed","https://doi.org/10.1017/gmh.2021.25","20210714","COVID-19 pandemic; mental health professionals; psychiatrists; public mental health; severe mental illness; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-15","",15968,""

An online questionnaire administered via Google Forms was used to gather data from 1064 African academics in four countries. A sensitivity analysis was applied to adjust for covariates. Data were analyzed with the hierarchical linear regression analysis. The average age of participants was 44Ã‚Â years. The study found that PA was positively associated with research but negatively associated with student assessment. Mental health was positively associated with onsite teaching but negatively associated with online teaching and research.

"[All in the mix? Blended psychotherapy as an example of digitalization in psychotherapy]","Over the last decades various approaches to digitalization of psychotherapy (PT) have been developed. The concept of blended PT, the combination of face to face and online interventions is one such example.

Also, due to the global pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), blended PT and other online approaches seem to be more relevant than ever before. The aim is to give an overview on the various forms of blended PT. Furthermore, the efficacy, the perspectives of patients and therapists as well as the topic of implementation are discussed. Narrative review of the literature on the topic of blended PT. Important considerations and findings are classified and described based on a comprehensive search. Blended psychotherapy is aÃ‚Â concept in need of definition. By taking inspiration from blended learning concepts, we propose that aÃ‚Â definition of blended psychotherapy should consider different levels of blends and may also consider the transforming effect on face to face psychotherapy. In transforming blends face to face PT is fundamentally changed. For some forms of blended PT the effectiveness has already been confirmed but for others there is an urgent need for research. Compared to face to face PT and purely online therapy, blended psychotherapy could provide several advantages. The interest in blended PT is increasing among patients and therapists. To be able to successfully provide evidence-based blended PT, close cooperation between science, institutions, therapists and relevant stakeholders is needed.","Bielinski, Trimpop, Berger","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00278-021-00524-3","20210714","Combined modality therapy; Face to face psychotherapy; Internet-based intervention; Mental health; eHealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-15","",15970,""
"The effectiveness of a psycho-education intervention on mental health literacy in communities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic-a cluster randomized trial of 24 villages in central Uganda-a research protocol","Literature shows a high prevalence of psychological distress (PD) as well as common mental disorders (CMD) such as major depressive disorders (MDD), generalized anxiety disorders (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), and substance misuse disorders (SUD) among people exposed to disasters and pandemics like the COVID-19. Moreover, CMD are associated with increased mortality (mainly through suicide) and morbidity (loss of productivity). A number of countries have made deliberate efforts to identify and manage CMD in light of COVID-19. However, low levels of mental health literacy (MHL) manifested by the individual's unawareness of CMD symptoms, limited human and mental health infrastructure resources, and high levels of mental illness stigma (MIS) are barriers to integration of mental health care in general health care during pandemics and epidemics such as the COVID-19. For the proposed study, we will determine effectiveness of a psycho-education intervention delivered by village health team (VHT) members. We will employ a cluster randomized trial design in 24 villages in central Uganda. We will collect baseline data to and document the prevalence of MHL, PD, MDD, PTSD, GAD, and SUD. We will distribute information education and communication materials (IEC) aimed at improving MHL to 420 adult individuals in the intervention arm (n = 12 villages).

"Proning related bilateral anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy in a patient with COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome","Non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is a rare but harmful complication of prone positioning. Prone mechanical ventilation is a therapeutic strategy which has been used extensively during the COVID-19 pandemic to treat acutely hypoxemic patients with COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Though a small number of cases of unilateral NAION have been reported in patients testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we describe what is to our knowledge, the first reported case of bilateral NAION occurring in a patient proned extensively for the treatment of COVID-19 related ARDS. We consider the potential aetiological factors leading to NAION after prone mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 and suggest strategies to protect against its development. We report a case of severe, irreversible, visual impairment secondary to bilateral anterior ION in a fifty-five-year-old male who underwent eight episodes of prone mechanical ventilation to treat COVID-19 related ARDS. Once weaned from his sedation he reported bilateral painless vision loss, and bedside ophthalmological assessment identified a reduced visual acuity of 3/30 unaided in the left eye and counting fingers in the right. Dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy revealed inferotemporal optic disc oedema with splinter haemorrhages in the right eye and mild disc oedema, temporal pallor, and nerve fibre layer haemorrhages inferiorly in the left eye. Humphrey visual field 24Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°2 testing confirmed a severely constricted visual field with macular sparing on the right and depressed inferonasal vision with preserved peripheral vision on the left eye. OCT disc imaging shortly after diagnosis revealed bilateral disc swelling and flame haemorrhages in the right eye.

"Self-reported psychological problems and coping strategies: a web-based study in Peruvian population during COVID-19 pandemic","The Coronavirus pandemic has disrupted health systems across the world and led to major shifts in individual behavior by forcing people into isolation in home settings. Its rapid spread has overwhelmed populations in all corners of Latin-American countries resulting in individual psychological reactions that may aggravate the health crisis. This study reports on demographics, self-reported psychological disturbances and associated coping styles during the COVID-19 pandemic for the Peruvian population. This cross-sectional study uses an online survey with snowball sampling that was conducted after the state of emergency was declared in PerÃƒÂº (on April 2nd). The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) was used to identify somatic symptoms, incidence of anxiety/ insomnia, social dysfunction and depression and the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (COPE-28) mapped personal strategies to address recent stress. 434 self-selected participants ranging in age from 18 to 68Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old (Mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°33.87) completed the survey. The majority of participants were women (61.30%), aged between 18 and 28 (41.70%), well-educated (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°85.00%), Peruvian (94.20%), employed (57.40%) and single (71.20%). 40.8% reported psychological distress, expressing fear of coronavirus infection (71.43%). Regression analysis shows that men had lower somatic-related symptom (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.87, 95%, CI: -Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.75 to -.99) and anxiety/insomnia symptom (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.91, 95% CI: -Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.98 to 0.84) compared to women. The risk for depression and social dysfunction are less likely with increasing age. Educational status was protective against developing psychological conditions (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). While active responses (acceptance and social support) are scarcely used by individuals with psychological distress; passive strategies (such as denial, self-distraction, self-blame, disconnection, and venting) are more commonly reported. This study provides a better understanding of the psychological health impact occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic on the Peruvian population. About half of the respondents reported psychological distress and poor coping responses. This evidence informs the need for broader promotional health policies focused on strengthening individual's active strategies aiming at improving emotional health and preventing psychiatric conditions, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ames-Guerrero, Barreda-Parra, Huamani-Cahua, Banaszak-Holl","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03326-8","20210714","Coping strategies; Mental health; Primary prevention; Psychological disturbances; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-15","",15973,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress, mental health and coping behavior in German University students - a longitudinal study before and after the onset of the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to massive restrictions in public and private lives, including a shut-down of face-to-face teaching at universities in Germany. We aimed to examine the impact of these changes on perceived stress, mental health and (study-)related health behavior of students in a longitudinal study. For two timepoints - the year before the COVID-19 pandemic (2019, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1377) and the year during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1867) - we surveyed students of all faculties at one German university for perceptions and preventive behavior regarding the COVID-19 pandemic using standard instruments for stress, anxiety, depression, and behavior and experience patterns. About 90% of students (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1633) in 2020 did not have a known contact infected with SARS-CoV-2, while 180 (9.8%) did have one. Only 10 respondents (0.5%) reported an infection with SARS-CoV-2. Wearing masks and washing hands more often were practiced by Ã¢â€°Â¥80% of students. Taking more care about cleanliness (51.8%) and using disinfectants (39.2%) were practiced much less. A higher percentage of female compared with male students and medical/health science students compared with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics students engaged more frequently in specific or nonspecific preventive measures. More than three quarters (77.1%) of all students rated their general health as (very) good. There were no significant differences in general health, stress, and depression between 2019 and 2020 in the students who responded at both timepoints. The distribution of behavior and experience patterns for this group showed a slight but significant difference from 2019 to 2020, namely decreasing proportions of students with a healthy pattern and a risk pattern for overexertion. Students with different behavior and experience patterns showed marked differences in perceptions and reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as psychosocial stress and symptoms, with higher scores for mental health symptoms and lower scores in preventive behavior regarding risk patterns. Despite massive alterations to students' lives in 2020, there were only moderate consequences for mental health compared with 2019 in the total student group of this German university. However, identifying students at risk would offer opportunities to foster mental health in relevant subgroups.","Voltmer, KÃƒÂ¶slich-Strumann, Walther, Kasem, Obst, KÃƒÂ¶tter","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11295-6","20210714","Behavior patterns; COVID-19; Mental health; Preventive measures; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-15","",15974,""
"COVID-19 and loneliness: A rapid systematic review","Loneliness is known to be associated with both poorer physical and mental health, being associated with increased mortality. Responses throughout the world to the current COVID-19 pandemic all incorporate varying degrees of social distancing and isolation. There is an imperative to provide a timely review and synthesis of the impact of COVID-19 on loneliness in the general population. PubMed was searched using the key terms 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus', 'SARS-COV2' and 'loneliness'. Fifty-four articles were identified and screened against the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria stipulated that the study needed to incorporate a measure of loneliness with participants being drawn from the general adult population. Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. The key data extracted from the 24 reviewed studies are presented and summarised with a focus on key demographics of participants, the research designs utilised, the measures of loneliness employed and the other variables assessed in the studies. Overall, the findings indicate that loneliness has been a significant issue during the current COVID-19 pandemic and loneliness is positively associated with mental health symptoms. However, there were inconsistencies in the results evident across studies. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of research investigating loneliness during the current COVID-19 pandemic in the general adult population. Despite the inconsistencies evident in some of the results across the studies, it is clearly apparent that loneliness is having an impact on the mental health and wellbeing of the general adult population. Furthermore, it is apparent that the current COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on loneliness in the general adult population and that loneliness is significantly positively associated with mental illness symptomatology. Thus, there is an imperative to address loneliness through public policy and interventions. The limitations of this review are noted and directions given for future research.","Pai, Vella","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674211031489","20210714","COVID-19; Loneliness; SARS-COV-2; coronavirus; mental health; mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-15","",15975,""
"Physical activity patterns among adults population during the coronavirus pandemic: consideration of the role of resilience","This study aims to characterize patterns of physical activity (PA) and resilience levels, and to examine whether resilience contributes to PA participation among adults during COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted during the quarantine period. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) questionnaires were used to assess the study's outcomes. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine the difference in PA across resilience levels. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between resilience and PA. Data were reported as medians and interquartile ranges. A sample of 1859 were included in the study (40% aged 26-35 yrs). The findings show that 85% of the respondents engaged in PA and 15% were physically inactive. The majority participated in moderate-intensity PA (71%). The median score was 3.50(0.85), which indicates a medium level of resilience. The positive correlation coefficient was shown between the average score of resilience and both walking (rs =0.01, p&lt;0.001) and vigorous- intensity PA (rs =0.08, p=.007). Data did not show a significant correlation between moderate-intensity PA and resilience score. Greater emphasis on PA engagement after the period of quarantine is needed. Resilience may play an important role in buffering the deleterious impact of quarantine on PA.

"COVID-19 phobia in healthcare workers; a cross-sectional study from a pandemic hospital","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the forefront of the fight against coronavirus. The purpose of this study was to evaluate COVID-19 phobia levels of HCWs of a pandemic hospital and explore associated factors. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted on HCWs employed in a pandemic hospital. A total of 365 HCWs (95 physicians, 187 nurses and 83 assistant healthcare staffs) were included in the study. In order to evaluate COVID-19 phobia, coronavirus-19 phobia scale (C19P-S) was administrated. Chronophobia levels of frontline and nonfrontline HCWs were compared. Additionally, the effect of working in different departments, profession and associated factors on COVID-19 phobia was evaluated. Overall, 172 HCWs completed the C19P-S and agreed to participate in the study. Mean total CP19P-S score of the HCWs included in the study was 50.1 Ã‚Â± 17.3. Of the study population, 59.3% participants were frontline HCWs and 40.7% were non-frontline HCWs. When frontline HCWs and nonfrontline HCWs were compared in terms of total C19P-S and subscales scores (psychological, psycho-somatic, economic, social), no statistically significant differences were found (p= 0.914, p= 0.687, p= 0.766, p= 0.347, p= 0.794, respectively).When the HCWs were divided into three groups according to departments (clinics, intensive care unit (ICU), emergency department) where they worked regardless of whether they cared for patients with COVID-19, HCWs employed in the ICUs had the highest scores regarding total C19P-S and subscales scores (p= 0.002, p= 0.001, p= 0.001, p= 0.012, p= 0.002,respectively) . Profession based comparison revealed no significant difference between the groups regarding total C19P-S score (p= 0.117). It is essential to make a comprehensive evaluation regarding the effects of pandemics on HCWs, not only for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic but also to protect the mental health of HCWs. Critical care professions appear to need particular attention among HCWs. The C19P-S, which assesses coronaphobia levels with psychological, psycho-somatic, economic, and social aspects could be a convenient screening tool for evaluating COVID-19 phobia levels in HWCs.","Oktay Arslan, Batum, Varol, Ã…Å¾enel, UÃƒÂ§ar","https://doi.org/10.5578/tt.20219810","20210714","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-15","",15977,""
