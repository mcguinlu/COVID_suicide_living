"[Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Medical Care of Patients with Inherited Bleeding Disorders]","Chronic diseases, such as inherited bleeding disorders (IBD) are often associated with high costs of medical care. COVID-19 containment measures, including isolation and triage, led to restrictions in the health care of chronically ill patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health care of IBD patients. In this multicentre cross-sectional study to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on the mental health and quality of care of patients with inherited bleeding disorder, an ad hoc questionnaire was sent to 586 patients/parents of children with haemophilia A, B or von Willebrand syndrome type 3. In addition to demographic and clinical data, patients/parents of patients with inherited bleeding disorders were asked about their thoughts, concerns and experiences regarding their medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Differences between clinical subgroups were calculated. Significant differences were found between subgroups (severity, type of therapy, product class, comorbidities) with regard to the transmission of COVID-19 through plasma products, the effects of COVID-19 positive test results, fear of getting COVID-19, delayed drug supply and physiotherapy treatment. The medical care of patients with inherited bleeding disorders, who need a continuous supply of essential drugs, is a particular challenge in times of pandemics. Therefore, worries and fears of IBD patients should be taken seriously and innovative communication channels established to maintain therapy standards and quality of care. Chronische Erkrankungen, wie z.Ã¢â‚¬â€°B. angeborene Blutungsneigungen (IBD: Inherited Bleeding Disorders), gehen hÃƒÂ¤ufig mit einem erhÃƒÂ¶hten Versorgungsaufwand einher. MaÃƒÅ¸nahmen zur EindÃƒÂ¤mmung der COVID-19 Pandemie, inklusive Isolation und Triageierung, haben zu EinschrÃƒÂ¤nkungen in der Krankenversorgung von chronisch kranken Patienten gefÃƒÂ¼hrt. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist es, die Auswirkungen der COVID-19 Pandemie auf die Krankenversorgung von IBD-Patienten zu untersuchen. In dieser multizentrischen Querschnittsstudie zur Bewertung der Auswirkungen von COVID-19 auf die psychische Gesundheit und VersorgungsqualitÃƒÂ¤t von Patienten mit angeborener Blutungsneigung wurde ein ad-hoc Fragebogen an 586 Patienten/Eltern von Kindern mit HÃƒÂ¤mophilie A, B oder von Willebrand Syndrom Typ 3 verschickt. Neben demografischen und klinischen Daten wurden IBD Patienten zu ihren Gedanken, Sorgen und Erfahrungen in Bezug auf ihre medizinische Versorgung wÃƒÂ¤hrend der COVID-19 Pandemie befragt. Unterschiede zwischen klinischen Subgruppen wurden berechnet. Signifikante Unterschiede zeigten sich zwischen Subgruppen (Schweregrad, Art der Therapie, Produktklasse, KomorbiditÃƒÂ¤ten) bezÃƒÂ¼glich ÃƒÅ“bertragung von COVID-19 durch Plasmaprodukte, Auswirkungen COVID-19 positiver Testergebnisse, Angst COVID-19 zu bekommen, verzÃƒÂ¶gerter Medikamentenversorgung und Physiotherapiebehandlung. Die medizinische Versorgung von IBD-Patienten, die eine kontinuierliche Versorgung mit lebensnotwendigen Medikamenten benÃƒÂ¶tigen, stellt in Pandemiezeiten eine besondere Herausforderung dar. Daher sollten Sorgen und Ãƒâ€žngste von IBD-Patienten ernst genommen und innovative Kommunikationswege zur Aufrechterhaltung von Therapiestandards und VersorgungsqualitÃƒÂ¤t etabliert werden.","Olivieri, Halimeh, Wermes, Hassenpflug, Holstein, von Mackensen","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1399-9166","20210408","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12736,""
"[Fear of Coronavirus, Intention to Follow the AHA Rules and Risk Perception Regarding Visits to the Doctor: Cross-sectional Study with Patients suffering from Pre-existing Mental Illness]","The COVID-19 pandemic requires containment measures such as contact restrictions and hygiene requirements. It is accompanied by psychological problems and the fear of infection or of a severe course of the disease. This paper examines the relationship between fear of infection and adherence to rules of hygiene as well as the utilization of medical services. 1005 patients (20-79 years, 626=62.4% female) were interviewed by online questionnaire before starting a psychosomatic rehabilitation program. Data are presented descriptively and analysed by variance analyses. 68.6% were rarely/sometimes afraid and 17.9% were always afraid of contracting coronavirus or of a severe course of the disease. Those who were afraid intended to wash their hands more frequently (97.2%) than those who were not afraid. Regardless of any change in their physical and mental health status, participants felt it to be risky to seek medical care. The intention to follow hygiene rules in people with pre-existing mental illness depends on a fear of infecting oneself or others with the coronavirus or of contracting a severe form of the disease. Especially mentally or psychosomatically affected individuals need to be informed adequately about the coronavirus and the necessary individual protective measures in order to reduce resistance and to increase willingness to seek medical help. Die COVID-19-Pandemie erfordert zur EindÃƒÂ¤mmung MaÃƒÅ¸nahmen wie KontaktbeschrÃƒÂ¤nkungen und Hygieneregeln und verursacht neben psychischen Problemen auch die Angst vor einer Ansteckung oder einem schweren Verlauf von COVID-19. Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht den Zusammenhang zwischen der Angst vor einer Ansteckung und dem Einhalten von Hygieneregeln und der Inanspruchnahme medizinischer Versorgung. Es wurden 1005 Patienten (20Ã¢â‚¬â€œ79 Jahre, 626=62,4% weiblich) vor Antritt einer psychosomatischen RehabilitationsmaÃƒÅ¸nahme mittels Online-Fragebogen befragt. Die Auswertung erfolgte deskriptiv, korrelativ und ÃƒÂ¼ber Varianzanalysen. 68,6% hatten selten/manchmal und 17,9% hatten immer Angst vor einer Ansteckung mit dem Coronavirus oder vor einem schweren Verlauf der Krankheit. Wer oft/immer Angst hatte, beabsichtigte sich die HÃƒÂ¤nde hÃƒÂ¤ufiger zu waschen (97,2%), als diejenigen, die nie Angst hatten. UnabhÃƒÂ¤ngig von einer VerÃƒÂ¤nderung des kÃƒÂ¶rperlichen und psychischen Gesundheitszustandes waren die Patienten bereit, HygienemaÃƒÅ¸nahmen einzuhalten. Jedoch hing mehr Angst vor Ansteckung mit mehr Risikowahrnehmung zusammen, medizinische Versorgung in Anspruch zu nehmen. Bedenken waren bei den Patienten am stÃƒÂ¤ksten ausgeprÃƒÂ¤gt, die einen verschlechterten Gesundheitszustand berichteten. Die Absicht des Befolgens der Hygieneregeln ist bei psychisch vorerkrankten Menschen abhÃƒÂ¤ngig von einer vorbestehenden Angst, sich selber oder andere mit dem Coronavirus anzustecken bzw. an einer schweren Verlaufsform zu erkranken. Insbesondere psychisch bzw. psychosomatisch vorerkrankte Menschen mÃƒÂ¼ssen adÃƒÂ¤quat ÃƒÂ¼ber das Coronavirus und die notwendigen individuellen SchutzmaÃƒÅ¸nahmen informiert werden, um Ãƒâ€žngste zu reduzieren und um die Bereitschaft zu steigern, medizinische Hilfe in Anspruch zu nehmen.","Dahmen, Keller, KÃƒÂ¶tting, Derksen, Lippke","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1397-7214","20210408","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12737,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Parent, Child, and Family Functioning","To quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health interventions on parent and child mental health and family relationships, we examined change in individual and family functioning in a sample of parents enrolled in a prevention trial; we examined change before the pandemic (2017-2019) when children were an average of 7Ã‚Â years old to the first months after the imposition of widespread public health interventions in the United States (2020) with paired t tests and HLM models. We examined moderation by parent gender, education, family income, and coparenting conflict. We found large deteriorations from before the pandemic to the first months of the pandemic in child internalizing and externalizing problems and parent depression, and a moderate decline in coparenting quality. Smaller changes were found for parent anxiety and parenting quality. Mothers and families with lower levels of income were at particular risk for deterioration in well-being. Results indicate a need for widespread family support and intervention to prevent potential family &quot;scarring,&quot; that is, prolonged, intertwined individual mental health and family relationship problems. Para cuantificar el efecto de la pandemia de la COVID-19 y de las intervenciones de salud pÃƒÂºblica en la salud mental de los padres y los niÃƒÂ±os y en las relaciones familiares, analizamos los cambios en el funcionamiento individual y familiar en una muestra de padres inscriptos en un ensayo de prevenciÃƒÂ³n; estudiamos el cambio antes de la pandemia (2017-2019) cuando los niÃƒÂ±os tenÃƒÂ­an un promedio de 7 aÃƒÂ±os hasta los primeros meses despuÃƒÂ©s de la imposiciÃƒÂ³n de las intervenciones generalizadas de salud pÃƒÂºblica en los Estados Unidos (2020) con pruebas t apareadas y modelos lineales jerÃƒÂ¡rquicos. Analizamos la moderaciÃƒÂ³n por gÃƒÂ©nero, educaciÃƒÂ³n, ingresos familiares y conflicto de cocrianza de los padres. Hallamos grandes deterioros desde antes de la pandemia hasta los primeros meses de la pandemia en problemas de interiorizaciÃƒÂ³n y exteriorizaciÃƒÂ³n de los niÃƒÂ±os y depresiÃƒÂ³n de los padres, y una disminuciÃƒÂ³n moderada de la calidad de la cocrianza. TambiÃƒÂ©n encontramos cambios mÃƒÂ¡s pequeÃƒÂ±os en la ansiedad de los padres y la calidad de la crianza. Las madres y las familias con niveles mÃƒÂ¡s bajos de ingresos estuvieron en riesgo particular de deterioro del bienestar. Los resultados indican la necesidad de apoyo familiar generalizado y de intervenciones para prevenir posibles Ã‚Â«secuelasÃ‚Â» familiares, p. ej.: salud mental individual interconectada y prolongada y problemas en las relaciones familiares.

"The COVID-19 outbreak increases maternal stress during pregnancy, but not the risk for postpartum depression","The COVID-19 pandemic affects society and may especially have an impact on mental health of vulnerable groups, such as perinatal women. This prospective cohort study of 669 participating women in the Netherlands compared perinatal symptoms of depression and stress during and before the pandemic. After a pilot in 2018, recruitment started on 7 January 2019. Up until 1 March 2020 (before the pandemic), 401 women completed questionnaires during pregnancy, of whom 250 also completed postpartum assessment. During the pandemic, 268 women filled out at least one questionnaire during pregnancy and 59 postpartum (1 March-14 May 2020). Pregnancy-specific stress increased significantly in women during the pandemic. We found no increase in depressive symptoms during pregnancy nor an increase in incidence of high levels of postpartum depressive symptoms during the pandemic.

"Can Physical Activity Support Grief Outcomes in Individuals Who Have Been Bereaved? A Systematic Review","In 2018, there were 616,014 registered deaths in the United Kingdom (UK). Grief is a natural consequence. Many mental health concerns, which can be identified as grief outcomes (e.g. anxiety and depression) in those who have experienced a bereavement, can be improved through physical activity. The objective of this review was to identify from the existing literature if physical activity can benefit grief outcomes in individuals who have been bereaved. A systematic review of nine databases was performed. Included studies (qualitative and quantitative) explored physical activity to help individuals (of any age) who had experienced a human bereavement (excluding national loss). From 1299 studies screened, 25 met the inclusion criteria, detailing eight types of bereavement (parental (n = 5), spousal (n = 6), patient (n = 4), pre-natal (n = 3), later life (n = 1), caregiver (n = 1), multiple (n = 4) and non-defined (n = 1). Activities including yoga, running, walking and martial arts were noted as beneficial. Physical activity allowed a sense of freedom, to express emotions, provided a distraction and an escape from grief, whilst enhancing social support. There is some evidence that physical activity may provide benefit for the physical health and psychological wellbeing of those who have been bereaved, including when the loss has happened at a young age. This review is timely, given the wide-scale national loss of life due to COVID-19 and extends knowledge in this area. More research is needed to explore the benefits of physical activity for those who have been bereaved. In particular, there is a need for well-designed interventions which are tailored to specific activities, populations and grief outcomes.","Williams, Shorter, Howlett, Zakrzewski-Fruer, Chater","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40798-021-00311-z","20210408","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12740,""
"The social paradox of COVID-19 pandemic: the duality of socialization and the value of fraternal charity","Government across all nations had promulgated precautionary measures in controlling the wide spread of the disease. One that takes precedence is the practice of community quarantine where people are mandated to stay at home and avoid going outside if is not utterly necessary. This mandate caused a lot of catastrophic outcomes in the socio-economic condition and mental health of many. Many people are in psychological and existential despair for the loss of their jobs and the isolation that they are experiencing. However, in the midst of this undesirable condition, the natural tendency of the human person to socialize is still present. Done in the spirit of fraternal charity, an individual's way of socialization gives hope to those who are in despair. The COVID-19 pandemic does not deter the human person to exercise his fraternal instinct but gives him sufficient reason to employ it all the more, creating the social paradox of human presence.","Canete","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab114","20210408","behavior; communities; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12741,""

"Mental health treatment and the role of tele-mental health at the veterans health administration during the COVID-19 pandemic","To quantify overall trends in patients treated for mental health disorders and adverse events, including via tele-mental health (TMH) and psychopharmacology during pandemic-related health care transformation. Longitudinal observational study including veterans receiving mental health treatment at a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facility from January 1, 2017 to June 16, 2020. Observed and expected patient care for on-going and new treatment of depression, posttraumatic stress, substance use disorder, severe mental illness diagnoses, overdose, and suicide attempts, and psychotropic prescriptions for antidepressant, antipsychotic, benzodiazepine, opioid, and mood stabilizing medications are depicted. Percent change between actual and expected counts in the early months of the COVID pandemic (March 18-May 5, 2020) are computed. Decreases in counts of patients receiving mental health treatment early in the pandemic ranged from 7% to 20% for on-going treatment, and 28% to 37% for new treatment. TMH rapidly expanded across VHA, becoming the primary means by which encounters were delivered. Counts of patients receiving on-going care for suicide attempts were stable, and for overdoses, decreased by 17%. Counts of patients initiating care for suicide attempts and overdoses decreased by 30% and 38%, respectively. Weekly prescriptions and medication on-hand for psychotropics ranged from a 2% decrease to a 4% increase. New patient prescribing decreased 21%-50%. VHA and other large healthcare systems will need to expand outreach and continue to develop TMH services to maintain care continuity and initiate care for existing and new patients during COVID-19 and future large-scale outbreaks, epidemics, and disasters.

These psychological problems have been seen in either normal people during the lockdown (who are waiting to get infected with COVID-19) and patients with COVID-19 (who are waiting for death). These psychological problems adversely affect immune functions causing more increase in the severity of COVID-19 associated disorders and death rates. Increasing the aerobic capacity is one of the effective methods that could be used to decrease stress, anxiety, and depression. Besides, increasing the aerobic capacity increases immune functions through autonomic regulation. Thus, this review was developed to summarize the effect of increasing the aerobic capacity on psycho-immune hormones commonly disturbed in people during the lockdown or patients with COVID-19 infection. This review was carried out by searching through Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials, literature reviews, and systematic reviews. The search included the possible effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the functions of psycho-immune hormones. This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity can decrease psychological problems commonly seen in people with COVID-19 and increase immune functions by modulating the levels of glucocorticoid, oxytocin, insulin, thyroid hormones. This review demonstrated that increasing the aerobic capacity is a recommended treatment for decreasing the psychological problems commonly seen in people with COVID-19 because it has the potential for decreasing psychological problems and improving immune functions which would help counter COVID-19.","Amro, Mohamed, Alawna","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202103_25443","20210408","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12746,""
"Epigenetic Lens to Visualize the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection in COVID-19 Pandemic","In &lt;20 years, we have witnessed three different epidemics with coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in human populations, causing widespread mortality. SARS-CoV-2, through its rapid global spread, has led to the pandemic that we call COVID-19. As of February 1, 2021, the global infections linked to SARS-CoV-2 stand at 103,503,340, with 2,236,960 deaths, and 75,108,099 recoveries. This review attempts to highlight host-pathogen interaction with particular emphasis on the role of epigenetic machinery in regulating the disease. Although researchers, since the start of the pandemic, have been intensely engaged in diverse areas to understand the mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection to find answers that can bring about innovative ways to swiftly treat and prevent disease progression, this review provides an overview on how the host epigenetics is modulated and subverted by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells and drive immunopathogenesis. Epigenetics is the study that combines genetic and non-genetic factors controlling phenotypic variation, which are primarily a consequence of external and environmental stimuli. These stimuli alter the activity of a gene without impinging on the DNA code. In viral-host interactions, DNA/RNA methylation, non-coding RNAs, chromatin remodeling, and histone modifications are known to regulate and modulate host gene expression patterns. Viruses such as Coronaviruses (an RNA virus) show intrinsic association with these processes. They have evolved the ability to tamper with host epigenetic machinery to interfere with immune sensing pathways to evade host immune response, thereby enhancing its replication and pathogenesis post-entry. These epigenetic alterations allow the virus to weaken the host's immune response to successfully spread infection. How this occurs, and what epigenetic mechanisms are altered is poorly understood both for coronaviruses and other respiratory RNA viruses. The review highlights several cutting-edge aspects of epigenetic work primarily pertinent to SARS-CoV-2, which has been published between 2019 and 2020 to showcase the current knowledge both in terms of success and failures and take lessons that will assist us in understanding the disease to develop better treatments suited to kill SARS-CoV-2.","Saksena, Bonam, Miranda-Saksena","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.581726","20210408","COVID; SARSCOV2; SARSCoV2 pathogenesis; chromatin; epigenetic modulation; epigenetics; methylation; miRNA","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12747,""
"A Self-Compassion and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Mobile Intervention (Serene) for Depression, Anxiety, and Stress: Promoting Adaptive Emotional Regulation and Wisdom","<b>Introduction:</b> Many individuals and families are currently experiencing a high level of COVID-19-related stress and are struggling to find helpful coping mechanisms. Mindfulness-based interventions are becoming an increasingly popular treatment for individuals experiencing depression and chronic levels of stress. The app (Serene) draws from scholarly evidence on the efficacy of mindfulness meditations and builds on the pre-existing apps by incorporating techniques that are used in some therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. <b>Methods:</b> Participants were randomly assigned to a 4-week mindfulness and self-compassion-based cognitive smartphone intervention (Serene) or a wait-list control group. They were instructed to engage in self-compassion and mindfulness practices and a cognitive restructuring task. They also completed measures that evaluated their levels of depression, stress, anxiety, self-compassion, wisdom, psychological well-being, and subjective well-being. The intervention group was also instructed to track their weekly engagement with the app. Standardized effect sizes for between-group differences were calculated using Cohen's <i>d</i> for complete case analyses. <b>Results:</b> Complete case analyses from baseline to the end of this randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant moderate between-group differences for depressive symptoms (<i>d</i> = -0.43) and decisiveness (<i>d</i> = 0.34). Moderate between-group differences were also found for self-compassion (<i>d</i> = 0.6) such that significant improvements in self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness and decreases in self-judgement, isolation, and overidentification were observed. A small between-group difference was found for emotional regulation (<i>d</i> = 0.28). Moreover, a significant moderate within-group decrease in stress (<i>d</i> = -0.52) and anxiety symptoms (<i>d</i> = -0.47) was also observed in the intervention group. <b>Conclusions:</b> Serene is an effective intervention that promotes increased levels of self-compassion and emotional regulation. Engaging with Serene may help reduce depressive symptoms through mindfulness, self-compassion, and cognitive restructuring which help reduce overidentification with one's negative emotions. As individuals rebalance their thinking through cognitive restructuring, they can identify the varying stressors in their life, develop action plans and engage in adaptive coping strategies to address them. Serene may promote greater self-understanding which may provide one with a more balanced perspective on their current upsetting situations to positively transform their challenges during the pandemic.","Al-Refae, Al-Refae, Munroe, Sardella, Ferrari","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648087","20210408","CBT; app; depression; emotion regulation; mindfulness; self-compassion; serene; wisdom","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12748,""
"A Perspective on Mature Gratitude as a Way of Coping With COVID-19","This perspective presents evidence of mature gratitude as a way of coping with the threats and boundaries of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This narrative, non-systematic review will be based on studies from the COVID-19 period in association with more general literature on the characteristics of mature gratitude related to good mental health. The results from the literature suggest that a confrontation with our existential vulnerability during a pandemic is not only a crisis but also an opportunity to view our lives in a different way. Mature gratitude, as proposed in this perspective, can help us in coping with the threats and boundaries that are part of our lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This time of crisis gives us the opportunity to self-reflect on our current life and plans for the future and to reframe them through a positive lens which can encourage individuals to actively strengthen their psychological resilience and coping skills. Cultivating an attitude of mature gratitude through actions of kindness, expressing being thankful for life and God, and enjoying all the small things in life helps in coping with the current threats of COVID-19 and building lifelong resilience for the future. Knowledge about these associations can help psychologists, counselors, and coaches to support people who experience psychological issues due to the current pandemic and all crises to come.","Jans-Beken","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.632911","20210408","character strengths; clinical psychology; corona; positive psychology; virtues","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12749,""
"The Importance of Well-Being on Resiliency of Filipino Adults During the COVID-19 Enhanced Community Quarantine: A Necessary Condition Analysis","Nation-wide community quarantines and social distancing are part of the new normal because of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Since extensive and prolonged lockdowns are relatively novel experiences, not much is known about the well-being of individuals in such extreme situations. This research effort investigated the relationship between well-being elements and resiliency of 533 Filipino adults who were placed under the nationwide enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants comprised of 376 females (70.56%) and 157 males (29.45%). The median and mode ages of the participants is 23 years, while 25 is the mean age. PERMA Profiler was used to measure participants' well-being elements, while Connor-Davidson Resiliency Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10) was used to measure their resiliency. Collected data were analyzed using the regression model and necessary condition analysis. This study corroborated that all the five pillars of well-being are significant positive correlates of resiliency (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.00) in quarantined adults. The results shown accomplishment (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 0.447, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) positively predicts resiliency, while negative emotions (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = -0.171, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.00) negatively predict resiliency. Lastly, the five pillars of well-being are necessary-but-not-sufficient conditions (ceiling envelopment with free disposal hull, CE-FDH <i>p</i> &lt; 0.00) of resiliency. Our results cast a new light on well-being elements as constraints rather than enablers of resiliency. This novel result shows that optimum resiliency is only possible when all the five pillars of well-being are taken care of and when a person is at least minimally contented with their physical health. The present findings underscore the importance of a holistic as against an atomistic approach to maintaining good mental health, which suggests that deficiencies in certain areas of well-being may not be fully addressed by overcompensating on other areas, as all five pillars of well-being are necessary-but-not-sufficient conditions of resiliency. The study ends with the recommendation for the use of necessary condition analysis to study both classical and novel psychological research problems.","Camitan, Bajin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.558930","20210408","COVID-19; PERMA; Philippines; necessary condition analysis; necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for optimality; positive psychology; resilience; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12750,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Male Strength Athletes Who Use Non-prescribed Anabolic-Androgenic Steroids","<b>Background:</b> One sub-population potentially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are strength athletes who use anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS). We examined links between disruption in AAS use and training due to the pandemic and mental health outcomes in this population, hypothesising: (a) the pandemic would be linked with reduced training and AAS use; and (b) athletes perceiving greater impact on their training and AAS use would report increases in detrimental mental health outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> Male strength athletes using AAS (<i>N</i> = 237) from 42 countries completed an online questionnaire in May 2020. A sub-sample (<i>N</i> = 90) from 20 countries participated again 4 months later. The questionnaire assessed pre-pandemic and current AAS use and training, alongside several mental health outcomes. <b>Results:</b> At Time 1, most participants perceived an impact of the pandemic on AAS use (91.1%) and/or training (57.8%). Dependent <i>t</i>-tests demonstrated significant reductions in training frequency (<i>t</i> = 7.78; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and AAS dose (<i>t</i> = 6.44; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) compared to pre-pandemic. Linear regression showed the impact of the pandemic on training was a significant positive predictor of excessive body checking (<i>B</i> = 0.35) and mood swings (<i>B</i> = 0.26), and AAS dose was a significant positive predictor of anxiety (<i>B</i> = 0.67), insomnia (<i>B</i> = 0.52), mood swings (<i>B</i> = 0.37). At Time 2, fewer participants perceived an impact of the pandemic on AAS use (29.9%) and/or training (66.7%) than at Time 1. Training frequency (<i>t</i> = 3.02; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and AAS dose (<i>t</i> = 2.11; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) were depressed in comparison to pre-pandemic. However, AAS dose had increased compared to Time 1 (<i>t</i> = 2.11; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Linear regression showed the impact of the pandemic on training/AAS use did not significantly predict any mental-health outcomes. However, AAS dose was a significant negative predictor of depressive thoughts (<i>B</i> = -0.83) and mood swings (<i>B</i> = -2.65). <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings showed impact of the pandemic on the training and AAS use, reflected in reduced training frequency and AAS dose.

"Death and Mourning Process in Frontline Health Care Professionals and Their Families During COVID-19","The COVID-19 epidemic has mushroomed globally, disrupting the existence of millions. Under this current pandemic situation, the frontline health care professionals are looped in the clutch of the virus and are relatively more exposed to the patients infected with the disease. In this precarious situation, the frontline health care professionals have contributed their best to provide utmost care to the patients infected with the ailment. The direct involvement of these professionals, however, has taken a toll on their physical health as well as on their mental well-being. Several studies conducted recently have reported that frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 are associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues. Lack of personal protection equipment, unreasonable amounts of work, improper medicines, fear of contracting the disease, and lack of skilled training have interposed the frontline health care workers with unimaginable stress. Due to the widespread outbreak, the death count of the frontline health care professionals has also surged. However, studies exploring the physical and mental welfare of the frontline health care professionals and their families are very few and far behind. To address this aperture, the present paper attempts to highlight the psychological and physical impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the frontline health care professions and to understand the impact of the death of these frontline health care professionals on the psychological well-being, mourning process, and complicated grief among the family members of healthcare professionals. The paper also presents some recommendations for providing psychological support to healthcare professionals and their bereaved families.","Das, Singh, Varma, Arya","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.624428","20210408","COVID - 19; death; frontline health care professionals; grief; mourning; psychosocial support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12752,""
"Risk perception and knowledge of COVID-19 in patients with celiac disease","We recently demonstrated that the odds of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with celiac disease (CeD) is similar to that of the general population. However, how patients with CeD perceive their COVID-19 risk may differ from their actual risk. To investigate risk perceptions of contracting COVID-19 in patients with CeD and determine the factors that may influence their perception. We distributed a survey throughout 10 countries between March and June 2020 and collected data on demographics, diet, COVID-19 testing, and risk perceptions of COVID-19 in patients with CeD. Participants were recruited through various celiac associations, clinic visits, and social media. Risk perception was assessed by asking individuals whether they believe patients with CeD are at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 when compared to the general population. Logistic regression was used to determine the influencing factors associated with COVID-19 risk perception, such as age, sex, adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), and comorbidities such as cardiac conditions, respiratory conditions, and diabetes. Data was presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs). A total of 10737 participants with CeD completed the survey. From them, 6019 (56.1%) patients with CeD perceived they were at a higher risk or were unsure if they were at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to the non-CeD population. A greater proportion of patients with CeD perceived an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 when compared to infections in general due to their CeD (56.1% <i>vs</i> 26.7%, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). Consequently, 34.8% reported taking extra COVID-19 precautions as a result of their CeD. Members of celiac associations were less likely to perceive an increased risk of COVID-19 when compared to non-members (49.5% <i>vs</i> 57.4%, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). Older age (aOR: 0.99; 95%CI: 0.99 to 0.99, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), male sex (aOR: 0.84; 95%CI: 0.76 to 0.93, <i>P</i> = 0.001), and strict adherence to a GFD (aOR: 0.89; 95%CI: 0.82 to 0.96, <i>P</i> = 0.007) were associated with a lower perception of COVID-19 risk and the presence of comorbidities was associated with a higher perception of COVID-19 risk (aOR: 1.38; 95%CI: 1.22 to 1.54, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Overall, high levels of risk perceptions, such as those found in patients with CeD, may increase an individual's pandemic-related stress and contribute to negative mental health consequences. Therefore, it is encouraged that public health officials maintain consistent communication with the public and healthcare providers with the celiac community. Future studies specifically evaluating mental health in CeD could help determine the consequences of increased risk perceptions in this population.","Zhen, Stefanolo, Temprano, Seiler, Caminero, de-Madaria, Huguet, Santiago, Niveloni, Smecuol, Dominguez, Trucco, Lopez, Olano, Mansueto, Carroccio, Green, Duerksen, Day, Tye-Din, Bai, Ciacci, VerdÃƒÂº, Lebwohl, Pinto-Sanchez","https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v27.i12.1213","20210408","COVID-19; Celiac disease; Coronavirus; Gluten; Infection; Knowledge; Perception; Risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12753,""
"Assessment of impact of the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases in Europe: results from the REUMAVID study (phase 1)","To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). REUMAVID is a cross-sectional study using an online survey developed by an international multidisciplinary patient-led collaboration across seven European countries targeting unselected patients with RMDs. Healthcare access, daily activities, disease activity and function, well-being (WHO Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5)), health status, anxiety/depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)) and access to information were evaluated. Data were collected in April-July 2020 (first phase). Data from the first phase included 1800 patients with 15 different RMDs (37.2% axial spondyloarthritis, 29.2% rheumatoid arthritis, 17.2% osteoarthritis and others). Mean age was 53, 80% female and 49% had undertaken university studies. During the beginning of the pandemic, 58.4% had their rheumatology appointment cancelled and 45.6% reported not having received any information relating to the possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in their RMDs, with the main source being patient organisations (27.6%).Regarding habits, 24.6% increased smoking, 18.2% raised their alcohol consumption, and 45.6% were unable to continue exercising. Self-reported disease activity was high (5.3Ã‚Â±2.7) and 75.6% reported elevated pain. Half the patients (49.0%) reported poor well-being (WHO-5) and 46.6% that their health had changed for the worse during lockdown. According to HADS, 57.3% were at risk of anxiety and 45.9% of depression.

"Update to the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a mindfulness training programme in schools compared with normal school provision (MYRIAD): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","MYRIAD (My Resilience in Adolescence) is a superiority, parallel group, cluster randomised controlled trial designed to examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a mindfulness training (MT) programme, compared with normal social and emotional learning (SEL) school provision to enhance mental health, social-emotional-behavioural functioning and well-being in adolescence. The original trial protocol was published in Trials (accessible at https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-017-1917-4 ). This included recruitment in two cohorts, enabling the learning from the smaller first cohort to be incorporated in the second cohort. Here we describe final amendments to the study protocol and discuss their underlying rationale. Four major changes were introduced into the study protocol: (1) there were changes in eligibility criteria, including a clearer operational definition to assess the degree of SEL implementation in schools, and also new criteria to avoid experimental contamination; (2) the number of schools and pupils that had to be recruited was increased based on what we learned in the first cohort; (3) some changes were made to the secondary outcome measures to improve their validity and ability to measure constructs of interest and to reduce the burden on school staff; and (4) the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) pandemic both influences and makes it difficult to interpret the 2-year follow-up primary endpoint results, so we changed our primary endpoint to 1-year follow-up. These changes to the study protocol were approved by the Trial Management Group, Trial Steering Committee and Data and Ethics Monitoring Committees and improved the enrolment of participants and quality of measures. Furthermore, the change in the primary endpoint will give a more reliable answer to our primary question because it was collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in both cohort 1 and cohort 2. Nevertheless, the longer 2-year follow-up data will still be acquired, although this time-point will be now framed as a second major investigation to answer some new important questions presented by the combination of the pandemic and our study design.

We surveyed a sample of Italian adolescents during the strictest quarantine period and assessed the effects of socio-demographic and psychological factors on current emotional symptoms. A convenient sample of 326 adolescents (age range 14-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) participated in a web-based survey. We collected data on several socio-demographic and psychological variables (summarized into three indexes: environmental context, changes in lifestyle, and worries about infection) and psychopathological symptoms (previous psychopathological status, current anxiety and depressive symptoms). Descriptive analysis showed that adolescents have experienced quarantine under very different conditions; they reported 47.5 and 14.1% of anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Regression analyses indicated that previous psychopathological status and worries about infection are linked to anxiety and that female gender, previous psychopathological status (moderated by change in lifestyle), worse environmental context are linked to depression. This study indicates that, facing the COVID-19 pandemic and its related safety measures, adolescents show relevant emotional symptoms and therefore should be monitored, assessed and supported.","Pisano, Catone, Gritti, Almerico, Pezzella, Santangelo, Bravaccio, Iuliano, Senese","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-021-01036-1","20210408","Anxiety symptoms; Depressive symptoms; Pandemic; Quarantine; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12756,""
"Perceived stressÃ‚Â among university students in south-east Serbia during the COVID-19 outbreak","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into focus the mental health of the student population. The study aimed to analyze the psychological response to the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of perceived stress and its related factors among university students in south-east Serbia. The study was conducted during the increased incidence of COVID-19 in Serbia. A total of 434 students from the public university in south-east Serbia enrolled in the study and completed the measures of socio-demographic data, the perceived stress scale (PSS-10), the Coping Strategy Indicator (CSI) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). The data were analyzed through quantitative and qualitative methods. Study findings suggest that the mean perceived stress score was placed toÃ‚Â 20.43 (Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.67). Our model showed that female gender, higher scores on anxiety/insomnia and depression subscale as well as the coping strategy avoidance predicted higher perceived stress, while higher scores on social dysfunction were related to the reduced perceived stress scores.Ã‚ CONCLUSION: Notwithstanding the study limitation, findings provided authentic data of stress reactions of the students in south-east Serbia during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Variables between groups within the study sample were compared using ANOVA and Chi-square tests (with Fisher's exact test). Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between variables related to access to health services. Of the study population, 80.6% accessed the general practitioner (GP), 40% accessed the student health centres, and 11.4% were admitted to the hospital at least once. About 80% of international students reported changing their views to access healthcare more because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of awareness of healthcare support systems, perceived stigma associated with mental health services, and language barriers were the main barriers affecting healthcare access by international students. Study findings indicate the need for education of international students on available healthcare, targeted health promotion, and training of health providers on effective communication.","Masai, GÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ§iz-DoÃ„Å¸an, Ouma, Nyadera, Ruto","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06301-x","20210408","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12758,""
"History for some or lesson for all? A systematic review and meta-analysis on the immediate and long-term mental health impact of the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak","The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to examine the prevalence of adverse mental health outcomes, both short-term and long-term, among SARS patients, healthcare workers and the general public of SARS-affected regions, and to examine the protective and risk factors associated with these mental health outcomes. We conducted a systematic search of the literature using databases such as Medline, Pubmed, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science Core Collection, CNKI, the National Central Library Online Catalog and dissertation databases to identify studies in the English or Chinese language published between January 2003 to May 2020 which reported psychological distress and mental health morbidities among SARS patients, healthcare workers, and the general public in regions with major SARS outbreaks. The literature search yielded 6984 titles. Screening resulted in 80 papers for the review, 35 of which were included in the meta-analysis. The prevalence of post-recovery probable or clinician-diagnosed anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among SARS survivors were 19, 20 and 28%, respectively. The prevalence of these outcomes among studies conducted within and beyond 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months post-discharge was not significantly different. Certain aspects of mental health-related quality of life measures among SARS survivors remained impaired beyond 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months post-discharge. The prevalence of probable depressive disorder and PTSD among healthcare workers post-SARS were 12 and 11%, respectively. The general public had increased anxiety levels during SARS, but whether there was a clinically significant population-wide mental health impact remained inconclusive. Narrative synthesis revealed occupational exposure to SARS patients and perceived stigmatisation to be risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes among healthcare workers, although causality could not be determined due to the limitations of the studies. The chronicity of psychiatric morbidities among SARS survivors should alert us to the potential long-term mental health complications of covid-19 patients. Healthcare workers working in high-risk venues should be given adequate mental health support. Stigmatisation against patients and healthcare workers should be explored and addressed. The significant risk of bias and high degree of heterogeneity among included studies limited the certainty of the body of evidence of the review.","Chau, Wong, Ramakrishnan, Chan, Wong, Li, Raymont, Elliot, Rathod, Delanerolle, Phiri","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10701-3","20210408","Covid-19; Healthcare workers; Infectious disease; Mental health; Post-traumatic stress disorder; SARS","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12759,""
"Telepsychiatry adoption across hospitals in the United States: a cross-sectional study","Access to psychiatric care is critical for patients discharged from hospital psychiatric units to ensure continuity of care. When face-to-face follow-up is unavailable or undesirable, telepsychiatry becomes a promising alternative. This study aimed to investigate hospital- and county-level characteristics associated with telepsychiatry adoption. Cross-sectional national data of 3475 acute care hospitals were derived from the 2017 American Hospital Association Annual Survey. Generalized linear regression models were used to identify characteristics associated with telepsychiatry adoption. About one-sixth (548 [15.8%]) of hospitals reported having telepsychiatry with a wide variation across states. Rural noncore hospitals were less likely to adopt telepsychiatry (8.3%) than hospitals in rural micropolitan (13.6%) and urban counties (19.4%). Hospitals with both outpatient and inpatient psychiatric care services (marginal difference [95% CI]: 16.0% [12.1% to 19.9%]) and hospitals only with outpatient psychiatric services (6.5% [3.7% to 9.4%]) were more likely to have telepsychiatry than hospitals with neither psychiatric services. Federal hospitals (48.9% [32.5 to 65.3%]), system-affiliated hospitals (3.9% [1.2% to 6.6%]), hospitals with larger bed size (Quartile IV vs. I: 6.2% [0.7% to 11.6%]), and hospitals with greater ratio of Medicaid inpatient days to total inpatient days (Quartile IV vs. I: 4.9% [0.3% to 9.4%]) were more likely to have telepsychiatry than their counterparts. Private non-profit hospitals (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.9% [-Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.7% to -Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.0%]) and hospitals in counties designated as whole mental health professional shortage areas (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.6% [-Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.7% to -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.5%]) were less likely to have telepsychiatry. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, telepsychiatry adoption in US hospitals was low with substantial variations by urban and rural status and by state in 2017. This raises concerns about access to psychiatric services and continuity of care for patients discharged from hospitals.","Li, Harrison, Li, Hung","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03180-8","20210408","Access to care; Continuity of care; Hospital psychiatry; Telemedicine; Telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12760,""
"Benefits of Indirect Contact With Nature on the Physiopsychological Well-Being of Elderly People","Exposure to nature or to green space has positive mental health benefits. Closing of parks and green spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced options for mental health and well-being benefits and could have a greater impact on vulnerable populations, especially the elderly. The present study, therefore, explores the physiopsychological impacts of indirect contact with nature, using forest imagery, on the brain activity and autonomic nervous systems of elderly people. A within-subject design experiment was used. Thirty-four participants aged 82.9 Ã‚Â± 0.78 years were asked to look at bamboo and urban images for 2 min. During the visual stimulation, ÃŽÂ± relative waves were measured using electroencephalography as an indicator of brain activity. Heart rate variability and skin conductance (SC) responses were utilized as indicators of arousal. Afterward, psychological responses were evaluated using the semantic differential and the Profile of Mood States questionnaires. Visual stimulation with bamboo image induced a significant increase in ÃŽÂ± relative waves and parasympathetic nervous activity and a significant decrease in SC. In addition, a significant increase in perceptions of &quot;comfortable,&quot; &quot;relaxed,&quot; &quot;cheerful,&quot; and &quot;vigorous&quot; feelings was observed. Indirect contact with nature enhances the physiological and psychological conditions of the elderly. Findings can be used to guide the new design, renewal, and modification of the living environments of the elderly and those who are unable to get outside.","Elsadek, Shao, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1177/19375867211006654","20210408","bamboo imagery; forest therapy; heart rate variability; mood; relaxation; senior housing; ÃŽÂ± wave activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12761,""
"Impact of a Resiliency Training to Support the Mental Well-being of Front-line Workers: Brief Report of a Quasi-experimental Study of the Community Resiliency Model","Front-line workers (FLW) are at risk for secondary traumatic stress, burnout, and related psychiatric sequelae: depression, anxiety, suicidality, posttraumatic stress disorder, and sleep and substance use disorders. FLW are in need of self-care programs to support their mental health. Quasi-experimental study to assess the impact of a simple mental well-being and emotional regulation training, the Community Resiliency Model (CRM), using a convenience sample of FLW. Baseline scores of mental well-being and stress measures were compared with follow-up scores at 3 time points. Outcomes were psychological wellness (World Health Organization-5 Well-being Index); resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10); traumatic stress (Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale); physical symptoms (Somatic Symptom Scale-8). Of the 104 participants who enrolled and attended the CRM training, 73 (70.2%) completed at least 1 posttest. Well-being scores increased at 1 year with a small-moderate effect size (Cohen d=0.32). Resilience scores increased with a small-moderate effect size by 1 year (Cohen d=0.36). Secondary traumatic stress scores declined, with the largest effect at 1 week (Cohen d=0.49). Somatic symptoms decreased at each posttest, with the largest change occurring from baseline to 1 week (d=0.39). Participants reported an awareness of body sensations helped them when overwhelmed as a means of calming themselves. After a 3-hour CRM training, participants reported improved mental well-being and decreased secondary traumatic stress and somatic symptoms.

"A longitudinal assessment of depression and anxiety in the Republic of Ireland before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Few studies have examined changes in mental health before and after the outbreak of COVID-19. We examined changes in the prevalence of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) between February 2019 and March-April 2020; if there were changes in major depression and GAD during six weeks of nationwide lockdown; and we identified factors that predicted major depression and GAD across the six-week lockdown period. Nationally representative samples of Irish adults were gathered using identical methods in February 2019 (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1020) and March-April 2020 (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1041). The latter was reassessed six weeks later. Significantly more people screened positive for depression in February 2019 (29.8% 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 27.0, 32.6) than in March-April 2020 (22.8% 95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 20.2, 25.3), and there was no change in GAD. There were no significant changes in depression and GAD during the lockdown. Major depression was predicted by younger age, non-city dwelling, lower resilience, higher loneliness, and higher somatic problems. GAD was predicted by a broader set of variables including several COVID-19 specific variables. These findings indicate that the prevalence of major depression and GAD did not increase as a result of, or during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland.","Hyland, Shevlin, Murphy, McBride, Fox, Bondjers, Karatzias, Bentall, Martinez, ValliÃƒÂ¨res","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113905","20210407","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Longitudinal; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12763,""
"Changes in smoking and alcohol consumption during COVID-19-related lockdown: A cross-sectional study in France","In many countries, lockdown measures were implemented to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation may have an impact on mental health, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption. The aim of this research report is therefore to describe changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption in the general French population during the first two weeks of lockdown and identify any associated factors. Self-reported changes in smoking and alcohol consumption following the lockdown implemented in France on March 17, 2020 were collected from 2,003 respondents aged 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and older in an online cross-sectional survey carried out from March 30 to April 1, 2020. Anxiety and depression levels were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Among current smokers, 26.7% reported an increase in their tobacco consumption since lockdown and 18.6% reported a decrease, while it remained stable for 54.7%. The increase in tobacco consumption was associated with an age of 18-34Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, a high level of education, and anxiety. Among alcohol drinkers, 10.7% reported an increase in their alcohol consumption since lockdown and 24.4% reported a decrease, while it remained stable for 64.8%. The increase in alcohol consumption was associated with an age of 18-49Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, living in cities of more than 100,000 inhabitants, a high socio-professional category, and a depressive mood. The national lockdown implemented in France during the COVID-19 pandemic influenced tobacco and alcohol consumption in different ways according to sociodemographic group and mental health.","Guignard, Andler, QuatremÃƒÂ¨re, Pasquereau, du RoscoÃƒÂ¤t, Arwidson, Berlin, Nguyen-Thanh","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab054","20210407","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12764,""
"COVID-19 and suicide: when crises collide","Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide. Even before the emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 COVID-19 pandemic, suicide continued to be a major public health concern. Globally, someone dies by suicide every 40Ã‚Â s, and for each death, there are 20 more persons attempting suicide. A recently published article rightly stated the need for a 'population-based approach' to suicide prevention to mitigate suicide attempts. This paper further adds that there must be a stronger multi-agency or multi-sectoral approach to suicide prevention, intervention and postvention. This paper concludes with few suggestions on how to address the COVID-19-related suicide cases as the world continues to fight against the double pandemic.","Corpuz","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab115","20210407","COVID-19; intervention; pandemic; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12765,""
"Association of Human Mobility Restrictions and Race/Ethnicity-Based, Sex-Based, and Income-Based Factors With Inequities in Well-being During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States","An accurate understanding of the distributional implications of public health policies is critical for ensuring equitable responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and future public health threats. To identify and quantify the association of race/ethnicity-based, sex-based, and income-based inequities of state-specific lockdowns with 6 well-being dimensions in the United States. This pooled, repeated cross-sectional study used data from 14Ã¢â‚¬Â¯187Ã¢â‚¬Â¯762 households who participated in phase 1 of the population-representative US 2020 Household Pulse Survey (HPS). Households were invited to participate by email, text message, and/or telephone as many as 3 times. Data were collected via an online questionnaire from April 23 to July 21, 2020, and participants lived in all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Indicators of race/ethnicity, sex, and income and their intersections. Unemployment; food insufficiency; mental health problems; no medical care received for health problems; default on last month's rent or mortgage; and class cancellations with no distance learning. Race/ethnicity, sex, income, and their intersections were used to measure distributional implications across historically marginalized populations; state-specific, time-varying population mobility was used to measure lockdown intensity. Logistic regression models with pooled repeated cross-sections were used to estimate risk of dichotomous outcomes by social group, adjusted for confounding variables. The 1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯088Ã¢â‚¬Â¯314 respondents (561Ã¢â‚¬Â¯570 [51.6%; 95% CI, 51.4%-51.9%] women) were aged 18 to 88 years (mean [SD], 51.55 [15.74] years), and 826Ã¢â‚¬Â¯039 (62.8%; 95% CI, 62.5%-63.1%) were non-Hispanic White individuals; 86Ã¢â‚¬Â¯958 (12.5%; 95% CI, 12.4%-12.7%), African American individuals; 86Ã¢â‚¬Â¯062 (15.2%; 95% CI, 15.0%-15.4%), Hispanic individuals; and 50Ã¢â‚¬Â¯227 (5.6%; 95% CI, 5.5%-5.7%), Asian individuals. On average, every 10% reduction in mobility was associated with higher odds of unemployment (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.4), food insufficiency (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2), mental health problems (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.0-1.1), and class cancellations (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2). Across most dimensions compared with White men with high income, African American individuals with low income experienced the highest risks (eg, food insufficiency, men: OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.8-3.7; mental health problems, women: OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.8-2.1; medical care inaccessibility, women: OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.6-1.9; unemployment, men: OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.5-3.2; rent/mortgage defaults, men: OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 4.7-7.1). Other high-risk groups were Hispanic individuals (eg, unemployment, Hispanic men with low income: OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.5-3.4) and women with low income across all races/ethnicities (eg, medical care inaccessibility, non-Hispanic White women: OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.7-2.0). In this cross-sectional study, African American and Hispanic individuals, women, and households with low income had higher odds of experiencing adverse outcomes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders. Blanket public health policies ignoring existing distributions of risk to well-being may be associated with increased race/ethnicity-based, sex-based, and income-based inequities.","Chakrabarti, Hamlet, Kaminsky, Subramanian","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.7373","20210408","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12766,""
"Older adults in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil: effects on health, income and work","The goal of this study is to characterize the population of older adults in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic with regard to health, socioeconomic conditions, gender inequality, adherence to social distancing and feelings of sadness or depression. It is a cross-sectional study carried out with Brazilian older adults who responded to an online health survey (N = 9,173), using a &quot;virtual snowball&quot; sampling method. Data were collected online via a self-administered questionnaire. Prevalence and confidence interval estimates were performed and verified for independence using Pearson's chi-square test. During the pandemic there was a fall in household income among almost half of older adults. Extreme social distancing was practiced by 30.9% (95%CI: 27.8; 34.1) and 12.2% (95%CI: 10.1; 14.7) did not adhere to it. Older adults who were not working before the pandemic adhered in greater numbers to extreme social distancing measures. Most of them presented comorbidities associated with a higher risk of developing the severe form of COVID-19. Feelings of loneliness, distress and sadness were frequent among older adults, especially women. The COVID-19 pandemic widened the inequality gap by affecting the most vulnerable older people. Strategies to mitigate loneliness and social distancing should consider social vulnerability and the marked difference between men and women in terms of household composition and socioeconomic and working conditions. The development of representative surveys of Brazilian older adults is recommended, investigating the impact of the pandemic on this population.

"Evolution and impact of self-efficacy during French COVID-19 confinement: a longitudinal study","Based on social cognitive theory, we propose that self-efficacy is a personal resource that protects people from the impact of confinement in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a longitudinal study where 197 French citizens were surveyed over 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks of confinement (though only 25 participants responded each of these 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks), we examined the relationships between general self-efficacy and positive affect, negative affect and adaptive performance at work. Consistent with theoretical expectations, self-efficacy was relatively stable during confinement and was positively related to positive affect and negatively related to negative affect. Self-efficacy was also positively correlated with all dimensions of adaptive performance at work during confinement.

African American patients hospitalized and treated with invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID-19-associated respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, were screened for depression within 90 days of hospital discharge using the validated patient health questionnaires (PHQ-2) and PHQ-9. A total of 73 patients completed the questionnaire. The median age was 52.5 years [IQR 44-65] and 65% were males. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (66%) and diabetes mellitus (51%). Forty-four percent of the patients had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) based on their PHQ-9 questionnaire responses. The incidence of MDD was higher among females (69%, n=18/26) compared to males (29%, n=14/47), in patients &gt; 75 years (66%) and those with multiple comorbidities (45%). Eighteen percent of the patients had moderate depression, while 15% and 22% had moderately severe and severe depression, respectively. Only 26% (n=7/27) of eligible patients were receiving treatment for depression at the time of this survey. The incidence of depression in a cohort of African American patients without prior psychiatric conditions who recovered from severe COVID-19 infection was 44%. More than 70% of these patients were not receiving treatment for depression.","Olanipekun, Abe, Effoe, Westney, Snyder","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-01034-3","20210407","African Americans; COVID-19; Depression; ICU; PHQ-9","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12770,""
"Mental health and well-being of university staff during the coronavirus disease 2019 levels 4 and 5 lockdown in an Eastern Cape university, South Africa","The mental health of university staff members is often neglected and might have been exacerbated during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine the mental health and well-being of staff members in an Eastern Cape university just after levels 4 and 5 lockdowns (01 June 2020) in South Africa. The university was closed during lockdown and staff members had to work from home, trying to save the 2020 academic year. A cross-sectional exploratory survey of a sample of 280 staff members (response rate = 27.75%), with a mean age of 48.84 Ã‚Â± 10.17 years, completed the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) and Mental Health Continuum - Short Form (MHC-SF). A number (27.6%) of staff members reported psychological distress, whilst the majority (60%) was flourishing during lockdown. Socio-economic collapse, contracting the virus and the completion of the academic year were their biggest worries. Whilst a strong negative correlation between psychological distress and mental well-being (MWB) was observed (<i>r</i> = -0.595), age had an inverse correlation with psychological distress (<i>r</i> = -0.130) and a positive correlation with MWB (<i>r</i> = 0.153). Female staff members, staff members with comorbidities and workers in the administration and service sections were significantly more likely to report psychological distress. The mental health of female staff members and members with comorbidities were almost two times more at risk for psychological distress. The mental health and well-being of some university staff members were at an increased risk during lockdown.","van Niekerk, van Gent","https://doi.org/10.4102/sajpsychiatry.v27i0.1589","20210408","COVID-19; academic; mental health; mental well-being; pandemic; risk; staff members; university","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12771,""
"Comparison of Psychological Morbidity of Health Care Workers Posted in COVID and Non COVID Labour Rooms","The COVID-19 pandemic had not only burdened healthcare systems all over the world but had also affected mental health of frontline Health Care Workers. Purpose of our study was to compare the psychological morbidity of health care workers posted in Covid labour room with their counter parts in Non Covid labour room. Present study was a cross-sectional study conducted on HCW of Covid and Non Covid labour in a span of 6Ã‚Â months. Insomnia in Covid labour room was found to be in 57% HCW as compared to none in non Covid labour room (mean score 7.47Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.74 vs 1.82Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.25, <i>P</i> ValueÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001).

"Videoconferencing to deliver genetics services: a systematic review of telegenetics in light of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has forced reorganization of clinical services to minimize face-to-face contact between patients and health-care providers. Specialist services, including clinical genetics, must consider methods of remote delivery including videoconferencing-termed telegenetics. This review evaluates the evidence for telegenetics and its applicability to future service development. A systematic review of six databases was conducted to identify studies from 2005 onward using synchronous videoconferencing to deliver clinical genetics services. Included studies compared telegenetics to an alternative method or used a before and after design. Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria (eight compared telegenetics to in-person consultations and three to telephone delivery). Patient satisfaction, genetic knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes were similar for in-person and telegenetic counseling. There was some evidence that telegenetics may be superior to telephone delivery for knowledge gain and reduction in anxiety and depression. There is limited evidence concerning the effect of telegenetics on provider satisfaction and behavioral outcomes. Conclusions are limited by at least moderate risk of bias in all evaluated studies and small sample sizes. Across most outcomes measured, telegenetics had equivalent outcomes to in-person appointment; however, the extent to which the available evidence is applicable to longer-term use is debatable.","Brown, Watts, Beales, Maudhoo, Hayward, Sheridan, Rafi","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-021-01149-2","20210407","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12773,""
"Beyond Sociodemographic and COVID-19-Related Factors: The Association Between the Need for Psychological and Information Support from School and Anxiety and Depression","BACKGROUND In addition to sociodemographic and COVID-19- related factors, the needs of school support, including material, psychological and information support, have seldom been discussed as factors influencing anxiety and depression among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this cross-sectional study, 3351 college students from China were surveyed through questionnaires about their sociodemographic and COVID-19 characteristics, the needs of school support, and their experiences with anxiety and depression. RESULTS Anxiety and depression were reported by 6.88% and 10.50% of students, respectively. Married, higher education, non-medical, and urban students had significantly higher risks of anxiety or depression. Additionally, symptoms such as cough and fever, especially when following a possible contact with suspected individuals, quarantine history of a personal contact, going out 1-3 times a week, not wearing a mask, and spending 2-3 hours browsing COVID-19-related information were significantly associated with the occurrence of anxiety or depression. Those who used methods to regulate their emotional state, used a psychological hotline, and who had visited a psychiatrist showed higher anxiety or depression. Those who used online curricula and books, used preventive methods for COVID-19, and who had real-time information about the epidemic situation of the school showed lower anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS In addition to sociodemographic and COVID-19-related aspects, students' needs for psychological assistance and information from schools were also associated with anxiety and depression among college students.","Meng, Liu, Wang, Feng, Liu, Huang, Li","https://doi.org/10.12659/MSM.929280","20210407","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12774,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being of students in an Italian university: a web-based cross-sectional survey","Italy was the first European country to implement a national lockdown because of the COVID-19Ã‚Â pandemic. Worldwide, this pandemic had a huge impact on the mental health of people in many countries causing similar reaction in terms of emotions and concerns at the population level. Our study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being in a cohort of Italian university students. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in the period immediately after theÃ‚Â first lockdown through the administration of a questionnaire on the personal websites of students attending their undergraduate courses at the UniversitÃƒ Cattolica del Sacro Cuore.Ã‚Â We used the Patient-Health-Engagement-Scale, Self-Rating-Anxiety-Scale, and Self-Rating-Depression-Scale to assess engagement, anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms of our sample. The sample size was 501 subjects, of which 35.33% were classified as anxious and 72.93% as depressed. Over 90% of respondents had good understanding ofÃ‚Â the preventive measures despite over 70% suffered from the impossibility of physically seeing friends and partners. AroundÃ‚Â 55% of students would have been willing to contribute much more to face the pandemic. An increase in the occurrences of anxiety was associated with being female, being student of the Rome campus, suffering from the impossibility of attending university, being distant from colleagues, and being unable of physically seeing one's partner. Performing physical activity reduced this likelihood. UniversityÃ‚Â students are at risk of psychological distress in the case of traumatic events. The evolution of the pandemic is uncertain and may have long-term effects on mental health. Therefore, it is crucial to study the most effective interventions to identify vulnerable subgroups and to plan for acute and long-term psychological services to control and reduce the burden of psychological problems.","Villani, Pastorino, Molinari, Anelli, Ricciardi, Graffigna, Boccia","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00680-w","20210407","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Pandemics; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12775,""
"Study problems and depressive symptoms in adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak: poor parent-child relationship as a vulnerability","Little is known about the prevalence of and risk factors for adolescent mental health problems during the COVID-19 outbreak. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms, their association with study-relevant problems, and the moderating effect of parent-child relationship among Chinese adolescents during the school closures. We performed a cross-sectional analysis with data collected in middle and high schools in Taizhou, China. Students completed an online survey between April 16 and May 14, 2020. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Children's Depression Inventory. Three types of study problems were recorded, including having difficulty in studying at home, dislike of remote learning, and excessive screen entertainment time. Parental relationships were categorized into good or normal relationship and poor relationship. Linear regression and logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the associations between study-relevant problems and depressive symptoms. Using data from 6435 adolescents, we found that the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 17.7%. All the study problem measures were associated with more severe depressive symptoms. There was a moderating effect of the parental relationship on the associations between study problems and depressive symptoms. The association between number of study problems and depressive symptoms was stronger in adolescents with a poor parent-child relationship (regression coefficient 4.34 [95% CI 2.97, 5.72]) than those with a good or normal relationship (2.55 [2.35, 2.75]), p for interaction 0.002, on multivariable adjustment. Study problems due to school closures were particularly problematic for adolescents who had poor parent-child relationships. Public health initiatives could help students to adjust study habits and improve parent-child relationships, thereby protecting against the development of depression.","Wang, Wang, Lin, Richards, Yang, Liang, Chen, Fu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00693-5","20210407","Adolescents; COVID-19; Depression; Parent-child relationship; Study problem","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12776,""
"Burnout and depression among psychiatry residents during COVID-19 pandemic","Very few studies have been concerned with assessing the prevalence of burnout and depressive symptoms, especially during an infectious outbreak on non-frontline health care workers, such as a psychiatrist. In such instances, the role of psychiatrists and other mental health providers as a source of psychological support to the public and frontline workers is indispensable and valuable. This study aims to assess the prevalence of burnout and depressive symptoms, and their correlation, during the COVID-19 pandemic among psychiatry residents in Saudi Arabia. A total of 121 out of 150 psychiatry residents in Saudi Arabia completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory and Patient's Health Questionnaire for the assessment of burnout and depressive symptoms. Burnout symptoms were found in 27.3%, and another 27.3% reported having depression symptoms. In addition, 16.5% reported having both burnout and depressive symptoms, with a significant relationship between them. Participants in the first 2Ã‚Â years of training and having a history of receiving mental health treatment in the past 2Ã‚Â years were at higher risk. The need is urgent to increase investment in mental health services and to construct a plan to reduce this risk of burnout and depression among psychiatrists by developing preventative strategies to prevent burnout and promote wellness is more important than ever.","Alkhamees, Assiri, Alharbi, Nasser, Alkhamees","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-021-00584-1","20210407","Burnout; COVID 19; Depression; Pandemic; Psychiatry; Resident; Saudi Arabia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12777,""
"A scoping review of international policy responses to mental health recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's physical and mental health. Quarantine and other lockdown measures have altered people's daily lives; levels of anxiety, depression, substance use, self-harm and suicide ideation have increased. This commentary assesses how international governments, agencies and organisations are responding to the challenge of the mental health impact of COVID-19 with the aim of informing the ongoing policy and service responses needed in the immediate and longer term. It identifies some of the key themes emerging from the literature, recognises at-risk populations and highlights opportunities for innovation within mental health services, focusing on the published academic literature, international health ministry websites and other relevant international organisations beyond the United Kingdom and Ireland. COVID-19 has challenged, and may have permanently changed, mental health services. It has highlighted and exacerbated pre-existing pressures and inequities. Many decision-makers consider this an opportunity to transform mental health care, and tackling the social determinants of mental health and engaging in prevention will be a necessary part of such transformation. Better data collection, modelling and sharing will enhance policy and service development. The crisis provides opportunities to build on positive innovations: the adaptability and flexibility of community-based care; drawing on lived experience in the design, development and monitoring of services; interagency collaboration; accelerating digital healthcare; and connecting physical and mental health.","McCartan, Adell, Cameron, Davidson, Knifton, McDaid, Mulholland","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-020-00652-3","20210407","At-risk groups; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Digital healthcare; Mental health; Mental health policy; Social determinants","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12778,""
"Gender-based disparities on health indices during COVID-19 crisis: a nationwide cross-sectional study in Jordan","COVID-19 has an inevitable burden on public health, potentially widening the gender gap in healthcare and the economy. We aimed to assess gender-based desparities during COVID-19 in Jordan in terms of health indices, mental well-being and economic burden. A nationally representative sample of 1300 participants Ã¢â€°Â¥18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years living in Jordan were selected using stratified random sampling. Data were collected via telephone interviews in this cross-sectional study. Chi-square was used to test age and gender differences according to demographics, economic burden, and health indices (access to healthcare, health insurance, antenatal and reproductive services). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the beta-coefficient (ÃŽÂ²) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of factors correlated with mental well-being, assessed by patients' health questionnaire 4 (PHQ-4). 656 (50.5%) men and 644 (49.5%) women completed the interview. Three-fourths of the participants had health insurance during the COVID-19 crisis. There was no significant difference in healthcare coverage or access between women and men (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Half of pregnant women were unable to access antenatal care. Gender was a significant predictor of higher PHQ-4 scores (women vs. men: ÃŽÂ²: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.54-1.22). Among women, ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°60Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and being married were associated with significantly lower PHQ-4 scores. Only 0.38% of the overall participants lost their jobs; however, 8.3% reported a reduced payment. More women (13.89%) were not paid during the crisis as compared with men (6.92%) (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Our results showed no gender differences in healthcare coverage or access during the COVID-19 crisis generally. Women in Jordan are experiencing worse outcomes in terms of mental well-being and economic burden. Policymakers should give priority to women's mental health and antenatal and reproductive services. Financial security should be addressed in all Jordanian COVID-19 national plans because the crisis appears widening the gender gap in the economy.","Abufaraj, Eyadat, Al-Sabbagh, Nimer, Moonesar, Yang, Al Khatib, Al-Qutob","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01435-0","20210407","COVID-19; Gender; Mental health; Psychological stress; Women health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12779,""
"Differential trends of admissions in accident and emergency departments during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","Recent studies have shown a decrease of admissions to accident and emergency (A&amp;E) departments after the local outbreaks of COVID-19. However, differential trends of admission counts, for example according to diagnosis, are less well understood. This information is crucial to inform targeted intervention. Therefore, we aimed to compare admission counts in German A&amp;E departments before and after 12th march in 2020 with 2019 according to demographic factors and diagnosis groups. Routine data of all admissions between 02.12.2019-30.06.2020 and 01.12.2018-30.06.2019 was available from six hospitals in five cities from north-western, eastern, south-eastern, and south-western Germany. We defined 10 diagnosis groups using ICD-10 codes: mental disorders due to use of alcohol (MDA), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), heart failure, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, back pain, fractures of the forearm, and fractures of the femur. We calculated rate ratios comparing different periods in 12.03.2020-30.06.2020 with 12.03.2019-30.06.2019. Forty-one thousand three hundred fifty-three cases were admitted between 12.03.2020-30.06.2020 and 51,030 cases between 12.03.2019-30.06.2019. Admission counts prior to 12.03. were equal in 2020 and 2019. In the period after 12.03., the decrease of admissions in 2020 compared to 2019 was largest between 26.03. and 08.04. (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°30%, 95% CI -Ã¢â‚¬â€°33% to -Ã¢â‚¬â€°27%). When analysing the entire period 12.03.-30.06., the decrease of admissions was heterogeneous among hospitals, and larger among people aged 0-17Ã¢â‚¬â€°years compared to older age groups. In the first 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks after 12.03., admission counts of all diagnoses except femur fractures and pneumonia declined. Admissions with pneumonia increased in this early period. Between 07.05. and 30.6.2020, we noted that admissions with AMI (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°13%, 95% CI -Ã¢â‚¬â€°3% to +Ã¢â‚¬â€°32%) and cholelithiasis or cholecystitis (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°20%, 95% CI +Ã¢â‚¬â€°1% to +Ã¢â‚¬â€°44%) were higher than in 2019. Our results suggest differential trends of admission counts according to age, location, and diagnosis. An initial decrease of admissions with MDA, AMI, stroke or TIA, heart failure, COPD, cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, and back pain imply delays of emergency care in Germany. Finally, our study suggests a delayed increase of admissions with AMI and cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.","Jaehn, Holmberg, Uhlenbrock, Pohl, Finkenzeller, Pawlik, Quack, Ernstberger, Rockmann, Schreyer","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12873-021-00436-0","20210407","Accident and emergency; Admission rate; COVID-19; Internal medicine; Mental health; Surgery; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12780,""
"Psychological status after insulo-opercular resection in patients with epilepsy: Depression, anxiety, and quality of life","Insular epilepsy is increasingly recognized in epilepsy surgery centers. Recent studies suggest that resection of an epileptogenic zone that involves the insula as a treatment for drug-resistant seizures is associated with good outcomes in terms of seizure control. However, despite the existing evidence of a role of the insula in emotions and affective information processing, the long-term psychological outcome of patients undergoing these surgeries remain poorly documented. A group of 27 adults (18 women) who underwent an insulo-opercular resection (in combination with a part of the temporal lobe in 10, and of the frontal lobe in 5) as part of epilepsy surgery at our center between 2004 and 2019 completed psychometric questionnaires to assess depression (Beck Depression Inventory â€“ 2nd edition; BDI-II), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Trait Version; STAI-T), and quality of life (Patient Weighted Quality of Life In Epilepsy; QOLIE-10-P). Scores were compared to those of patients who had standard temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) surgery with similar socio-demographic and disease characteristics. Seizure control after insular epilepsy surgery was comparable to that observed after TLE surgery, with a majority of patients reporting being seizure free (insular: 63.0%; temporal: 63.2%) or having rare disabling seizures (insular: 7.4%; temporal: 18.4%) at the time of questionnaire completion. Statistical comparisons revealed no significant group difference on scores of depression, anxiety, or quality of life. Hemisphere or extent of insular resection had no significant effect on the studied variables. In the total sample, employment status and seizure control, but not location of surgery, significantly predicted quality of life. Self-reported long-term psychological status after insulo-opercular resection as part of epilepsy surgery thus appears to be similar to that observed after TLE surgery, which is commonly performed in epilepsy surgery centers.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107919","20210501","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12781,""
"Living in Uncertain Times: Pre-existing Mental Health Symptoms, Intolerance of Uncertainty and Perceived COVID-19 Threat as Predictors of Psychological Distress During the Pandemic","Amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, people are facing heightened uncertainty about the future and increasing rates of psychological distress. Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and perceived COVID-19 threat may be contributing to mental health problems. This study investigated changes in mental health problems prior to and during the first two pandemic waves in the U.S., and the extent to which IU and perceived COVID-19 threat predicted these problems. MTurk participants (n=192; 50% women) were recruited from a pre-pandemic study in December 2019/January 2020 for a follow-up study on COVID-19 experiences, across five timepoints between April and August 2020. IU, perceived COVID-19 threat, and mental health problems (i.e., worry, COVID-19 fear, and trauma symptoms) were assessed. On average, mental health problems were not elevated, relative to pre-pandemic levels, and remained stable across time. Heightened IU and perceived COVID-19 threat were associated with more mental health problems. Surprisingly, objective measures of COVID-19 threat (e.g., state case rates) showed no associations with IU, and were slightly negatively correlated with psychological distress and perceived threat. Pre-existing mental health symptoms, IU and perceived COVID-19 threat may foster vulnerability to mental health problems during the pandemic, more so than objective threat levels.","Kathryn M Bell et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613E-569-5BE","20210409","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; perceived risk; worry; longitudinal; ptsd; covid-19; intolerance of uncertainty","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12782,""
"The effect of passion for activities on fear of COVID-19 and mental health among the Japanese population","As the pandemic limited our lives, people engaged in their favorite activities; either in alternative ways or while disregarding the restrictions. These major activities and our engagement in these activities of life are considered to have a significant impact on our mental health. Thus, this study aimed to examine the relationship between two types of passion (harmonious passion and obsessive passion), fear of COVID-19 (emotional fear responses, symptomatic expressions of fear), and mental distress. To this end, 322 Japanese participants completed an online questionnaire. The results showed that harmonious passion (HP) was positively related to emotional fear responses and negatively to mental distress. On the other hand, obsessive passion (OP) was positively associated with symptomatic expressions of fear and negatively with mental distress. Symptomatic expressions of fear have a stronger positive relationship with mental distress than emotional fear reactions. This study evidenced that HP is a protective factor against pandemics as it improves mental health while appropriately recognizing fear of COVID-19. Focusing on different types of passion may prove effective in improving mental health amidst the pandemic.","Takahiro Kubo et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46063-DB9-889","20210409","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Motivational Behavior; fear of covid-19; covid-19; passion; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12783,""
"Long-term Labour Market and Economic Consequences of School Exclusions in England: Evidence from Two Counterfactual Approaches","Background. Previous research suggests that school exclusion during childhood is a precursor to social exclusion in adulthood. Past literature on the consequences of school exclusion is, however, scarce and mainly focused on short term outcomes such as educational attainment, delinquency, and mental health in early adolescence. Moreover, this evidence is based primarily on descriptive and correlational analysis, whereas robust causal evidence is required to best inform policy. Aims. We aimed to estimate the mid-to-long-term impact of school exclusion on labour market and economic outcomes. Sample. The sample included 6632 young people who at the age of 25/26 in the year 2015 participated in the Next Steps survey of whom 86 were expelled from school and 711 were suspended between the ages of 13/14 and 16/17. Method. Using high quality existing longitudinal data, we utilised four approaches to evaluate the impact of school exclusion: logistic regression-adjustment models, propensity score matching, school fixed-effects analysis, and inverse propensity weighting. The latter two counterfactual approaches were used to estimate causal effects. Results. We found that school exclusion increased the risk of becoming NEET at the age of 19/20, and then remaining economically inactive at the age of 25/26, as well as experiencing higher unemployment risk and earning lower wages also at the age of 25/26. Conclusion. School exclusion has pervasive negative effects into adulthood. Policy interventions should focus on both prevention and mitigating its negative effects. Interventions aimed at re-integrating excluded individuals into education or vocational training could be key in reducing the risk of poor socio-economic outcomes and social exclusion.","Joan Eliel Madia et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46075-9B5-D72","20210409","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; neet; inverse probability treatment weighting; school exclusion; unemployment; propensity score analysis","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-09","",12784,""
