"Psychosocial Health of School-aged Children  during the Initial COVID-19 Safer-At-Home School Mandates in Florida: A cross-sectional study","Background: Given the emerging literature regarding the impacts of lockdown measures on mental health, this study aims to identify risk factors in school-aged children for being at risk for psychosocial disorders during the COVID-19 Safer-at-Home School mandates in Florida Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in April 2020 (n=280). Bivariate analysis and logistic and muultinomial logistic regression models are used to examine socio-demographic and knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) predictors of anxiety,depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Results: Loss of household income was associated with being at risk for depression[aOR=3.130, 95% CI= (1.41-6.97)], anxiety [aOR=2.531, 95%CI= (1.154-5.551)], and OCD [aOR=2.90, 95%CI= (1.32-6.36)]. Being female was associated with risk for depression [aOR=1.72, 95% CI=(1.02-2.93)], anxiety [aOR=1.75, 95% CI=(1.04-2.97)],and OCD[aOR=1.764, 95%CI= (1.027-3.028)]. Parental practices that are protective against COVID-19 were associated with children being at risk of depression[aOR=1.55, 95% CI= (1.04-2.31)]. Being at a lower school level was risk factor for anxiety and OCD. Conclusions: Efforts to address mental health risk in children, as a result schools should prioritize girls, younger children, and children of families who lose income.Limiting the spread of COVID-19 through school closure may exacerbate the risk of psychosocial disorders in children, thus school administrators should move quickly totarget those at greatest risk.","Sarah Lindley McKune; Daniel E Acosta; Nick Diaz; Kaitlin Brittain; Diana Joyce Beaulieu; Anthony Thomas Maurelli; Eric J.

"Vitamin b12 deficiency in covid-19 recovered patients: Case report","Background: The link between immunity and nourishment is clearly known and special attention is being given to its role in the COVID-19 disease  Vitamin B12 is one of the dietary requirements necessary in the treatment of coronavirus patients  Coronavirus patients often show clinical symptoms, such as fever, cough, respiratory distress syndrome, gastrointestinal infection, and fatigue  It is sensible to suppose that COVID-19 affects cobalamin metabolism, impairs intestinal microbial proliferation, and contributes to symptoms of cobalamin deficiency  Such an assumption is based on the fact that there are signs and symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency that are similar to those of a coronavirus infection  Based on these observations, it can be inferred that treatment with vitamin B12 can be useful in the recovery of COVID-19 patients  Case Report: A 42-year-old healthy female with no chronic illness presented with a 1-week history of pale, weakness and fatigue, cold sensation in the extremities, dizziness and feeling of depression  She was recently diagnosed with mild COVID-19 symptoms but recovered without the need for hospital admission  After recovery, she resumed working but recent symptoms brought her to the doctorâ€™s office  Her laboratory findings revealed low Vitamin B  The attending doctor prescribed intramuscular daily vitamin B ampoules to replace and prevent further deterioration  The doses stopped when acute symptoms reduced, and normal levels were reached  Conclusion: Based on the outcome of the case, recovered COVID-19 patients need to be checked for vitamin B12 deficiency and treated in time to prevent possible deterioration  Â© 2020, Advanced Scientific Research  All rights reserved","Alshammari, E.","https://doi.org/10.31838/ijpr/2021.13.01.094","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: International Journal of Pharmaceutical Research;13(1):482, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Pharmaceutical Research;13(1):482, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-24","",7394,""

rÃ¡pidamente por todo el mundo  Ante este escenario, este estudio tuvo como objetivo identificar el impacto o los efectos de la pandemia de la COVID-19 en la salud de los adolescentes  Se trata de una revisiÃ³n de la literatura del tipo scoping review, valiÃ©ndose de las siguientes bases de datos: Web of Science;CINAHL;PsycINFO;SciELO;PUBCOVID19  El estudio siguiÃ³ las etapas propuestas por el Instituto Joanna Briggs para las scoping reviews, y el planteamiento que orientÃ³ los procedimientos adoptados se construyÃ³ a travÃ©s del acrÃ³nimo PCC (poblaciÃ³n;concepto;contexto)  Se incluyeron 11 artÃ­culos en la revisiÃ³n  ClÃ­nicamente, los adolescentes presentan los mismos sÃ­ntomas de la COVID-19 que los adultos afectados por la enfermedad  Se verificÃ³ que la pandemia y las medidas sanitarias adoptadas para controlar la infecciÃ³n se asocian a problemas de salud mental en adolescentes  EspecÃ­ficamente, los adolescentes han experimentado de forma negativa las medidas de distanciamiento social y cierre de escuelas  Estas medidas tambiÃ©n pueden favorecer la ocurrencia de violencia o comportamientos agresivos en el contexto domÃ©stico  Servicios de salud que atienden a la poblaciÃ³n adolescente necesitaron reorientar las prÃ¡cticas de cuidado, adoptando el modelo virtual en sustituciÃ³n del cuidado presencial, e incluso se necesitaron repensar las investigaciones  Esta scoping review abordÃ³ un tema emergente, en relaciÃ³n con una poblaciÃ³n poco considerada en estudios sobre la COVID-19  Los resultados sugieren que la situaciÃ³n de pandemia puede ser considerada un determinante que afecta diferentes dimensiones de la vida de los adolescentes  Abstract: COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus), emerged in China in December 2019 and spread quickly throughout the world  In this scenario, the current study aimed to identify the impact or effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents&#039;health  This is a scoping literature review based on the following databases: Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SciELO, and PUBCOVID19  The study adopted the stages proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute for scoping reviews, and the question orienting the procedures consisted of the acronym PCC (population;concept;context)  Eleven articles were included in the review  Clinically, adolescents present the same COVID-19 symptoms as adults  The pandemic and the health measures taken to control transmission were found to be associated with mental health problems in adolescents  Specifically, adolescents have a negative experience with social distancing measures and closing of schools  These measures can also favor situations of violence or aggressive behaviors in the home environment  Healthcare services that treat the adolescent population had to reorient their practices, adopting a virtual model to replace face-to-face care, and even research projects involving adolescence had to be rethought  This scoping review addressed an emerging theme in relation to a population that has received little attention in studies on COVID-19  The results suggest that the pandemic can be considered a determinant that affects different dimensions of adolescents&#039;lives","Oliveira, Wanderlei Abadio de, Silva, Jorge Luiz da, Andrade, AndrÃ© Luiz Monezi, Micheli, Denise De, Carlos, Diene Monique, Silva, Marta

descartarse duplicados o estudios no empÃ­ricos  Resultados: La mayorÃ­a se realizaron en China, el tamaÃ±o de la muestra oscilÃ³ entre 20 y 7236 participantes, en su mayorÃ­a adolescentes y adultos, entre 12 a 80 aÃ±os, con muestreo no probabilÃ­stico por conveniencia  La tendencia de los sÃ­ntomas y trastornos mÃ¡s estudiados fueron ansiedad (28%), depresiÃ³n (23%), estrÃ©s (15 3%), trastorno del sueÃ±o-vigilia (9 6%) y trastorno por estrÃ©s postraumÃ¡tico (5 7%), asociados con el consumo de sustancias psicoactivas, bajo rendimiento acadÃ©mico, pÃ©rdida de trabajo, calidad del sueÃ±o, bajo autocuidado y baja percepciÃ³n del estado de salud durante la pandemia  Conclusiones: Los sÃ­ntomas y trastornos de ansiedad, depresiÃ³n y estrÃ©s son los mÃ¡s frecuentes  Algunas limitaciones son la ausencia de mediciÃ³n previa a la pandemia o cuarentena y el uso de muestreo no aleatorio, para hacer generalizaciÃ³n de resultados  Es necesario formular investigaciones de intervenciÃ³n para mitigar el impacto psicolÃ³gico  Los sistemas de salud deben ofrecer programas de prevenciÃ³n y de promociÃ³n de la salud, que consideren factores psicosociales dirigidos a la poblaciÃ³n general, pacientes y

Most were carried out in China, the sample size ranged between 20 and 7236 participants, mostly adolescents and adults, between 12 and 80 years old, with non-probability sampling for convenience  The most studied symptoms and disorders were anxiety (28%), depression (23%), stress (15 3%), sleep-wake disorder (9 6%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (5 7%), associated with psychoactive substance use, low academic performance, job loss, sleep quality, low self-care, and low perception of health status during the pandemic  Conclusions: The symptoms and disorders of anxiety, depression, and stress are the most frequent  Some limitations are the absence of pre-pandemic or quarantine measurement and the use of non-random sampling to generalize the results  Intervention research needs to be formulated to mitigate the psychological impact  Health systems must offer prevention and health promotion programs that consider psychosocial factors aimed at the general population, patients, and

"Associations of Mental Health and Personal Preventive Measure Compliance With Exposure to COVID-19 Information During Work Resumption Following the COVID-19 Outbreak in China: Cross-Sectional Survey Study","BACKGROUND: Risk and crisis communication plays an essential role in public health emergency responses. The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered spontaneous and intensive media attention, which has affected people's adoption of personal preventive measures and their mental health. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between exposure to COVID-19-specific information and mental health (depression and sleep quality) and self-reported compliance with personal preventive measures (face mask wearing and hand sanitizing). We also tested whether these associations were moderated by thoughtful consideration of the veracity of the information to which people were exposed. METHODS: A cross-sectional, closed web-based survey was conducted among a sample of 3035 factory workers at the beginning of work resumption following the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen, China. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used for recruitment. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used for the analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of probable moderate-to-severe depression was 170/3035 (5.6%), while that of good or excellent sleep quality was 2110/3035 (69.5%). The prevalence of self-reported consistent face mask wearing in public places was 2903/3035 (95.7%), while that of sanitizing hands every time after returning from public spaces or touching public installations was 2151/3035 (70.9%). Of the 3035 respondents, 1013 to 1638 (33.3% to 54.0%) reported >1 hour of daily exposure to COVID-19-specific information through web-based media and television. After controlling for significant background variables, higher information exposure via television and via newspapers and magazines was associated with better sleep quality and higher compliance with hand sanitizing. Higher exposure via unofficial web-based media was associated with higher compliance with hand sanitizing but was also associated with higher depressive symptoms. In contrast, higher exposure through face-to-face communication was associated with higher depressive symptoms, worse sleep quality, and lower compliance with hand sanitizing. Exposure to information about positive outcomes for patients with COVID-19, development of vaccines and effective treatments, and heroic stories about frontline health care workers were associated with both better mental health and higher compliance with preventive measures. Higher overall information exposure was associated with higher depressive symptoms among participants who were less likely to carefully consider the veracity of the information to which they were exposed; it was also associated with better sleep quality among people who reported more thoughtful consideration of information veracity. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence of how the amount, sources, and contents of information to which people were exposed influenced their mental health and compliance with personal preventive measures at the initial phase of work resumption in China. Thoughtful consideration of information quality was found to play an important moderating role. Our findings may inform strategic risk communication by government and public health authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pan, Yihang; Xin, Meiqi; Zhang, Changhua; Dong, Willa; Fang, Yuan; Wu, Wenhui; Li, Mingzhe; Pang, Jun; Zheng, Zilong; Wang, Zixin; Yuan, Jinqiu; He, Yulong","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/22596","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(10): e22596, 2020 10 08.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(10): e22596, 2020 10 08.; Coronavirus Infections/prevention & control; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Hand Disinfection; Health Risk Behaviors; Mental Health/statistics & numerical data; Pandemics/prevention & control; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention & control; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Surveys and Questionnaires; Adolescent; Adult; Betacoronavirus; China/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression/epidemiology; Depression/psychology; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Male; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Self Report; Treatment Adherence and Compliance/psychology; Treatment Adherence and Compliance/statistics & numerical data; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-24","",7435,""

"Use of Thin Dressings Under N95 Respirators: Exploring Their Effect on Quantitative Fit Testing Results to Guide Hospital Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic","At the beginning of the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic, health care staff at a level 1 trauma center in the state of New York experienced facial irritation and skin breakdown under their N95 respirators due to increased and prolonged use. PURPOSE: Members of the Certified Wound and Ostomy Nurse, Nurse Practitioners staff were charged with developing recommendations within 48 hours to help prevent and manage facial skin issues using available products that would not compromise the seal of the respirators. METHOD: With the assistance of a health care safety specialist from the Environmental Health and Safety Department of the hospital, an ambient particle counting device was used to measure the N95 fit factor following application of a liquid skin barrier, transparent film dressing, light silicone-based adhesive dressing, or an extra-thin hydrocolloid dressing on the bridge of the nose and the cheekbones underneath an N95 respirator of 2 hospital staff members who volunteered to test the dressings. RESULTS: All thin dressings tested showed a fit factor over 100, reflecting an effective seal. The highest fit factors were seen with the liquid skin barrier in the 2 volunteers (200 and 198, respectively). Thin dressing usage information was included in the hospital guidelines for N95 respirators and shared with staff. Subsequent feedback suggests that the light silicone-based adhesive dressing and the extra-thin hydrocolloid dressing were preferred. CONCLUSION: Thin dressing use may help reduce skin complications among hospital staff during periods of extended N95 respirator wear time. Because use of the dressings did not result in failure of the quantitative fit test, they were permitted for use by health care staff under their N95 respirators. Studies are needed to help health care facilities optimize N95 respirator use to protect staff from coronavirus disease-19 and respirator-related skin complications while supply shortages remain.","Guschel, Susan; Chmiel, Karen; Rosenstein, Jennifer","https://www.google.com/search?q=Use+of+Thin+Dressings+Under+N95+Respirators:+Exploring+Their+Effect+on+Quantitative+Fit+Testing+Results+to+Guide+Hospital+Practice+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic.","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Wound Manag Prev;66(11): 13-17, 2020 Nov.; Publication details: Wound Manag Prev;66(11): 13-17, 2020 Nov.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-24","",7437,""
"Clinical characteristics and online mental health care of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019","Comparing to data in patients with severe coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19), there are few studies on the prevalence anxiety and/or depression in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19. We investigated the clinical characteristics and the prevalence of anxiety and/or depression among asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and monitored their mental health using an online assessment. An online survey for monitoring and assessing the mental health of patients with COVID-19 using a mobile phone was conducted. We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to measure anxiety and/or depression levels. Of the 234 patients, 66 patients were asymptomatic (28.2%), while the remaining 168 patients were mildly symptomatic. The prevalence of anosmia (p = 0.001) and ageusia (p = 0.008) significantly decreased with the increasing age. In addition, 19.8% and 14.0% patients had anxiety and/or depression in the first survey, and one week after the first survey, respectively. Compared to patients without anxiety and/or depression, those with anxiety and/or depression had a longer quarantine duration. We found that anomia and ageusia were relatively common in the young age group. Furthermore, one-fifth asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with COVID-19 had anxiety and/or depression.","Jeong, Chung, Sohn, Hyun, Baek, Cho, Kim, Ahn, Choi, Yeom","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242130","20201123","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-24","",7438,""
"Assessment of 135Ã¢â‚¬Â¯794 Pediatric Patients Tested for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Across the United States","There is limited information on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing and infection among pediatric patients across the United States. To describe testing for SARS-CoV-2 and the epidemiology of infected patients. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic health record data from 135Ã¢â‚¬Â¯794 patients younger than 25 years who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 from January 1 through September 8, 2020. Data were from PEDSnet, a network of 7 US pediatric health systems, comprising 6.5 million patients primarily from 11 states. Data analysis was performed from September 8 to 24, 2020. Testing for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness. A total of 135Ã¢â‚¬Â¯794 pediatric patients (53% male; mean [SD] age, 8.8 [6.7] years; 3% Asian patients, 15% Black patients, 11% Hispanic patients, and 59% White patients; 290 per 10Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 population [range, 155-395 per 10Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 population across health systems]) were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 5374 (4%) were infected with the virus (12 per 10Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 population [range, 7-16 per 10Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 population]). Compared with White patients, those of Black, Hispanic, and Asian race/ethnicity had lower rates of testing (Black: odds ratio [OR], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.68-0.72]; Hispanic: OR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.63-0.67]; Asian: OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.57-0.63]); however, they were significantly more likely to have positive test results (Black: OR, 2.66 [95% CI, 2.43-2.90]; Hispanic: OR, 3.75 [95% CI, 3.39-4.15]; Asian: OR, 2.04 [95% CI, 1.69-2.48]). Older age (5-11 years: OR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.13-1.38]; 12-17 years: OR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.73-2.12]; 18-24 years: OR, 3.51 [95% CI, 3.11-3.97]), public payer (OR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.31-1.57]), outpatient testing (OR, 2.13 [1.86-2.44]), and emergency department testing (OR, 3.16 [95% CI, 2.72-3.67]) were also associated with increased risk of infection. In univariate analyses, nonmalignant chronic disease was associated with lower likelihood of testing, and preexisting respiratory conditions were associated with lower risk of positive test results (standardized ratio [SR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.73-0.84]). However, several other diagnosis groups were associated with a higher risk of positive test results: malignant disorders (SR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.19-1.93]), cardiac disorders (SR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.05-1.32]), endocrinologic disorders (SR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.31-1.75]), gastrointestinal disorders (SR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.04-1.38]), genetic disorders (SR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.00-1.40]), hematologic disorders (SR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.06-1.47]), musculoskeletal disorders (SR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.07-1.30]), mental health disorders (SR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.10-1.30]), and metabolic disorders (SR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.24-1.61]). Among the 5374 patients with positive test results, 359 (7%) were hospitalized for respiratory, hypotensive, or COVID-19-specific illness. Of these, 99 (28%) required intensive care unit services, and 33 (9%) required mechanical ventilation. The case fatality rate was 0.2% (8 of 5374). The number of patients with a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease in early 2020 was 40% lower (259 vs 433 and 430) than in 2018 or 2019. In this large cohort study of US pediatric patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were low, and clinical manifestations were typically mild.

"Mental wellbeing in the German old age population largely unaltered during COVID-19 lockdown: results of a representative survey","Older individuals are at increased risk of a severe and lethal course of COVID-19. They have typically been advised to practice particularly restrictive social distancing ('cocooning'), which has sparked much debate on the consequences for their mental wellbeing. We aimed to provide evidence by conducting a representative survey among the German old population during COVID-19 lockdown. A computer-assisted standardized telephone interview was conducted in a randomly selected and representative sample of the German old age population (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1005; ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°65Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) during the firstÃ‚Â lockdown in April 2020. Assessments included sociodemographic factors, aspects of the personal life situation during lockdown, attitudes towards COVID-19, and standardized screening measures on depression, anxiety, somatization, overall psychological distress (Brief Symptom Inventory/BSI-18) and loneliness (UCLA 3-item loneliness scale). Sampling-weighted descriptive statistics and multiple multivariable regression analyses were conducted. Participants were MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°75.5 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.1) years old; 56.3% were women. At data collection, COVID-19 lockdown had been in force for MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°28.0 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.8) days. Overall, older individuals were worried about COVID-19, but supportive of the lockdown. Mean BSI-18 scores were 1.4 for depression, 1.6 for anxiety and 2.2 for somatization as well as 5.1 for global psychological distress. These figures did not indicate worse mental wellbeing, given normative values established by studies before the pandemic (2.0, 1.6, 2.4, 6.0, respectively). The prevalence of loneliness was 13.1%, which also fell within a range of estimates reported by studies before the pandemic. There were only few significant associations of aspects of the personal life situation during lockdown and attitudes towards COVID-19 with mental wellbeing. Resilience explained a large amount of variance. In the short-term, the mental wellbeing of the German old age population was largely unaltered during COVID-19 lockdown, suggesting resilience against the challenging pandemic situation. Our results refute common ageist stereotypes of &quot;the weak and vulnerable older adults&quot; that were present during the pandemic. Long-term observations are needed to provide robust evidence.","RÃƒÂ¶hr, Reininghaus, Riedel-Heller","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-020-01889-x","20201123","COVID-19 lockdown; COVID-19 pandemic; Epidemiology; Mental health; Mental wellbeing; Old age; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-24","",7440,""

"The Psychological Symptoms of Patients with Mild Symptoms of Coronavirus Disease (2019) in China: A Cross-sectional Study","To determine psychological symptoms of patients with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 in China and to explore the influencing factors. A cross-sectional study. A convenience sample of 296 mild coronavirus disease 2019 patients were recruited from a Fangcang hospital in Wuhan, Hubei Province, from 3<sup>rd</sup> March to 5<sup>th</sup> March, 2020. Participants were assessed using a sociodemographic and clinical characteristics questionnaire, and Symptom Check List 90. The binary logistic regression was utilized to explore the influencing factors of psychological symptoms of patients with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019. In total, 296 of 299 patients with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 participated in the study (response rate: 99.0%). The findings revealed that 12.8% patients with mild symptoms have mental-health problems; the most common psychological symptoms are phobic anxiety (58.4%), paranoid ideation (50.7%), and psychoticism (40.2%). Female patients [OR=3.587, 95%CI (1.694-7.598)] and those having physical symptoms currently [OR =2.813, 95%CI (1.210-6.539)] are at higher risk, while those in the middle duration of hospitalization [OR =0.278, 95% CI (0.121-0.639)] protect against mental-health problems. The minority of patients with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 were still suffering from psychological symptoms. Health-care providers are recommended to pay particular attention to screening these high-risk groups (females, those in the initial stages of hospitalization and those with physical symptoms currently) and implement targeted psychological care as required. This study found that most patients of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Fangcang hospital exhibited normal mental-health at par with the general Chinese norm and the minority of them were suffering from psychological symptoms. The findings can provide a reference for health-care providers to screen high-risk psychological symptoms groups and implement targeted psychological intervention for patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019.","Li, Yang, Zhang, Wang, Wang, Dong, Wang, Wei, Li, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14701","20201123","COVID-19; China; Coronavirus Disease 2019; mental-health condition; patient; psychological symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-24","",7442,""
"Sustaining a national surgical training programme during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all segments of daily life, with the healthcare sector being at the forefront of this upheaval. Unprecedented efforts have been taken worldwide to curb this ongoing global catastrophe that has already resulted in many fatalities. One of the areas that has received little attention amid this turmoil is the disruption to trainee education, particularly in specialties that involve acquisition of procedural skills. Hand surgery in Singapore is a standalone combined programme that relies heavily on dedicated cross-hospital rotations, an extensive didactic curriculum and supervised hands-on training of increasing complexity. All aspects of this training programme have been affected because of the cancellation of elective surgical procedures, suspension of cross-hospital rotations, redeployment of residents, and an unsustainable duty roster. There is a real concern that trainees will not be able to meet their training requirements and suffer serious issues like burnout and depression. The long-term impact of suspending training indefinitely is a severe disruption of essential medical services. This article examines the impact of a global pandemic on trainee education in a demanding surgical speciality. We have outlined strategies to maintain trainee competencies based on the following considerations: 1) the safety and wellbeing of trainees is paramount; 2) resource utilization must be thoroughly rationalized; 3) technology and innovative learning methods must supplant traditional teaching methods; and 4) the changes implemented must be sustainable. We hope that these lessons will be valuable to other training programs struggling to deliver quality education to their trainees, even as we work together to battle this global catastrophe.","Das De, Puhaindran, Sechachalam, Wong, Chong, Chin","https://doi.org/10.1302/2633-1462.15.BJO-2020-0019","20201123","Core competencies; Covid-19; Hand Surgery; Resident education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-24","",7443,""

Prospective case-control. Academic institute. Adult patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 were prospectively enrolled and separated into positive and negative groups. Each participant completed 4 validated patient-reported outcome measures. The UPSIT (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test) was distributed to patients who were SARS-CoV-2 positive.

"Long-Term Non-invasive Ventilation in Children: Current Use, Indications, and Contraindications","This review focuses on the delivery of non-invasive ventilation-i.e., intermittent positive-pressure ventilation-in children lasting more than 3 months. Several recent reviews have brought to light a dramatic escalation in the use of long-term non-invasive ventilation in children over the last 30 years. This is due both to the growing number of children receiving care for complex and severe diseases necessitating respiratory support and to the availability of LT-NIV equipment that can be used at home. While significant gaps in availability persist for smaller children and especially infants, home LT-NIV for children with chronic respiratory insufficiency has improved their quality of life and decreased the overall cost of care. While long-term NIV is usually delivered during sleep, it can also be delivered 24 h a day in selected patients. Close collaboration between the hospital complex-care team, the home LT-NIV program, and family caregivers is of the utmost importance for successful home LT-NIV. Long-term NIV is indicated for respiratory disorders responsible for chronic alveolar hypoventilation, with the aim to increase life expectancy and maximize quality of life. LT-NIV is considered for conditions that affect respiratory-muscle performance (alterations in central respiratory drive or neuromuscular function) and/or impose an excessive respiratory load (airway obstruction, lung disease, or chest-wall anomalies). Relative contraindications for LT-NIV include the inability of the local medical infrastructure to support home LT-NIV and poor motivation or inability of the patient/caregivers to cooperate or understand recommendations. Anatomic abnormalities that interfere with interface fitting, inability to protect the lower airways due to excessive airway secretions and/or severely impaired swallowing, or failure of LT-NIV to support respiration can lead to considering invasive ventilation via tracheostomy. Of note, providing home LT-NIV during the COVID 19 pandemic has become more challenging. This is due both to the disruption of medical systems and the fear of contaminating care providers and family with aerosols generated by a patient positive for SARS-CoV-2 during NIV. Delay in initiating LT-NIV, decreased frequency of home visits by the home ventilation program, and decreased availability of polysomnography and oximetry/transcutaneous PCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring are observed. Teleconsultations and telemonitoring are being developed to mitigate these challenges.","Praud","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2020.584334","20201123","COVID-19; chronic respiratory failure; home ventilation; mouthpiece ventilation; neuromuscular disorders; non-invasive ventilation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-24","",7445,""
"Mantram Repetition as a Portable Mindfulness Practice: Applications During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Mantram or holy name repetition has long been practiced in every major religious tradition. Repetition of a mantram as a mindfulness practice is helpful for stress management and resilience building. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of the key features of mantram and the Mantram Repetition Program (MRP) developed in the US Veterans Healthcare System, the evidence base for the MRP, and its applications. MRP practices are portable and do not require an extended or regularized period of sitting, in contrast to most methods of meditation. Core functions of MRP practices include focus shifting, frame activation, and fostering of mindfulness. We review scientific research, including multiple randomized trials, that has investigated the MRP. Research on the MRP has documented reductions in posttraumatic stress symptoms, insomnia, hyperarousal, and depression, as well as enhancement of quality of life, self-efficacy, and mindfulness. Mantram repetition may possess comparative advantages for managing symptoms of various mental health conditions, including posttraumatic stress disorder, HIV/AIDS, cancer, and chronic diseases. MRP practices can be integrated into daily routines to manage stress and improve coping, safety, efficacy, calmness, and resilience. The inclusion of mantram repetition alongside conventional mindfulness-based practices for stress management will improve their cultural and religious inclusiveness, enabling societies and organizations to build greater collective resilience. Mantram repetition can be readily used in the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on healthcare workers, patients, and the public.","Oman, Bormann, Kane","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-020-01545-w","20201123","COVID-19; Diversity; Mantra; Resilience; Spirituality; Stress management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-24","",7446,""
"Forecasting of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in India using SIR model, flatten curve and herd immunity","In this paper, we are presenting an epidemiological model for exploring the transmission of outbreaks caused by viral infections. Mathematics and statistics are still at the cutting edge of technology where scientific experts, health facilities, and government deal with infection and disease transmission issues. The model has implicitly applied to COVID-19, a transmittable disease by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SIR model (Susceptible-Infection-Recovered) used as a context for examining the nature of the pandemic. Though, some of the mathematical model assumptions have been improved evaluation of the contamination-free from excessive predictions. The objective of this study is to provide a simple but effective explanatory model for the prediction of the future development of infection and for checking the effectiveness of containment and lock-down. We proposed a SIR model with a flattening curve and herd immunity based on a susceptible population that grows over time and difference in mortality and birth rates. It illustrates how a disease behaves over time, taking variables such as the number of sensitive individuals in the community and the number of those who are immune. It accurately model the disease and their lessons on the importance of immunization and herd immunity. The outcomes obtained from the simulation of the COVID-19 outbreak in India make it possible to formulate projections and forecasts for the future epidemic progress circumstance in India.","Venkatasen, Mathivanan, Jayagopal, Mani, Rajendran, Subramaniam, Ramalingam, Rajasekaran, Indirajithu, Sorakaya Somanathan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-020-02641-4","20201123","COVID-19; Flatten-curve; Herd immunity; Outbreaks; SIR model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-24","",7447,""
"Fear of COVID-19, Stress, and Anxiety in University Undergraduate Students: A Predictive Model for Depression","Depression is a disabling illness which increases the risk of suicide. The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a rise in fear, anxiety, stress, and depression among the population: of these, university undergraduates from countries severely affected by COVID-19 are some of the most vulnerable of all, as they face strict lockdown measures and have fewer resources to cope with it. The aim of this study was to analyze the levels of fear of COVID-19, stress, anxiety, and depression during lockdown among undergraduates from Ecuador, and to test these possible predictors of depression using a model taken from our study of the scientific literature. A total of 640 undergraduates (72% women) between 18 and 47 years old (<i>M</i> = 21.69; <i>S.D</i> = 4.093) were surveyed. The resulting mean levels found for stress, anxiety, and depression were above levels considered non-pathological. Women showed higher levels of fear of COVID-19 than men. The statistical prediction for depression showed a good fit. This depression could be related: both directly and positively by fear of COVID-19 and stress, and indirectly, as a result of these two factors, positively mediated by anxiety. Our study concludes by highlighting the important role that the complex relationships between fear, stress, and anxiety can play in the development of depression symptoms and how they can be taken into account in programs aimed at preventing and alleviating this disorder. We propose some general measures for reducing fear of COVID-19 and stress and suggest that specific programs be designed to control and overcome anxiety among undergraduates.","RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Hidalgo, PantaleÃƒÂ³n, Dios, Falla","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.591797","20201123","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; fear; stress; undergraduate students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-24","",7448,""
"Availability of psychological support for medical students in Poland","Medical students suffer from a considerable level of stress, which can result in the deterioration of their mental health, including depression or suicidal ideation. They are afraid to seek help due to stigmatization and environmental ostracism. The goal of the study is to analyze the psychological support and stress management programs for students supported by medical schools in Poland. The authors sent out e-mails with 9 questions regarding the issue being analyzed to all 19 medical schools in Poland. They obtained answers from 15 such schools, which corresponds to a response rate of 79%. The study was conducted in 2018-2019, before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Due to the lack of central regulations, support is provided by medical schools individually. Those solutions focus on short-term, temporary therapy. If a longer therapy is needed, students are redirected to external health providers. Moreover, information about the support is not transferred by student-friendly communication channels. Support should be flexible, and it should quickly adapt to the emerging trends and consider students' feedback. A future model of psychological support could be a center organized as a transfer point between a university problem-solving facility and external health providers, concentrating on short-term activity. Quick support would eliminate potential complications and more serious mental problems.","Walkiewicz, Guziak","https://doi.org/10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01539","20201123","medical education; medical students; mental health; preventive programs; psychological distress; support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-24","",7449,""
"Virtual reality for behavioral health workforce development in the era of COVID-19","The coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic emerged at a time of substantial investment in the United States substance use service infrastructure. A key component of this fiscal investment was funding for training and technical assistance (TA) from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to newly configured Technology Transfer Centers (TTCs), including the Addiction TTCs (ATTC Network), Prevention TTCs (PTTC Network), and the Mental Health TTCs (MHTTC Network). SAMHSA charges TTCs with building the capacity of the behavioral health workforce to provide evidence-based interventions via locally and culturally responsive training and TA. This commentary describes how, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, TTCs rapidly adapted to ensure that the behavioral health workforce had continuous access to remote training and technical assistance. TTCs use a conceptual framework that differentiates among three types of technical assistance: basic, targeted, and intensive. We define each of these types of TA and provide case examples to describe novel strategies that the TTCs used to shift an entire continuum of capacity building activities to remote platforms. Examples of innovations include online listening sessions, virtual process walkthroughs, and remote &quot;live&quot; supervision. Ongoing evaluation is needed to determine whether virtual TA delivery is as effective as face-to-face delivery or whether a mix of virtual and face-to-face delivery is optimal. The TTCs will need to carefully balance the benefits and challenges associated with rapid virtualization of TA services to design the ideal hybrid delivery model following the pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108157","20201123","Behavioral health; COVID-19; Technology Transfer Centers; Workforce development","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-24","",7450,""
