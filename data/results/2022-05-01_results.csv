"Social isolation, loneliness and mental health sequelae of the Covid-19 pandemic in Parkinson's disease","People living with Parkinson Disease (PwP) have been at risk for the negative effects of loneliness even before the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Despite some similarities with previous outbreaks, the Covid-19 pandemic is significantly more wide-spread, long-lasting, and deadly, which likely means demonstrably more negative mental health issues. Although PwP are not any more likely to contract Covid-19 than those without, the indirect negative sequelae of isolation, loneliness, mental health issues, and worsening motor and non-motor features remains to be fully realized. Loneliness is not an isolated problem;the preliminary evidence indicates that loneliness associated with the Covid-19 restrictions has dramatically increased in nearly all countries around the world.","McDaniels, Bradley, Subramanian, Indu","https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.irn.2022.03.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Review of Neurobiology;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30787,""
"Behavior changes and functional capacity Physical, social, and dietary behavioral changes during the COVID-19 crisis and their effects on functional capacity in older adults","Background: This two-year follow-up study aimed to identify factors associated with unhealthy behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine their impact on functional capacity in older adults. Methods: Altogether, 536 adults aged =65 years participated in this study. The frequency of going out, exercise habits, face-to-face and non-face-to-face interactions, social participation, and eating habits were examined as behavioral factors before and after the first declaration of a state of emergency in Japan. Functional capacity was assessed using the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence. Results: Using latent class analysis considering changes in the six behaviors, the participants were divided into healthy (n=289) and unhealthy (nÂ =Â 247) behavior groups. The male sex was associated with 2.36 times higher odds, diabetes with 2.19 times higher odds, depressive mood with 1.83 times higher odds, poor subjective economic status with 2.62 times higher odds, and living alone with 44% lower odds of being unhealthy. The unhealthy behavior group showed significantly decreased functional capacity (B =-1.56 [-1.98, -1.14]) than the healthy behavior group. For each behavior, negative changes in going out (B =-0.99 [-1.60, -0.37]), face-to-face interaction (B =-0.65 [-1.16, -0.13]), and non-face-to-face interactions (B =-0.80 [-1.36, -0.25]) were associated with a decline in functional capacity. Conclusions: Our results showed four factors associated with engaging in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and how behavioral changes affect functional capacity decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, which will help to develop public health approaches","Abe, Takumi, Nofuji, Yu, Seino, Satoshi, Hata, Toshiki, Narita, Miki, Yokoyama, Yuri, Amano, Hidenori, Kitamura, Akihiko, Shinkai, Shoji, Fujiwara, Yoshinori","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archger.2022.104708","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics;: 104708, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30788,""
"NATIONAL MULTICENTRIC STUDY ON THE INCIDENCE OF ALCOHOL BURNS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Background Burns are traumatic wounds that occur when skin is exposed to an amount of energy greater than its maximum dissipation capacity. Alcohol, because it fuels flames and its vapor can cause an explosion, is one of the most common causal agents of burns in Brazil. In late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sudden and substantial increase in the use of 70% alcohol (w/v) for antisepsis. Objectives To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of alcohol burns during the COVID-19 pandemic in participating Burn Treatment Centers, as well as the severity and treatment of these burns. Method Descriptive, cross-sectional, quantitative and retrospective study based on data obtained from medical records of patients treated in participating Burn Treatment Centers. Data collection included origin, gender, education level, occupation, circumstance of the accident, wound depth and type of treatment. Results Of eight participating centers, the Hospital da RestauraÃ§Ã£o Gov. Paulo Guerra Burn Treatment Center experienced the highest number of alcohol burn patients (38.4%) and male gender accounted for 53.6% of all cases. Predominant occupations were those that involve domestic activities (29%) and 48.6% of patients had not completed elementary school. The most common cause was an accident during cooking (35.5%) followed by suicide attempt (18.3%). More than half (58.6%) of the patients had concomitant second and third degree burns and wound treatment of choice was surgical (43.1%). Conclusions The predominant population in this study was male, had a lower level of education, resided in the northeast region and had an occupation carried out in a domestic environment. The latter may reflect the population's longer stay at home due to social constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. There were a large number of second and third degree burns and, as a consequence, a high number of cases in which surgical treatment was required.","Kobarg, Bianca Sandi, Guanilo, Maria Elena EchevarrÃ­a, Bernard, Gustavo Peressoni, Barreto, Marcos Guilherme Praxedes, Vana, Luiz Philipe Molina, de Oliveira Junior, Joir Lima, de AraÃºjo, Kelly Danielle, de Lauro Machado Homem, Ricardo, Marlene, Elaine, de Arruda, Fabiano Calixto Fortes, Filho, Alfredo Gragnani","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.burns.2022.04.005","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Burns;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30789,""
"The stress and resilience town hall: A systems response to support the health workforce during COVID-19 and beyond","Objective The COVID-19 pandemic is a traumatic stressor resulting in anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and burnout among healthcare workers. We describe an intervention to support the health workforce and summarize results from its 40-week implementation in a large, tri-state health system during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method We conducted 121 virtual and interactive Stress and Resilience Town Halls attended by 3555 healthcare workers. Town hall participants generated 1627 stressors and resilience strategies that we coded and analyzed using rigorous qualitative methods (KappaÂ =Â 0.85). Results We identify six types of stressors and eight types of resilience strategies reported by healthcare workers, how these changed over time, and how town halls were responsive to emerging health workforce needs. We show that town halls dedicated to groups working together yielded 84% higher mean attendance and more sharing of stressors and resilience strategies than those offered generally across the health system, and that specific stressors and strategies are reported consistently while others vary markedly over time. Conclusions The virtual and interactive Stress and Resilience Town Hall is an accessible, scalable, and sustainable intervention to build mutual support, wellness, and resilience among healthcare workers and within hospitals and health systems responding to emerging crises, pandemics, and disasters.","Tebes, Jacob K.; Awad, Michael N.; Connors, Elizabeth H.; Fineberg, Sarah K.; Gordon, Derrick M.; Jordan, Ayana, Kravitz, Richard, Li, Luming, Ponce, Allison N.; Prabhu, Maya, Rubman, Susan, Silva, Michelle A.; Steinfeld, Matthew, Tate, David C.; Xu, Ke, Krystal, John H.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2022.04.009","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: General Hospital Psychiatry;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30790,""

"Persuading republicans and democrats to comply with mask wearing: An intervention tournament","Many people practiced COVID-19-related safety measures in the first year of the pandemic, but Republicans were less likely to engage in behaviors such as wearing masks or face coverings than Democrats, suggesting radical disparities in health practices split along political fault lines. We developed an â€œintervention tournamentâ€ which aimed to identify the framings that would promote mask wearing among a representative sample of Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. from Oct 14, 2020, to Jan 14, 2021 (NÂ =Â 4931). Seven different conditions reflecting different moral values and factors specific to COVID-19â€”including protection from harm (self), protection from harm (community), patriotic duty, purity, reviving the economy, threat, and scientific evidenceâ€”were implemented to identify which framings would â€œwinâ€ in terms of promoting mask wearing compared to a baseline condition. We found that Republicans had significantly more negative attitudes toward masks, lower intentions to wear them, and were less likely to sign or share pledges on social media than Democrats, which was partially mediated by Republicans, compared to Democrats, perceiving that the threat of COVID-19 was lower. None of our framing conditions significantly affected Republicans' or Democrats' attitudes, intentions, or behaviors compared to the baseline condition, illustrating the difficulty in overcoming the strength of political polarization during COVID-19.","Gelfand, Michele, Li, Ren, Stamkou, Eftychia, Pieper, Dylan, Denison, Emmy, Fernandez, Jessica, Choi, Virginia, Chatman, Jennifer, Jackson, Joshua, Dimant, Eugen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2022.104299","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Experimental Social Psychology; 101:104299, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30792,""
"Loneliness is not a homogeneous experience: An empirical analysis of adaptive and maladaptive forms of loneliness in the UK","Understanding loneliness is pivotal to informing related evidence-based preventive interventions. The present study examined the prevalence of loneliness in the UK, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the association between loneliness, mental health outcomes, and risk and protective factors for loneliness, after controlling for the effects of social isolation. It was estimated that 18.1% of the population in our study experienced moderately high to very high loneliness. We also found that loneliness was positively associated with self-disgust and social inhibition, and negatively associated with trait optimism and hope. Cluster analysis showed that two distinct groups emerged among those experiencing higher levels of loneliness: â€œadaptiveâ€ and â€œmaladaptiveâ€ loneliness groups. The maladaptive loneliness group displayed psychological characteristics like self-disgust and social inhibition including symptoms of depression and anxiety that can potentially undermine their ability to connect with others and form meaningful social relationships. These findings suggest that not all people experience loneliness in the same way. It is possible that a one-size-fit-all approach may be less effective because it does not take into account that people classified as ""lonely"" may display differential psychological profiles and characteristics relevant to their capacity to connect with others.","Ypsilanti, Antonia, Lazuras, Lambros","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114571","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114571, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30793,""
"Comparison of safety and health risk perceptions toward COVID-19 pandemic based on gender in Korean University students' work while studying","Background This study aims to identify the safety and health risk perceptions toward the COVID-19 pandemic based on gender in Korean university students who work and study during the pandemic. Methods A nationwide convenient sampling method was implemented to eliminate any regional characteristics in 757 university students, including those who studied while working. The participants answered the online questionnaire for one week. The collected data were analyzed using the R version 3.4.1 program. Results The results of comparing the safety and health risk perceptions toward COVID-19 based on the gender of the subjects who work while studying, â€œI often use the Internet to obtain information on COVID-19 infection controlâ€ are females appeared to use the internet more often (t=-2.18, p=0.031) compared to males. â€œCompared to pre-COVID-19, I am currently feeling safe after the outbreakâ€ is females felt less safe (t=3.43, p&lt;0.001). Although COVID-19 infection control awareness is high among Korean university students and officials, males reported higher scores over females in all the questions, which was statistically significant. Conclusion There should be prioritized psychological measures for prevention against COVID-19 for vulnerable groups with high mental health risks. A network must be established to protect the mental health of such groups, and candidates who require intervention must be actively identified and supported. Therefore, there must be efforts to deliver accurate information based on scientific evidence of the infectious disease, and the actions should be supported through such active communication.","Kim, Sang Hee, Park, Min Soo, Tae-Gu, K.

"Bereavement & mental health: The generational consequences of a grandparent's death","The COVID-19 pandemic has left millions of children and adolescents grieving the sudden death of a grandparent. Yet, we lack knowledge of the mental health implications of a grandparent's death for youth. This study uses longitudinal data to examine if the loss of a grandparent increases adolescent grandchildren's likelihood of experiencing their mothers' major depressive disorder, and of having depressive symptoms themselves. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a population-based cohort study of children born in 20 U.S. cities between 1998 and 2000, we estimate associations between the death of a maternal grandparent in mid-childhood and adolescents', and their mothers', depressive outcomes when the adolescent is roughly age 15 (in 2014â€“17), net of a robust set of covariates, including pre-bereavement depression. Adjusted regression models show no elevated depression risk associated with a grandfather's deathâ€”neither for adolescents nor their mothers. A grandmother's death within the previous seven years is associated with a higher likelihood of adolescents having a depressed mother compared to both non-bereaved adolescents (odds ratio (OR)Â =Â 2.42;95% confidence interval (CI)Â =Â 1.17, 5.01) and those whose grandmother died more than seven years ago (ORÂ =Â 3.78;95% CIÂ =Â 1.54, 9.31). Furthermore, adolescent boys have a 50% increase in their depressive symptoms following a grandmother's death relative to their non-bereaved peersâ€”an increase that operates independently from the influence of the death on their mother. Together, the results show the death of a grandmother is an underappreciated, persistent risk factor for adolescents experiencing maternal major depressive disorder, and for adolescent boys experiencing depressive symptoms personally.","Livings, Michelle, Smith-Greenaway, Emily, Margolis, Rachel, Verdery, Ashton","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2022.100100","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: SSM - Mental Health;: 100100, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30795,""
"Exploring the influence of telehealth on patient engagement with a multidisciplinary Non-Epileptic Seizure (NES) Clinic during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The ILAE task force has identified a gap in treatment access for patient with non-epileptic seizures (NES).[1] Access to multidisciplinary treatment clinics for adults with NES is limited with only 18 institutions delivering care across the United States. [2] Patient engagement has been low in the University of Colorado, NES Clinic treatment program despite our clinicâ€™s status as the only clinic of its kind in the mountain west. We analyzed patient factors of those who engaged in treatment before and after COVID-19 regulations were imposed and found a 23.6% increase in treatment engagement using telehealth. Those who engaged using telehealth were more likely to be of white race, of non-Hispanic ethnicity, publicly insured, employed, have a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of zero, a daily seizure rate of 0-1, did not have suicidal ideation or attempts, and live greater than 25 miles from the NES clinic. Delivering NES treatment via telehealth reduced the logistical and psychological barriers to initiating recovery and with a severe lack of accessible treatments for patients with NES, barrier reduction is necessary. This study describes patient factors that result in higher engagement with NES treatment using telehealth and emphasizes the importance of telehealth utilization to improve access to available treatment.","Watson, Meagan, Borland, Holly, Baker, Sarah, Sillau, Stefan, Armon, Carl, Strom, Laura","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2022.108707","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Epilepsy & Behavior;: 108707, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30796,""
"First-onset major depression during the COVID-19 pandemic: A predictive machine learning model","This study longitudinally evaluated first-onset major depression rates during the pandemic in Italian adults without any current clinician-diagnosed psychiatric disorder and created a predictive machine learning model (MLM) to evaluate subsequent independent samples. An online, self-reported survey was released during two pandemic periods (May to June and September to October 2020). Provisional diagnoses of major depressive disorder (PMDD) were determined using a diagnostic algorithm based on the DSM criteria of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 to maximize specificity. Gradient-boosted decision trees and the SHapley Additive exPlanations technique created the MLM and estimated each variable's predictive contribution. There were 3532 participants in the study. The final sample included 633 participants in the first wave (FW) survey and 290 in the second (SW). First-onset PMDD was found in 7.4% of FW participants and 7.2% of the SW. The final MLM, trained on the FW, displayed a sensitivity of 76.5% and a specificity of 77.8% when tested on the SW. The main factors identified in the MLM were low resilience, being an undergraduate student, being stressed by pandemic-related conditions, and low satisfaction with usual sleep before the pandemic and support from relatives. Current smoking and taking medication for medical conditions also contributed, albeit to a lesser extent. Small sample size; self-report assessment; data covering 2020 only. Rates of first-onset PMDD among Italians during the first phases of the pandemic were considerable. Our MLM displayed a good predictive performance, suggesting potential goals for depression-preventive interventions during public health crises.","Caldirola, DaccÃƒÂ², Cuniberti, Grassi, Alciati, Torti, Perna","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.145","20220430","COVID-19; Depression; First-onset; General population; Machine learning; Predictive model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30797,""
"Disruption to well-being activities and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: The mediational role of social connectedness and rumination","Disruption to everyday routine during the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in considerable implications for global mental health. The inter- and intra-personal mechanisms by which disrupted routine can contribute to elevated depressive symptoms has not been well-explored. The present study aimed to examine how feelings of social (dis)connectedness and rumination, as a maladaptive coping strategy, could explain the association between disrupted well-being activities and depressive symptoms. Participants (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯496) ranging in age from 18 to 73Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years (MÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯28.73, SDÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯10.93) completed an online survey within the first 3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months of the COVID-19 pandemic, which included measures of disruption to usual psychological and physical well-being activities, social connectedness, rumination, and depressive symptoms. Social connectedness and rumination were investigated as serial mediators of the association between disrupted well-being activities and depression using Hayes' PROCESS macro. 39.5% of the sample reported clinically significant levels of depression. Disruption to well-being activities predicted higher depressive symptoms, and this was partially explained by feelings of social disconnectedness and subsequent rumination. Rumination, alone, was not a significant mediator between disrupted routine and depressive symptoms. The cross-sectional survey design does not preclude the possibility of bidirectional effects. The social distancing public health measures to combat COVID-19 have contributed to widespread disrupted routine, and in turn, elevated symptoms of depression. Social disconnectedness plays a particularly important role in this association. Intervention strategies should consider social factors as a 'social cure' for mass, positive mental health promotion during the times of COVID-19.","McMahon, Douglas, Casey, Ahern","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.142","20220430","COVID-19; Depression; Disrupted routine; Rumination; Social connectedness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30798,""
"An online breathing and wellbeing programme (ENO Breathe) for people with persistent symptoms following COVID-19: a parallel-group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial","There are few evidence-based interventions for long COVID; however, holistic approaches supporting recovery are advocated. We assessed whether an online breathing and wellbeing programme improves health related quality-of-life (HRQoL) in people with persisting breathlessness following COVID-19. We conducted a parallel-group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial in patients who had been referred from one of 51 UK-based collaborating long COVID clinics. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older; were recovering from COVID-19 with ongoing breathlessness, with or without anxiety, at least 4 weeks after symptom onset; had internet access with an appropriate device; and were deemed clinically suitable for participation by one of the collaborating COVID-19 clinics. Following clinical assessment, potential participants were given a unique online portal code. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either immediate participation in the English National Opera (ENO) Breathe programme or to usual care. Randomisation was done by the research team using computer-generated block randomisation lists, with block size 10. The researcher responsible for randomisation was masked to responses. Participants in the ENO Breathe group participated in a 6-week online breathing and wellbeing programme, developed for people with long COVID experiencing breathlessness, focusing on breathing retraining using singing techniques. Those in the deferred group received usual care until they exited the trial. The primary outcome, assessed in the intention-to-treat population, was change in HRQoL, assessed using the RAND 36-item short form survey instrument mental health composite (MHC) and physical health composite (PHC) scores. Secondary outcome measures were the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessment test score, visual analogue scales (VAS) for breathlessness, and scores on the dyspnoea-12, the generalised anxiety disorder 7-item scale, and the short form-6D. A thematic analysis exploring participant experience was also conducted using qualitative data from focus groups, survey responses, and email correspondence. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04830033. Between April 22 and May 25, 2021, 158 participants were recruited and randomly assigned. Of these, eight (5%) individuals were excluded and 150 participants were allocated to a treatment group (74 in the ENO Breathe group and 76 in the usual care group). Compared with usual care, ENO Breathe was associated with an improvement in MHC score (regression coefficient 2Ã‚Â·42 [95% CI 0Ã‚Â·03 to 4Ã‚Â·80]; p=0Ã‚Â·047), but not PHC score (0Ã‚Â·60 [-1Ã‚Â·33 to 2Ã‚Â·52]; p=0Ã‚Â·54). VAS for breathlessness (running) favoured ENO Breathe participation (-10Ã‚Â·48 [-17Ã‚Â·23 to -3Ã‚Â·73]; p=0Ã‚Â·0026). No other statistically significant between-group differences in secondary outcomes were observed. One minor self-limiting adverse event was reported by a participant in the ENO Breathe group who felt dizzy using a computer for extended periods. Thematic analysis of ENO Breathe participant experience identified three key themes: (1) improvements in symptoms; (2) feeling that the programme was complementary to standard care; and (3) the particular suitability of singing and music to address their needs. Our findings suggest that an online breathing and wellbeing programme can improve the mental component of HRQoL and elements of breathlessness in people with persisting symptoms after COVID-19. Mind-body and music-based approaches, including practical, enjoyable, symptom-management techniques might have a role supporting recovery.

"Factors associated with perceived decline in the quality of drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from community-recruited cohorts of people who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada","Driven by an increasingly toxic drug supply, drug toxicity deaths in the United States and Canada have risen to unprecedented levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to characterize the prevalence of and the factors associated with a perceived decline in the quality of drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic among community-recruited cohorts of PWUD in Vancouver, Canada. Data collection took place between July and November 2020. In adherence with COVID-19 safety protocols, questionnaires were administered by interviewers through remote means (e.g., phone or videoconference). Using multivariable logistic regression, we characterized the prevalence of and factors associated with a perceived decline in drug quality during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Vancouver, Canada. Of the 738 individuals included in this analysis, 272 (36.9%) reported that the quality of drugs declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. In multivariable analysis, perceived decline in the quality of drugs was significantly associated with: recent non-fatal overdose (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.01, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.29-3.15), at least weekly injection drug use (AOR=1.94, 95% CI: 1.40-2.71), at least weekly crack use (AOR=1.61, 95%CI: 1.10-2.36), and at least weekly crystal methamphetamine use (AOR=1.46, 95%CI: 1.03-2.08). Over a third of PWUD perceived that the quality of drugs declined during the COVID-19 pandemic and these individuals were significantly more likely to report experiencing a recent non-fatal overdose, engaging in frequent injection drug and stimulant use. Study findings indicate the need for interventions to address the toxic drug supply, including providing a regulated supply.","McAdam, Hayashi, Dong, Cui, Sedgemore, Dietze, Phillips, Wilson, Milloy, DeBeck","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109471","20220430","COVID-19; Crystal methamphetamine; Drug overdose; Fentanyl; Injection drug use; Toxic drug supply","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30800,""
"Post-COVID-19 fatigue: the contribution of cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms","Fatigue in its many forms of physical, mental, and psychosocial exhaustion is a common symptom of post-COVID-19 condition, also known as ""Long COVID."" Persistent fatigue in COVID-19 patients is frequently accompanied by cognitive dysfunction and neuropsychiatric symptoms; however, less is known about the relationships between these components of post-COVID-19 condition and fatigue itself. Consequently, the present study sought to (1) distinguish the types of fatigue experienced by participants, and (2) investigate whether cognitive deficits across various domains and neuropsychiatric conditions predicted these different types of fatigue. The study included 136 COVID-19 patients referred for neuropsychological evaluation due to cognitive complaints 8Ã‚Â months on average after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Measures included self-reported fatigue (physical, cognitive, and psychosocial), neuropsychiatric questionnaires (assessing symptoms of depression, anxiety, apathy, and executive functioning), a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, and self-reported quality of life and everyday functioning. Results showed that reports of clinical significant fatigue were pervasive in our sample (82.3% of participants), with physical fatigue rated highest on average relative to the subscale maximum. Elevated levels of apathy, anxiety, and executive dysfunction in neuropsychiatric measures along with executive and attentional difficulties on cognitive tests were found to be consistently important predictors among different types of fatigue. This implicates both cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms as predictors of fatigue in post-COVID-19 condition, and stresses the importance of a holistic approach in assessing and considering potential treatment for COVID-19 patients experiencing fatigue.","Calabria, GarcÃƒÂ­a-SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Grunden, Pons, Arroyo, GÃƒÂ³mez-Anson, EstÃƒÂ©vez GarcÃƒÂ­a, BelvÃƒÂ­s, MorollÃƒÂ³n, Vera Igual, Mur, Pomar, Domingo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-022-11141-8","20220430","COVID-19; Cognitive complaints; Fatigue; Neuropsychiatric symptoms; Neuropsychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30801,""
"Assessment of Knowledge, Attitude and Factors Influencing Uptake of COVID-19 Vaccine among Traders at Edaiken Market, Uselu, Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria","Vaccination is a criticaltool in the battle against COVID-19, and a public health necessity in combating the pandemic. Challenges in getting the public to accept the vaccine may be due to vaccine hesitancy which may be caused by poor knowledge, poor attitude, ethical issues and safety concerns. The study aimed at assessing the knowledge, attitude and factors affecting the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccine among traders at Edaiken market, Uselu, Benin City, Edo State. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among 400 traders using multistage sampling technique in Benin City, Edo State. A forty-one-item questionnaire was utilized to collect data. Data were analyzed with IBM SPSS version 25.0 and quantitative variables were expressed as frequencies, proportions, means and standard deviation. Level of statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. A higher proportion (35.2%) of respondents were aged between 20 - 29 years of age and almost three-quarters (74.0%) were females, while 48.7% were married. Almost one-third, 30% of the respondents had good knowledge of COVID-19 and 375 (93.8%) had poor knowledge regarding COVID-19 vaccine. One-fifth (20.8%) of respondents had a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine and 90 (22.5%) respondents did not know where to get the vaccine. Knowledge of COVID-19 vaccines was poor among the respondents, with most of them displaying a negative attitude to the vaccine. Knowledge of locations for obtaining vaccines was reported as a factor that would influence vaccine uptake. We recommend campaigns by public health authorities aimed at sensitizing the public about availability and importance of COVID-19 vaccine.

"Predicting self-harm and suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia: a nationwide survey report","It is estimated that 77.0% of suicide cases occurred in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), which would increase because of the COVID-19 pandemic and socioeconomic inequity. However, there is lack of reports on this topic from LMICs, especially during the pandemic. Therefore, this nationwide study aimed to explore self-harm and suicide ideation and its predictive variables during the pandemic in Indonesia as a MIC with the highest COVID-19 fatality rate in Asia. Non-random sampling online survey was conducted nationwide between 25 May and 16 June 2021. The collected data were demographic variables (i.e. age group), loneliness from social isolation using The UCLA Loneliness Scale Six Items (ULS-6), and self-harm and suicide ideation using item 9 of The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Predictive model was analyzed using hierarchical logistic regression. A total of 5211 participants from all 34 provinces in Indonesia completed the survey. Among 39.3% of them reported self-harm and suicide ideation during the pandemic, which significantly correlated with loneliness. The predictive variables associated with the likelihood of self-harm and suicide ideation were age, residence, job, religion, sex-gender, sexual orientation, HIV status, disability status, and loneliness. The predictive model showed a significant goodness-of-fit to the observed data (x<sup>2</sup> [ (15)] = 1803.46, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), R<sub>N</sub><sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.40. Four out of 10 Indonesians experienced self-harm and suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly people within the age range of 18-24, living in the Java Island, unemployed/student/retired and freelancer, women, members of minority and marginalized communities, and experience of loneliness during the pandemic.","Liem, Prawira, Magdalena, Siandita, Hudiyana","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-03944-w","20220430","Health inequity; LGBTIQ; Loneliness; Marginalized group; Mental health surveillance; Minority; Suicide ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30803,""
"Mental health experiences with COVID-19 public health measures in an Alberta First Nations Community","First Nations (FN) people of Canada experience health, social, and systemic inequities due to colonization. Consequently, COVID-19 has placed further mental health stress on people related to personal finances, employment security and worry over infection, resulting in exacerbated effects of unresolved past medical and physical traumas. This study aims to understand the experiences related to mental health in an Alberta FN community during the early stages of the pandemic. In partnership with FN leadership, the study implemented an online cross-sectional survey. Adults from a large FN community in Alberta, Canada, were asked to complete a survey, including two mental health-related screening questionnaires: (1) Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 item; and (2) Patient Health Questionnaire-2 item. In addition, respondents could provide responses to open-ended questions about their experiences. Among 106 respondents, 95 (89.6%) finished the survey; 18% of adults screened positive for depressive symptoms (score of 3 or greater) and reported difficulty following public health advice for using hand sanitizer, maintaining social distancing, or self-isolating. 21% of adults screened positive for symptoms of anxiety (score of 3 or greater) and reported difficulty maintaining social distance, self-isolating, obtaining food and clothing, or meeting other basic living requirements. FN communities may be disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and may experience exacerbated symptoms of anxiety, depression and overall poor mental health and well-being. Additional supports and services, including for mental health, should be considered for FN in the context of COVID-19 public health measures. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought upon increased stress and accompanying symptoms of anxiety and depression for a First Nations community in Alberta. Studies, such as this one, that characterize the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among First Nations people, are urgently needed because of increasing demands on healthcare systems due to the pandemic and potential delays in the care of patients living with pre-existing mental health conditions. There is an opportunity to capitalize on First Nations people's experiences of post-traumatic growth proactively supporting/maintaining their well-being and possibly the development of community-based mental health interventions and supports.","Lee, Wozniak, Soprovich, Sharma, Healy, Samanani, Eurich","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-022-00532-z","20220429","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Epidemiology; First Nations; Mental health; Population health; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30804,""
"Americans' Health Priorities During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study aimed to examine how Americans' opinions of the seriousness of various health-related problems have changed over time and to quantify the public's preferences for research prioritization. We conducted a survey that asked respondents to rate the seriousness of 80 health-related problems on a 4-point Likert scale (""very serious problem,"" ""somewhat serious problem,"" ""not too serious of a problem,"" or ""not a problem at all""). Results were compared with past surveys from 2001 and 2013 that examined the same set of health-related problems (with the exception of COVID-19). The survey also included best-worst scaling questions that asked respondents to select, from 20 health problems, those they considered most and least important for research funding. Respondents were recruited from the KnowledgePanel, a nationally representative sample of American households. A total of 768 adults completed the survey between September 3, 2020, and September 14, 2020. The health-related problems that Americans consider to be ""very serious"" generally align with the leading causes of death and noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and mental health; nevertheless, several social determinants of health are also identified. COVID-19 was an unsurprising top priority, whereas cancer remains the highest and a persistent priority for research funding. Americans consider a diverse set of health-related problems to be ""very serious,"" with recognition of social determinants of health rising. Our findings offer guidance as to the disease areas for which the public would value further public and private investment in treatment innovations.","Cook, Pittaoulis, Gilchrist, Alderfer, Sapia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2022.01.021","20220429","COVID-19; best-worst scaling; health problems; patient priorities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30805,""
"Light acupuncture and five-element music therapy for nurses' mental health and well-being during and post-COVID-19: protocol for a randomised cross-over feasibility study","Australian nurses have experienced higher levels of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the prepandemic. This may have affected their long-term mental health and intention to stay in the profession resulting in a workforce shortage, which further impacts the health of the public. Management is urgently required to improve nurses' well-being. However, there is limited evidence available. The proposed clinical trial aims to evaluate the feasibility and therapeutic effects of using a combination of light acupuncture and five-element music therapy to improve nurses' mental health and well-being during and post-COVID-19. This randomised, single blinding, two-arm cross-over feasibility study involves a 1-week run-in period, 2-week intervention and 1-week run-in period in between interventions. Thirty-six eligible nurses will be recruited from the community and randomised into either a combination of light acupuncture treatment and five-element music therapy group or no treatment group for 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks. After a 1-week run in period, they will be swapped to the different group. The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a combination of light acupuncture treatment and five-element music therapy to improve nurses' mental health and well-being. The secondary outcomes will include anxiety and depression, work productivity and activity, and quality of life assessments. Participants will be asked to complete a set of online questionnaires throughout the trial period. All analyses will be performed in R Studio V.1.1.463. Ethical approval was attained from Edith Cowan University's Human Research Ethics Committee (No. 2021-02728-WANG). Research findings will be shared with hospitals and in various forms to engage broader audiences, including national and international conferences, presentations, open-access peer-reviewed journal publications, and local community workshop dissemination with healthcare professionals.

"Does the trauma associated with out-of-home care transmit across generations? Evidence from the 1970 British Cohort Study during a major health pandemic","Children with experience of out-of-home care (OHC) are at an increased risk of adverse outcomes in later life, including poorer levels of psycho-social adjustment. Less is known about the intergenerational transmission of the trauma associated with OHC and psychosocial outcomes in mid-adulthood, particularly during a major health pandemic. To examine if there is evidence of intergenerational transmission of trauma associated with OHC in mid-adulthood, we used data from the 1970 British Cohort Study 2020 COVID-19 Survey. Cases were defined as cohort members (CMs) who had themselves experienced OHC (OHC1) and those whose mother reported to have been in OHC (OHC2). Among the 5320 CMs who participated in the second COVID-19 Survey, we have OHC information for n=4236. Our analytical samples range from n=2472 to 3864 depending on outcome: the largest sample comprised 105 (2.5%) CMs with direct OHC experience (OHC1), 93 (2.2%) CMs with a mother who had OHC experience (OHC2) and 3666 CMs with no OHC experience (OHC0). Self-reported outcomes at age 50 included indicators of depression, health and psychological well-being. Multivariate logistic regression models control for socioeconomic childhood background and current circumstances. Compared with the majority OHC0, the OHC1 group report higher levels of depression (OR 2.18 (95% CI 1.09 to 4.36) p&lt;.05) and are at a greater risk of poor mental (OR 2.23 (95% CI 1.24 to 4.02) p&lt;0.01) and general health (OR 3.32 (95% CI 1.65 to 6.67) p&lt;0.001) during the pandemic. OHC2 was more than twice as likely to report poor mental health prepandemic (OR 2.52 (95% CI 1.37 to 4.64) p&lt;0.01), but not during the pandemic. Children of care leaver mothers (OHC2) appear to be better adjusted than those who were themselves in care (OHC1), although compared with those without care experience (OHC0) both groups had an increased risk of poorer adult outcomes. However, the findings point to both continuity and discontinuity of disadvantage.","Parsons, Schoon","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056736","20220429","COVID-19; depression &amp; mood disorders; mental health; statistics &amp; research methods","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30807,""

"Slovak parentsâ€™ mental health and socioeconomic changes during the COVID-19 pandemic","Studying changes in peopleâ€™s mental health has become one of the hot topics during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Parents were said to be among the most vulnerable groups, considering the nature of the imposed anti-pandemic measures. The present paper analyzes trends in mental health indicators in a sample of Slovak parents (N = 363) who participated in four waves of data collection across a year and a half of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health indicators were represented by general levels of depression and anxiety and the COVID-related stress and anxiety. Only minor changes in depression and anxiety were observed, however, the dynamic in COVID-related stress and especially anxiety was more noteworthy. Besides some exceptions, the results hold even after controlling for the socioeconomic situation. Gender differences in the mental health trends were mostly negligible. These results indicate that, in general, parents have successfully adapted to the pandemic situation.","Lenka VargovÃ¡ et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0232-9EE-4E4","20220501","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; anxiety; covid-19; pandemic; depression; stress; economic situation; parents; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-01","",30810,""
