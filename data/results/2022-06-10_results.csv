"DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND STRESS LEVEL DUE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN PATHOLOGISTS WORKING IN TERTIARY HEALTH CARE CENTRES OF PAKISTAN","Objectives: To determine the level of depression, anxiety and stress in pathologists due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: It was a Cross-sectional Analytical Multicenter Questionnaire-based study conducted from April 2020 to June 2020 including Pathologists working in Khyber Teaching Hospital and Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islam-abad. Informed written consent was obtained and DASS-21 Questionnaire was administered. Data were analysed by SPSS. Levels of depression, anxiety and stress were determined and analysed by multiple regression mothod to predict depression anxiety and stress levels from demographics. Results: Mean age of the study sample was 25-63 (37Â±8.75). There were 13(22.4%) males and 45(77.6%) females. Overall DAS score, mean depression, anxiety and stress score were 31.5Â±22, 8.7Â±9.1, 7.4Â±7.1 and 15.3Â±9 respectively. Females had a higher overall DAS score (U=156.5, p=.011), depression score (U=178.5, p=.032) and anxiety score (U=168.5, p=.029) as compared to males. Anxiety scores were highest in pathologists working in the microbiology section and lowest in those of the chemical pathology section (<U+03C7>2=8.13, p=.043). Multiple regression analysis showed that the female gender was significantly associated with a higher overall DAS score (ÃŸ=13.69, p=.047) and stress score (ÃŸ=6.10, p=.031) as compared to the male gender. Conclusion: Pathologists working in the Covid-19 pandemic have a high level of mental distress and females have a higher level of psychological distress as compared to males. Implementation of mental support programmes for health care workers during pandemic situations is required to provide psychological support to health care workers.","Idrees, M.; Khan, M.

"A Review on Schizophrenia: Outline and Treatment","Schizophrenia is a debilitating, genetic brain condition caused by anomalies that appear early in infancy and interrupt normal brain development. It has a lifetime risk of 1% and affects people of all ages, with around 10% dying by suicide. COVID-19 may raise the risk of mortality and morbidity in people with schizophrenia. Although antipsychotic medications of the first, second, and third generations are the most commonly prescribed treatments for schizophrenia, they are linked to major side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, oxidative stress, and EPS. Ayurvedic herbal medications and some dietary supplements score well in this category since they can be taken for a long time without causing major adverse effects and have antioxidant properties. Low potency first generation antipsychotics, sedating antihistamines, and benzodiazepines, as well as inhalable antipsychotics, oral and short acting injectable olanzapine, and ziprasidone, as well as low potency first generation antipsychotics, sedating antihistamines, and benzodiazepines, should be avoided or closely monitored for patients with COVID-19. Mentally ill patients with COVID-19 should be segregated if at all possible, and employees should be adequately protected.","Chaudhary, S.; Chaudhary, S.; Tyagi, V.","https://doi.org/10.47583/ijpsrr.2022.v73i02.010","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences Review and Research; 73(2):35-46, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32569,""
"Multimodal Depression Detection Using Audio, Visual and Textual Cues: A Survey","In the recent past, mental health has become a global concern. COVID-19 has further caused a rapid surge in depression. Depression is a serious mental illness that is impacting the lives of individuals of all ages all around the world. Depression affects a person's physiological well-being as well as their emotional state. Now days, Depression is the most common element experienced by the human beings irrespective of their age factor and professional life. To detect the depression status among the persons, the system uses different approaches by using the sensor technology. The automatic identification of depression at early stages or immediately helps the clinical studies to cure the people accurately. In this proposed research, the system aims to identify the depression using facial expressions, voice, live video capturing, by analysing their tweets, status, posts in the social media. By applying computer vision integrated with ML and DL techniques, the entire capturing and analysis process gets automated and the complexity involved in the model designing gets reduced because the system focuses more on extracting the statistical features involved in movements and behaviour of the human being. Most of the existing research works focuses on the unimodal development which focuses on the single component analysis but the proposed research aims to focus on the multi modal with a fusion of different modalities of learning approaches involved in detection of depression, this survey provides an overview of numerous methodologies that have been created with the goal of employing emotion recognition to analyse depression.","Mamidisetti, S.; Reddy, A.

"COVID-19 in Brazil: Opportunity to integrate mental health in the Programa Bolsa Familia","According to the World Health Organization, Brazil ranks third in COVID-19 cases and second in deaths globally. The most severely impacted by this shock are the approximately 10 million Brazilians that live in extreme poverty. This vulnerability is evident in youth, financially, and in their well-being and mental health. Like other cash transfer programmes globally, the Programa Bolsa Familia (PBF) is currently being adapted to support individuals and families during the pandemic. The current environment offers a unique opportunity for PBF to focus on young people and tackle poverty from a broader perspective. The PBF can expand its scope to address the longer-term mental health impacts of economic crises and poverty, besides addressing urgent food security and survival needs. This approach could enhance youth's future life chances and break the vicious cycle between mental illness and poverty that spirals many young people into socioeconomic and mental health disadvantages. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)  (Portuguese) Segundo a Organizacao Mundial da Saude (OMS), o Brasil e o terceiro pais do mundo com mais casos de COVID-19 e o segundo em numero de mortes. Os mais afetados sao os cerca de dez milhoes de brasileiros vivendo na linha da pobreza. Essa vulnerabilidade e mais visivel entre os jovens, tanto economicamente quanto em relacao a saude mental. Junto a outros programas de transferencia de renda, o Programa Bolsa Familia (PBF) foi adaptado para melhor contribuir durante a pandemia. Esse contexto oferece uma oportunidade unica para que o PBF foque em jovens e aborde a pobreza de forma mais ampla. Alem de cobrir as necessidades basicas, o PBF poderia ampliar seu alcance visando a impactos economicos e de saude mental de longo prazo. Esse enfoque poderia melhorar as oportunidades de vida de jovens e romper o ciclo vicioso entre problemas de saude mental e pobreza que os mantem em situacao de vulnerabilidade social.

"Unmet Needs of Children with Inherited Metabolic Disorders in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective: Crucial information is lacking on unmet needs of children with rare inherited metabolic disorders during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic from low-and middle-income countries. We aimed to identify the unmet needs of children with rare inherited metabolic disorders from Turkey. Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional observational design, all children with rare inherited metabolic disorders aged 0-18 years followed at Ankara University School of Medicine Department of Pediatrics Pediatric Metabolism Division were recruited and interviewed via phone calls. The Expanded Guide for Monitoring Child Development enabled assessment of unmet needs and environmental context during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Step-wise logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent factors associated with unmet needs. Results: The sample comprised 229 children (54.1% boys) with rare inherited metabolic disorders (36.7% diet-dependent disorders). Most common diagnoses were amino acid metabolism disorders (40.2%). Of all, 29.3% of the mothers reported depression, 25.3% loss of job of family members during the pandemic. All children had unmet needs: at least 73.0% in health care, 96.8% in education, 78.3% in special services/rehabilitation. Having significant developmental delay and/or disability (odds ratio = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.14-4.67) emerged as the only independent factor associated with unmet needs in health care. Conclusion: Children with rare inherited metabolic disorders and their families in Turkey experience unmet needs in many domains during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Urgent action is needed to address the unmet needs of children with rare inherited metabolic disorders, especially those who has significant developmental delays and/or disabilities for this pandemic and possible future crisis.","Akin, E.

"Mental health and sleep quality in patients recovered from COVID-19","Objective: To explore the mental health, sleep quality and related factors in patients recovered from COVID-19. Methods: A total of 161 patients recovered from COVID-19 in Baoding and Shijiazhuang areas of Hebei Province were assessed with the 12 General Health Questionnaires (GHQ-12) and Pittsburgh Sleep quality Index (PSQI). The score of GHQ-12 = 3 indicated poor mental health, and the score of PSQI = 5 indicated poor sleep quality. Results: Totally 52 cases (32. 3%) had poor mental health and 86 cases (53. 4%) had poor sleep quality. Male, highly educated, single marital status, good self-evaluation effect were protective factors of good mental health (OR= 0. 36, 0. 14, 0. 14, 0. 16). Worrying about sequelae was a risk factor for poor mental health (OR= 5. 63). Good therapeutic effect and high education were protective factors for poor sleep quality (OR= 0. 15), and worrying about sequelae was the risk factor for poor sleep quality (OR = 24. 48 ) . Conclusion: It suggests that the problems of poor mental health and poor sleep quality are common in patients recovered from COVID-19, and there is a close relationship between them.

concern leading to unexpected psychoemotional consequences and a need to summarize the most recent knowledge about this topic. Therefore, we conducted a narrative review of the relevant literature, synthesizing data from available databases. According to the findings of this review, pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic were more anxious and depressed mainly due to the fear of contacting the virus, restricting measures, and concerns about the health of their unborn children. The elevated stress levels in pregnant women due to the pandemic could represent risk factors for physical health complications. Thus, strategies including relaxation, mindfulness, acceptance, and positive attitude to COVID-19 should be promoted for pregnant women.","Stavridou, Androniki, Michailidou, Despoina, Panagouli, Eleni, Sergentanis, Theodoros N.; Tzila, Efthalia, Psaltopoulou, Theodora, Tsolia, Maria, Vlahos, Nikolaos, Tsitsika, Artemis","https://doi.org/10.3897/folmed.64.e61406","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Folia Medica; 64(1):21-26, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32576,""
"Influence of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on a sample of Egyptian children with Down syndrome","Background: Down syndrome (DS) is characterized by variable degrees of intellectual disability (ID). The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) lockdown prevented children with DS from reaching their rehabilitation facilities. This could have led to deterioration of their abilities and mental health hazards. The aim of this cohort study was to investigate frequency of COVID-19, the influence of COVID-19 pandemic on health, and some abilities of children with DS, and to explore factors that could have governed receiving home-based training during the lockdown. A survey of 150 individuals with Down syndrome was answered by their caregivers. Additionally, 135 participants were subjected to assessment of cognitive, language, and motor abilities using Portage program. They were divided into 2 groups: group I who received online therapy sessions during the lockdown and group II who did not receive sessions. Logistic regression was used to determine the factors which influenced getting home-based training. Results: The percentage of COVID-19 cases was 3.3%. All evaluated abilities were reduced despite receiving online sessions particularly language performance (P &lt; 0.001). Male gender, having severe ID and low parental education were among the factors which encouraged parents to get virtual training. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the abilities of DS children even those who got rehabilitation sessions. Their dependence on social interaction could have limited the benefit of virtual sessions. Factors that influence a parentâ€™s decision to get home-based training should be monitored and targeted in order to overcome obstacles or concepts that may prevent families from enduring home-based intervention.","Meguid, N.

"The Uneven Stress of Social Change: Disruptions, Disparities, and Mental Health","As the COVID-19 pandemic underscores, disparities in stress exposure, vulnerability, and protective resources are often magnified in times of rapid change. I argue that Leonard Pearlin?s integration of life course and stress process frameworks constitutes a useful model for advancing a research agenda on the stressors and corollary mental health impacts of the social disruptions and dislocations defining life in the early twenty-first century. Social changes interrupt life paths and produce potentially stressful circumstances at particular time points in biographies already defined, shaped, and constrained at the intersections of race, class, nativity, age, and gender. Critical for both science and policy development is a mental health research agenda on the nature and consequences of the uneven stresses of social changes as they play out at different life course stages in disparate ways depending on people?s intersecting social locations.","Moen, Phyllis","https://doi.org/10.1177/21568693221100171","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Society and Mental Health;: 21568693221100171, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32578,""
"Social workersâ€™ experiences in integrated health care during the COVID-19 pandemic","SummaryThe massive spread of the novel COVID-19 virus across the globe has been disruptive to all providers within integrated healthcare systems, including social workers. The literature on how the pandemic has impacted medical workers are emerging. The present article explored the experiences of social workers. A purposive sample of 40 social workers in integrated healthcare settings was interviewed from September to November 2020 prior to vaccine availability to learn about how they managed the earlier months of the pandemic. A constant comparison approach was used to analyze the data.FindingsThemes identified included: (1) how social workers felt about safety in their work environments;(2) what it was like for social workers to transition to remote work;(3) how the pandemic affected social workers? workload and mental health;and (4) what were the preparedness issues and lessons learned.ApplicationsThis study adds to the existing literature on provider experiences of the pandemic in integrated health care with social workers? voices. This additional perspective may contribute to better preparedness of behavioral health services and taking care of social workers in future crises.","Weng, Suzie S.","https://doi.org/10.1177/14680173221101256","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Social Work;: 14680173221101256, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32579,""
"Public perception of social workers as a source for providing help during the COVID-19 pandemic","SummaryThe current study examined the contribution of select demographic and psychosocial variables, as well as prior experience with social workers (SWs), to explaining the likelihood of seeking their help by the general public in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the purpose of the study, an online questionnaire was administered to a sample of 582 respondents older than 20.FindingsThe findings show that the respondents reported a fairly low likelihood of seeking help from SWs. Women, those not in a significant relationship, people who had prior experience with SWs, and those reporting higher levels of loneliness, had a higher likelihood of seeking help from SWs. At the same time, no association was found between age, employment status, depression, and anxiety, and the likelihood of seeking help from SWs.ApplicationsWhen dealing with the mental, health, and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis, it is important to identify groups with a lower likelihood of seeking help from SWs and to actively offer them help. Furthermore, it is important to develop a policy aimed at promoting knowledge of SW roles and reducing barriers to seeking SW help, while attending to the unique needs of diverse population groups.","Kagan, Maya, Elbaz Kachlon, Yahel S.","https://doi.org/10.1177/14680173221101255","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Social Work;: 14680173221101255, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32580,""
"How the First COVID-19 Lockdown Worsened Younger Generationsâ€™ Mental Health: Insights from Network Theory","Two years after the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), one fact seems to be emerging clearly: lockdowns affect mental health differently across generations. This article uses data collected before and after the first wave of COVID-19 on a sample of 5,859 respondents, showing that the first lockdown worsened the mental health of the younger generations (Gen Y and Gen Z) in particular. Given that the older generations are considered the most vulnerable in this global pandemic, this may seem surprising. However, our data reveal that the pandemic outbreak raised very different concerns in different generations. While older people appear to be worried about the economy and their own health, younger people were more concerned about their lifestyles and, generally, their social relationships. This suggests that some of the mechanisms behind the exacerbation of younger people?s mental health may lie at the intersection of these two issues. On one hand, a life lived essentially online undermines all those processes of social capital activation that occur through leisure and face-to-face encounters, from which Gen Z may have suffered in particular. On the other hand, not only has the pandemic added further uncertainty to Generation Y?s career paths but working from home has also forced them to reorganize family routines and construct entirely new ones with colleagues using computers and smartphones. The article reflects on the upheavals of work and leisure to foster research on networks, social capital, and mental health in this period of a continuing pandemic.","Vacchiano, Mattia","https://doi.org/10.1177/13607804221084723","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sociological Research Online;: 13607804221084723, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32581,""
"Understanding Teacher Self-Efficacy to Address Studentsâ€™ Social-Emotional Needs in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Teachers are returning to schools during the COVID-19 pandemic under the weight of unprecedented stressors to engage a student body that has also experienced stress and trauma. In this study, we examined how confident 454 teachers (55% Black) from 41 charter schools in New Orleans, Louisiana, were in their ability to address studentsâ€™ social-emotional needs upon their return to school. Results showed that Black teachers were more likely to report a greater sense of efficacy in addressing studentsâ€™ needs. Both Black and White teachers identified the top three resources needed to assist students: mental health supports, trainings, and in-class resources.

"Nurturing care during COVID-19: a rapid review of early evidence","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant changes to family life, society and essential health and other services. A rapid review of evidence was conducted to examine emerging evidence on the effects of the pandemic on three components of nurturing care, including responsive caregiving, early learning, and safety and security. Two academic databases, organisational websites and reference lists were searched for original studies published between 1 January and 25 October 2020. A single reviewer completed the study selection and data extraction with verification by a second reviewer. We included studies with a complete methodology and reporting on quantitative or qualitative evidence related to nurturing care during the pandemic. Studies reporting on outcomes related to responsive caregiving, early learning, and safety and security were included. The search yielded 4410 citations in total, and 112 studies from over 30 countries met our eligibility criteria. The early evidence base is weighted towards studies in high-income countries, studies related to caregiver mental health and those using quantitative survey designs. Studies reveal issues of concern related to increases in parent and caregiver stress and mental health difficulties during the pandemic, which was linked to harsher and less warm or responsive parenting in some studies. A relatively large number of studies examined child safety and security and indicate a reduction in maltreatment referrals. Lastly, studies suggest that fathers' engagement in caregiving increased during the early phase of the pandemic, children's outdoor play and physical activity decreased (while screen time increased), and emergency room visits for child injuries decreased. The results highlight key evidence gaps (ie, breastfeeding support and opportunities for early learning) and suggest the need for increased support and evidence-based interventions to ensure young children and other caregivers are supported and protected during the pandemic.","Proulx, Lenzi-Weisbecker, Hatch, Hackett, Omoeva, Cavallera, Daelmans, Dua","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050417","20220609","COVID-19; Child protection; Community child health; Depression &amp; mood disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32583,""
"Are free school meals failing families? Exploring the relationship between child food insecurity, child mental health and free school meal status during COVID-19: national cross-sectional surveys","Food insecurity is linked to poor health and well-being in children and rising prevalence rates have been exacerbated by COVID-19. Free school meals (FSM) are considered a critical tool for reducing the adverse effects of poverty but apply a highly restrictive eligibility criteria. This study examined levels of food security and FSM status to support decision-making regarding increasing the current eligibility criteria. Two cross-sectional national surveys administered in August-September 2020 and January-February 2021 were used to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the food experiences of children and young people. UK. 2166 children (aged 7-17 years) and parents/guardians. Participant characteristics were described by food security and FSM status; estimated marginal means were calculated to obtain the probability of poor mental health, expressed as children reporting feeling stressed or worried in the past month, by food security status and FSM status. We observed food insecurity among both children who did and did not receive of FSM: 23% of children not receiving FSM were food insecure. Children who were food insecure had a higher probability of poor mental health (31%, 95% CI: 23%, 40%) than children who were food secure (10%, 95% CI: 7%, 14%). Food insecure children receiving FSM had a higher probability of poor mental health (51%, 95% CI: 37%, 65%) than those who were food insecure and not receiving FSM (29%, 95% CI: 19%, 42%). Many children experienced food insecurity regardless of whether they received FSM, suggesting the eligibility criteria needs to be widened to prevent overlooking those in need.","Yang, Power, Moss, Lockyer, Burton, Doherty, Bryant","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059047","20220609","COVID-19; Food insecurity; MENTAL HEALTH; PUBLIC HEALTH","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32584,""
"Mental Health of Caregivers Working in Nursing Homes during the COVID-19 Pandemic","There have been numerous reports of cluster outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hospitals and nursing homes. Healthcare workers fighting COVID-19 experience mental health issues. Caregivers in nursing homes experienced increased psychological distress and concern about deterioration of their mental health. We conducted a large-scale web-based survey exploring mental health among caregivers working in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of identifying their support needs. Survey participants were caregivers working at 284 nursing homes in Ibaraki prefecture, Japan. The survey period was from September 2020 to March 2021. Participants responded to a questionnaire covering gender, age, occupation, infections at facilities, infection protection, changes in nursing home users, cooperation with other medical institutions, and prejudice/discrimination. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to evaluate participants' depression and anxiety. In total, 676 participants completed the survey; 350 (52.5%) were with anxiety symptoms and 378 (56.7%) were with depressive symptoms (scores exceeding the HADS cut-off points). The risk for anxiety was associated with being care worker or social worker. The risk of anxiety or depression was high when family caregivers' mental state changed. This study found that caregivers working in nursing homes were exposed to high levels of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic and were at high risk for developing depression and anxiety.","Takahashi, Ekoyama, Tachikawa, Midorikawa, Shiratori, Ota, Takahashi, Arai","https://doi.org/10.1159/000524953","20220609","Anxiety; COVID-19; Caregivers; Dementia care; Nursing home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32585,""
"""COVID just kind of opened a can of whoop-ass"": The rapid growth of safer supply prescribing during the pandemic documented through an environmental scan of addiction and harm reduction services in Canada","In the context of the ongoing overdose crisis, a stark increase in toxic drug deaths from the unregulated street supply accompanied the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Injectable opioid agonist treatment (iOAT - hydromorphone or medical-grade heroin), tablet-based iOAT (TiOAT), and safer supply prescribing are emerging interventions used to address this crisis in Canada. Given rapid clinical guidance and policy change to enable their local adoption, our objectives were to describe the state of these interventions before the pandemic, and to document and explain changes in implementation during the early pandemic response (March-May 2020). Surveys and interviews with healthcare providers comprised this mixed methods national environmental scan of iOAT, TiOAT, and safer supply across Canada at two time points. Quantitative data were summarized using descriptive statistics; interview data were coded and analyzed thematically. 103 sites in 6 Canadian provinces included 19 iOAT, 3 TiOAT and 21 safer supply sites on March 1, 2020; 60 new safer supply sites by May 1 represented a 285% increase. Most common substances were opioids, available at all sites; most common settings were addiction treatment programs and primary care clinics, and onsite pharmacies models. 79% of safer supply services were unfunded. Diversity in service delivery models demonstrated broad adaptability. Qualitative data reinforced the COVID-19 pandemic as the driving force behind scale-up. Data confirmed the capacity for rapid scale-up of flexible, community-based safer supply prescribing during dual public health emergencies. Geographical, client demographic, and funding gaps highlight the need to target barriers to implementation, service delivery and sustainability.","Glegg, McCrae, Kolla, Touesnard, Turnbull, Brothers, Brar, Sutherland, Le Foll, Sereda, Goyer, Rai, Bernstein, Fairbairn","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103742","20220609","Addiction; COVID-19 pandemic; Canada; Harm reduction; Injectable opioid agonist treatment; Safer supply; Service delivery models; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32586,""

"The Occupational Health and Safety of Sign Language Interpreters Working Remotely During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a dramatic shift in work conditions, bringing increased attention to the occupational health of remote workers. We aimed to investigate the physical and mental health of sign language interpreters working remotely from home because of the pandemic. We measured the physical and mental health of certified interpreters who worked remotely 10 or more hours per week. We evaluated associations within the overall sample and compared separate generalized linear models across primary interpreting settings and platforms. We hypothesized that physical health would be correlated with mental health and that differences across settings would exist. We recruited 120 interpreters to participate. We calculated scores for disability (mean score, 13.93 [standard error of the mean (SEM), 1.43] of 100), work disability (mean score, 10.86 [SEM, 1.59] of 100), and pain (mean score, 3.53 [SEM, 0.29] of 10). Shoulder pain was most prevalent (27.5%). Respondents had scores that were not within normal limits for depression (22.5%), anxiety (16.7%), and stress (24.2%). Although disability was not associated with depression, all other outcomes for physical health were correlated with mental health (r Ã¢â€°Â¥ 0.223, P Ã¢â€°Â¤ .02). Educational and community/freelance interpreters trended toward greater adverse physical health, whereas educational and video remote interpreters trended toward more mental health concerns. Maintaining the occupational health of sign language interpreters is critical for addressing the language barriers that have resulted in health inequities for deaf communities. Associations of disability, work disability, and pain with mental health warrant a holistic approach in the clinical treatment and research of these essential workers.","Roman, Samar, Ossip, McKee, Barnett, Yousefi-Nooraie","https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd19.210462","20220609","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32588,""
"The impact of a 24-hour syringe dispensing machine on a face-to-face needle and syringe program and targeted primary healthcare clinic","Automatic syringe dispensing machines (ADM) have become an important adjunct to Australia's needle and syringe programs (NSP). However, concerns that they reduce face-to-face contact with health staff and other health interventions remain. We examined changes in the number of needle/syringes dispensed at an ADM and occasions of service at a co-located face-to-face NSP and targeted primary healthcare clinic during the first wave of COVID-19 restrictions. We reviewed data from an inner-city harm reduction program during the study period of April 2020 to March 2021 compared to the previous year. Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate the association between occasions of service and equipment distribution. ADM-dispensed equipment increased significantly by 41.1%, while face-to-face NSP occasions decreased by 16.2%. Occasions provided by the targeted primary healthcare clinic increased by 59.7% per month. We have shown that 24-hour ADM access did not adversely affect the number of people using targeted primary healthcare when provided within close proximity. Implication for public health: These findings reinforce the demand for 24-hour needle/syringe access and can be used to support the expanded access to ADMs, especially where people who inject drugs (PWID) have access to appropriate healthcare.","Uthurralt, McGlinn, O'Donnell, Haber, Day","https://doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.13267","20220609","automatic syringe dispensing machines; face-to-face care, primary healthcare; people who inject drugs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32589,""
"Clinical and Financial Outcomes Associated With a Workplace Mental Health Program Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Investment in workplace wellness programs is increasing despite concerns about lack of clinical benefit and return on investment (ROI). In contrast, outcomes from workplace mental health programs, which treat mental health difficulties more directly, remain mostly unknown. To determine whether participation in an employer-sponsored mental health benefit was associated with improvements in depression and anxiety, workplace productivity, and ROI as well as to examine factors associated with clinical improvement. This cohort study included participants in a US workplace mental health program implemented by 66 employers across 40 states from January 1, 2018, to January 1, 2021. Participants were employees who enrolled in the mental health benefit program and had at least moderate anxiety or depression, at least 1 appointment, and at least 2 outcome assessments. A digital platform that screened individuals for common mental health conditions and provided access to self-guided digital content, care navigation, and video and in-person psychotherapy and/or medication management. Primary outcomes were the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression (range, 0-27) score and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (range, 0-21) score. The ROI was calculated by comparing the cost of treatment to salary costs for time out of the workplace due to mental health symptoms, measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale. Data were collected through 6 months of follow-up and analyzed using mixed-effects regression. A total of 1132 participants (520 of 724 who reported gender [71.8%] were female; mean [SD] age, 32.9 [8.8] years) were included. Participants reported improvements from pretreatment to posttreatment in depression (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-6.34; 95% CI, -6.76 to -5.91; Cohen dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-1.11; 95% CI, -1.18 to -1.03) and anxiety (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-6.28; 95% CI, -6.77 to -5.91; Cohen dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-1.21; 95% CI, -1.30 to -1.13). Symptom change per log-day of treatment was similar post-COVID-19 vs pre-COVID-19 for depression (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.14; 95% CI, -0.10 to 0.38) and anxiety (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.08; 95% CI, -0.22 to 0.38). Workplace salary savings at 6 months at the federal median wage was US $3440 (95% CI, $2730-$4151) with positive ROI across all wage groups.

"Beyond Pathogen Filtration: Possibility of Smart Mask as Wearable Device for Personal and Group Health and Safety Management","Face masks are an important way to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the prolonged pandemic has revealed confounding problems of the current face masks, not only the spread of the disease but also concurrent psychological, social, and economic complications. As face masks have been worn for a long time, people have been interested in expanding the purpose of masks from protection to comfort and health, leading to the release of various ""smart"" mask products around the world. To envision how the smart masks will be extended, this paper reviewed 25 smart masks (12 from commercial products and 13 from academic prototypes) that emerged after the pandemic. While most smart masks presented in the market focus on solving user breathing discomfort problems that arise from prolonged use, academic prototypes were designed for not just sensing COVID-19 but for general health monitoring aspects. Next, we investigated several specific sensors that can be incorporated into the mask for expanding biophysical features. On a larger scale, we discussed the architecture and possible applications with the help of connected smart masks. Namely, beyond a personal sensing application, a group or community sensing application may share an aggregate version of information with the broader population. In addition, this kind of collaborative sensing will also address the challenges of individual sensing, such as reliability and coverage. Lastly, we identified possible service application fields and further considerations for actual use. Along with daily life health monitoring, smart masks may work as a general respiratory health tool for sports training, emergency room/ambulatory setting, protection for industry workers and firefighters, and soldier safety and survivability. For further considerations, we investigated design aspects in terms of sensor reliability and reproducibility, ergonomic design for user acceptance, and privacy-aware data handling. Overall, we aim to explore new possibilities by examining the latest research, sensor technologies, and application platform perspectives for smart masks as one of the promising wearable devices. By integrating biomarkers of respiration symptoms, a smart mask can be a truly cutting-edge device that expands further knowledge on health monitoring to reach the next level of wearables.","Lee, Kim, Kim, Choi, Zitouni, Khandoker, Jelinek, Hadjileontiadis, Lee, Jeong","https://doi.org/10.2196/38614","20220609","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32591,""
"Role of Neuroimmune Interactions in COVID-19-related Cardiovascular Damage","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic impacting over 200 countries/regions and more than 200 million patients worldwide. Among the infected patients, there is a high prevalence of COVID-19-related cardiovascular injuries. However, the specific mechanisms linking cardiovascular damage and COVID-19 remain unclear. The COVID-19 pandemic also has exacerbated the mental health burden of humans. Considering the close association between neuroimmune interactions and cardiovascular disease, this review assessed the complex pathophysiological mechanisms connecting neuroimmune interactions and cardiovascular disease. It was revealed that the mental health burden might be a pivotal accomplice causing COVID-19-associated cardiovascular damage. Specifically, the proinflammatory status of patients with a terrible mood state is closely related to overdrive of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathovagal imbalance, and endothelial dysfunction, which lead to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular injury during COVID-19. Therefore, during the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients, particular attention should be given to relieve the mental health burden of these patients.","Chen, Qiao, Cao, Shi, Du, Dong","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11596-022-2529-0","20220609","COVID-19; autonomic nervous system; endothelial dysfunction; mental health burden; neuroimmune interactions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32592,""

"Anxiety in patients treated in a temporary hospital in Belgrade, Serbia, during the first epidemic wave of COVID-19","It has been reported that COVID-19 patients in general often experience anxiety, depression and stress, but those problems in patients of temporary COVID-19 hospitals seem to have attracted less attention. The study included 87 SARS-Cov-2 infected subjects accommodated and treated in a temporary hospital in Belgrade, Serbia, during the first epidemic wave of COVID-19. The patients' level of anxiety was assessed on two occasions (at admission to the temporary hospital, and 2 weeks after discharge) using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Demographic and clinical data were obtained through questionnairesor retrieved from patients' medical records. A multiple linear regression model revealed that sex, age, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms (COVID-19_SS) and the family history of psychiatric disorder (FHPD) remain significant predictors of the level of anxiety at hospital admission (F (4, 82)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 14.916, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.0001), wih an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.421.

"The Relationship Between Adjustment and Mental Health of Chinese Freshmen: The Mediating Effect of Security and the Moderating Effect of Gender","During the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities are confronted with campus lockdown or even school closures to reduce the risk of infection. However, these measures pose a threat to the mental health of adolescents. In particular, freshmen who have just entered the university campus may suffer from more serious mental health risks. In this study, 1,818 freshmen were analyzed by using the Chinese College Student Adjustment Scale (CCSAS), Sense of Security Questionnaire (SQ), and Symptom Check List 90 (SCL-90) of the qualitative method. The results showed that adjustment had an impact on mental health. Firstly, there was a significant negative association between adjustment and mental health. Secondly, adjustment had a significant predictive effect on mental health. Finally, a sense of security and gender affected the relationship between adjustment and mental health. Collectively, adjustment, sense of security, and gender exerted impacts on the mental health of freshmen, suggesting that we should create a warm and harmonious campus environment for students and conduct targeted education for male and female students.","Cao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.916329","20220609","adjustment; mediating effect; mental health; moderating effect; security","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32598,""
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Parkinson's disease patients","COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It causes respiratory tract infection that ranges from mild to lethal. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological impact of COVID-19 on Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. A questionnaire about the emotional, physiological, and cognitive stress symptoms was designed in the present study. A total of 94 cases and 188 controls participants filled out the questionnaire. The participants include 70.2% male and 29.8% female in both cases and controls. 27.6% of the participants were aged 18-40 years old, 33.0% were aged 41-60 years old, and 39.4% were above 61 years old. In the present study, we found that the emotional symptoms of stress were common in PD patients. Fear about own and family health was significantly higher in PD patients. A significant number of PD patients were feeling depressed; the major reason was the COVID-19 and being a PD patient, While job difficulties and COVID-19 pandemic was the main reason for feeling depressed in the control group. Constant worrying due to COVID-19 was also more common in PD patients than in the control group. Among the physiological symptoms of stress, low energy, Restlessness, clenched jaw and avoiding others were significantly higher in PD patients. Among the cognitive symptoms of stress, racing thoughts, forgetfulness, and more nervous behaviours were common in PD patients. This study concludes that PD patients face a psychological burden due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which needs proper attention.","Tufail, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09604","20220609","COVID-19; Cognitive stress; Emotional stress; Parkinson's disease; Physiological stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32599,""
"Juvenile Justice, Technology and Family Separation: A Call to Prioritize Access to Family-Based Telehealth Treatment for Justice-Involved Adolescents' Mental Health and Well-Being","Separating children from families has deleterious effects on children's mental health and well-being, which is highly relevant for youth in juvenile detention and other out-of-home residential placements. Despite growth in the evidence of family-based interventions in mitigating adverse behavioral health outcomes for justice involved adolescents (JIA), gaps remain in intervention dissemination for JIA; this particularly true for those leveraging digital health technologies, a need that has intensified with the COVID-19 pandemic. Use of digital health technologies for JIAs is pressing to address structural barriers in maintaining JIA-family connections, but also to improve treatment access for detained JIAs. Court systems' capacity to support use of digital health tools, such as telehealth, appear promising. Data on the use of tele-conferencing in U.S. juvenile and family courts were collected from 456 juvenile justice professionals as part of a larger study on judicial decision making. Results suggest overwhelming adoption of video-conferencing for court hearings with only 40% of respondents reporting family court use prior to the onset of COVID-19, but majority (91%) now reporting its routine use. Youth participate from a range of settings, including detention, other residential placement, community-based behavioral health and in-home settings. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a shift in the uptake of video-conferencing platforms that could hold promise for future larger scale use across the juvenile justice system. Findings underscore feasibility and acceptability of technology requirements in key settings that should be leveraged for broad scale implementation of empirically supported family-based interventions to advance behavioral health equity for JIA.","Tolou-Shams, Bath, McPhee, Folk, Porche, Fortuna","https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2022.867366","20220609","behavioral health equity; family separation; juvenile detention; structural intervention; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32600,""
"Preventive practice, vaccine acceptance, and knowledge toward coronavirus disease-19: An online cross-sectional questionnaire-based report in Iranian dentists","The coronavirus disease (COVID) is predicted to cause serious mental health problems among healthcare providers (HCPs) especially dentists. Also understanding the influencing factors of the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among HCPs are important aspects in the design of effective strategies to improve the vaccine coverage rate. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the knowledge, vaccination acceptance, fear, and obsession, as well as the preventive practice behaviors of Iranian dentists and dental students in late 2020 toward COVID-19. A descriptive, web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among Iranian dental students and dentists (general practitioners and specialists). All Iranian dentists and dental students living in the Islamic Republic of Iran regardless of their city and workplace were invited to participate in the study. The total number of dentists in Iran was estimated to be 54,927. The sample size was calculated 380. The questionnaires used in this study were adapted from previously published studies based on the authors' permission. The questionnaire consisted of four sections that sought to collect information on the respondents' vaccination acceptance, knowledge, preventive practice, fear, and obsession toward COVID-19. The relationship between the study variables was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and also multiple linear regression tests. Overall, 394 dentists were filled the questionnaire (65 dental students, 151 general dentists and 178 specialists). There were no differences in terms of vaccination acceptance, knowledge and also fear score in different designation groups. Dentists had significantly higher obsession and also preventive practice scores than other designation groups (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The majority of respondents had good knowledge (more than 9), acceptable preventive practice (more than 19), low fear-obsession (&lt;2.7), and high acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination (more than 8.8). Although obsession and fear scores were low in all designation groups, dentists had higher obsession and also preventive practice scores than other designation groups. More than half of respondents preferred imported COVID-19 vaccines. Finally, organizations such as the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Public Health in Iran should increase vaccine convenience and accessibility in terms of vaccine importing, distribution, supply, and immunization service.","Oshagh, Najafi, Jafarzadeh, Gholinia, Dalaie, Jahanbazi","https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_633_21","20220609","Coronavirus disease-19; dentist; fear; health; knowledge; prevention; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32601,""
"[Deliberative dialogue with Ibero-American universities on interventions in student mental health during the COVID-19 pandemicDiÃƒÂ¡logo deliberativo com universidades ibero-americanas sobre intervenÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes em saÃƒÂºde mental dos estudantes na pandemia de COVID-19]","To contextualize a synthesis of evidence on interventions in student mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic through a deliberative dialogue with Ibero-American universities. An evidence synthesis and synchronous dialogues were previously conducted, consisting of subgroup discussions about the design and implementation of mental health interventions. An analysis of dialogic data was conducted, then organized by topic. Fifty-seven representatives of 17 public and private Ibero-American universities participated in the meeting. In terms of the design of interventions, mental health is perceived as neglected, although its profile was raised by the pandemic. Interventions are guided by detection of needs; scientific evidence is rarely used to design them. Importance was given to forming an interdisciplinary team with continuous training in order to design a specific program that also covers families and teaching/administrative staff. In terms of implementation, problems include saturation of services due to high demand and lack of basic resources among students. Regarding the provision of resources, the influence of the broader context, including the institutional context, is undeniable. The dialogues were perceived as an opportunity to build a new set of interventions. These dialogues enriched the description of interventions already described in the literature on student mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, implementing such interventions in the region means addressing previous neglect and a high level of unmet basic needs.

"Media use and Coping in Tweens during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Public and scholarly debate about the effects of media on youth has been a topic of concern since the twentieth century. These concerns were further amplified and accelerated with heavy use of and reliance on media for everyday living and learning with the homebound conditions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. With the public discourse about children's media use and school safety concerns, we conducted online interviews of 36 young people ages 9-14 years to learn about (1) their life situations, including school experience, (2) their overall media use, (3) their overall worries and difficulty with their situations, and (4) their stress management and coping strategies during the fall semester of 2020. While tweens reported using media more during the pandemic than before, media did not seem to completely displace other activities. Tweens engaged in media, non-media, and hybrid coping strategies to relieve stress, enhance their mood, and stay connected to others outside their home. This qualitative study was a first step in understanding the effect of COVID-19 on tweens within the context of their coping and resiliency building, and how media factor into these processes.","Jennings, Caplovitz","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-022-02252-x","20220609","COVID-19 pandemic; Media use; Mental health; Resilience; Tweens","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32603,""
"Trait Intolerance of Uncertainty Is Associated with Decreased Reappraisal Capacity and Increased Suppression Tendency","The COVID-19 pandemic has been a time of great uncertainty for the general population and highlights the need to understand how attitudes towards uncertainty may affect well-being. Intolerance of uncertainty is a trait associated with worry, anxiety, and mood disorders. As adaptive emotion regulation supports well-being and mental health, it is possible that intolerance of uncertainty is also associated with the ability and tendency to regulate emotions. However, the relationships between intolerance of uncertainty and widely studied cognitive emotion regulation strategies - such as reappraisal and suppression - have received little attention. In two studies that recruited participants online from the United States, we tested the hypotheses that higher trait intolerance of uncertainty would be associated with greater worry, decreased capacity and tendency to use reappraisal, and increased tendency to use suppression in daily life. Study 1 provided an initial test of our hypotheses. Study 2 was a confirmatory, preregistered study that replicated findings in a young adult sample, demonstrating that scores on the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS) were associated with greater COVID-related worry, decreased capacity to regulate negative emotions on a task that manipulated the use of reappraisal, and greater self-reported use of suppression in daily life. Together, these results indicate that intolerance of uncertainty is associated with the capacity and tendency to use emotion regulation strategies important for well-being.

"Academic Stress and Mental Well-Being in College Students: Correlations, Affected Groups, and COVID-19","Academic stress may be the single most dominant stress factor that affects the mental well-being of college students. Some groups of students may experience more stress than others, and the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic could further complicate the stress response. We surveyed 843 college students and evaluated whether academic stress levels affected their mental health, and if so, whether there were specific vulnerable groups by gender, race/ethnicity, year of study, and reaction to the pandemic. Using a combination of scores from the Perception of Academic Stress Scale (PAS) and the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS), we found a significant correlation between worse academic stress and poor mental well-being in all the students, who also reported an exacerbation of stress in response to the pandemic. In addition, SWEMWBS scores revealed the lowest mental health and highest academic stress in non-binary individuals, and the opposite trend was observed for both the measures in men. Furthermore, women and non-binary students reported higher academic stress than men, as indicated by PAS scores. The same pattern held as a reaction to COVID-19-related stress. PAS scores and responses to the pandemic varied by the year of study, but no obvious patterns emerged. These results indicate that academic stress in college is significantly correlated to psychological well-being in the students who responded to this survey. In addition, some groups of college students are more affected by stress than others, and additional resources and support should be provided to them.","Barbayannis, Bandari, Zheng, Baquerizo, Pecor, Ming","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.886344","20220609","COVID-19; Perception of Academic Stress; Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale; academic stress; college students; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32605,""
"Depression prevalence in Vietnam during the Covid-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","As of 10 October 2021, Vietnam has recorded 835,036 locally acquired Covid-19 cases including 20,520 fatalities. In response to the coronavirus illness outbreak Vietnam adopted a number of public health measures including contact tracing and testing mandatory quarantine and lockdowns. Lockdown measures during the Covid-19 pandemic are demonstrated to negatively impact psychological and mental health problems such as depression. However, the magnitude of these psychological impacts on Vietnamese during the epidemic has remained unknown. Thus, we have determined that it is necessary to perform this meta-analysis to better understand a comprehensive range of the prevalence of depression during the pandemic in Vietnam. To find relevant articles we followed the PRISMA guidelines and searched MEDLINE Scopus and PubMed from their inception to October 01 2021 confined to English language publications. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist was used to determine the possibility of bias. We pooled the included studies using the Random effect model in MedCalc version 20.014. Cochran's Q heterogeneity test and I<sup>2</sup> were used to determine statistical heterogeneity. Out of 110 articles 13 articles comprising of 27,216 participants were selected. Our meta-analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence of depression was 14.636% (95% CI: 11.521 - 18.054% I2 = 97.98% <i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). And depression is more prevalent among health workers than among non-health workers. Our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that the Vietnamese population was burdened by depression during the Covid-19 pandemic which we believe is a significant finding especially in healthcare workers. If these mental health disorders are not addressed promptly the community may suffer significant long-term mental social and economic consequences.","Duc, Chi, Quang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemep.2022.100806","20220609","Covid-19; Depression; Mental health; Vietnam","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32606,""
"Positive Youth Development and Internet Use in a Sample of Spanish Adolescents","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of Internet in the adolescent population has increased. A growing research interest has been developed about the consequences of Internet use for adolescent development. Despite most studies have examined the impact of Internet use on some indicators of psychological maladjustment, few studies have addressed the detrimental impact on the positive indicators of mental health. Positive youth development (PYD) represents a positive view of adolescent transition to adulthood which focuses on building the strengths that make young people more resistant to negative outcomes and more capable to choose a positive life direction. This study aimed to analyze the relationships between different aspects of Internet use and overall PYD in a sample of Spanish adolescents. To reach this aim, a sample of 1,038 adolescents (50.1% boys, <i>M</i> age = 14.19, <i>SD</i> = 1.38), enrolled in 14 high schools in the city of Huelva (Spain), filled in some self-report measures of PYD and Internet use and experience, such as the frequency of Internet use on weekdays or weekends, the different uses of Internet (i.e., social networks, playing online, reading, surfing or looking for information, playing or downloading music, and searching, selling, or buying products), and the subjective experience using the Internet (i.e., acknowledgment of spending too much time playing or in the networks, and being in a bad mood if they do not play or use the networks). Results of a hierarchical regression analysis showed that the more hours using Internet on weekdays, the less PYD. Moreover, the experience of feeling bad when not using the networks and spending too much time with online playing was related to lower PYD. However, the use of Internet for reading or looking for information had a positive association with PYD. These results suggest some implications for practice, such as the need to promote an adaptive Internet use, by providing a safe online context that encourages the acquisition of positive social values and life skills.","GÃƒÂ³mez-Baya, Grasmeijer, LÃƒÂ³pez-BermÃƒÂºdez, Gaspar de Matos, Mendoza","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2022.842928","20220609","Internet use; adolescence; mental health; positive youth development; social networks; videogames","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32607,""
"An exploratory study on the challenges faced and coping strategies used by preclinical medical students during the COVID-19 crisis","The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis on medical education includes reduced clinical training, a significant loss of learning time and a probable decline in confidence of being a doctor. These recent changes will have significant effect on the well-being of medical students and interventional support needs to be given early. This study explores the challenges faced and coping strategies used by preclinical medical students during the crisis. A qualitative study involving 13 preclinical medical students was conducted between August and September 2020 at a medical school in Malaysia. An in-depth individual interview via Microsoft Teams (Microsoft Corp.) with semi-structured questions was conducted. The recorded interview data were thematically analyzed using the six phases of Braun and Clarke's Thematic Analysis. The challenges faced were identified under three themes: psychosocial impact of lockdown, significant lifestyle changes, and impact on professional progression. Meanwhile, four themes emerged in coping strategies that include behavioral strategies, re-appraisal of the uncertainties of situation, active coping mechanisms, and regulation of emotion with coping reserve. There are indications that personality traits determine strategies to cope with challenges faced during the crisis which may either lead to resilience building or experiencing burnout. The findings of the study highlighted the urgent need to develop early preventive and intervention strategies to address the mental health of medical students to mitigate stress and promote positive well-being in times of crisis.","Sam, Mamat, Nadarajah","https://doi.org/10.3946/kjme.2022.222","20220609","Challenges; Coping strategies; Crisis; Preclinical medical student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32608,""
"The effect of the Baduanjin exercise on COVID-19-related anxiety, psychological well-being and lower back pain of college students during the pandemic","This study aimed to examine the effect of Baduanjin exercise on COVID-19-related anxiety, psychological well-being, and the lower back pain of college students during the coronavirus pandemic in China. The study was carried out in a temporary experimental center of four universities in Wenzhou city in Zhejiang Province, China. 387 participants who were college students were allocated to two groups: the Baduanjin exercise group(BEG, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°195); and the Control group(CG,nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°192). In this randomized controlled trial,387 participants who were college students were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to 12-week Baduanjin exercise group (BEG, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°195)and 12-week Control group(CG,nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°192).CAS(Coronavirus Anxiety Scale), PWBS(Psychological Well-being Scale),NMQ( Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire), was used to assess COVID-19-related anxiety, psychological well-being, and lower back pain at second times ( before and after the intervention). The paired t-test and an independent t-test (with a 95% confidence interval) was used to compare the outcome variables of the two groups. Within-group comparison, there was no significant difference in the control group before and after the intervention. In contrast, the Baduanjin group had a significant improvement before and after the intervention. Between-group comparison, the Baduanjin group had a significant difference from the control group. The intervention effect on the Baduanjin exercise group was remarkably better than that of the control group (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05).

"The Relationship Between Meaning in Life, Life Satisfaction and Job Satisfaction with Religious Experience in the Life of Polish Nurses","This article examines the relationship between mental health dimensions such as meaning in life, life satisfaction, and job satisfaction, and the religious experience of God's presence and God's absence in the lives of Polish nurses with a bachelor and master's degree. The research was carried out in the city of KrakÃƒÂ³w, Poland. All nurses were brought up in Catholic families and declared themselves believing and practicing. The following research tools were used: the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, the Satisfaction with Job Scale, and the Intensity of Religious Experience Scale. Data analysis showed that the education level of Polish nurses does not significantly differentiate the analyzed variables. The correlation analysis showed that the strongest relationship was between satisfaction with life and satisfaction with job in the group of nurses with a bachelor's degree and nurses with a master's degree. The regression analysis showed that the strongest predictor of God's presence in the group of nurses with a bachelor's degree wasÃ‚Â satisfaction with job, and in the group of nurses with a master's degree it was satisfaction with life. The structural equation analysis revealed that the satisfaction with life plays an important and positive mediation role between the presence of the meaning in life and the search for the meaning in life, and the experience of God's presence and the experience of God's absence in the life of nurses.","GÃ…â€šaz","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-022-01589-3","20220608","COVID-19; Education; Job satisfaction; Life satisfaction; Meaning in life; Polish nurses; Religious experience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32610,""
"Travel-weary to travel-worry: the epidemiology of injury-related traveller deaths in Australia, 2006-2017","To explore injury deaths in international and domestic interstate travellers, together with those newly arrived to Australia. A population-based cohort study of all injury-related deaths between 1January 2006 and 31 December 2017 registered with Births Death and Marriages in Australia was conducted using Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) Cause of Death information. Population data on travellers were obtained from Tourism Research Australia. There were 4,503 injury-related traveller deaths (domestic interstate:3,055; international:934; new arrivals:514). The average annual age-standardised mortality rates in domestic interstate travellers was 0.75 per 100,000, compared with 2.22 per 100,000 in international travellers. Leading causes of injury-related death were land transport incidents (n=1495, 33.2%), self-harm (n=786, 17.5%) and falls (n=513, 11.4%), with differences in mechanism by state/territory, traveller type and age group. Intentional self-harm was common amongst all visitor types, however, it was the primary cause of death in new arrivals Conclusion: Age-standardised mortality rates were almost three-fold higher in international than domestic travellers. New arrivals, international and domestic travellers have different injury profiles, and each require specific prevention strategies. While COVID has restricted travel to and within Australia, this has provided an opportunity for exploration, reflection, and consideration of risk factors for travellers, and to develop targeted injury prevention strategies for visitor types, so travel experience can be optimised and the magnitude of harm can be reduced.","Miller, Franklin, Watt, Leggat","https://doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.13217","20220609","epidemiology; incidence; injury; tourist; travel; Australia; COVID-19; Cohort Studies; Humans; Risk Factors; Travel","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","",32611,""
