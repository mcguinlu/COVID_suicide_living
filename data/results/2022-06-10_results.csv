"Healthcare system leadership and climate change: five lessons for improving health systems resiliency","Correspondence to Mr Jeff Tochkin, University of Sheffield School of Health and Related Research, 30 Regent St, Sheffield City Centre, Sheffield S1 4DA, UK;tochkinjeff@gmail.com Introduction Global climate emergencies have increased in frequency and complexity,1 2 leading to greater disruption and increasing economic consequences.3 4 Climate change is responsible for driving this increasing exposure to extreme events, impacting infectious disease transmission, and undermining peopleâ€™s mental health and livelihoods.5 As highlighted in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)6 climate change report, â€˜climate change is already affecting every inhabited region across the globe with human influence contributing to many observed changes in weather and climate extremes (p.13).â€™ Meteorological events such as heat and cold waves, drought and flooding are on a steep incline7 and have directly or indirectly affected over 2 billion people across the globe.8 Human health and the health of the environment are inextricably linked.7 The increase of disasters caused by climate change has a myriad of impacts on human health which causes further strain on global health systems.5 To date, a â€˜climate emergencyâ€™ has been declared in over 2000 jurisdictions around the world covering over 1 billion people.9 Given this, it is quite concerning and important to highlight that health services themselves are large contributors to climate change,10 accounting for 4.4% of the worldâ€™s net greenhouse gas emissions. [...]health services in Australia, Japan, Canada and the UK11â€“13 are all far above those averages. Health system leaders will need to be intimately aware of climate change and its effects on the provision of healthcare. [...]integrating environmental and social measures into their business strategy requires awareness of how their organisations are contributing to climate change and how to decrease their carbon footprint. [...]health system stakeholders must be considerate of the need for crisis leadership development and training. Because the impacts and antecedents of climate change will be less known to some stakeholders, educational interventions are required to level up knowledge of their roles in mitigating the impacts of climate change.","Tochkin, Jeff, Richmond, John, Hertelendy, Attila","https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2021-000583","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Leader;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32520,""
"Comparing the Psychosocial Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic Between Haematological Cancer and Myeloma Patients: Findings From an Online Survey","Haematological cancer is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, and multiple myeloma (MM) patients may have further risk due to older age and susceptibility to infections. This study aims to understand the pandemic's psychosocial impact on people with haematological cancers, and investigate whether MM patients experience extra stress compared to non-MM patients. The IMPaCCT survey was an international, longitudinal online survey, open to cancer patients. The first survey captured the period April-July 2020 and used quantitative and qualitative measures of quality of life (QoL), including validated tools (WHOQOL-BREF and EQ-5D-5L). Overall, 944 blood cancer patients responded (173 MM, 93 leukaemia, 117 lymphoma, 561 myeloproliferative neoplasm). Most were female, resided in the United Kingdom and did not live alone. Patients with MM were older ( p &lt; 0.001), and more of them had received their cancer diagnosis within the last 5 years ( p &lt; 0.001) than non-MM patients. Only three participants had a COVID diagnosis and none of them had MM. In both MM and non-MM groups, most participants said they would be less concerned about COVID if they did not have cancer. Although 70% of respondents reported their QoL as good/ very good, QoL scores on WHOQOL-BREF were lower in the physical, psychological and social domains than healthy prepandemic UK norms 7 . Respondents reported more satisfaction with environmental factors, such as living arrangements and access to services, however, than prepandemic norms. In both groups there were high rates of anxiety/depression (67%, severe in 5%). MM patients reported more issues with pain and mobility than non-MM patients. Overall 84% of the respondents reported COVID had changed their lives, and 63% of them found this hard to manage. Patients' most trusted sources for information about COVID-19 were healthcare providers and scientists for MM and non-MM participants (90% and 86% with high levels of trust respectively). MM patients had more trust in their friends and family for COVID information than non-MM patients (58% with high level of trust vs. 41%;p &lt; 0.001). Regarding services, 43% of participants had used telemedicine, with more MM than non-MM patients using this service (61% of MM vs. 39% of non-MM). Most reported it was a positive experience. Most participants experienced a changed format for their health appointments, particularly MM patients (69% of MM vs. 52% of non-MM). Appointments with oncologists or haematologists were most often affected. Thirty-four per cent of MM patients reported their treatments were changed or delayed, compared to 11% of non-MM blood cancer patients. This study summarises the self-reported impact of COVID on psychosocial health and care access during the early pandemic in vulnerable patient groups. Results indicate that MM patients are especially vulnerable. Better understanding the needs of these patients will enable healthcare providers to properly support them..","Quinn, S.

"Delivery of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy With Diverse, Underresourced Youth Using Telehealth: Advancing Equity Through Consumer Perspectives","The purpose of this qualitative study was to capture the perspectives of individuals representing an urban, predominantly Latinx community who are underresourced by mental health services about the use of telehealth to deliver mental health treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic required hospital- and community-based mental health programs to pivot to telehealth with alarming speed and very little opportunity to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and disparate impact on unique populations of patients. This study aimed to assess perceived strengths and limitations of telehealth mental health service delivery via qualitative focus group methods. Three focus groups were conducted with 13 youth (aged 8â€“17) who were being treated at an urban, academic childrenâ€™s hospital serving a predominantly Latinx community mental health population;two focus groups were conducted with 19 parents of said children;and one focus group was conducted with four mental health providers providing services to this population. A coding schema was designed to capture themes relevant to the following: (1) privacy and confidentiality;(2) perceived limitations of telehealth;(3) comfort with telehealth;(4) therapeutic relationship;(5) perceived strengths of telehealth;(6) perceived safety of telehealth;and (7) advice for providers engaging in telehealth. Findings were illustrative of both perceived strengths and limitations across these domains that can inform optimized telehealth mental health services moving forward.","Castro, M. J.; Rodriguez, R.

"Pandemic Stress and Coping in Adults with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities in Urban Los Angeles: A Qualitative Interview Study","Background Method Results Conclusions People with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) from low income diverse communities are experiencing the health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic most acutely.To better understand the impacts of the pandemic on the wellbeing of adults with IDD from an urban US region and how they are managing the associated disruptions, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 14 participants. A modified grounded theory approach was used to analyze data.Participants experienced stress in response to pandemic media reports and attempted to cope by sanitizing and wearing masks. These did little to reduce stress and may have added to frustration with non-compliers. Social distancing limited access to family, leading to isolation. Participants who engaged in spiritual practices, physical fitness and creative activities were more successful in coping.People with IDD may benefit from mindfulness practices or developing creative hobbies to be better equipped to cope.

"Paediatric hospital admissions for psychiatric and psychosocial reasons during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic","Increases in youth psychiatric presentations to out-patient and emergency department settings during COVID-19 have been reported. This study, using data from five hospitals in Ireland, examines changes in the number and type of paediatric admissions during COVID-19 (March 2020 â€“ February 2021) compared to the previous two years. ICD-10 classification was used to establish admissions with mental, behavioural, neuro-developmental disorders and psychosocial reasons (MBN-PS). Overall hospital admissions fell by 25.3%, while MBN-PS fell by only 2.6%, mostly during an initial lockdown. Admissions for MBN-PS increased in July-August (9.2%), increased further in September-December (28.3%), returning to pre-COVID-19 levels in Januaryâ€“February 2021. Significant increases were observed among youths with anorexia nervosa (47.8%), other eating disorders (42.9%), and admissions for anxiety (29.6%), with these effects relating to females only. Although admissions for self-harm increased (3%) and rates of ASD admissions reduced (17%), these were not statistically significant. The disproportionate increase in admissions for MBN-PS compared to medical admissions suggests an adverse effect of COVID-19 on youth mental health, for females in particular, and supports previous reports of a pandemic specific increase in eating psychopathology. Combined community and acute service delivery and capacity planning are urgently needed given the prior underfunding of services pre-pandemic.

"Psychological impact and clinical psychology responses to COVID-19: Comparative case studies from Cuba, Ethiopia, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States","This paper examines four different countries with distinct health care systems to explore both global commonalities and national differences in terms of the psychological impact and the clinical psychological response to COVID-19 (Torales et al., 2020). Through four descriptive case examples from Bangalore in India, Holguin in Cuba, Virginia in the United States, and Leicester in the United Kingdom, this paper describes and explores how the profession of clinical psychology in each country has responded and adapted to the pandemic. Each case example considers how the pandemic has led to the adoption of new ways of practice by clinical psychologists who have the potential to contribute to the provision of more equal access to mental health care and so ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all (United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3). (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Impact and Implications.-The pandemic has led to clinical psychologists changing their practice. In different countries, clinical psychologists have started to offer psychotherapy online, to use digital platforms and online media to provide psychological advice, and to rethink the way psychological therapy is delivered. These changes have the potential to make mental health care more accessible to more people and so contribute to ensuring healthy lives and well-being for all (SDG 3).

"COVID-19 - International psychology's role in addressing healthcare disparities and ethics in marginalized communities","This conceptual paper provides an overview of the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare disparities and particularly its impact on marginalized communities. This critical analysis addresses the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3, 10, and 16, which include health and well-being, reduction of inequality between and within countries, and the need for peaceful and inclusive societies. COVID-19 has infected over 189 million individuals in 220 countries and territories. The pandemic exposed long-standing healthcare inequities between and within countries. Prior to the pandemic, there were limited health and mental health services available to marginalized communities, individuals of lower socioeconomic status, and those in low- and middle-income countries;COVID-19 overburdened healthcare and mental health systems, which resulted in grave mental and physical health consequences. SDG 10 focuses on reducing inequality within and between countries and the need for advocacy for vulnerable groups. International psychology is in a unique position to address the ethical issues associated with healthcare disparities and rationing of care. SDG 3 addresses the need for good health and well-being for all. Achieving this goal is a challenge because of unequal access to healthcare and barriers to services continue, particularly in countries without universal healthcare. Goal 16 focuses on creating and promoting peaceful, just, and inclusive societies and institutions. However, access to healthcare does not erase long-standing histories of injustice, colonialism, and discrimination. Additionally, appreciation of the suspicion with which many minority communities view the healthcare system can be the first step in addressing vaccine reluctance.

"HEMO TERAPIA: IMPLEMENTAÃ‡ÃƒO DE UM PROGRAMA DE ATENÃ‡ÃƒO Ã€ SAÃšDE MENTAL DOS COLABORADORES DE UM HEMOCENTRO","A pandemia da COVID-19 trouxe alteraÃ§Ãµes e necessidades de adaptaÃ§Ãµes nas atividades laborais, que passaram a ser, na sua maioria, realizadas na modalidade online. Para muitos profissionais, essas alteraÃ§Ãµes, aliadas ao sofrimento de outras perdas e inseguranÃ§as em funÃ§Ã£o do cenÃ¡rio pandÃªmico, foram fontes de sofrimento emocional. Descrever a implementaÃ§Ã£o de um programa de atenÃ§Ã£o Ã  saÃºde mental dos colaboradores de um Hemocentro no segundo ano de pandemia da COVID-19. Um questionÃ¡rio sobre adaptaÃ§Ã£o do trabalho durante a pandemia foi respondido por 113 colaboradores: 75% relataram aumento de ansiedade;65% aumento de cansaÃ§o;61% notaram aumento de sobrecarga. Frente a essas queixas, a equipe de psicologia elaborou um plano de intervenÃ§Ã£o que constava de atividades psicoeducativas e de um grupo de apoio emocional. Inicialmente, foi realizada uma palestra com o tema sofrimento emocional no trabalho, enfocando, em especial, ansiedade, depressÃ£o e estresse. Em seguida, foi proposto um grupo de conversa sobre os impactos emocionais da pandemia, com cinco encontros de uma hora de duraÃ§Ã£o, sempre nos mesmos dias e horÃ¡rios e com os mesmos coordenadores. Ressaltou-se o fato de que o conteÃºdo do grupo seria sigiloso e que aconteceria depois do horÃ¡rio do expediente de trabalho. Antes e apÃ³s os encontros dos grupos, os participantes foram solicitados a realizar avaliaÃ§Ãµes de estresse, ansiedade e de depressÃ£o com os seguintes instrumentos: InventÃ¡rio de Sintomas de Stress para adultos de Lipp- (ISSL) e Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD). Dos dezoito colaboradores que manifestaram interesse na proposta, nove aderiam e foram distribuÃ­dos em dois grupos, sendo que um grupo contou com quatro participantes e outro, com cinco integrantes. Dos nove participantes, sete responderam os instrumentos prÃ©-grupo. Observa-se que cinco apresentavam estresse, sendo quatro na fase de resistÃªncia e um na fase de quase exaustÃ£o. Sintomas de depressÃ£o foram mais frequentes do que de ansiedade. Os tÃ³picos abordados nos encontros tangenciaram os impactos da pandemia na vida cotidiana, com acentuada incerteza a respeito do futuro e diminuiÃ§Ã£o da socializaÃ§Ã£o de das atividades de bem-estar. Em relaÃ§Ã£o ao trabalho, foram notadas dificuldades decorrentes do aumento da sobrecarga de trabalho e na interaÃ§Ã£o com outros colaboradores, que foi prejudicada devido mudanÃ§as na organizaÃ§Ã£o do trabalho e do estresse causado pela pandemia. Segundo avaliaÃ§Ã£o dos participantes, os encontros contribuÃ­ram para ventilaÃ§Ã£o de emoÃ§Ãµes, compartilhamento de experiÃªncias, aumento do sentido do trabalho, promoÃ§Ã£o apoio entre os colaboradores e desenvolvimento de estratÃ©gias para controle das atividades de forma a evitar sobrecarga. Depois do grupo, os participantes foram solicitados a responder novamente os mesmos instrumentos. PÃ³s-grupo, cinco respostas foram registradas. Observou-se uma queda nos sintomas de ansiedade e uma nÃ£o alteraÃ§Ã£o nos de depressÃ£o. O melhor resultado foi encontrado na reduÃ§Ã£o de estresse: dos cinco participantes que apresentaram quadro de estresse prÃ©-grupo, somente um participante continuava com estresse. Conclui-se que intervenÃ§Ãµes preocupadas com a saÃºde emocional dos colaboradores e alinhadas com suas necessidades podem contribuir para a prevenÃ§Ã£o e o cuidado de sintomas de depressÃ£o, ansiedade e estresse.","Santos, J.

"Mental Health and Visual Acuity in Patients with Age-related Macular Degeneration (preprint)","Background:  Visual acuity (VA) loss has been associated with depression in patients with AMD. However, previous studies did not incorporate subgroups of AMD when correlating VA and mental health. The goal of this study was to describe the relationship between VA and mental health questions in patients with different classifications of AMD, and to identify associations of mental health subscale scores. Methods: : AMD patients classified by multi-modal imaging were recruited into an AMD registry. Habitual VA was obtained by ophthalmic technicians using the Snellen VA at distance. At enrollment, patients completed the NEI-VFQ-25, which includes 25 questions regarding the patientâ€™s visual functionality. Median with interquartile-range (IQR) scores on the mental health subscale of the VFQ were calculated by AMD classification and VA groups. Univariate and multivariable general linear models were used to estimate associations between mental health scores and variables of interest. Results: : 875 patients were included in the study. Patients with bilateral GA or bilateral GA and NV AMD scored lowest on the mental health subscales with a median (IQR) of 58.2 (38-88) and 59.3 (38-88). When stratified by visual acuity, patients with a habitual VA of 20/200 or worse scored the lowest on mental health subscales scores: median of 43.8 (IQR: 31-62). Patients with a VA of 20/20 scored the highest: 87.5 (IQR: 81-94). Habitual VA of the better- and worse-seeing eye and AMD classification were significantly associated with mental health subscale scores (all p&lt;0.0001 in both the univariate and multivariable analysis, except the VA of the worse-seeing eye in multivariable model p=0.027). Patients enrolled during the COVID pandemic had mental health scores that were 2.7 points lower than prior to the pandemic, but this difference was not significant in univariate (p=0.300) or multivariable analysis (p=0.202). Conclusion:  There is a significant association between mental health questionnaire scores and AMD classification, as well as VA in both the better and worse-seeing eyes in patients with AMD. It is important for clinicians to recognize feelings of worry/ frustration in these patients, so they can be appropriately referred, screened, and treated for mental health problems.","Fonteh, Cheryl, Mathias, Marc, Mandava, Naresh, Manoharan, Niranjan, Lynch, Anne, Navo, Roxanne, Patnaik, Jennifer","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1713337/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32528,""
"Major amputation needed to treat purulent tenosynovitis and necrotizing fasciitis in a patient diagnosed with severe COVID-19: a case report (preprint)","Background:  Peripheral human bite wounds are rarely serious and are typically treated medically, with the most complex cases requiring only minor amputation or excision of the infected site. There are few to no reports documenting the development of purulent tenosynovitis, necrotizing fasciitis, and osteomyelitis from these lesions. Major amputations are required only rarely in these cases. Case Presentation: A 71-year-old woman presented with an uncontrolled infection following a self-inflicted bite wound to her left middle finger. A bacterial culture of the lesion revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The infection could not be controlled with antibiotics or additional interventions, including debridement and minor amputation. She contracted severe COVID-19 while in the hospital which limited the available treatment options. In an attempt to control the infection, the patient ultimately underwent a major amputation of the distal left forearm. While recovering from the procedure, the patient succumbed to septic shock and cardiopulmonary arrest Conclusions The unusual progression of this case may be attributed to the interventions required to treat acute COVID-19 as well as a variety of confounding factors. For example, vasopressors and steroids used to treat severely-ill patients compromise the local and systemic physiologic responses to acute bacterial infection. It is important to reconsider clinical expectations during the pandemic and intervene as early as possible to prevent ongoing damage and clinical deterioration.","Toga, Akira, Balaji, Ayush, Nagura, Shigeki","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1709470/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32529,""
"Incidence, determinants and serological correlates of reactive symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: a population-based longitudinal study (COVIDENCE UK) (preprint)","Prospective population-based studies investigating associations between reactive symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and serologic responses to vaccination are lacking. We therefore conducted such a study in 9003 adults from the United Kingdom (UK) general population receiving SARS-COV-2 vaccines as part of the national vaccination programme. Data relating to incidence and type of reactive symptoms after vaccination were captured using online questionnaires, along with information on 56 potential determinants of symptom risk. Titres of combined IgG/IgA/IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein were determined in eluates of dried blood spots collected from all participants before and after vaccination. 4262 (47.3%) participants experienced systemic reactive symptoms after a first vaccine dose. Factors associating with lower risk of such symptoms included older age (aOR per additional 10 years of age 0.85, 95% CI 0.81â€“0.90), male vs. female sex (aOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.53â€“0.65) and receipt of an mRNA vaccine vs. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (0.29, 0.26â€“0.32 for BNT162b2;0.06, 0.01â€“0.26 for mRNA-1273). Higher risk of such symptoms was associated with a history of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to vaccination (2.23, 1.78â€“2.81) and presence vs. absence of self-rated anxiety or depression at cohort enrolment (1.24, 1.12â€“1.39). Post-vaccination anti-S titres were higher among participants who experienced reactive symptoms after vaccination vs. those who did not (P &lt; 0.001). We conclude that factors influencing risk of systemic symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination include demographic characteristics, pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 serostatus and vaccine type. Participants experiencing reactive symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination had higher post-vaccination titres of IgG/A/M anti-S antibodies. Improved public understanding of the frequency of reactogenic symptoms and their positive association with vaccine immunogenicity could potentially increase vaccine uptake.","Holt, Hayley, Jolliffe, David, Talaei, Mohammad, Faustini, Sian, Vivaldi, Giulia, Greenig, Matthew, Lyons, Ronan, Griffiths, Christopher, Kee, Frank, Sheikh, Aziz, Richter, Alex, Davies, Gwyneth, Shaheen, Seif, Martineau, Adrian","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1692845/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32530,""
"Health behaviours the month prior to COVID-19 infection and the development of self-reported long COVID and specific long COVID symptoms: A longitudinal analysis of 1,811 UK adults (preprint)","Background:  The aim of this study was to examine whether specific health behaviours in the month preceding infection with COVID-19 act as upstream risk factors long COVID as well and three specific long COVID symptoms.Methods1,811 UK adults from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study and who had previously been infected with COVID-19 were analysed. Health behaviours in the month before infection were weekly exercise frequency, days of fresh air per week, sleep quality, smoking, consuming more than the number of recommended alcoholic drinks per week (&gt;14), and the number of mental health care behaviours (e.g., online mental health programme). Logistic regressions controlling for covariates (e.g., COVID-19 infection severity and pre-existing health conditions) examined the impact of health behaviours on long COVID and three long COVID symptoms (difficulty with mobility, cognition, and self-care).Results In the month before infection with COVID-19, poor quality sleep increased the odds of long COVID (odds ratio [OR]: 3.53;(95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01 to 6.21), as did average quality sleep (OR: 2.44;95% CI: 1.44 to 4.12). Having smoked (OR: 8.39;95% CI: 1.86 to 37.91) increased and meeting recommended weekly physical activity guidelines (3+ hours) (OR: 0.05;95% CI: 0.01 to 0.39) reduced the likelihood of difficulty with self-care (e.g., washing all over or dressing) amongst those with long COVID. Conclusions Results point to the importance of sleep quality for long COVID, potentially helping to explain previously demonstrated links between stress and long COVID. Results also suggest that exercise and smoking may be modifiable risk factors for preventing the development of difficulty with self-care.","Paul, Elise, Fancourt, Daisy","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1684030/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32531,""
"Psychometric Evaluation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale Among Syrian Population (preprint)","Fear is a common emotional reaction to an impending threat like the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus. A fear of COVID-19 Scale has been developed to evaluate the severity of COVID-19-related fear. This study investigated the psychometric characteristics a Syrian Arabic version of the scale to give additional validation for the Arabic FCV-19S. The fear of COVID-19 Scale was translated and validated in Syrian context. The sample is comprised of 1637 Syrian individuals, who have participated in this online survey. The results were compared with their responses to the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and the Satisfaction with Life scale. Cronbachâ€™s alpha for the Syrian version of the fear of COVID-19 scale was determined to 0.84. The scaleâ€™s ratings showed a significant negative relationship with life satisfaction and a significant positive association with sub-scales of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the Syrian version of the fear of COVID-19 Scale has a unidimensional structure which fits the data well. The scale has useful psychometric characteristics and can be employed to evaluate the severity of fear of COVID-19 among Syrian populations.","Khadour, Fater, Khadour, Younes, Ebrahem, B.

"The effect of resource loss on depression and peritraumatic distress during the early period of the COVID-19: considering the pandemic-situational and social context (preprint)","Background:  The public experienced loss of resources, including their health and property during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Conservation of Resources (COR) Theory is a useful tool to explain the effect of resource loss on mental health. This paper examines the e<U+FB00>ect of resource loss on depression and peritraumatic distress considering the situational and social context of the COVID-19 pandemic, applying COR theory. Methods: : An online survey was conducted for Gyeonggi residents over eight days (5 October to 13 October 2020) when the second wave of the COVID-19 in South Korea declined;2,548 subjects were included in the hierarchical linear regression analysis. Results: : COVID-19 related experiences (infection /isolation /quarantine), resource losses (e.g., <U+FB01>nancial burden, deterioration of health, and decline of self-esteem), and fear of stigma were related to elevated levels of peritraumatic distress and depression. A higher level of risk perception was associated with higher peritraumatic distress, and people with reduced income or job loss showed a higher level of depression. Social support was a protective factor for mental health. Conclusions: : This study indicates that COVID-19-related experiences and loss of daily resources require attention when considering mental health parameters during COVID-19. Moreover, it is important to monitor the mental health of medically and socially vulnerable groups and those who have lost resources due to the pandemic and to provide these individuals with social support or <U+FB01>nancial compensation.","Lee, Yubin, Hyun, Yoorim, You, Myoungsoon, Lee, Heeyoung, Han, Jin-Ok, Seo, Suin","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1682985/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32533,""
"Stress and depression of university students in Egypt during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background:  Mental health issues have been increasing globally, especially among university students. The pandemic of COVID-19 has aggravated this pre-existing and serious problem. This study aimed to assess the stress and depression levels and mental health status of Egyptian university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : A cross-sectional online survey was conducted on medical and non-medical Egyptian university students. A total of 1470 participants completed the electronic anonymous online survey containing Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Perceived Stress Scale(PSS). Results: : Of the 1470 participants, 10.9% have moderately severe depression and 6.1% have severe depression. Moreover, 77.6% reported moderate stress, 16.3% reported low stress, and 6.2% reported high stress. There was strong positive correlation between depression and stress among participants (r = 0.815) (p &lt; 0.001). The significant predictors for depression were age between 18 and 20 years, female sex, presence of chronic diseases, and presence of friends or relatives diagnosed with COVID-19. The significant predictors for stress were age between 18 and 20 years, female sex, presence of friends or relatives diagnosed with COVID-19, and medical faculties. Conclusions:  During the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of university students of Egypt showed moderate to high level of stress, and about one-third of them had moderate to severe depression. Younger age, female sex and having a relative or friend diagnosed with COVID-19 were significant predictors for high stress level and depression. Psychological interventions for university students during the COVID-19 pandemic are strongly recommended to promote their mental health and improve academic achievement.","Soliman, Asmaa Mohamed Ahmed, Mabrouk, Shimaa Elsayed Mohammed, Hagag, Radwa Samir, Ghandour, Ahmed, Mekhamier, Hanem Awad, Elsherbeny, Enas Elsayed","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1671313/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32534,""

"Long-COVID in Scotland Study: a nationwide, population cohort study (preprint)","BACKGROUNDWith increasing numbers of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, a better understanding of long-COVID is required to inform health and social care support.METHODSA nationwide, ambidirectional, population cohort was constructed of adults in Scotland with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test from April 2020 to May 2021 and a matched, never infected comparison group. Recovery status, symptoms, quality of life, impaired daily activities, hospitalization and death were ascertained via repeated self-completed questionnaires, at 6, 12 and 18-months follow-up, and linkage to hospitalization and death records.RESULTSThe cohort comprised 31,486 symptomatic and 1,795 asymptomatic infected individuals, and 62,957 never infected individuals. Of the former, 1,856 (6%) had not recovered and 13,350 (42%) only partially. Lack of recovery was associated with severe (hospitalized) infection, older age, female sex, deprivation, respiratory disease, depression and multimorbidity. Twenty-four persistent symptoms were independently associated with previous infection including breathlessness (OR 3.44, 95% CI 3.29â€“3.59), palpitations (OR 2.51, OR 2.37â€“2.67), chest pain (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.97â€“2.24), and confusion (OR 2.93, 95% CI 2.78â€“3.08). Pre-infection vaccination was associated with reduced risk of seven symptoms. Previous symptomatic infection was also associated with poorer quality of life (EQ-5D median 75 vs 80, p &lt; 0.001) and impairment across all daily activities. Asymptomatic infection was not associated with adverse outcomes.CONCLUSIONSThe sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection are wide-ranging and not explained by confounding. The risk of long-COVID is greater following severe infections requiring hospitalization and absent following asymptomatic infection, whilst pre-infection vaccination may be protective.","Pell, Jill, Hastie, Claire, Lowe, David, McAuley, Andrew, Winter, Andrew, Mills, Nicholas, Black, Corri, Scott, Janet, O'Donnell, Catherine, Blane, David, Browne, Susan, Ibbotson, Tracy","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1656915/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32536,""
"Psychometric Properties of the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) among Malaysians during COVID-19: A Methodological Study (preprint)","Depression, anxiety, and stress continue to be among the largest burdens of disease, globally. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale â€“ 21 Items (DASS-21) is a shortened version of DASS-41 developed to measure these mental health conditions. The DASS-41 has strong evidence of validity and reliability in multiple contexts. However, the DASS-21, and the resulting item properties, have been explored less in terms of modern test theories. One such theory is Item Response Theory (IRT), and we use IRT models to explore latent item and person traits of each DASS-21 sub-scale among people living in Malaysia. Specifically, we aimed to assess Classical Test Theory and IRT properties including dimensionality, internal consistency (reliability), and item-level properties. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study and sent link-based questionnaires to people aged 18 and above in a private university and requested roll out the link. Overall and individual subscalesâ€™ Cronbachâ€™s alpha of the DASS-21 indicates an excellent internal consistency. The average inter-item correlation and corrected inter-item correlations for each of the sub-scales indicated acceptable discrimination. On average, DASS-21 total scores and sub-scale scores were significantly higher among female participants than males. The Graded Response Model had a better empirical fit to sub-scale response data. Raw summated and latent (IRT estimated) scores of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress sub-scales, and overall DASS-21 were strongly correlated. Thus, this study provides evidence of validity supporting the use of the DASS-21 as a mental health screening tool among Malaysians. Specifically, the standard error of measurement was minimized to provide robust evidence of potential utility in identifying participants who are and are not experiencing these mental health issues. Additional research is warranted to ensure that test content is culturally appropriate and accurately measuring cultural norms of depression, anxiety, and stress.","Thiyagarajan, Arulmani, James, Tyler, Marzo, Roy","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1232368/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32537,""
"Reductions in Anxiety, Depression and Insomnia in Health Care Workers using a non-pharmaceutical intervention (preprint)","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant medical and psychological challenges worldwide, and not only exceeded the capacity of hospitals and intensive care units but also an individuals&rsquo;ability to cope with life. Health-care workers have continued to provide care for patients despite exhaustion, fear of transmission to themselves and their family, illness or death of friends and colleagues, and losing many patients. They have also faced additional stress and anxiety due to long shifts combined with unprecedented population restrictions, including personal isolation. In this study, we study the effect of an app-based Yoga of Immortals (YOI) intervention on mental health of healthcare workers. In this study, the health care workers were digitally recruited, and their psychological parameters were measured using validated questionaries. The participants were randomly grouped into control and test groups. The validated psychological measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) scales. The digital YOI intervention significantly reduced the anxiety, depression symptoms, and insomnia in healthcare workers of all age groups. In contrast, there was no improvement in the control group. This study details the effectiveness of an app-based YOI intervention in healthcare workers.","Currie, Katherine, Gupta, Babu, Shivanand, Ishan, Desai, Amit, Bhatt, Shweta, Tunuguntla, Hari, Verma, Sadhna","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202205.0291.v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32538,""
"Changes in childrenâ€™s wellbeing in Bradford during COVID-19: The Born in Bradford COVID-19 longitudinal research study (preprint)","Background:  Concerns have been raised about the potential impact of COVID-19 and associated lockdown measures on child mental wellbeing, but emerging evidence suggests mixed results and there is a dearth of information from ethnically diverse samples. The current study aims to explore the impact of the pandemic on wellbeing using longitudinal data collected from the multi-ethnic Born in Bradford family cohort study. Methods: : Within-child changes in wellbeing were explored using data collected pre-pandemic and again during the first UK lockdown for 500 children aged 7-13 from a range of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, using self-reported feelings of happiness and sadness. Associations between changes in wellbeing, demographic factors, quality of social relationships and physical activity levels were explored using multinomial logistic regression models. Results: : In this sample, 55% of children reported no change in their wellbeing from pre-pandemic to during the first lockdown (n=264). Children of Pakistani heritage were more than twice as likely to report feeling sad less often than White British children (RRR: 2.61, 95% CI: 1.23, 5.51) during the first lockdown. Those who reported being left out by other children before the pandemic were over three times as likely than those who did not (RRR: 3.72: 1.51, 9.20) to report feeling sad less often during the pandemic. Around a third of children reported feeling happier (n=152, 31.6%), but these changes did not relate to any of the explanatory variables included in this analysis. Conclusion:  Many children in this study reported no changes in their wellbeing during the first UK lockdown compared to before the pandemic and some described improved wellbeing. These findings suggest that children have coped well with the significant changes over the past year, though targeted support, particularly for those children who felt excluded before the pandemic, would be beneficial.","Pybus, Katie, Kelly, Brian, Hou, Bo, Ajebon, Mildred, McIvor, Claire, Bingham, Daniel, McEachan, Rosemary, Pickett, Kate, Dickerson, Josie","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.17642.2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32539,""

"Increased ambulance attendances related to suicide and self-injury in response to the pandemic in Australia (preprint)","Investigating the change in the trend of ambulance service utilization for suicide in response to the COVID-19 pandemic can clarify the impact of the pandemic on acute health services. To determine whether the trends of the ambulance attendances related to self-injury and suicide changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We extracted the data from the National Ambulance Surveillance System in Australia between March 2018 and March 2021 to examine the trajectory of the ambulance attendances related to self-injury and suicide. The results indicate that the number of ambulance attendances related to self-injury, suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt increased immediately during the first quarter since the outbreak and stayed higher over the at least 12 months. Notably, the post-outbreak surge in ambulance attendances associated with these mental health crises did not continue to escalate further. To sum up, the overall increase in ambulance attendances may reflect increased distress in the community, but also signify disruptions of other non-emergency health services. In contrast to recent evidence for the suicide rate being unchanged during the pandemic, our findings provide a different perspective on the impact of the pandemic on mental health services.

"Clearing the Fog: A Systematic Review on Cognitive Dysfunction in COVID-19 (preprint)","ABSTRACT Objective The systematic review aims to examine the association between COVID-19 and cognitive dysfunction, including the link between the severity of COVID-19 and the occurrence of cognitive impairment and the potential pathophysiological mechanisms related to brain fog among COVID-19 patients. Methods PubMed, Oxford University Press, ProQuest Health and Medical Complete, ScienceDirect, Ovid, HERDIN, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library databases were accessed to retrieve literature using the PRISMA guidelines. Results After critical appraisal, thirteen full journal articles were included in the study. The studies showed the most frequent cognitive impairment are attention, memory, and executive function in COVID-19 patients. Compared with healthy controls (HC) in 3 out of 4 studies, cognitive impairment was only evident in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, two studies showed no correlation between brain fog and depression, and five studies showed a link between the severity of COVID-19 infection and cognitive impairment. Cases ranging from mild to severe illness presented manifestations of brain fog. However, a disparity in the evidence of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and cognitive dysfunction exists, prompting the need to investigate further. Additionally, recent studies provide insufficient evidence for direct central nervous system invasion, and there are emerging studies that contrast the presumed pathogenesis of neurological complications from neuroinflammation. Conclusion There is an association between COVID-19 and cognitive dysfunction. Manifestation of cognitive dysfunction is present regardless of illness severity. Moreover, there are existing pathophysiological mechanisms of the Coronavirus that lead to cognitive dysfunction in COVID-19 patients;however, additional studies are required to substantiate such mechanisms further.

"Depressive and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: A two-year follow-up (preprint)","Background There has been much research into the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and how it is related to time-invariant individual characteristics (e.g. age and gender). However, there is still a lack of research showing long-term trajectories of mental health across different stages of the pandemic. And little is known regarding the longitudinal association of time-varying contextual and individual factors (e.g. COVID-19 policy response and pandemic intensity) with mental health outcomes. This study aimed to provide a longitudinal profile of how depressive and anxiety symptoms changed by month between March 2020 and April 2022, and to examine their longitudinal associations with time-varying contextual and individual level factors. Methods and findings Drawing data from a large panel study of over 58,000 adults living in England, we showed that mental health changes were largely in line with changes in COVID-19 policy response and pandemic intensity. Further, data were analysed using fixed-effects, with models fitted separately across three stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that more stringent policy response was associated with increased mental health symptoms, in particular during lockdown periods. Higher COVID-19 deaths were also associated with poorer mental health, but this association weakened over time. Finally, there was also evidence for the longitudinal association of mental health with individual level factors, including confidence in government/healthcare/essentials, COVID-19 knowledge, COVID-19 stress, COVID-19 infection and social support. Conclusions Our results provided empirical evidence on how changes in contextual and individual level factors were related to depressive and anxiety symptoms. While some factors clearly acted as consistent predictors of mental health during a pandemic, other factors were dependent on the specific situations occurring within society. This could provide important implications for policy making and for a better understanding of mental health of the general public during a national or global health crisis.","Bu, Feifei, Steptoe, Andrew, Fancourt, Daisy","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.24.22275529","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32543,""
"Covid-19 is a leading cause of death in children and young people ages 0-19 years in the United States (preprint)","Covid-19 has caused more than 1 million deaths in the US, including at least 1,433 deaths among children and young people (CYP) aged 0-19 years. Deaths among US CYP are rare in general, and so we argue here that the mortality burden of Covid-19 in CYP is best understood in the context of all other causes of CYP death. Using publicly available data from the National Center for Health Statistics, and comparing to mortality in 2019, the immediate pre-pandemic period, we find that Covid-19 is a leading cause of death in CYP aged 0-19 years in the US, ranking #9 among all causes of deaths, #5 in disease related causes of deaths (excluding accidents, assault and suicide), and #1 in deaths caused by infectious / respiratory diseases. Due to the impact of mitigations such as social distancing and our comparison of a single disease (Covid-19) to groups of causes such as deaths from pneumonia and influenza, these rankings are likely conservative lower bounds. Our findings underscore the importance of continued vaccination campaigns for CYP over 5 years of age in the US and for effective Covid-19 vaccines for under 5 year olds.","Flaxman, Seth, Whittaker, Charles, Semenova, Elizaveta, Rashid, Theo, Parks, Robbie, Blenkinsop, Alexandra, Unwin, Juliette, Mishra, Swapnil, Bhatt, Samir, Gurdasani, Deepti, Ratmann, Oliver","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.23.22275458","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32544,""

They also had an increased risk of shortness of breath (HR=1.43, CI, 1.14-1.80 and HR=1.70, CI, 1.46-1.98 for omicron and delta, respectively, relative to negative). Omicron was related with a similar, and no increased risk of musculoskeletal pain, cough, heart palpitations, anxiety/depression when compared to delta and when compared to test negative. The risk of complaints was similar for omicron and delta and decreased over time for the post-covid periods 14-30 days, 30-90 days and 90 days or more. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 omicron and delta infection are associated with similarly increased risks of post-covid complaints when compared to non-infected. The omicron variant will likely lead to a temporarily increased burden on healthcare services.","Magnusson, Karin, Kristoffersen, Doris Tove, Dellâ€™Isola, Andrea, Kiadaliri, Ali, Turkiewicz, Aleksandra, Runhaar, Jos, Bierma-Zeinstra, Sita, Englund, Martin, Magnus, Per Minor, Kinge, Jonas Minet","https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.23.22275445","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: EuropePMC; 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32545,""
"High prevalence of burnout syndrome among medical and nonmedical residents during the COVID-19 pandemic (preprint)","Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, health professionals have been working under extreme conditions, increasing the risk of physical and mental illness. We evaluated the prevalence of burnout and its associated factors among postgraduate student residents in health professions during the global health crisis. Methods: Healthcare residents were recruited from all across Brazil between July and September 2020 through digital forms containing instruments for assessing burnout (Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI)), resilience (brief resilient coping scale (BRCS)) and anxiety, stress and depression (depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)). Additionally, the relationships between burnout and chronic diseases, autonomy and educational adequacy in the residency programme, personal protective equipment (PPE), workload and care for patients with COVID-19 were evaluated. The chi-square test, Studentâ€™s t test, Pearsonâ€™s correlation test and logistic regression were performed. Results: A total of 1,313 participants were included: mean (standard deviation) age, 27.8 (4.4) years;female gender, 78.1%;white race, 59.3%;and physicians, 51.3%. The overall prevalence of burnout was 33.4%. The odds (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]) of burnout were higher in the presence of pre-existing diseases (1.76 [1.26â€“2.47]) and weekly work &gt; 60 h (1.36 [1.03â€“1.79]) and were lower in the presence of high resilience (0.84 [0.81â€“0.88]), autonomy (0.87 [0.81â€“0.93]), and educational structure (0.77 [0.73â€“0.82]), adequate availability of PPE (0.72 [0.63â€“0.83]) and non-white race (0.63 [0.47â€“0.83]). Burnout was correlated with anxiety (r = 0.47;p &lt; 0.05), stress (r: 0.58;p &lt; 0.05) and depression (r: 0.65;p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: We observed a high prevalence of burnout among residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual characteristics and conditions related to the work environment were associated with a higher or lower occurrence of the syndrome.","Pinho, R. D. N. L.; Costa, T. F.; Silva, N.

"Public Relations and Stakeholder Engagement during COVID-19: A Study of Jaipur Malls (preprint)","The COVID-19 Pandemic brought sudden unexpected changes in the lives of every person. The outbreak of the virus just didnâ€™t shut down the people within their four walls affecting their mental and heath conditions, but it had also shut down all doors of corporate operations, resulting in tremendous damage to the world economy, forcing some of the corporates to adopt severe cost-cutting measures. The bitter COVID times forced every organization to immediately adopt situation-based Stakeholder Management tools and strategies to address their growing tensions and to reach out to them about the new work models. Every organization adopted all possible offline and online Crisis Management strategies in the direction of Stakeholder Management. The research article tries to study the various Communication Strategies employed by the malls, being one of the most prominent business hub area during the critical times to ensure that a consistent channel of communication is maintained with their stakeholders. As a part of the study, the researcher seeks the insights of the top-most professionals of the PR & Management Team of the leading malls of Jaipur to find out their perception regarding the effectiveness of the role played by the Communication Professionals during the COVID-19 Lockdown Period to keep the stakeholders informed and engaged. The findings revealed that the employment of innovative PR and Management Strategies by the malls proved out to be one of the strongest relationship building measures during the pandemic period to reach out to the stakeholders in a more compassionate and engaging manner.","Mukherjee, Tanushri","https://www.google.com/search?q=Public+Relations+and+Stakeholder+Engagement+during+COVID-19:+A+Study+of+Jaipur+Malls+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint; Publication details: SSRN; 2020.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32547,""
"Pandemic Depression: COVID-19 and the Mental Health of the Self-Employed (preprint)","We investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on self-employed peopleâ€™s mental health. Using representative longitudinal survey data from Germany, we reveal differential effects by gender: whereas self-employed women experienced a substantial deterioration in their mental health, self-employed men displayed no significant changes up to early 2021. Financial losses are important in explaining these differences. In addition, we find larger mental health responses among self-employed women who were directly affected by government-imposed restrictions and bore an increased childcare burden due to school and daycare closures. We also find that self-employed individuals who are more resilient coped better with the crisis.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the research activity and working experience of clinical academics, with a focus on gender and ethnicity: a qualitative study in the UK","To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the research activity and working experience of clinical academics, with a focus on gender and ethnicity. Qualitative study based on interviews and audio/written diary data. UK study within clinical academia. Purposive sample of 82 clinical academics working in medicine and dentistry across all career stages ranging from academic clinical fellows and doctoral candidates to professors. Qualitative semistructured interviews (n=68) and audio diary data (n=30; including 16 participants who were also interviewed) collected over an 8-month period (January-September 2020), thematically analysed. 20 of 30 (66.6%) audio diary contributors and 40 of 68 (58.8%) interview participants were female. Of the participants who disclosed ethnicity, 5 of 29 (17.2%) audio diary contributors and 19/66 (28.8%) interview participants identified as Black, Asian or another minority (BAME). Four major themes were identified in relation to the initial impact of COVID-19 on clinical academics: opportunities, barriers, personal characteristics and social identity, and fears and uncertainty. COVID-19 presented opportunities for new avenues of research. Barriers included access to resources to conduct research and the increasing teaching demands. One of the most prominent subthemes within 'personal characteristics' was that of the perceived negative impact of the pandemic on the work of female clinical academics. This was attributed to inequalities experienced in relation to childcare provision and research capacity. Participants described differential experiences based upon their gender and ethnicity, noting intersectional identities. While there have been some positives afforded to clinical academics, particularly for new avenues of research, COVID-19 has negatively impacted workload, future career intentions and mental health. BAME academics were particularly fearful due to the differential impact on health. Our study elucidates the direct and systemic discrimination that creates barriers to women's career trajectories in clinical academia. A flexible, strategic response that supports clinical academics in resuming their training and research is required. Interventions are needed to mitigate the potential lasting impact on capacity from the pandemic, and the potential for the loss of women from this valuable workforce.","Finn, Crampton, Buchanan, Balogun, Tiffin, Morgan, Taylor, Soto, Kehoe","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057655","20220608","COVID-19; medical education &amp; training; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32549,""
"Web-based physical activity interventions are feasible and beneficial solutions to prevent physical and mental health declines in community-dwelling older adults during isolation periods","Periods of prolonged lockdown increase the risk of physical inactivity, which can contribute to physical decline among older adults. Online technology could be an innovative solution to promote physical activity habits in this context. The goal of this study was to examine and compare the acceptability, feasibility and potential benefits of two modalities of web-based PA interventions in older adults during the COVID-19 lockdown. Eighty-three non-physically active community-dwelling older adults (age 60 and over) were randomized to a 12-week web-based PA intervention delivered either in a Live Group (LG; n=38) or a Recorded Group (RG; n=45). Acceptability, feasibility as well as functional capacities, physical performance, quality of life and PA level were assessed pre- and post-intervention. There were fewer dropouts in the LG than RG (LG:16% vs. RG:46%). However, adherence rate (LG:89%; RG:81%), level of satisfaction (LG:77% vs. RG:64%) and enjoyment (LG:68% vs. RG:62%) were similar across groups, even if the participants found the intervention slightly difficult (LG:58% vs. RG:63%). Both groups significantly improved on functional capacities, physical performance and quality of life. Only the LG showed significant improvements in perceived health and PA level. The LG showed greater improvements in physical performance and quality of life than the RG. Web-based PA interventions are feasible, acceptable and beneficial for improving functional capacities and physical performance during periods of lockdown. However, the interactive web and live modalities appear to be more effective for promoting some of these outcomes than recorded and individual modalities.","Granet, PeyrusquÃƒÂ©, Ruiz, Buckinx, Abdelkader, Dang-Vu, Sirois, Gouin, Pageaux, Aubertin-Leheudre","https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glac127","20220608","COVID-19 lockdown; aging; exercise; muscle function; web-based intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32550,""
"Feasibility, Acceptability, and Preliminary Efficacy of an App-Based Meditation Intervention to Decrease Firefighter Psychological Distress and Burnout: A One-Group Pilot Study","Firefighters are often exposed to occupational stressors that can result in psychological distress (ie, anxiety and depression) and burnout. These occupational stressors have only intensified with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and will likely persist in the postpandemic world. To address occupational stressors confronting firefighters, we pilot tested a novel, cost-effective, smartphone app-based meditation intervention created by Healthy Minds Innovations that focused on mindfulness (awareness) training along with practices designed to cultivate positive relationships (connection), insight into the nature of the self (insight), and a sense of purpose in the context of challenge (purpose) with a sample of professional firefighters from a large metropolitan area in southwestern United States. A total of 35 participants were recruited from a closed online group listserv and completed the self-guided 10-unit meditation app over the course of 10 days, at 1 unit per day. We assessed anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, burnout, and negative affect as well as saliva diurnal cortisol rhythm, an objective indicator of stress-related biology, before and after use of the meditation app. This study demonstrated the meditation app was both feasible and acceptable for use by the majority of firefighters. We also found significant reductions in firefighters' anxiety (P=.01), burnout (P=.05), and negative affect (P=.04), as well as changes in cortisol diurnal rhythm, such as waking cortisol (P=.02), from before to after use of the meditation app. Our study findings call for future research to demonstrate the efficacy of this meditation app to reduce psychological distress and burnout in firefighters.","Pace, Zeiders, Cook, Sarsar, Hoyt, Mirin, Wood, Tatar, Davidson","https://doi.org/10.2196/34951","20220608","anxiety; burnout; cortisol; digital health; firefighter; mHealth; meditation; mental health; mobile health; smartphone app; stress management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32551,""
"Socio-ecological Resilience Relates to Lower Internalizing Symptoms among Adolescents during the Strictest Period of COVID-19 Lockdown in PerÃƒÂº","The COVID-19 pandemic has touched the lives of adolescents around the world. This short-termÃ‚Â longitudinal, observational study followed 1,334 adolescents (11-17 yo) to investigate whether social-ecological resilience relates to intra- and inter-personal resources and/or the caregiver relationship relates to changes in internalizing symptoms during five stressful weeks of COVID-19 lockdown in PerÃƒÂº. In this work, we contextualize social-ecological resilience in relation to culturally-relevant personal and caregiver resources that youth can use to adapt to stressful situations. We found that adolescents who reported higher levels of personal, caregiver, and overall resilience had lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms at week six. We also find that personal, caregiver, and overall resilience moderated the change in anxiety symptoms from week 6 to week 11 of lockdown in 2020. Our findings underscore the importance of social-ecological resilience related to both intra/interpersonal resources and the caregiver relationship for minimizing the harmful impacts of COVID-19 on adolescent internalizing symptoms.","Guazzelli Williamson, Berger, Barendse, Pfeifer, Dahl, Magis-Weinberg","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10802-022-00928-y","20220608","Adolescence; Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; LMICs; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32552,""
"The network of psychosocial health in middle-aged and older adults during the first COVID-19 lockdown","Psychosocial health problems, such as social isolation, loneliness, depression and anxiety, have gained attention during the COVID-19 pandemic and are commonly co-occurring. We investigated the network of psychosocial health constructs during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study included 4553 participants (mean age: 68.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.2Ã‚Â years, 56% women) from the prospective Rotterdam Study, who filled out a questionnaire between April and July 2020, the time of the first COVID-19 wave in the Netherlands. Psychosocial health constructs included were depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale), anxiety symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale), loneliness (University of California, Los Angeles loneliness scale), social connectedness (five items) and pandemic-related worry (five items). We estimated mixed graphical models to assess the network of items of these constructs and whether age and sex affected the network structure. Within the network of psychosocial constructs, a higher depressive symptoms score was particularly associated with items of loneliness and social connectedness, whereas overall anxiety was particularly associated with items of pandemic-related worry. Between people from different sex and age, the network structure significantly altered. This study demonstrates that within the same network of psychosocial health constructs, depressive symptom score is particularly associated with loneliness and social connectedness, whereas anxiety symptom score is associated with pandemic-related worry during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Our results support that psychosocial constructs should be considered in conjunction with one another in prevention and treatment efforts in clinical care, and that these efforts need to be tailored to specific demographic groups.","de Feijter, Kocevska, Blanken, van der Velpen, Ikram, Luik","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-022-02308-9","20220608","COVID-19 pandemic; Lockdown; Middle-aged and elderly; Network analyses; Population-based; Psychosocial health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32553,""
"Telemedicine in the treatment of addictions","The purpose of this update is to provide an overview of recent research publications (January 2020-January 2022) on real-time telemedicine solutions for the management of addictions (alcohol, tobacco, opioids, and other drugs). Motivational interviewing by real-time telemedicine showed effectiveness in youth and adults for risky alcohol use and alcohol use disorders, even when a concurrent mental health disorder exists. Live telemedicine is well accepted for managing tobacco use disorders. The range of interventions for treating opioid use disorder by real-time telemedicine is large and has been increased due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (prescription of opioid agonists, peer-to-peer support, counseling, and group therapy). The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the implementation of real-time telemedicine and, in parallel, research has been conducted to test its effectiveness. Videoconferencing and telephone interventions are supported by solid evidence for risky alcohol use and alcohol use disorder, tobacco use disorder and opioid use disorder. The Integration of other types of telemedicine (asynchronous telemedicine and remote monitoring) and with the entire health system is lacking. Many areas and vulnerable populations (e.g., homeless, elderly, and cannabis use disorders) need more attention.","Caballeria, LÃƒÂ³pez-Pelayo, Matrai, Gual","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000795","20220608","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32554,""
"Balancing risk, intimacy and (non)compliance: aÃ‚Â qualitative study of sex across household during COVID-19 social restrictions","Government controls over intimate relationships, imposed to limit the spread of Sars-CoV-2, were unprecedented in modern times. This study draws on data from qualitative interviews with 18 participants in Natsal-COVID, a quasi-representative web-panel survey of the British population (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6,654 people), reporting that they had sex with someone from outside their household in the preceding four weeks; a period in which contact between households was restricted in the UK. Whilst only 10% of people reported sexual contact outside their household, among single people and those in non-cohabiting relationships, rates were much higher (Natsal-COVID). Our findings show that individuals did not take decisions to meet up with sexual partners lightly. Participants were motivated by needs-for connection, security, intimacy and a sense of normality. People balanced risks-of catching COVID-19, social judgement and punishment for rule-breaking-against other perceived risks, including to their mental health or relationships. We used situated rationality and social action theories of risk to demonstrate that people weighed up risk in socially situated ways and exhibited complex decision-making when deciding not to comply with restrictions. Understanding motivations for non-compliance is crucial to informing future public health messaging which accounts for the needs and circumstances of all population members.","Maxwell, BosÃƒÂ³ PÃƒÂ©rez, Reid, Freeman, Menezes, Sonnenberg, Field, Mitchell","https://doi.org/10.1080/13691058.2022.2078507","20220608","COVID-19; pandemic restrictions; risk behaviour; sexual behaviour","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32555,""

In Wuhan, China, large teams of healthcare personnel were dispatched to respond to the COVID-19 emergency. This study aimed to determine the sociodemographic and psychological predictors of resilience among frontline nurses fighting the current pandemic. A total of 143 nurses were recruited from February 15 to February 20, 2020 to participate in this study. The 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale were used to estimate the participants' resilience and mental wellbeing. Results showed that the nurses displayed a moderate resilience level. Their median depression, anxiety, and stress scores were 1, 2, and 3, respectively, which were negatively correlated with resilience. Female gender, being dispatched to Wuhan, and depression levels were the significant predictors of resilience. The results suggest that particular attention should be given to female nurses who were dispatched to Wuhan and who exhibited depression symptoms, and appropriate measures should be taken to boost their resilience.","Zhang, Xiong, Zhang, Jiang, Zhuang, Meng, Peng, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2022.138","20220608","anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; nurses; resilience; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32556,""

"Changes in self-harm- and violence-related urgent psychiatric consultation in the emergency department during the different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic significantly affected emergency department (ED) visits and urgent psychiatric consultation (UPC) seeking behavior in EDs. Our study explored the changes in UPCs during and after the pandemic peak. This retrospective observational study evaluated UPCs in the ED of a referral medical center in Taiwan, where treated both physical and psychiatric complaints. We defined the COVID-19 pandemic peak period as calendar week 4-18, 2020. The corresponding baseline as calendar week 4-18, 2019, and the slack period as week 4-18, 2021. The total number of UPCs, patient demographic data such as sex and age of the patients seen, the referral system (whether police or emergency medical service [EMS] or other sources), and the chief complaint (self-harm or violence) were recorded. Compared with the baseline period, a significant decline in UPCs was observed in the pandemic peak period, and a rebound was observed in the slack period, with the median [IQR] Q1, Q3 values of 22 [18, 26], 12 [10, 17]), and 16 [15, 23], respectively. We observed significantly few men (34.9% vs 45.2%) and less violence (10.2% vs 17.6%) in the peak period compared with in the baseline period, but no significant difference was found compared with the slack period. Throughout the pandemic, younger patients (41.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°17.4 in 2019, 39.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°18.5 [pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.121] in 2020, and 35.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°17.2 [pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001] in 2021), higher proportions of police/EMS referral (38.7% in 2019, 41.9% [pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.473] in 2020, and 51.9% [pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001] in 2021) and self-harm-related complaints (57% in 2019, 62.4% [pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.233] in 2020, and 64.9% [pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.049] in 2021) was noted among UPC seekers during the pandemic. However, the proportion of violence-related UPCs (17.6% in 2019, 10.2% [pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.023] in 2020, and 12.3% [pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.072] in 2021) declined. This study found that UPCs changed throughout the pandemic. This result raises the concern that mental health needs are masked during the pandemic.","Liu, Chen, Chen, Yeh","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04029-4","20220607","COVID-19; emergency department; psychiatric consultation; self-harm; violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32561,""
"Knowledge deficit and fear of COVID-19 among higher education students during the first wave of the pandemic and implications for public health: a multi-country cross-sectional survey","Public health measures such as physical distancing and distance learning have been implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 related knowledge deficit can increase fear that leads to negative mental health and COVID-19, especially among adolescents. Therefore,Ã‚Â our study aimed to assess COVID-19 related knowledge deficit and its association with fear among higher education (HE) students during the first wave of COVID-19. A cross-sectional survey, COVID-19 International Students Well-being Study (C-19 ISWS) was conducted in 133 Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in 26 countries between April 27 and July 7, 2020. A stratified convenience sampling technique was used. Descriptive, bivariate, mixed-effect logistic regression analyses were conducted using R software. Out of 127,362 respondents, 72.1% were female, and 76.5% did not report a previous history of confirmed COVID-19. The majority of those without the previous infection 81,645 (83.7%) were from 21 European countries while the rest 15,850 (16.3%)Ã‚Â were from 5 non-European countries. The most frequent correct response to COVID-19 related knowledge questions among respondents was having the virus without having symptoms (94.3%). Compared to participants with good knowledge, the odds of being afraid of acquiring SARS-COV-2 infection among those with poor knowledge was 1.05 (95%CI:1.03,1.08) and the odds of being afraid of contracting severe COVID-19 was 1.36 (95%CI:1.31,1.40). COVID-19 related knowledge was independently associated with both fear of acquiring SARS-COV-2 infection as well as contracting severe COVID-19. Our findings will serve as a basis for public health response for both the current and similar future pandemics by highlighting the need for addressing the COVID-19 knowledge deficit to fight the infodemic and prevent negative mental health outcomes.","Berhe, Van de Velde, Rabiee-Khan, van der Heijde, Vonk, Buffel, Wouters, Van Hal","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13511-3","20220607","COVID-19; Fear; Knowledge; Mixed-effect logistic regression; Multi-country; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32562,""
"COVID-19 Induced Environments, Health-Related Quality of Life Outcomes and Problematic Behaviors: Evidence from Children with Syndromic Autism Spectrum Disorders","Between July 2020 and January 2021, 230 principal caregivers completed a questionnaire to measure proxy-assessed health-related quality of life outcomes (HRQoL), behavioral outcomes in children with syndromic autism spectrum disorders and COVID-19 induced changes to lifestyle and environments. HRQoL and behavioral outcomes reported earlier during the pandemic were generally worse compared to those reported later. COVID-19 induced reduction to a caregiver's mental health appointments, and hours spent watching TV were associated with decreases in HRQoL and increased the likelihood of problematic behaviors. Increasing time outdoors and time away from digital devices were positively associated with HRQoL and behaviors and might protect children from COVID-19 induced restrictions.","Bolbocean, Rhidenour, McCormack, Suter, Holder","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-022-05619-7","20220607","Autism spectrum disorders; COVID-19; HRQoL; PhelanÃ¢â‚¬â€œMcDermid syndrome; Rett Syndrome; SYNGAP1-ID","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32563,""
"Diabetes in the Western Cape, South Africa: A secondary analysis of the diabetes cascade database 2015 - 2020","The aim was to describe the demographics, comorbidities and outcomes of care for patients with diabetes at primary care facilities in the Western Cape, South Africa, between 2015 and 2020. This was a secondary analysis of the diabetes cascade database. The database included 116726 patients with mean age of 61.4 years and 63.8 % were female. The mean age at death was 66.0 years. Co-morbidities included hypertension (69.5 %), mental health disorders (16.2 %), HIV (6.4 %) and previous TB (8.2 %). Sixty-three percent had at least one previous hospital admission and 20.2 % of all admissions were attributed to cardiovascular diseases. Coronavirus was the third highest reason for admission over a 10-year period. Up to 70% were not receiving an annual HbA1c test. The mean value for the last HBA1c taken was 9.0%. Three-quarters (75.5 %) of patients had poor glycaemic control (HbA1c &gt;7 %) and a third (33.7 %) were very poorly controlled (HbA1c&gt;10 %). Glycaemic control was significantly different between urban sub-districts and rural areas. Renal disease was prevalent in 25.5 %. Diabetes was poorly controlled with high morbidity and mortality. There was poor compliance with guidelines for HbA1c and eGFR measurement.

"The early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with severe mental illness: An interrupted time-series study in South-East England","Deterioration in general population mental health since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic has been reported, but the impact of the pandemic on people with severe mental illness (SMI) has received less attention. To understand the impact of the early stages of the pandemic on the patients with SMI, in terms of provision of mental health care and patient outcomes. We examined records of 34,446 patients with SMI in Oxford Health Foundation Trust between March 2016 and July 2020. We used interrupted time-series analysis to estimate the immediate and subsequent changes in weekly rates of the use of community mental health services, hospitalization, and patient outcomes (as measured by Health of the Nation Outcome Scales, or HoNOS, scores) during the weeks of lockdown between March 23, 2020 and July 3, 2020. Mean total HoNOS scores for all patients deteriorated in the weeks subsequent to lockdown (0.060 per week; 95%CI: 0.033, 0.087). Scores for patients with a history of psychosis deteriorated immediately (0.63; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.0). There was an immediate decrease in weekly referrals to community and outpatient services (-196; 95%CI: -300, -91) and no immediate change in weekly inpatient admissions (-4.2; 95%CI: -9.9, 1.5) or weekly total contacts (-26; 95%CI: -475, 423). Patients with SMI were negatively impacted during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with a history of psychosis experienced distinct and immediate impacts. During the same period, referrals to community and outpatient services fell with no consequent impact on inpatient admissions.","Penington, Lennox, Geulayov, Hawton, Tsiachristas","https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.22","20220608","COVID-19; Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS); Interrupted time series; Mental health services; Severe mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-09","",32565,""
"Early relational health: Innovations in child health for promotion, screening, and research","Relational experiences during infancy and early childhood are key drivers for building health, social emotional development, and learning capacities, each vital for wellbeing. The U.S. child health sectors share a commitment to universal health promotion, prevention and early intervention, and a growing enthusiasm for the research-affirmed primacy of caregiver-child interactions during the critical first 1000 days of life. Given our nation's growing children's mental health crisis, racial justice awakening and the need to reimagine equitable supports for young families post-COVID19, the child health sectors seek new tools and clinical approaches that blend science-to-practice innovations with co-developed activities that are meaningful to families. This special section brings together papers about a journey of co-discovery between researchers, clinicians, and parents during the development and refinement of new video- and interview-based dyadic relational screening and monitoring tools. The collection of papers addresses a range of topics including early relational health (ERH), development and validation of the Early Relational Health Screen, its application within research and clinical settings, and thoughtful discussions from multiple perspectives. Informed by the diversity informed tenets, this journey highlights not only science-informed approaches, but also co-development with families of equitable approaches to understanding and serving children and their caregivers. Las experiencias en las relaciones durante la infancia y la temprana niÃƒÂ±ez son conductores claves para fortalecer la salud, el desarrollo socio-emocional y las capacidades de aprendizaje, todas las cuales son vitales para el bienestar. Los sectores de salud infantil en los Estados Unidos comparten un compromiso para promover globalmente la salud, la prevenciÃƒÂ³n y la temprana intervenciÃƒÂ³n, asÃƒÂ­ como un creciente entusiasmo por la primacÃƒÂ­a de las interacciones entre quien presta el cuidado y el niÃƒÂ±o, tal como las reafirma la investigaciÃƒÂ³n, durante los crÃƒÂ­ticos primeros mil dÃƒÂ­as de vida. Dada la creciente crisis de salud mental infantil de nuestro paÃƒÂ­s, el despertar de la justicia racial y la necesidad de volver a conceptualizar los apoyos equitativos para familias jÃƒÂ³venes despuÃƒÂ©s del Covid-19, los sectores de salud infantil, buscan nuevas herramientas y acercamientos clÃƒÂ­nicos que mezclan las innovaciones de la ciencia a la prÃƒÂ¡ctica con actividades desarrolladas en conjunto que resultan significativas para las familias. Esta secciÃƒÂ³n especial presenta artÃƒÂ­culos acerca de una trayectoria de descubrimiento en conjunto entre investigadores, profesionales clÃƒÂ­nicos y padres durante el desarrollo y afinamiento de nuevas herramientas de detecciÃƒÂ³n y supervisiÃƒÂ³n de la relaciÃƒÂ³n diÃƒÂ¡dica basadas en videos y entrevistas. El grupo de artÃƒÂ­culos aborda un nÃƒÂºmero de temas que incluyen la temprana saludable relaciÃƒÂ³n (ERH), el desarrollo y la validez de la DetecciÃƒÂ³n de la Temprana Saludable RelaciÃƒÂ³n, su aplicaciÃƒÂ³n dentro de los campos de la investigaciÃƒÂ³n y clÃƒÂ­nicos, asÃƒÂ­ como sensatas discusiones a partir de mÃƒÂºltiples perspectivas. Respaldada por principios basados en la diversidad, esta trayectoria subraya no sÃƒÂ³lo los acercamientos cuya informaciÃƒÂ³n proviene de la ciencia, sino tambiÃƒÂ©n el desarrollo en conjunto con familias de equitativos acercamientos para comprender y servirles a los niÃƒÂ±os y a quienes los cuidan. Les expÃƒÂ©riences relationnelles le bas ÃƒÂ¢ge et la petite enfance sont des facteurs clÃƒÂ©s pour la construction de la santÃƒÂ©, le dÃƒÂ©veloppement socio-ÃƒÂ©motionnel et les capacitÃƒÂ©s d'apprentissage, qui sont indispensables au bien-ÃƒÂªtre. Les secteurs de la santÃƒÂ© de l'enfant aux Etats-Unis d'AmÃƒÂ©rique partagent un engagement envers la promotion universelle de la santÃƒÂ©, la prÃƒÂ©vention et l'intervention prÃƒÂ©coce, et un enthousiasme grandissant pour la primautÃƒÂ© des interactions personne prenant soin de l'enfant-enfant, affirmÃƒÂ©e par les recherches, durant les 100 premiers jours critique de la vie. Au vu de la croissance de la crise de santÃƒÂ© mentale des enfants dans notre pays, du rÃƒÂ©veil de la justice raciale et du besoin de rÃƒÂ©imaginer les soutiens ÃƒÂ©quitables pour les jeunes familles aprÃƒÂ¨s le Covid19, les secteurs de la santÃƒÂ© mentale de l'enfant cherchent de nouveaux outils et des approches cliniques qui mÃƒÂ©lange des innovations science-ÃƒÂ -pratique avec des activitÃƒÂ©s ÃƒÂ©laborÃƒÂ©es conjointement qui sont utiles et ont un sens pour les familles. Cette section spÃƒÂ©ciale rassemble des articles sur un voyage de codÃƒÂ©couverte entre des chercheurs, des cliniciens, et des parents durant le dÃƒÂ©veloppement et le perfectionnement d'un nouveau dÃƒÂ©pistage relationnel dyadique Ãƒ partir d'entretiens et de vidÃƒÂ©os, et d'outils de suivi. Cette collection d'articles porte sur un ÃƒÂ©ventail de sujets y compris la SantÃƒÂ© Relationnelle PrÃƒÂ©coce (SRP), le dÃƒÂ©veloppement et la validation du DÃƒÂ©pistage de SantÃƒÂ© Relationnelle PrÃƒÂ©coce, son application dans des contextes de recherche et dans des contextes cliniques, et des discussions attentionnÃƒÂ©es de perspectives multiples. InformÃƒÂ© par des principes fondÃƒÂ©s sur la diversitÃƒÂ©, ce voyage met en ÃƒÂ©vidence non seulement des approches scientifiques mais aussi des co-dÃƒÂ©veloppements avec des familles d'approches ÃƒÂ©quitables Ãƒ la comprÃƒÂ©hension et au service des enfants ainsi que des personnes prenant soin d'eux. Beziehungserfahrungen im SÃƒÂ¤uglingsalter und in der frÃƒÂ¼hen Kindheit sind entscheidend fÃƒÂ¼r den Aufbau von Gesundheit, sozial-emotionaler Entwicklung und LernfÃƒÂ¤higkeiten, welches alles entscheidende Faktoren fÃƒÂ¼r das Wohlbefinden sind. Die Sektoren des US-Kindergesundheitswesens engagieren sich gemeinsam fÃƒÂ¼r GesundheitsfÃƒÂ¶rderung, PrÃƒÂ¤vention und FrÃƒÂ¼hintervention. AuÃƒÅ¸erdem gibt es einen wachsenden Enthusiasmus fÃƒÂ¼r die durch die Forschung bestÃƒÂ¤tigte Vorrangstellung der Interaktionen zwischen Bezugspersonen und Kindern in den entscheidenden ersten 1000 Lebenstagen. Angesichts des immer kritischer werdenden Zustands der psychischen Gesundheit von Kindern in unserem Land, des Erwachens der Gerechtigkeit zwischen Ethnien und der Notwendigkeit, UnterstÃƒÂ¼tzung fÃƒÂ¼r junge Familien nach COVID19 neu zu konzipieren, suchen die Sektoren des Kindergesundheitswesens nach neuen Instrumenten und klinischen AnsÃƒÂ¤tzen, die Innovationen aus der Wissenschaft in die Praxis einflieÃƒÅ¸en lassen und AktivitÃƒÂ¤ten beinhalten, die fÃƒÂ¼r die Familien sinnvoll sind. In diesem Sonderteil sind BeitrÃƒÂ¤ge zusammengestellt, die eine gemeinsame Entdeckungsreise von Forschenden, Kliniker:innen und Eltern bei der Entwicklung und Verfeinerung neuer video- und interviewbasierter dyadischer Beziehungsscreenings und Monitoring-Instrumente darstellen. Die Sammlung von BeitrÃƒÂ¤gen befasst sich mit einer Reihe von Themen, darunter frÃƒÂ¼he relationale Gesundheit (Early Relational Health, ERH), die Entwicklung und Validierung des Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Early Relational Health ScreenÃ¢â‚¬Å“, seine Anwendung in der Forschung und im klinischen Umfeld sowie durchdachte Diskussionen aus verschiedenen Perspektiven. Auf der Grundlage des Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Diversity-InformedÃ¢â‚¬Å“-Grundsatzes werden nicht nur wissenschaftlich fundierte AnsÃƒÂ¤tze vorgestellt, sondern auch gemeinsam mit Familien erarbeitete, gerechte AnsÃƒÂ¤tze zum VerstÃƒÂ¤ndnis und zur Betreuung von Kindern und ihren Bezugspersonen.
