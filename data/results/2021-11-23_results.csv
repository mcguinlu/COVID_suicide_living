"The Effect of COVID-19 on the Postdoctoral Experience: a comparison of pre-pandemic and pandemic surveys","In the interest of advocating for the postdoctoral community in the United States, we present results from survey data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic on the same population of postdocs. In 2019, 5,929 postdocs in the US completed a comprehensive survey, and in 2020, a subset completed a follow-up survey several months into the pandemic. The results show that the pandemic has substantially impacted postdocs' mental health and wellness irrespective of gender, race, citizenship, or other identities. Postdocs also reported a significant impact on their career trajectories and progression, reduced confidence in achieving career goals, and negative perceptions of the job market compared to pre-COVID-19. International postdocs also reported experiencing distinct stressors due to the changes in immigration policy. Notably, having access to Postdoctoral Associations and Postdoctoral Offices positively impacted postdocs' overall well-being and helped mitigate the personal and professional stresses and career uncertainties caused by the pandemic.","AndrÃ©anne Morin; Britney A Helling; Seetha Krishnan; Laurie E Risner; Nykia D Walker; Nancy B Schwartz","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.19.468693","20211121","","bioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22442,""
"Potential sedative and therapeutic value of Dexmedetomidine in critical COVID-19 patients","The coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is an ongoing outbreak of respiratory disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus can invade various tissues and organs, causing multiple organ dysfunctions. Critically ill COVID-19 patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia, which are the major causes of hypoxemic respiratory failure and death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, ventilation support (invasive or noninvasive), has become a common practice in respiratory treatment of COVID-19 patients. Patients receiving mechanical ventilation usually require sedation to alleviate anxiety, pain and discomfort. On the other hand, current clinical reports have indicated that a significant number of COVID-19 patients require prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) care and ventilation, which increases the risk of delirium. Thus, selection of appropriate sedative medications during this period is of utmost importance. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a sedative, anxiolytic and analgesic agent that acts through the a2-adrenoceptor. Its sedative property is notable due to the lack of respiratory depression. In addition, its cytoprotective, immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory properties have been well established in preclinical settings. Based on these features, a number of recent studies have proposed DEX as a beneficial sedative agent that simultaneously mitigates the excessive inflammation and protects vital body organs in patients with severe COVID-19. In current brief review, we aimed to discuss the therapeutic benefits of DEX in managing different indications of COVID-19.

"Sleeping habits in confinement by Covid-19 in a sample of Colombian children","The new disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 has generated a process of global confinement to slow down the number of infections and protect people's lives. Isolation and changes in habits, however, have produced adverse effects on mental health. The present study aimed at determining problems in sleeping habits and their relationship with some conditions generated by confinement in a sample of Colombian children. The study included 259 parents of children aged 5 to 12 years from Pasto City. Data collected included the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) and a questionnaire on daily routines, their use of digital technology, and changes in the children's emotionality. Descriptive analysis through the X2 test determined the influence of sex and socioeconomic variables. Rho Spearman tests examined the correlation between the scales and subscales of the instruments. The most relevant results revealed that 45,5% of children showed some sleep difficulties such as parasomnias and daytime sleepiness. Correlations between the scores (Rho = 0.46 p&lt;0.05) revealed associations among using digital technology and emotional changes with sleep difficulties. Thus results concluded that there are changes in sleep habits after the start of confinement. (English) [ FROM AUTHOR] La nueva enfermedad provocada por el virus SARS-CoV-2 ha generado en el mundo un confinamiento cuyo fin es ralentizar el nÃºmero de contagios y proteger asÃ­ la vida de las personas;sin embargo, tal aislamiento y el cambio de hÃ¡bitos han producido considerables efectos en su salud mental. Por consiguiente, el presente estudio tuvo como objetivo determinar los problemas en los hÃ¡bitos de sueÃ±o y su relaciÃ³n con algunas caracterÃ­sticas generadas por la reclusiÃ³n en una muestra de 259 niÃ±os colombianos de 5 a 12 aÃ±os de edad, residentes en la ciudad de Pasto (Colombia), a travÃ©s de la aplicaciÃ³n a sus padres del cuestionario Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire y de un cuestionario ad hoc para evaluar los cambios en las rutinas diarias, el uso de la tecnologÃ­a y la emocionalidad en los niÃ±os. A este efecto, se hicieron anÃ¡lisis descriptivos de los instrumentos, una prueba de X2 para determinar la influencia de las variables de sexo y nivel socioeconÃ³mico, y pruebas de correlaciÃ³n rho de Spearman entre las escalas y subescalas de dichos instrumentos. Entre los resultados mÃ¡s relevantes se hallÃ³ que 45.5% de los niÃ±os mostraban algunos problemas del sueÃ±o, siendo las parasomnias y la somnolencia diurna los de mayor prevalencia. AdemÃ¡s, se encontraron correlaciones positivas entre los puntajes de las escalas, identificÃ¡ndose tambiÃ©n relaciones entre el uso de la tecnologÃ­a y los cambios emocionales con dificultades del sueÃ±o, por lo que se concluye que han ocurrido alteraciones en los hÃ¡bitos de sueÃ±o debidos al confinamiento.

"Ethical dilemmas and challenges of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: Nursing is one of the most stressful professions with nurses experiencing daily moral dilemmas, challenges and fears that bring them face to face with themselves, seriously affecting their mental health, especially when working in an infectious and highly stressful environment like what caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Aim: To highlight and examine the ethical dilemmas and challenges faced by nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. Methods: A search was conducted for review articles and research studies published in Greek and English in the electronic databases ""Pubmed"", ""Google Scholar"" and ""IATROTEK"" for the period 2020-2021. Results: The COVID-19 pandemic posed a challenge to the global health system. The nurses were at the forefront and fully committed to controlling the pandemic, defying any danger, while at the same time, they had to face moral challenges and dilemmas on many fronts. The significant increase in the volume and intensity of their work, along with the constant implementation of new protocols and changes in disease management, has been a source of constant stress and self-doubt as to whether they met the needs of the health system without adverse effects on both themselves and their familiar environment as well as towards their debt to patients. Conclusions: There is an urgent need for health policies, review and redesign of health protocols for comprehensive service delivery, resource redistribution, training and adequacy of staff and in particular proposals to support mental health and strengthen nurses' mental resilience.","Fragkiadaki, G.","https://doi.org/10.22514/sv.2021.150","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Signa Vitae; 17(5):6, 2021.; Publication details: Signa Vitae; 17(5):6, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22445,""
"TWO-STEP MODEL FOR EMOTION DETECTION ON TWITTER USERS: A COVID-19 CASE STUDY IN MALAYSIA","Human emotion is often a reflection of one's behaviour that leads to awareness of one's mental health. Emotion detection on Twitter users specifically gains attention as it generates information that is useful in the field of psychology and linguistics. However, most existing works related to the subject analysed the emotion of a tweet based on the number of keywords or phrases in it, thus resulting in false annotations and eventually false judgement of the user's emotion. This paper proposes a two-step model with high and reliable accuracy to detect the emotion of Twitter users based on the semantic meaning of the tweets they posted. The first step classified the emotion of each tweet using four different deep learning techniques. The second step detected the emotion of the user based on the proposed statistical post-level features and a boosting technique. Then, Kappa's agreement score method was implemented to validate both models. The first step achieved 0.9482 in accuracy while the second step achieved 0.9683 in accuracy. To further validate such highly accurate result, a case study was conducted, and a web-based system was developed to analyse the emotion of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our analysis corresponded to most of the current reports on the pandemic which further proved the reliability of the developed model.","Razak, C. S. A.; Ab Hamid, S.

"Social representations about the COVID-19 pandemic of Chilean higher education students","The COVID 19 has caused multiple effects on the physical and mental health of the world s population. From the psychosocial perspective, this study proposes to understand the social representations about the COVID-19 pandemic of Chilean higher education students. The participants were a total of 92 Chilean higher education students. Data collection was carried out using a questionnaire of social representations, which included the following stimulus words: (a) COVID-19, (b) quarantine, and (c) social distancing. The data were analyzed using natural semantic network analysis. The results showed that the thematic categories of the COVID-19 are mainly related to biological, emotional and value aspects. For quarantine and social distancing, thematic categories are related to emotional and value aspects. The results are discussed based on the understanding of the categories of thought that promote behavior in the context of a health emergency. Â© 2021 Universidad Catolica del Uruguay.

"The Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of Healthcare Workers and Recommendations for Preventing Loss of Work Efficiency","Objective: We aimed to evaluate the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental health conditions of healthcare workers and raise awareness regarding the measures to be taken in this regard. Materials and Methods: A group of total 435 healthcare professionals, including 52.2% women, who worked in the pandemic clinics, were enrolled. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was administered using a web-based questionnaire system. We divided the healthcare workers into the following three groups: physicians, nurses, and other auxiliary healthcare workers, and compared their HADS-A and HADS-D scores. We grouped the healthcare workers as per their departments and years of professional experience and compared the HADS-A and HADS-D scores of the groups. Results: The mean patient age was 34.34Â±8.34 y. Further, 25.7% had received professional mental support, and 18.6% started undergoing professional psychological therapy for the first time in their lives owing to the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic process. Healthcare workers were assessed for anxiety and depression using the HADS;43.4% of them had anxiety and 65.1% had depression. Conclusion: The present study stated that &lt;50% of healthcare workers with mental disorders who were serving as frontline healthcare providers for COVID-19 patients receive professional mental support. The authorities should take precautions to prevent healthcare services from being interrupted and the negative impacts on healthcare workers' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"A Virtual Wellness and Learning Communities Program for Medical Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the authors' medical school transitioned to an all-virtual learning environment from March to June 2020, which raised concerns among student leaders and administrators as reduced interpersonal attachments have known associations with decreased mental health. In an effort to facilitate student well-being during the pandemic, the Virtual Wellness and Learning Communities program was established. The authors evaluate the effect of this Virtual Wellness and Learning Communities program on medical student sense of wellness and community during the pandemic. Objectives: Numerous studies have demonstrated the high risk for burnout and mental illness in medical students. Because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, our medical school transitioned to an all-virtual learning environment from March to June 2020, which raised concerns among student leaders and administrators, as reduced interpersonal attachments have known associations with decreased mental health. In an effort to facilitate student well-being during the pandemic, the Virtual Wellness and Learning Communities (VWLC) program was established. VWLC consisted of hour-long events that offered students the opportunity to engage with their peers online. Methods: More than 20 events and workshops were conducted from March to June 2020, including trivia nights, song and guitar performances, sketching, video editing tutorials, chess lessons, yoga, and personal investing tips. An institutional review boardâ€“approved survey to assess the efficacy of the VWLC program was sent to medical student participants and nonparticipants. Results: The overall response rate of this study was 43% (53/123). The response rate for students who attended a VWLC event was 51% (33/65), and the response rate for students who did not attend a VWLC event was 34% (20/58). Of all of the respondents, 85% (45/53) reported a decreased sense of connectivity with peers because of the pandemic, and 40% (21/53) reported a decrease in their sense of wellness. After attending a VWLC event, 79% (26/33) reported an increased sense of peer connectivity, 61% (20/33) reported improved wellness, and 55% (18/33) believed that these events should continue postpandemic to supplement in-person programming. Those who did not attend a virtual event stated that the main barriers to attending were unfamiliarity with attendees and screen fatigue. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened medical student well-being and sense of community. VWLC programming may be an effective strategy for promoting medical student wellness and community while social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. To our knowledge, this is the first virtual wellness program for promotion of medical student mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic to be described in the literature.

"Impact of COVID-19 on Patients with Mental Health Conditions Reported by Caregivers in Saudi Arabia","Objective: The current study aims to measure the perceived effects of COVID-19 on patients with mental health conditions and their families. Methods: Using a descriptive cross-sectional survey design, a random sample of 1,168 caregivers were recruited to the study. Caregivers were identified via the Patient Affairs Department database with every third person invited via WhatsApp to complete an online questionnaire. The structured questionnaire was based on published research during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Of the 1,168 people recruited, 246 participated in the study;nearly 50% were caregivers for patients who were women. One out of two caregivers reported a deterioration in patientsâ€™ mental health symptoms. Four out of ten participants reported that the pandemic negatively affected home care support by family members of mental health patients. Around 50% reported they would decline hospital admission if a psychiatric doctor recommended it during the pandemic and 71.3% reported believing that medications were unsafe if prescribed without a consultation. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a pronounced effect on Saudi mental health patients. Decisions whether to seek psychiatric care were also greatly influenced COVID-19. There is a clear need for adaptation and monitoring of the current emergency response psychiatric services as well as for further research to explore the knowledge of psychiatric patients and their caregivers regarding COVID-19.

"Impact of covid-19 on the life of higher-education students in &Iacute;stanbul: Relationship between social support, health-risk behaviors, and mental/academic well-being","Objective: This study aimed to draw a general picture of the impact of the coronavirus dis-ease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the life of higher-education students in &Iacute;stanbul, with specific emphasis on the relationship between studentsâ€™ social support systems, health-risk behaviors, and mental/academic well-being. Methods: A total of 2583 higher-education students from different fields of study par-ticipated in an online survey gathering information from several domains, including available social networks, support-seeking attitudes, substance use patterns, physical activity levels, academic stress, academic satisfaction, and psychological well-being during the pandemic. Results: Our findings pointed to major changes in studentsâ€™ life circumstances and daily routines during COVID-19, including a significant decrease in contact with friends, over-all substance use, and physical activity as well as high levels of depression, academic stress, and academic dissatisfaction. Depressive symptoms were significantly predicted by the loneliness score (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.88-2.29), female gender (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.21-2.24), frequency of binge drinking (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.06-1.86), and level of academic stress (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.1-1.19), whereas the number of people to easily bor-row money from was found to be a protective factor against depression (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.92-0.99). Conclusion: Our results highlight the need for higher-education institutions to take the appropriate social and mental health interventions, tailored to fit the specific require-ments of the COVID-19-related measures.

"Highlights of this issue","The identification and management of risk is central to our everyday clinical practice in psychiatry, but the management of risk associated with mental disorders is not a straightforward algorithm such as those more commonly seen in the treatment of asthma or diabetes mellitus. Mental health legislation varies across the globe, but the authors seek to explore the balance between civil rights and public protection when the harm is not that of risk to life through immediate physical harm to self or others but the longer-term harm from infection to both patients and the public. Kim and colleagues (pp. 598â€“605) examined this relationship more closely in 1094 adults aged 16 and over with depressive disorder as part of the MAKE Biomarker Discovery for Enhancing Antidepressant Treatment Effect and Response study, of whom 884 were followed up during a 1 year period of stepwise pharmacotherapy.","Rahul, Rao","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2021.140","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: The British Journal of Psychiatry; 219(5):A43, 2021.; Publication details: The British Journal of Psychiatry; 219(5):A43, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22454,""
"In a Stressful Social Environment, Can Using Sports Apps Relieve the Physical and Mental Stress of the Elderly? From the Perspective of Industry 40","The purpose of this research was to understand the current physical and mental health of the elderly using sports apps under the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 711 questionnaires were collected using purposive sampling and the snowball method and were analyzed by Statistical Product and Service Solutions 22.0 and Analysis of Moment Structures 20.0 software. The survey found that elderly people who exercise at intervals of one month are more physically and mentally stressed, but that different exercise frequencies also have different levels of physical and mental health problems;the lower the exercise intensity, the more obvious the negative emotions, the stronger or the less time they spend in exercise, and the greater the pressure of sports. In a high-risk social environment, even if the elderly use sports apps to exercise, they will still change the intensity and time of the exercise, but they will not change the frequency of exercise that has become a daily habit.

"Reported effects of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic on the activities of people with cerebral palsy in Portugal","Background and Objective(s): People with conditions affecting their health and their ability to be autonomous and socially included are particularly sensitive to sudden, severe disturbances of the social environment, especially if they also affect formal and informal caregivers and their infrastructures of support. The voices of these individuals are seldom heard, their needs unattended. People living with cerebral palsy (CP) are paradigmatic of the potentially difficult situation presented by the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. Study Design: Project ""BarÃ³metro COVID-19 e Paralisia Cerebral"" monitors how the SARS-CoV2 pandemic affects people living with CP, hearing their own voices, through a web-based self-applied, anonymous, mixed-responses survey of people with CP, their relatives, caregivers and cohabitants. It has a common core of questions with ""BarÃ³metro COVID-19: OpiniÃ£o Social"" (NOVA National School of Public Health). As a dynamic tool, questions can be added as indicated by the periodical, intermediate analyses. Study Participants & Setting: People living with CP were invited to participate by the Federation of Portuguese Associations for Cerebral Palsy and the Portuguese Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy. The survey is available and ongoing from April 6th 2020. Data from responders self-identified as having CP and data related to them, reported by relatives, cohabitants, caregivers and technicians were considered for this analysis. Data reported until December 26th 2020 were considered. The period includes different legal settings or social restrictions and ends with the beginning of vaccination for Covid-19 in the European Union. Materials/Methods: Descriptive statistics were applied. Results: Data on the daily life of people having CP were retrieved from 765 surveys (112 filled by individuals with CP and 234 by relatives, caregivers and cohabitants of individuals with CP). Most of the respondents (96%) reported substantial changes in daily routines: school, day-center, and/or activity center were suspended (50%), working conditions changed (24%), and 21% had been quarantined or on social isolation;87% of individuals with CP avoided being out of their home (59% did not leave their homes for at least 2 weeks). People with CP had face-to-face rehabilitation and health care sessions cancelled (29%) or choose to cancel them (21%);they had home-based basic health care services cancelled (23%) or choose to cancel them (18%). There was reported difficulty on obtaining drugs or health care related devices (20%) and primary goods (9%);8% reported loss in income. The perception of own general health was reported as good/very good by 71% and of mental health by 69%. Conclusions/Significance: The pandemic seriously affected participation and maintenance of required care and assistance, potentially endangering abilities, competences, wellbeing and quality of life.","Virella, D.; Cadete, A.; Folha, T.; AlvarelhÃ£o, J.; Dias, C.","https://doi.org/10.1111/dmcn.15005","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology; 63(SUPPL 3):104-105, 2021.; Publication details: Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology; 63(SUPPL 3):104-105, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22456,""
"A gardening and woodwork group in mental health: a step towards recovery","Purpose: This paper aims to evaluate the impact of an eight-week gardening and woodwork group programme on individualsâ€™ recovery goals in an adult community mental health setting. Design/methodology/approach: Seven individuals participated in the research. The programme was designed and facilitated by two occupational therapists (the authors) and one horticulture and trade skills facilitator. The goal attainment scale was used as a quantitative outcome measure as it allowed individuals to collaboratively set occupation-focused recovery-oriented goals. Due to the small sample size, descriptive statistics were used to analyse this data. Qualitative feedback was gathered through participant feedback forms when the programme ended. Findings: Quantitative findings indicate positive results for individualsâ€™ progression towards their recovery goals, with six out of seven participants either achieving or exceeding their goals. One person who attended only one out of eight groups had â€œworse than expectedâ€ goal achievement. Originality/value: While there is evidence for the use of gardening and woodwork group therapy in mental health settings, most studies have relied on symptom-focused questionnaires or qualitative results rather than quantifiable recovery-oriented measures (Cipriani et al., 2017;Kamioka et al., 2014;Parkinson et al., 2011). It is hoped that this paper begins to bridge that gap and also outlines how recovery principles, gardening and woodwork can be incorporated into occupational therapy group programmes. This is of particular merit during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a greater need for group intervention in outdoor settings, where social distancing can be comfortably facilitated.

"Perceptions and stress factors among physicians in pre-graduate and post-graduate training in Morocco: COVID-19 pandemic context","Context: On 30 January, 2020, WHO stated that the global COVID-19 epidemic is a public health emergency. Facing this critical situation, health-care workers were at risk of developing psychological distress and other mental health problems.Aims: This study seeks to explore the feelings, attitudes and perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic among physicians in pre-graduate and post-graduate training from Marrakesh University Hospital Centre.Methods and Material:We conducted a cross-sectional study with internal and resident-physicians in May 2020. Data collection was based on a self-administered electronic questionnaire. The sociodemographic informations, pandemic impact on the occupational and social fields and stress factors were evaluated. Statistical significance was set at p &lt;Â 0.05.Results: The number of participants was 74. The sex ratio was 1.4 with an average age of 26.1Â Â±Â 3.6Â years. Two-thirds were directly involved in the management of patients with SARS-CoV2. The majority reported that their work puts them at high-risk of exposure to SARS-CoV2 and 66% felt stressed at work, female physicians were more stressed than men (pÂ =Â 0.028). Not knowing when the pandemic will be under control and the risk of developing an infection with SARS-CoV2 were the main sources of stress. About motivators for similar situations, respondents emphasized family support (91.9%) and recognition by management and supervisors for the additional efforts they provide (83.8%).Conclusions: The protection of health-care workers is an important component of public health measures to combat this pandemic. Special interventions to promote health-care workers mental well-being must be implemented immediately.","Mansouri, Adil, Majda, Sebbani, Adarmouch, Latifa, Mansoury, Ouassim, Mohamed, Amine","https://doi.org/10.1080/20009666.2021.1965288","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Community Hospital Internal Medicine Perspectives; 11(6):753-759, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Community Hospital Internal Medicine Perspectives; 11(6):753-759, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22461,""
"Phototherapy at home for the treatment of neonatal jaundice: An innovative, patient centered pilot project during the COVID-19 pandemic","INTRODUCTION Approximately 60% of term babies develop jaundice. This often requires inpatient hospital treatment with phototherapy. Home phototherapy is not well-established within Italy as routine care for the management of neonatal jaundice. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has become a most challenging health emergency. In that context, hospitals policies and protocols around perinatal care changed, barring faders and extra people from the laboring mom, the delivery room, and the postpartum units, in an effort to keep moms and babies safe. Nevertheless, prolonging hospital stay for phototherapy would increase by the stress of isolation, the anxiety over disease status, and the fear for the new responsibilities in the assumption of the maternal role, making lockdown in hospital challenging for maternal mental health and breastfeeding initiation. This study reports an innovative, patient centered pilot project of phototherapy at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, to promote mother and baby bonding and experience of neonatal jaundice by reducing hospital stay. METHODS Following the introduction of the home phototherapy guideline ('Home Phototherapy': ST-MD-01, 03.15.2018, Policlinico Abano Terme), newborn babies were considered for home phototherapy during COVID-19 outbreak. The inclusion criteria included: feeding established, bilirubin levels at &gt;75&lt;90 percentile of Bhutani nomogram, weight loss &lt;10%, parents motivated, no social concerns, and lived within a pre-defined surrounding area (the Euganean Hills). Parents were trained to use the equipment at home [MiraÂ®, GINEVRI srl. Albano Laziale, Rome: the therapy light, produced by a high-power LED (peak 460 nm), is transmitted, through a flexible fiber optic cable, to a lightening element of small dimensions that has to be placed in contact with patient skin], and the outreach team would visit the baby 24 h after hospital discharge, feeding assessments, perform serum bilirubin levels, plot results and make a management plan in conjunction with the neonatologists. RESULTS 21 babies went home for phototherapy between January and May 2021. Mean gestational age was 39.73 Â± 1.13weeks, average weight 3355.90 Â± 419 g, average discharged home day 2.3 Â± 04, and average days received phototherapy at home 1.27 Â± 0.43. No adverse events were noted. Additional babies (n=2) could have been recruited during this period, but did not live within the pre-defined area. Excellent feedback was received from 19/21 (90.4%) the mother-infant dyads involved. CONCLUSION The pilot project of 'Home Phototherap' was introduced safely during COVID-19 pandemic. It was wellappreciated by parents and cost-effective to improve maternal and newborn health. It has given us the basis to roll this project out to different Level 1-3 neonatal units across the country after the COVID-19 outbreak.","Zanardo, V.; Guerrini, P.; Severino, L.; Maione, R.; Bucci, C.; Straface, G.","https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.1962370","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine; 34(SUPPL 1):14-15, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine; 34(SUPPL 1):14-15, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22462,""

"The 3D-Transition Study: Objectives, Methods, and Implementation of an Innovative Planned Missing-Data Design","The prevalence of mental health problems represents a significant burden on school and community health resources as early as preschool. Reducing this burden requires a better understanding of the developmental mechanisms linking children's early vulnerabilities with mental health after the transition to formal schooling. The 3D-Transition Study (2017-2021) follows 939 participants from a pregnancy cohort in the province of QuÃ©bec, Canada, as they transition to kindergarten and first grade to examine these mechanisms. Biannual assessments include completed questionnaires from 2 parents as well as teachers, parent-child observations, anthropometric measurements, and age-sensitive cognitive assessments. Saliva is also collected on 11 days over a 16-month period in a subsample of 384 participants to examine possible changes in child salivary cortisol levels across the school transition and their role in difficulties observed during the transition. A combination of planned missing-data designs is being implemented to reduce participant burden, where incomplete data are collected without introducing bias after the use of multiple imputation. The 3D-Transition Study will contribute to an evidence-based developmental framework of child mental health from pregnancy to school age. In turn, this framework can help inform prevention programs delivered in health-care settings during pregnancy and in child-care centers, preschools, and schools.","Rioux, Charlie; Parent, Sophie; Castellanos-Ryan, Natalie; Archambault, Isabelle; Boivin, Michel; Herba, Catherine M; Lupien, Sonia J; Marc, Isabelle; Muckle, Gina; Fraser, William D; SÃ©guin, Jean R","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwab141","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Epidemiol;190(11): 2262-2274, 2021 11 02.; Publication details: Am J Epidemiol;190(11): 2262-2274, 2021 11 02.; Epidemiologic Research Design; Mental Health; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Schools; Stress, Psychological; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone/metabolism; Infant; Life Change Events; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Pregnancy; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22465,""

"Cost-Utility Analysis of Discontinuing Antidepressants in England Primary Care Patients Compared with Long-Term Maintenance: The ANTLER Study","BACKGROUND: Depression is a common mental health condition with considerable negative impact on health and well-being. Although antidepressants are recommended as first-line treatment, there is limited evidence regarding the cost effectiveness of long-term maintenance antidepressants for preventing relapse. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to calculate the mean incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 12 months of discontinuing long-term antidepressant medication in well patients compared with maintenance, using patient-level trial data. METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis of 478 participants from 150 UK general practices recruited to a randomised, double-blind trial (ANTLER). QALYs were calculated from EQ-5D-5L and 12-Item ShortÂ Form survey (SF-12) results, with primary analysis using the EQ-5D-5L value set for England. Resource use was collected from primary care patient electronic medical records and self-completed questionnaires capturing mental-health-related resource use. Costs were calculated by applying standard UK unit costs to resource use. Adjustments were made for baseline variables. RESULTS: Participants randomised to discontinuation had significantly worse utility scores at 3 months (-Â 0.032; 95% confidence interval [CI] -Â 0.053 to -Â 0.011) but no significant difference in QALYs (-Â 0.011; 95% CI -Â 0.026 to 0.003) or costs (Â£3.11; 95% CI -Â 41.28 to 47.50) at 12 months. The probability that discontinuation was cost effective compared with maintenance was 12.9% at a threshold of Â£20,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Discontinuation of antidepressants was unlikely to be cost effective compared with maintenance for currently well patients on long-term antidepressants. However, this analysis provides no information on the wider impact of antidepressants. Our findings provide information on the potential impact of discontinuing long-term maintenance antidepressants and facilitate improving guidanceÂ forÂ shared patient-clinician decision making.

"The Risk of Preoperative Central Nervous System-Acting Medications on Delirium Following Hip or Knee Surgery: A Matched Case-Control Study","INTRODUCTION: Medicines acting on the central nervous system can increase the risk of postoperative delirium, but the specific medicines associated with greatest risk remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the risk of individual central nervous system-acting medicines used preoperatively on delirium after hip or knee surgery. METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted using data from the Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs. We included people aged 65 years or older who had knee or hip surgery between 2000 and 2019. People with hip or knee surgery who developed postoperative delirium were cases and controls were people with hip or knee surgery but who did not develop postoperative delirium. Use of medicines including anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics, opioid analgesics and antidepressants prior to surgery was compared between cases and controls. RESULTS: A total of 2614 patient cases with postoperative delirium were matched by same sex, age (Â±2 years), and year of admission (Â±2 years) with 7842 controls without postoperative delirium. Cases were more likely to be exposed to nitrazepam (odds ratio [OR] = 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24-2.64), sertraline (OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.20-1.87), mirtazapine (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.11-1.74), venlafaxine (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.02-1.98), citalopram (OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.19-1.99), escitalopram (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.06-1.89) or fluvoxamine (OR = 5.01, 95% CI 2.15-11.68) prior to surgery than controls. At the class level, exposure to benzodiazepines (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.05-1.37) and antidepressants (OR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.47-1.83) prior to surgery was significantly higher in cases than in controls. The numbers needed to treat to harm for one additional delirium case were 43 for sertraline, 40 for citalopram, 57 for mirtazapine and 26 for nitrazepam. Whereas, the numbers needed to treat to harm were found to be 20 for sertraline, 17 for citalopram, 19 for mirtazapine and 10 for nitrazepam in the 85 years or older age group, indicating that the harmful effect of these medicines is pronounced as age advances. CONCLUSIONS: People who developed delirium following hip or knee surgery were more likely to be exposed to nitrazepam, sertraline, mirtazapine, venlafaxine, citalopram, escitalopram or fluvoxamine at the time of admission for surgery. Planning to reduce use of these medicines well prior to surgery may decrease the risk of postoperative delirium.","Kassie, Gizat M; Roughead, Elizabeth E; Nguyen, Tuan A; Pratt, Nicole L; Kalisch Ellett, Lisa M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40264-021-01136-1","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Drug Saf;2021 Nov 08.; Publication details: Drug Saf;2021 Nov 08.; Country: NZ; NOVA ZELÃ‚NDIA; NEW ZEALAND; NUEVA ZELANDA","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22469,""
"Risk Factors for Veteran Food Insecurity: Findings from a National US Department of Veterans Affairs Food Insecurity Screener","OBJECTIVE: Food insecurity is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes. The US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) began universal food insecurity screening in 2017. This study examined prevalence and correlates of food insecurity among Veterans screened. DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study using VHA administrative data. Multivariable logistic regression models were estimated to identify sociodemographic and medical characteristics associated with a positive food insecurity screen. SETTING: All US VA medical centers (n=161). PARTICIPANTS: All Veterans screened for food insecurity since screening initiation (July 2017-December 2018). RESULTS: Of 3,304,702 Veterans screened for food insecurity, 44,298 were positive on their initial screen (1.3% of men; 2.0% of women). Food insecurity was associated with identifying as non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic. Veterans who were non-married/partnered, low-income Veterans without VA disability-related compensation, and those with housing instability had higher odds of food insecurity, as did Veterans with a BMI<18.5, diabetes, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Prior military sexual trauma was associated with food insecurity among both men and women. Women screening positive, however, were eight times more likely than men to have experienced military sexual trauma (48.9% vs 5.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity was associated with medical and trauma-related comorbidities as well as unmet social needs including housing instability. Additionally, Veterans of color and women were at higher risk for food insecurity. Findings can inform development of tailored interventions to address food insecurity such as more frequent screening among high-risk populations, onsite support applying for federal food assistance programs, and formal partnerships with community-based resources.","Cohen, Alicia J; Dosa, David M; Rudolph, James L; Halladay, Christopher W; Heisler, Michele; Thomas, Kali S","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1368980021004584","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Public Health Nutr;: 1-26, 2021 Nov 08.; Publication details: Public Health Nutr;: 1-26, 2021 Nov 08.; Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22470,""
"Environmental Displacement and Mental Well-Being in Banjarnegara, Indonesia","BACKGROUND: Residential moves (displacement) owing to climate- and weather-related disasters may significantly impact mental health. Despite the growing risk from climate change, health impacts of environmental-mobility remain understudied. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the effects of displacement on the association between landslides and changes in perceived mental well-being in Banjarnegara, Indonesia. We also investigated whether sociodemographics (age, sex, level of education, household-level income, or employment in agriculture) and landslide characteristics (number and severity of landslides) were associated with differing odds of relocation after experiencing landslides. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we surveyed 420 individuals who experienced landslides between 2014 and 2018 to assess perceived changes in mental well-being, comparing after landslide exposure to before landslide exposure. We used a novel six-item measure that was created in collaboration with the local community to compare perceived changes between those who were displaced by landslides and those who were not displaced, using logistic and multinomial regressions adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. We then assessed whether the odds of displacement differed based on sociodemographic characteristics and landslide exposure characteristics, using logistic regressions. RESULTS: Those who were displaced were more likely than those who were not displaced to report perceived increases in economic stability [odds ratio (OR)=3.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.45, 6.46], optimism (OR=4.01; 95% CI: 1.87, 8.61), safety (OR=2.71; 95% CI: 1.44, 5.10), religiosity (OR=1.92; 95% CI: 1.03, 3.65), and closeness with community (OR=1.90; 95% CI: 1.10, 3.33) after landslides compared with before their first landslide during the study period. More frequent landslide exposures were associated with reduced odds of relocation, but more severe landslides were associated with increased odds of relocation. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that landslides affect the mental well-being not only of those who are displaced but also of those who are left behind. Further, this work supports the need for community-based participatory research to fully capture the health impacts of environmental mobility. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP9391.","Burrows, Kate; Pelupessy, Dicky C; Khoshnood, Kaveh; Bell, Michelle L","https://dx.doi.org/10.1289/EHP9391","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Environ Health Perspect;129(11): 117002, 2021 Nov.; Publication details: Environ Health Perspect;129(11): 117002, 2021 Nov.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22471,""
"A Meta-analysis of the Effect of Motivational Interviewing on Depression, Anxiety, and Quality of Life in Stroke Patients","ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Motivational interviewing has become a popular approach for relieving mood disturbances. We aimed to investigate whether motivational interviewing can effectively improve depression, anxiety, and quality of life among stroke patients. METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched from inception to March 15, 2021. Other potentially related studies were identified through manually searching the reference lists of empirical articles and relevant review articles. Randomized controlled trials that investigated the effects of motivational interviewing on stroke patients with mood disturbances were deemed eligible. The Cochrane Handbook 5.1.0 was used to assess the risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted using the Review Manager Version 5.3. RESULTS: Six articles with 1419 participants were included. The subgroup analysis revealed that motivational interviewing was associated with improvement of depression (P < .00001) and quality of life (P = .0007) among patients having stroke at less than 12 months of follow-up. No significant differences were detected for improving depression (P = .40) and quality of life (P = .38) at 12 months of follow-up. Furthermore, the meta-analysis showed that motivational interviewing was not associated with alleviation of anxiety (P = .81) among stroke patients. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicated that motivational interviewing might have beneficial effects on depression and quality of life in stroke patients at less than 12 months of follow-up. However, large and well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.","Qiqi, Ni; Hangting, Li; Jia, Wu; Jiaoni, Shen; Xinrui, Wan; Guijuan, He","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JNN.0000000000000617","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: J Neurosci Nurs;53(6): 244-250, 2021 Dec 01.; Publication details: J Neurosci Nurs;53(6): 244-250, 2021 Dec 01.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Motivational Interviewing; Stroke; Anxiety; Depression/therapy; Humans; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stroke/therapy","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22472,""
"Childhood adversity patterns differentially cluster with mental disorders and socioeconomic indicators in a large Swiss community sample","BACKGROUND: Exposure to childhood adversities (CHAD) has been found to be strongly associated with individuals' mental health and social development. Recently, it has been suggested that certain CHAD patterns exist in the population, which are more closely related to individuals' later mental health than the simple summation of adversities. The current study aims 1) to establish CHAD patterns based on self-reported child abuse and family dysfunction and 2) to assess their associations with mental disorders and sociodemographic indicators reported in adulthood. METHODS: Data used in this cross-sectional study were derived from the representative CoLaus/PsyCoLaus population-based cohort (NÂ =Â 5111, 35 to 88Â years). Latent class analysis was conducted for the identification of CHAD patterns, while their associations with mental disorders and socioeconomic achievements (e. g. education and income) were investigated using correspondence analysis. RESULTS: Four CHAD patterns emerged. While the majority (70.7%) of the sample showed an overall low adversity pattern (c1), 13.6% had not been raised by both of their biological parents due to divorce or being placed in foster home (c2), 11.0% had been raised by conflictive / dysfunctional / abusive parents (c3), and 4.7% showed high overall adversities (c4). Patterns c3 and c4 were most strongly associated with various mental disorders, especially c3 with internalizing anxiety disorders, while c2 was closely related to lower educational achievement. CONCLUSIONS: Four CHAD patterns characterised by varying levels of child abuse and family dysfunction existed in this community sample. They yielded distinct associations with mental disorders and socioeconomic indicators.","Xu, Yanhua; Ajdacic-Gross, Vladeta; MÃ¼ller, Mario; Buadze, Anna; Seifritz, Erich; Kleim, Birgit; von KÃ¤nel, Roland; Wagner, En-Young N; Strippoli, Marie-Pierre F; Castelao, Enrique; Preisig, Martin; Vandeleur, Caroline L","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2021.152282","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Compr Psychiatry;112: 152282, 2021 Oct 21.; Publication details: Compr Psychiatry;112: 152282, 2021 Oct 21.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22473,""
"Do positive and negative emotional reactions during war predict subsequent symptomatology? A prospective experience sampling study","While peritraumatic negative emotions have been associated with subsequent posttraumatic stress and depression, the predictive role of real-time emotional reactions to specific stressors during prolonged stress exposure is still unclear, particularly that of positive emotions. The current study uses experience sampling methodology to examine individual general levels of negative and positive emotions, and emotional reactivity to specific stressors during war, as prospective predictors of posttraumatic stress and depression. Ninety-six civilians exposed to rocket fire during the 2014 Israel-Gaza war reported exposure to rocket warning sirens and levels of ten negative and six positive emotions twice a day for 30 days. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress and depression were then assessed two months post-war. Participants reported higher negative emotions and lower positive emotions during assessment windows with sirens. Over time, negative emotions decreased and positive emotions increased. Higher levels of overall negative emotions predicted posttraumatic stress symptoms and depression symptoms two months later. Levels of positive emotions, and negative and positive emotional reactivity to sirens, were not associated with subsequent symptomatology. Our results indicate the stronger role of overall negative emotions as predictors of symptomatology compared with momentary emotional reactivity, and the stronger predictive role of negative compared with positive emotions.","Lapid Pickman, Liron; Gelkopf, Marc; Greene, Talya","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102492","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: J Anxiety Disord;84: 102492, 2021 Dec.; Publication details: J Anxiety Disord;84: 102492, 2021 Dec.; Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22474,""
"Potential structural trait markers of depression in the form of alterations in the structures of subcortical nuclei and structural covariance network properties","It has been proposed recently that major depressive disorder (MDD) could represent an adaptation to conserve energy after the perceived loss of an investment in a vital source, such as group identity, personal assets, or relationships. Energy conserving behaviors associated with MDD may form a persistent marker in brain regions and networks involved in cognition and emotion regulation. In this study, we examined whether subcortical regions and volume-based structural covariance networks (SCNs) have state-independent alterations (trait markers). First-episode drug-naÃ¯ve currently depressed (cMDD) patients (NÂ =Â 131), remitted MDD (RD) patients (NÂ =Â 67), and healthy controls (HCs, NÂ =Â 235) underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Subcortical gray matter volumes (GMVs) were calculated in FreeSurfer software, and group differences in GMVs and SCN were analyzed. Compared to HCs, major findings were decreased GMVs of left pallidum and pulvinar anterior of thalamus in the cMDD and RD groups, indicative of a trait marker. Relative to HCs, subcortical SCNs of both cMDD and RD patients were found to have reduced small-world-ness and path length, which together may represent a trait-like topological feature of depression. In sum, the left pallidum, left pulvinar anterior of thalamus volumetric alterations may represent trait marker and reduced small-world-ness, path length may represent trait-like topological feature of MDD.","Xiong, Ge; Dong, Daifeng; Cheng, Chang; Jiang, Yali; Sun, Xiaoqiang; He, Jiayue; Li, Chuting; Gao, Yidian; Zhong, Xue; Zhao, Haofei; Wang, Xiang; Yao, Shuqiao","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2021.102871","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neuroimage Clin;32: 102871, 2021 Nov 03.; Publication details: Neuroimage Clin;32: 102871, 2021 Nov 03.; Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22475,""
"Common Factors Underlying Diverse Responses in Alcohol Use Disorder","Objective: Interindividual variation in responses to alcohol is substantial, posing challenges for medical management and for understanding the biological underpinnings of alcohol use disorders (AUD). It is important to understand whether diverse alcohol responses such as sedation, which is predictive of risk and partly heritable, occur concurrently or independently from responses such as blackouts and withdrawal. We hypothesized that latent factors accounting for sources of variance in diverse alcohol response phenotypes could be identified in a large, deeply phenotyped sample of patients with AUD. Methods: We factor analyzed 17 alcohol response related items from the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS) in 938 individuals diagnosed with AUD via structured clinical interviews. Demographic, genetic, and clinical characteristics were tested as predictors of the latent factors by multiple indicators, multiple causes analysis. Results: The final factor solution included three alcohol response factors: Physical Symptoms, Perceptual Disturbances, and Neurobiological Effects. Both gender and genetic ancestry were identified as variables influencing alcohol response. Major depressive disorder positively predicted physical symptoms and aggression negatively predicted physical symptoms. Barratt's Impulsivity Scale total score predicted the Physical and Perceptual domains. Family history, average drinks per drinking day, and negative urgency (an impulsivity measure) predicted all three domains. Conclusions: Diverse items from the ADS concurrently load onto three correlated alcohol response factors rather than loading independently. Genetic ancestry and clinical characteristics predicted the severity of items that define the alcohol response factors even after accounting for degree of alcohol consumption. Co-occurring phenotypes point towards an underlying shared physiology of diverse alcohol responses.","Chebolu, Esha; Schwandt, Melanie L; Ramchandani, Vijay A; Stangl, Bethany L; George, David T; Horneffer, Yvonne; Vinson, Tonette; Vogt, Emily L; Manor, Brandon A; Diazgranados, Nancy; Goldman, David","https://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.prcp.20200028","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatr Res Clin Pract;3(2): 76-87, 2021.; Publication details: Psychiatr Res Clin Pract;3(2): 76-87, 2021.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22476,""
"Secondary analysis of retrospective and prospective reports of adverse childhood experiences and mental health in young adulthood: Filtered through recent stressors","Background: Evidence has identified the detrimental effects that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have on outcomes across the life course. We assess associations between prospective and retrospective ACEs and mental health in young adulthood and the influence of recent stressors. Methods: Secondary analysis of a sample of 1592 young adults from the Birth to Twenty Plus cohort, from 1990 to 2013, were assessed throughout their first 18 years for prospective ACEs. Retrospective ACEs and an assessment of mental health were collected at the 22-23-year data point. Findings: Prospective physical and sexual abuse are associated with an increased risk of depression (OR 1Â·7 [95% CI 1Â·37-1Â·93, pÂ =Â 0Â·034], and OR 1Â·8 [95% CI 1Â·27-2Â·07, pÂ =Â 0Â·018], respectively). Retrospective emotional abuse/neglect is associated with increased anxiety (OR 1Â·8 [95% CI 1Â·32-2Â·36, pÂ =Â 0Â·000]), depression (OR 1Â·6 [95% CI 1Â·08-2Â·25, pÂ =Â 0Â·018]) and overall psychological distress (OR 1Â·6 [95% CI 1Â·18-2Â·17, pÂ =Â 0Â·002]). Prospectively reporting four or more ACEs is associated with a twofold increase in risk for overall psychological distress (OR 2Â·2 [95% CI 1Â·58-3.12, pÂ =Â 0Â·008]). Retrospectively reporting four or more ACEs is associated with increased likelihood of somatization (pÂ =Â 0Â·004), anxiety (pÂ =Â 0Â·002), depression (pÂ =Â 0Â·021), and overall psychological distress (pÂ =Â 0Â·005). Interpretation: Both individual and combined retrospective and prospective ACEs are related to mental health in young adulthood. Recent stressors reinforce this relationship; the likelihood of those who report more ACEs experiencing psychological distress increases when adjusting for recent stressors.

"Patients Require Less Time to Complete Preoperative Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Than Legacy Patient-Reported Outcome Measures","Purpose: To analyze time to completion of preoperative legacy patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and more recent computer adaptive Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) questionnaires in patients with symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement syndrome undergoing primary hip arthroscopy. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients undergoing hip arthroscopy by a single fellowship-trained hip arthroscopist. Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing primary arthroscopic hip surgery and completion of at least 1 legacy PRO or PROMIS questionnaire at the preoperative time point. Exclusion criteria were history of contralateral or ipsilateral hip surgery, non-English-speaking patients, patients who completed PROs by phone or by paper form, and patients who did not complete preoperative PROs. Legacy PROs included modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), Hip Outcome Score (HOS), International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-12), and Hip Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS-Pain). PROMIS PROs included Physical Function (PROMIS-PF), Pain Interference (PROMIS-PI), and Depression (PROMIS-D). Only preoperative PROs were included in the analysis. Completion time was calculated using the questionnaire start and stop time reported by the survey collecting software. The median and interquartile range of each PRO were reported for analysis of central tendency and statistical dispersion, respectively. Results: A total of 1,901 patients and 269 patients were included in the legacy and PROMIS groups, respectively. The median time required for completion of each PRO in (minutes: seconds) format was as follows: mHHS (1:29), HOS (3:58), iHOT (2:11), VAS-Pain (0:32), PROMIS-PF (0:46), PROMIS-PI (0:37), and PROMIS-D (0:43). The interquartile range of the middle 50% of respondents was as follows; mHHS (0:58), HOS (2:46), iHOT (1:22), VAS-Pain (0:28), PROMIS-PI (0:19), PROMIS-D (0:29), and PROMIS-PF (0:20). Conclusions: This study supports that preoperative PROMIS forms require less time to complete than preoperative legacy PROs and are not significantly influenced by age, race, or workers compensation status.

"Electro-responsive actuators based on graphene","Electro-responsive actuators (ERAs) hold great promise for cutting-edge applications in e-skins, soft robots, unmanned flight, and in vivo surgery devices due to the advantages of fast response, precise control, programmable deformation, and the ease of integration with control circuits. Recently, considering the excellent physical/chemical/mechanical properties (e.g., high carrier mobility, strong mechanical strength, outstanding thermal conductivity, high specific surface area, flexibility, and transparency), graphene and its derivatives have emerged as an appealing material in developing ERAs. In this review, we have summarized the recent advances in graphene-based ERAs. Typical the working mechanisms of graphene ERAs have been introduced. Design principles and working performance of three typical types of graphene ERAs (e.g., electrostatic actuators, electrothermal actuators, and ionic actuators) have been comprehensively summarized. Besides, emerging applications of graphene ERAs, including artificial muscles, bionic robots, human-soft actuators interaction, and other smart devices, have been reviewed. At last, the current challenges and future perspectives of graphene ERAs are discussed.","Zhang, Yong-Lai; Li, Ji-Chao; Zhou, Hao; Liu, Yu-Qing; Han, Dong-Dong; Sun, Hong-Bo","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.xinn.2021.100168","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Innovation (N Y);2(4): 100168, 2021 Nov 28.; Publication details: Innovation (N Y);2(4): 100168, 2021 Nov 28.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22479,""
"Effects of treadmill exercise on anxiety-like behavior in association with changes in estrogen receptors ER&#945;, ERÃŸ and oxytocin of C57BL/6J female mice","Exercise can reduce the incidence of stress-related mental diseases, such as depression and anxiety. Control group was neither exposed to CVMS nor TRE (noCVMS/noTRE). Females were tested and levels of serum17-beta-oestradiol (E2), estrogen receptors &#945; immunoreactive neurons (ER&#945;-IRs), estrogen receptors ÃŸ immunoreactive neurons (ERÃŸ-IRs) and oxytocin immunoreactive neurons (OT-IRs) were measured. The results showed there's increased anxiety-like behaviors for mice from CVMS/noTRE, CVMS/higher speed TRE (CVMS/HTRE) and noCVMS/HTRE groups when they were put in open field and elevated maze tests. They had lower serum E2 levels than mice from CVMS/low-moderate speed TRE (CVMS/LMTRE), noCVMS/LMTRE and noCVMS/noTRE groups. The three groups of CVMS/noTRE, CVMS/HTRE and noCVMS/HTRE mice had more ER&#945;-IRs and less ERÃŸ-IRs in the medial preoptic area (mPOA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and medial amygdala (MeA), hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON). The number of OT-IRs in PVN and SON of CVMS/noTRE, CVMS/HTRE and noCVMS/HTRE mice was also lower than that of mice from CVMS/LMTRE, noCVMS/LMTRE and noCVMS/noTRE groups. Interestingly, CVMS/LMTRE and noCVMS/LMTRE mice were similar to noCVMS/noTRE mice in that they did not show anxiety, while CVMS/HTRE and noCVMS/HTRE mice did not, which were similar to the mice in CVMS/noTRE. We propose that LMTRE instead of HTRE changes the serum concentration of E2. ERÃŸ/ER&#945; ratio and OT level in the brain may be responsible for the decrease in anxiety-like behavior in female mice exposed to anxiety-inducing stress conditions.","He, Feng-Qin; Fan, Mei-Yang; Hui, Yu-Nan; Lai, Rui-Juan; Chen, Xin; Yang, Ming-Juan; Cheng, Xiao-Xia; Wang, Zi-Jian; Yu, Bin; Yan, Bing-Jie; Tian, Zhen","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibneur.2021.10.001","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: IBRO Neurosci Rep;11: 164-174, 2021 Dec.; Publication details: IBRO Neurosci Rep;11: 164-174, 2021 Dec.; Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22480,""

"Stressors and mental health in Bangladesh: current situation and future hopes","Bangladesh is a densely populated emerging country in South Asia. Since its harsh independence war, it has suffered from repeated floods and other natural and man-inflicted disasters. Internal migration from rural areas to the urban centres has increased crowdedness, pollution and social conflicts. Furthermore, in recent years, the country has absorbed close to a million refugees from Myanmar. These stressors have been associated with an increase in mental disorders and symptoms with which the country is struggling. Lack of resources and a shortage of human capital have weakened the national capacity to efficiently respond to situational stressors or disasters. For assessment of stress-related mental health issues, information available from the Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Mental Health was collected and supplemented by external reports. It is promising that the government's approach of responding to mental health needs only after the occurrence of a crisis has recently been replaced by the concept of total management through primary healthcare. There is a need for development of adequate infrastructure, logistics and workforce support, as well as establishment of multidisciplinary teams of management and clinical services. Collaboration of all related sectors of the government and an overall increase in government funding for mental health are essential.","Alam, Faruq; Hossain, Rubina; Ahmed, Helal Uddin; Alam, Mohammad Tariqul; Sarkar, Mekhala; Halbreich, Uriel","https://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bji.2020.57","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Int;18(4): 91-94, 2021 Nov.; Publication details: BJPsych Int;18(4): 91-94, 2021 Nov.; Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22482,""

"""Mapping suicide prevention initiatives targeting Indigenous SÃ¡mi in Nordic countries""","BACKGROUND: Suicide is a major public health issue among Indigenous SÃ¡mi in Nordic countries, and efforts to prevent suicide in the SÃ¡mi context are increasing. However, there is no literature on suicide prevention initiatives among SÃ¡mi. The aim of the study was to map suicide prevention initiatives targeting SÃ¡mi in Norway, Sweden, and Finland during 2005-2019. METHOD: Initiatives were identified and described through utilizing networks among stakeholders in the field of suicide prevention among SÃ¡mi, acquiring documentation of initiatives and utilizing the authors first-hand experiences. The described initiatives were analyzed inspired by the ""What is the problem represented to be?"" (WPR)-approach. RESULTS: Seventeen initiatives targeting SÃ¡mi were identified during 2005-2019, including nine in Sweden, five in Norway, one in Finland and two international initiatives. Analysis with the WPR-approach yielded 40 problematizations regarding how to prevent suicide among SÃ¡mi, pertaining to shortcomings on individual (5), relational (15), community/cultural (3), societal (14) and health systems levels (3). All initiatives were adapted to the SÃ¡mi context, varying from tailor-made, culture-specific approaches to targeting SÃ¡mi with universal approaches. The most common approaches were the gatekeeper and mental health literacy training programs. The initiatives generally lacked thorough evaluation components. CONCLUSION: We argue that the dominant rationales for suicide prevention were addressing shortcomings on individual and relational levels, and raising awareness in the general public. This threatens obscuring other, critical, approaches, such as broadening perspectives in prevention planning, improving health systems for SÃ¡mi, and promoting cultural empowerment among SÃ¡mi. Nevertheless, the study confirms considerable efforts have been invested into suicide prevention among SÃ¡mi during the last 15 years, and future initiatives might include a broader set of prevention rationales. To improve evaluation and identify the most promising practices, increased support regarding development of plans and implementation of evaluation components is needed.","Stoor, Jon Petter A; Eriksen, Heidi A; Silviken, Anne C","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-12111-x","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMC Public Health;21(1): 2035, 2021 Nov 07.; Publication details: BMC Public Health;21(1): 2035, 2021 Nov 07.; Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22489,""
"The impact of participant mental health on attendance and engagement in a trial of behavioural weight management programmes: secondary analysis of the WRAP randomised controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Low attendance and engagement in behavioural weight management trials are common. Mental health may play an important role, however previous research exploring this association is limited with inconsistent findings. We aimed to investigate whether mental health was associated with attendance and engagement in a trial of behavioural weight management programmes. METHODS: This is a secondary data analysis of the Weight loss referrals for adults in primary care (WRAP) trial, which randomised 1267 adults with overweight or obesity to brief intervention, WW (formerly Weight Watchers) for 12-weeks, or WW for 52-weeks. We used regression analyses to assess the association of baseline mental health (depression and anxiety (by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), quality of life (by EQ5D), satisfaction with life (by Satisfaction with Life Questionnaire)) with programme attendance and engagement in WW groups, and trial attendance in all randomised groups. RESULTS: Every one unit of baseline depression score was associated with a 1% relative reduction in rate of WW session attendance in the first 12 weeks (Incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.99; 95% CI 0.98, 0.999). Higher baseline anxiety was associated with 4% lower odds to report high engagement with WW digital tools (Odds ratio [OR] 0.96; 95% CI 0.94, 0.99). Every one unit of global quality of life was associated with 69% lower odds of reporting high engagement with the WW mobile app (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.15, 0.64). Greater symptoms of depression and anxiety and lower satisfaction with life at baseline were consistently associated with lower odds of attending study visits at 3-, 12-, 24-, and 60-months. CONCLUSIONS: Participants were less likely to attend programme sessions, engage with resources, and attend study assessments when reporting poorer baseline mental health. Differences in attendance and engagement were small, however changes may still have a meaningful effect on programme effectiveness and trial completion. Future research should investigate strategies to maximise attendance and engagement in those reporting poorer mental health. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The original trial ( ISRCTN82857232 ) and five year follow up ( ISRCTN64986150 ) were prospectively registered with Current Controlled Trials on 15/10/2012 and 01/02/2018.","Jones, Rebecca A; Mueller, Julia; Sharp, Stephen J; Vincent, Ann; Duschinsky, Robbie; Griffin, Simon J; Ahern, Amy L","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-021-01216-6","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act;18(1): 146, 2021 Nov 07.; Publication details: Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act;18(1): 146, 2021 Nov 07.; Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22490,""
"Psychometric validation of the Chinese version of the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and evaluation of its measurement invariance across sex","BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (C-SIBDQ), and its measurement invariance across sex in Chinese patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Between September 2018 and July 2021, 284 patients with IBD were recruited from a spleen and stomach clinic. All participants completed the C-SIBDQ, 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9), and the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Floor and ceiling effects were evaluated by testing frequencies and composition ratios for the minimum and maximum C-SIBDQ scores. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to evaluate the C-SIBDQ's factor structure and construct validity. Convergent validity was evaluated through examining bivariate correlations between the C-SIBDQ and the SF-12, PHQ-9, and GAD-7. Internal consistency reliability and retest reliability were evaluated by respectively calculating the Cronbach's &#945; and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) among a subsample (n = 79) after 2Â weeks. The measurement invariance across sex was evaluated through multiple-group CFA. RESULTS: The C-SIBDQ scores showed no floor or ceiling effects and had a single-factor structure and good convergent validity, with significant correlations with the SF-12, PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Good internal consistency (Cronbach's &#945; = 0.920) and test-retest reliability (ICC = 959) were observed. The C-SIBDQ also showed measurement invariance across sex, and females showed higher C-SIBDQ scores than males. CONCLUSIONS: The C-SIBDQ has high reliability, validity, and stability across sex, and can be used in clinics to assess the health-related quality of life of patients with IBD.","Sun, Dajuan; Chi, Lili; Liu, Jiahui; Liang, Junwei; Guo, Song; Li, Shaojie","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12955-021-01890-x","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Qual Life Outcomes;19(1): 253, 2021 Nov 07.; Publication details: Health Qual Life Outcomes;19(1): 253, 2021 Nov 07.; Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Quality of Life; China; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/diagnosis; Male; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22491,""
"Disturbances in branched-chain amino acid profile and poor daily functioning in mildly depressed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients","BACKGROUND: Depression is one of the most common and untreated comorbidities in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and is associated with poor health outcomes (e.g. increased hospitalization/exacerbation rates). Although metabolic disturbances have been suggested in depressed non-diseased conditions, comprehensive metabolic phenotyping has never been conducted in those with COPD. We examined whether depressed COPD patients have certain clinical/functional features and exhibit a specific amino acid phenotype which may guide the development of targeted (nutritional) therapies. METHODS: Seventy-eight outpatients with moderate to severe COPD (GOLD II-IV) were stratified based on presence of depression using a validated questionnaire. Lung function, disease history, habitual physical activity and protein intake, body composition, cognitive and physical performance, and quality of life were measured. Comprehensive metabolic flux analysis was conducted by pulse stable amino acid isotope administration. We obtained blood samples to measure postabsorptive kinetics (production and clearance rates) and plasma concentrations of amino acids by LC-MS/MS. Data are expressed as mean [95% CI]. Stats were done by graphpad Prism 9.1.0. Ã‰<U+0091> < 0.05. RESULTS: The COPD depressed (CD, n = 27) patients on average had mild depression, were obese (BMI: 31.7 [28.4, 34.9] kg/m2), and were characterized by shorter 6-min walk distance (P = 0.055), physical inactivity (P = 0.03), and poor quality of life (P = 0.01) compared to the non-depressed COPD (CN, n = 51) group. Lung function, disease history, body composition, cognitive performance, and daily protein intake were not different between the groups. In the CD group, plasma branched chain amino acid concentration (BCAA) was lower (P = 0.02), whereas leucine (P = 0.01) and phenylalanine (P = 0.003) clearance rates were higher. Reduced values were found for tyrosine plasma concentration (P = 0.005) even after adjustment for the large neutral amino acid concentration (= sum BCAA, tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan) as a marker of dopamine synthesis (P = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Mild depression in COPD is associated with poor daily performance and quality of life, and a set of metabolic changes in depressed COPD that include perturbation of large neutral amino acids, specifically the BCAAs.

"Breast may not always be best: moderation of effects of postnatal depression by breastfeeding and infant sex","BACKGROUND: There is good evidence that female infants are particularly vulnerable to poor emotional outcomes following in utero glucocorticoid exposure. It is currently unclear whether such effects might persist into the postnatal period for breastfed infants, as maternal cortisol is expressed in breastmilk and is influenced by maternal psychological distress. We pre-registered hypotheses that maternal postnatal depression would be associated with infant negative emotionality, and that this effect would be moderated by breastfeeding status and infant sex. METHODS: We analysed data from the Wirral Child Health and Development Study (WCHADS), a prospective epidemiological study starting in pregnancy. Nine weeks after birth mothers self-reported depressive symptoms and breastfeeding status, and reported infant negative emotionality using the distress to limits subscale of the infant behaviour questionnaire (IBQ-R) when their infant was aged 9Â weeks and 14Â months. Maximum likelihood estimations made use of data from 857 mother-infant pairs. RESULTS: At 9Â weeks of age, maternal postnatal depressive symptoms were positively associated with infant distress to limits; however, this effect was not moderated by infant sex or breastfeeding. At age 14Â months, the association between postnatal depression symptoms and distress to limits was greatest in the breastfed females, whereas the association was smaller, but still significant, in the non-breastfed females. For males, the association was non-significant in both the breastfed and non-breastfed groups. A test of sex difference between breastfed males and females was significant. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that effects of maternal postnatal depression on child emotional outcomes are moderated by breastfeeding status and differ by infant sex. Female vulnerability to elevated maternal breastmilk glucocorticoids may, at least in part, explain these effects.","Braithwaite, Elizabeth C; Sharp, Helen; Pickles, Andrew; Hill, Jonathan; Wright, Nicola","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13293-021-00403-1","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Biol Sex Differ;12(1): 59, 2021 Nov 07.; Publication details: Biol Sex Differ;12(1): 59, 2021 Nov 07.; Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22493,""
"Evaluating the Cumulative Impact of Childhood Misfortune: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach","Most studies of the early origins of adult health rely on summing dichotomously measured negative exposures to measure childhood misfortune (CM), neglect, adversity, or trauma. There are several limitations to this approach, including that it assumes each exposure carries the same level of risk for a particular outcome. Further, it often leads researchers to dichotomize continuous measures for the sake of creating an additive variable from similar indicators. We propose an alternative approach within the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework that allows differential weighting of the negative exposures and can incorporate dichotomous and continuous observed variables as well as latent variables. Using the Health and Retirement Study data, our analyses compare the traditional approach (i.e., adding indicators) with alternative models and assess their prognostic validity on adult depressive symptoms. Results reveal that parameter estimates using the conventional model likely underestimate the effects of CM on adult health outcomes. Additionally, while the conventional approach inhibits testing for mediation, our model enables testing mediation of both individual CM variables and the cumulative variable. Further, we test whether cumulative CM is moderated by the accumulation of protective factors, which facilitates theoretical advances in life course and social inequality research. The approach presented here is one way to examine the cumulative effects of early exposures while attending to diversity in the types of exposures experienced. Using the SEM framework, this versatile approach could be used to model the accumulation of risk or reward in many other areas of sociology and the social sciences beyond health.","Mustillo, Sarah; Li, Miao; Ferraro, Kenneth F","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0049124119875957","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sociol Methods Res;50(3): 1073-1109, 2021 Aug 01.; Publication details: Sociol Methods Res;50(3): 1073-1109, 2021 Aug 01.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22494,""
"Comparing narrative-informed occupational therapy in adult outpatient mental health to treatment as usual: A quasi-experimental feasibility study with preliminary treatment outcomes","This paper describes implementation of a narrative-informed occupation-based service in an outpatient community mental health setting that addressed several gaps, including 1) the need for outcome data on occupational therapy in this setting; 2) an ongoing mental health provider shortage; and 3) a need for innovative approaches to supporting mental health. We found a significant improvement from baseline to post-intervention in occupational participation, and dose of occupational therapy was significantly related to improvements in the areas of roles, habits, values, long-term goals, social environment, and readiness for change. This study suggests future, larger effectiveness studies of narrative-informed occupation-based interventions delivered by occupational therapists in outpatient community mental health are warranted.","Wasmuth, Sally; Wilburn, Victoria G; Hamm, Jay A; Chase, Anthony","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0164212x.2020.1845276","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Occup Ther Ment Health;37(1): 56-71, 2021.; Publication details: Occup Ther Ment Health;37(1): 56-71, 2021.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22495,""
"HIV Injection Risk Behaviors among HIV-Negative People Who Inject Drugs Experiencing Homelessness, 23 US Cities","Despite recent declines in numbers of people who inject drugs (PWID) diagnosed with HIV, clusters of HIV among PWID are ongoing, especially among PWID experiencing homelessness. Using data from the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance in 2018, we evaluated the association between homelessness and injection risk and prevention behaviors among HIV-negative PWID who were recruited by respondent-driven sampling in 23 U.S. cities. Interviewers assessed sociodemographic characteristics, history of overdose, and behavioral risk and prevention factors for HIV. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% CI were obtained using Poisson regression models. Of 10,614 HIV-negative PWID participants, 7275 (68.5%) reported experiencing homelessness. Homeless PWID were more likely than those who were not to be younger age, white, unemployed, without health insurance, in poverty, experiencing psychological distress, and incarcerated in the past 12 months. PWID experiencing homelessness were significantly more likely to report injection risk behaviors [share syringes/equipment (aPR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.20-1.33), non-fatal opioid overdose (aPR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.49-1.79)] and prevention behaviors [testing for HIV in past 12 months (aPR = 1.18; 95% CI = 1.12-1.24) and using syringe services programs (aPR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.03-1.16)] than PWID not experiencing homelessness.

"Adverse Childhood Experiences in relation to drug and alcohol use in the 30 days prior to incarceration in a county jail","Purpose: To characterize the relationship between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and substance use among people incarcerated in a county jail. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was administered to 199 individuals incarcerated in a Southwest county jail as part of a social-epidemiological exploration of converging co-morbidities in incarcerated populations. Among 96 participants with complete ACEs data, the authors determined associations between individual ACEs items and a summative score with methamphetamine (meth), heroin, other opiates, and cocaine use and binge drinking in the 30 days prior to incarceration using logistic regression. Findings: People who self-reported use of methamphetamine, heroin, other opiates, or cocaine in the 30 days prior to incarceration had higher average ACEs scores. Methamphetamine use was significantly associated with living with anyone who served time in a correctional facility and with someone trying to make them touch sexually. Opiate use was significantly associated with living with anyone who was depressed, mentally ill, or suicidal; living with anyone who used illegal street drugs or misused prescription medications; and if an adult touched them sexually. Binge drinking was significantly associated with having lived with someone who was a problem drinker or alcoholic. Originality: Significant associations between methamphetamine use and opiate use and specific adverse childhood experiences suggest important entry points for improving jail and community programming. Social Implications: Our findings point to a need for research to understand differences between methamphetamine use and opiate use in relation to particular adverse experiences during childhood, and a need for tailored intervention for people incarcerated in jail.","Eaves, Emery R; Camplain, Ricky L; Lininger, Monica R; Trotter, Robert T","https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ijph-06-2020-0038","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Int J Prison Health;17(2): 142-155, 2021.; Publication details: Int J Prison Health;17(2): 142-155, 2021.; Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22497,""
"The Relationship between Community Participation and Physical Activity among Individuals with Serious Mental Illnesses","Introduction: The importance of physical activity (PA) and health outcomes for individuals with serious mental illnesses (SMI) has been well documented. It is also established that individuals with SMI engage in high amounts of sedentary behavior and low amounts of physical activity, which contributes to poor health outcomes. This study explores the relationship between community participation, physical activity, and sedentary behavior among individuals with SMI. Methods: This study used a sample of individuals with SMI who were receiving community mental health services in a large urban area of the United States. Of the 526 individuals approached, 308 were interested in the study; 173 consented and completed data collection. This study reports on 152 participants who had complete data. Using the Temple University Community Participation Scale, participants reported on community-based activities completed independently in the previous 30 days. Additionally, participants were asked to wear a tri-axial accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X) on the non-dominant wrist for seven days. The total number of community participation days was correlated with PA variables including steps, sedentary, light, and moderate-vigorous PA. Two groups of step data were analyzed using t-tests: &#8805;7500 steps, and &#8805; 10,000 steps. Logistic regressions were run to examine the relationship between amount, breadth and sufficiency of community participation and having +/- 7,500 steps and +/- 10,000 daily steps, controlling for age, gender, and income. Results: Amount of community participation was inversely associated with the % of time in sedentary activity and positively associated with the % of time in moderate to vigorous PA. Those with at or more than 7500 steps and 10,000 steps reported significantly more days of community participation. Conclusion: This study highlights the contribution of everyday activities for increased physical activity and reduced time spent in sedentary activity. Practitioners should consider recommendations for engagement in the community to increase opportunities for walking.","Snethen, Gretchen; Brusilovskiy, Eugene; McCormick, Bryan P; Hiremath, Shiv V; Salzer, Mark S","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mhpa.2021.100381","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Ment Health Phys Act;202021.; Publication details: Ment Health Phys Act;202021.; Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22498,""
"Physician Training Related to Environmental Hazards near Ash Superfund Sites","Physicians do not receive formal environmental health training in medical schools. The objectives of this study were to provide health care providers with basic environmental medicine training to better advise, treat or refer patients in the community and to observe any differences in the environmental medicine learning gains pre/post- test assessment. To rectify the problem of the lack of physicians' training related to environmental hazards, we conducted an environmental health workshop which targeted physicians living near Health Zone 1, Superfund ash sites. Fifty health care providers from both St. Vincent Family Medicine and Department of Health, Duval County Health Department (DOH-Duval) participated in a pre-test survey before the training and a post-test survey following the training. We used a non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test to compare pre- and post- knowledge of training participants. At the 10% level of significance, the number of incorrect answers significantly declined in the post-training survey compared to the pre-training survey for all participants from both facilities combined (p=0.083). Site-specific analysis show, while a significant difference was found for participants from the St. Vincent's site (p=0.084), the difference for participants from the DOH-Duval site was not significant (p = 0.102), although the number of incorrect answers declined. The training resulted in learning gains for the 50 participants and the evaluations were very positive with 100% of physicians recommending this training to other health care providers. Additionally, training participants gave a high mark for the environmental medicine pocket guide. In 2019, the ash sites are 90% remediated and cleanup is expected to be completed in 2022. There is still a need for additional training for physicians due to other active sites (i.e., Kerr-McGee) in the community. This study highlights the importance of providing environmental hazards training to physicians and the approach by which it could be delivered effectively.","Becker, Alan; Tawk, Rima; Kiros, Gebre; Suther, Sandra; Hilliard, Aaron; Gragg, Richard; Close, Fran; Harris, Cynthia M","https://dx.doi.org/10.21601/ejeph/11096","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Eur J Environ Public Health;5(2)2021.; Publication details: Eur J Environ Public Health;5(2)2021.; Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22499,""
"Assessment of Comorbid Depression and Anxiety in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Using Adaptive Testing Technology","Background: Depression and anxiety are comorbidities of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and it is now recommended to screen IBD patients for these conditions. We screened patients using a novel computerized adaptive testing technology and compared the screening results to measures of disease activity. Methods: Consecutive patients at our tertiary IBD clinic were asked to complete the validated CAT-MH&#8482; survey (Adaptive Testing Technologies, Chicago, IL); we then reviewed disease and patient characteristics. Clinical remission status was determined based on clinical, laboratory, endoscopy and imaging results. Statistical methods included Fisher's exact test and Pearson Chi-square tests to assess association. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed. Results: We included 134 patients, of which 34 (25.3%) screened positive for depression and 18 (13.4%) screened positive for anxiety. We identified 19 (55.9 %) and 10 (55.5%) patients who were previously undiagnosed for depression and anxiety, respectively. Patients in clinical remission were less likely to screen positive for depression (OR 0.19; 95%CI 0.07-0.50) and for anxiety (OR 0.30; 95%CI 0.10-0.91). Compared to patients with negative CRP values, patients with positive CRP were more likely to also screen positive for depression (p=0.025) and anxiety (p=0.15). Conclusions: We demonstrate the utility of a novel testing technology for screening patients with IBD for depression and anxiety. We found a large number of patients with previously undiagnosed anxiety or depression and a significant positive association between clinically active IBD and these mental health conditions. This work supports and informs recommendations for mental health screening in the IBD population.","Karpin, Jordan; Rodriguez, Tina G; Traboulsi, Cindy; Rai, Victoria; Gibbons, Robert D; Rubin, David T","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/crocol/otaa095","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Crohns Colitis 360;3(1)2021 Jan.; Publication details: Crohns Colitis 360;3(1)2021 Jan.; Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22500,""
"The acceptability of a therapist-assisted internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy program for the treatment of anxiety disorders in adolescents: a qualitative study","Computerized treatments have been shown to be effective in young people with anxiety disorders. However, there has been limited investigation into the experiences of adolescents in undertaking this treatment. This qualitative study explored adolescents' experiences of being treated for an anxiety disorder, using an online intervention with therapist support, as part of a randomised controlled trial. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirteen adolescents aged between 13 and 17Â years, who had received the online intervention. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Two cross-cutting themes were identified: (i) Usability of the program, and (ii) Putting techniques into practice. Although the convenience of online sessions was recognised as positive, many of the adolescents expressed a preference for face-to-face sessions. The length of sessions and the large amount of reading involved was highlighted by most participants. The transdiagnostic nature of the content meant some elements of the programme were seen as less relevant. While many participants appreciated the 'fun' aspect of the program, others felt that certain aspects of the program were not suitable for their age group. Exposure, psychoeducation and cognitive restructuring were generally received positively, whereas responses to the use of relaxation and rewards were much more mixed. Our findings highlight the potential utility for online treatments delivered with therapist support. However, they also highlight how issues with both the format and treatment components can impact the acceptability of a program. As such, further work is warranted to improve the acceptability of online treatments for adolescents with anxiety disorders.","Smart, Katy; Smith, Lydia; Harvey, Kate; Waite, Polly","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01903-6","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry;2021 Nov 08.; Publication details: Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry;2021 Nov 08.; Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22501,""
"Impact of Pregnancy-Related Venous Thromboembolism on Quality of Patients' Lives","Background: During pregnancy, the risk of venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) is increased at least five times compared with non-pregnant women of the same age, while the relative risk in the postpartum period can be as high as sixty times. The aim of the study was to explore the impact of pregnancy-related VTE on patients' mental, professional, social and personal life. Methods and Materials: Cross-sectional study at Jordan University Hospital's Obstetrics Department. Results: There were 112 women. Forty-six (41.1%) had a postpartum VTE. Twenty-eight of the patients (25%) had comorbidity. Eleven (9.9%) had a previous episode of VTE. Thirty-nine (35%) of the women reported three or more hospital visits over the past six months. Twenty-one (19.6%) of the women answered that their leg or chest pain has impeded their social activities. Anxiety/Depression was reported by 96.43% while Pain/Discomfort by 73.21%. A significant reduction of time spent on their work (correlation = 0.663, significant at <0.01) and accomplishing less work (correlation = 0.787, this was significant at <0.01) was found; 57.14% of patients indicated that VTE affecting their future pregnancies; 58.9% of patients were receiving anticoagulants with the most commonly used drug was aspirin. Twenty-four (36.4%) of the women were on multiple anticoagulant therapies. Twenty-five of the patients receiving medications do not monitor their medications and 20 patients said that monitoring the drug level was a bother to them. Conclusions: Pregnancy-related VTE had a significant adverse impact on physical, mental and professional life of women. It also had negative effects on future pregnancy plans.","Al-Husban, Naser; Alnsour, Leena N; El-Adwan, Zaid; Saleh, Nada A; El-Zibdeh, Mazen","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10760296211040873","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clin Appl Thromb Hemost;27: 10760296211040873, 2021.; Publication details: Clin Appl Thromb Hemost;27: 10760296211040873, 2021.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22502,""

"Home Rehabilitation System in Chronic Stroke: An Observational Study in Central Italy","Introduction: By 6 months following a stroke, approximately 65% of stroke survivors cannot incorporate into daily activities, resulting completely dependent. The aim of this study is to assess the overall outcome in psychological and physical well-being, increase in residual abilities, reintegration and social inclusion for people with chronic disabilities resulting from stroke, after home rehabilitation. Materials and Methods: We assessed the functional outcome of a group of 600 patients with disability related to several pathological conditions and undergoing home rehabilitation therapy (twice a week for 40 sessions per year) as granted by the Public Health. We evaluated the outcome with Barthel and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scales. Furthermore, in a group of 73 persons with chronic stroke we also carried out an overall evaluation, by using specific rating scales (FIM, Stroke Impact Scale, Motricity Index, Tinetti Balance Scale, 10-m Walking Test, 6-min Walking Test, 5 Repetitions Sit-to-Stand Test, and Hamilton Depression Scale) after 120 days (114 Â± 6) from the end of the home rehabilitation program. Results: The results highlighted a statistically significant improvement between T0 and T1 and a significant worsening between T1 and T2 (follow-up at 3 months). Hamilton Depression Scale is the only parameter that significantly improves both at the time T1 and T2. Conclusions: Territorial rehabilitation system should consider some fundamental aspects: centrality of the person and the individual health project; identification of specific and personalized rehabilitation plan and prognosis based on the results of a follow-up; ultra-specialization of interventions; multidisciplinary team; highlight of the emerging needs; and coordination of the different care pathways.","Saggini, Raoul; Veraldi, Roberto; Carmignano, Simona Maria; Palermo, Tommaso; Russo, Chiara; Barassi, Giovanni; Bellomo, Rosa Grazia","https://dx.doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.329548","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurol India;69(5): 1285-1292, 2021.; Publication details: Neurol India;69(5): 1285-1292, 2021.; Country: IN; ÃNDIA; INDIA; INDIA; Stroke Rehabilitation; Stroke; Activities of Daily Living; Humans; Italy; Survivors","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22504,""
"miR-182 mediated the inhibitory effects of NF-&#954;B on the GPR39/CREB/BDNF pathway in the hippocampus of mice with depressive-like behaviors","BACKGROUND: Chronic stress is one of the most important causes of depression, accompanied by neuroinflammation and hippocampal injuries. Long-term elevation of glucocorticoid leads to activation of NF-&#954;B and inhibition of GPR39/CREB/BDNF pathway, which is pivotal for neuroprotection and neurogenesis. The present study thus was designed to determine the relationship between NF-&#954;B and GPR39/CREB/BDNF pathway. METHODS: Depressive-like behaviors were induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and chronic restraint stress (CRS) in mice. Corticosterone, inflammatory cytokines, and GPR39/CREB/BDNF pathway were determined by ELISA and Western Blot assays. The activation of NF-&#954;B and inhibition of GPR39 were connected by bioinformatic analysis and experimentally validated in hippocampus cells by knock-in and knock-down techniques. RESULTS: CUMS and CRS led to an elevation of serum corticosterone and depressive-like behaviors in mice, with activation of NF-&#954;B subunit p65 in the hippocampus and elevations of TNF&#945; and IL-6. The expression of GPR39/CREB/BDNF pathway in the hippocampus was inhibited. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that four miRNAs, miR-96, miR-143, miR-150, and miR-182, were potentially transcribed by NF-&#954;B and bound with GPR39 mRNA. NF-&#954;B overexpression increased miR-182 expression and decreased GPR39 expression in hippocampus cells. Its inhibitor led to reverse effects. miR-182 mimics or inhibitors also regulated GPR39 expression in hippocampus cells and more importantly, blocked the regulation of NF-&#954;B on GPR39. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that activation of NF-&#954;B inhibited GPR39/CREB/BDNF pathway through increasing miR-182 in chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviors. The negative-regulation features of miRNAs might be important for neuroinflammation-induced inhibition of neurofunction in depression.","Tang, Yuxiao; Yang, Jianxin; Ye, Chuyang; Xu, Xin; Cai, Mengyu; Zhang, Yinyin; Lu, Hongtao; Mo, Fengfeng; Li, Hongxia; Shen, Hui","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2021.113647","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Behav Brain Res;418: 113647, 2021 Oct 30.; Publication details: Behav Brain Res;418: 113647, 2021 Oct 30.; Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22505,""
"Effect of forced treadmill exercise on stimulation of BDNF expression, depression symptoms, tactile memory and working memory in LPS-treated rats","Neuroinflammation has been implicated in cognitive dysfunction and the occurrence of depression in neurodegenerative diseases. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is believed to be involved with the benefits of exercise training in boosting memory and learning processes and antidepressant therapies. This study aimed to investigate the effect of forced treadmill exercise on hippocampal BDNF expression levels, depression symptoms, tactile memory and working memory in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated rats. For this purpose, 40 male Wistar rats received 0.25Â mg/kg of LPS or saline intraperitoneally for 9 consecutive days before exercise. They again received a single injection of 0.5Â mg/kg of LPS or saline on days 20 and 41 after exercise. Exercise groups had to run on a motorized treadmill 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Following the last exercise training session, forced swim test (FST), Y maze and novel object recognition (NOR) task were performed. Finally, the hippocampus of rats was removed and used for determination of BDNF expression levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR). The data showed that LPS decreased BDNF expression levels, Y maze score, and recognition index in NOR and increased immobility time in FST (pÂ <Â 0.05). In contrast, forced treadmill exercise increased BDNF expression levels and improved the percentage of spontaneous alternation, recognition index, and immobility time in LPS-treated rats (pÂ <Â 0.05). There was a significant correlation between BDNF expression levels with immobility time and recognition index (pÂ <Â 0.05) but not with the percentage of spontaneous alternation (pÂ >Â 0.05). The findings suggest that forced treadmill exercise may protect the brain of LPS-treated rats by improving the symptoms of depression and cognitive function through its effect on BDNF expression levels.","Sohroforouzani, Azam Moosavi; Shakerian, Saeed; Ghanbarzadeh, Mohsen; Alaei, Hojjatallah","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2021.113645","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Behav Brain Res;418: 113645, 2021 Oct 30.; Publication details: Behav Brain Res;418: 113645, 2021 Oct 30.; Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22506,""
"Sex differences in long-term behavioral alterations, especially anxiety, following prenatal fluoxetine exposure in C57BL/6 mice","Evidence demonstrates that psychiatric disorders during pregnancy are detrimental to the offspring. Many disorders are treated with SSRIs and increasing numbers of pregnant women now receive these drugs during gestation. The long-term neurobehavioral consequences of prenatal SSRI exposure require further evaluation. This study examined the effects of prenatal fluoxetine exposure in mice in an extensive battery of behaviors related to neurodevelopment, mood, social, and repetitive behaviors. C57BL/6J dams were administered fluoxetine at a low (0.6Â mg/kg/day) or high (6Â mg/kg/day) dose or saline from embryonic days 8 to 18. Juvenile mice were tested for changes in ultrasonic vocalizations and neuromotor development. In adulthood, offspring were tested for changes in behaviors related to anxiety, depression, social, and repetitive behaviors. Prenatal exposure to fluoxetine impaired surface righting reflex at P5, and sex-dependently reduced the frequency of ultrasonic vocalizations in juvenile males but not females. In adulthood, both males and females prenatally exposed to high, but not low, doses of fluoxetine exhibited an increase in repetitive behaviors in the marble burying task and a decrease in sucrose preference. Males, but not females, exposed to fluoxetine exhibited increased anxiety-related behaviors in the elevated plus maze. Prenatal fluoxetine exposure did not affect other adult behaviors including social preference, self-grooming, passive avoidance and open field activity. These findings suggest males are more sensitive than females to disruptions in serotonin balance during prenatal development and highlight the need for additional systematic and mechanistic studies to evaluate the impact of fluoxetine exposure during other periods of gestation.","Leussis, Melanie P; Thanos, Jessica M; Powers, Alex; Peterson, Emalee; Head, Joshua P; McGovern, Nathan J; Malarkey, Francis J; Drake, Anna","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbb.2021.173293","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pharmacol Biochem Behav;211: 173293, 2021 Oct 29.; Publication details: Pharmacol Biochem Behav;211: 173293, 2021 Oct 29.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22507,""
"Proteomics analysis of the gut-brain axis in a gut microbiota-dysbiosis model of depression","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious mental illness. Increasing evidence from both animal and human studies suggested that the gut microbiota might be involved in the onset of depression via the gut-brain axis. However, the mechanism in depression remains unclear. To explore the protein changes of the gut-brain axis modulated by gut microbiota, germ-free mice were transplanted with gut microbiota from MDD patients to induce depression-like behaviors. Behavioral tests were performed following fecal microbiota transplantation. A quantitative proteomics approach was used to examine changes in protein expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), liver, cecum, and serum. Then differential protein analysis and weighted gene coexpression network analysis were used to identify microbiota-related protein modules. Our results suggested that gut microbiota induced the alteration of protein expression levels in multiple tissues of the gut-brain axis in mice with depression-like phenotype, and these changes of the PFC and liver were model specific compared to chronic stress models. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that the protein changes of the gut-brain axis were involved in a variety of biological functions, including metabolic process and inflammatory response, in which energy metabolism is the core change of the protein network. Our data provide clues for future studies in the gut-brain axis on protein level and deepen the understanding of how gut microbiota cause depression-like behaviors.","Liu, Yiyun; Wang, Haiyang; Gui, Siwen; Zeng, Benhua; Pu, Juncai; Zheng, Peng; Zeng, Li; Luo, Yuanyuan; Wu, You; Zhou, Chanjuan; Song, Jinlin; Ji, Ping; Wei, Hong; Xie, Peng","https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01689-w","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Transl Psychiatry;11(1): 568, 2021 Nov 08.; Publication details: Transl Psychiatry;11(1): 568, 2021 Nov 08.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22508,""
"Temperature impact on the influence of penguin-derived nutrients and mosses on non-native grass in a simulated polar ecosystem","Human activity and climate change are increasing the spread of species across the planet, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Invasion engineers, such as birds, facilitate plant growth through manuring of soil, while native vegetation influences plant germination by creating suitable microhabitats which are especially valuable in cold and dry polar regions. Here we tested how penguin-derived nitrogen, several common Antarctic moss species and warming affect seed germination and growth of the non-native grass Agrostis capillaris under laboratory conditions. Experimental settings included a simulation of contemporary season-specific Antarctic light and temperature (2Â°C) conditions and a +5Â°C warming scenario. Mosses (Andreaea depressinervis, A. regularis, Sanionia uncinata and Chorisodontium aciphyllum) incorporated a range of nitrogen content and isotopic nitrogen signatures (ÃŽÂ´15 N) due to variation in sampling proximity to penguin colonies. Moss species greatly affected time to germination with consequences for further growth under the simulated Antarctic conditions. Grass seeds germinated 10Â days earlier among A. regularis compared to S. uncinata and C. aciphyllum and 26Â days earlier compared to A. depressinervis. Moss-specific effects are likely related to microclimatic differences within the moss canopy. Warming reduced this moss influence. Grass emerged on average 20Â days earlier under warming, leading to increased leaf count (88%), plant height (112%) and biomass (145%). Positive correlations were identified between moss and grass nitrogen content (rÂ =Â 0.377), grass biomass (rÂ =Â 0.332) and height (rÂ =Â 0.742) with stronger effects under the warming scenario. Transfer of nitrogen from moss to grass was confirmed by ÃŽÂ´15 N (rÂ =Â 0.803). Overall, the results suggest a shift from temperature-limited to N-limited growth of invasive plants under increased warming in the maritime Antarctic.","Bokhorst, Stef; Convey, Peter; van Logtestijn, Richard; Aerts, Rien","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15979","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Glob Chang Biol;2021 Nov 08.; Publication details: Glob Chang Biol;2021 Nov 08.; Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22509,""
"Maternal plasma serotonin level not suitable as postpartum depression diagnostic biomarker: Results from a prospective cohort study","BACKGROUND: Whether plasma serotonin (5-HT) levels could be a biomarker for postpartum depression (PPD) diagnosis is under dispute. METHODS: A total of 979 of pregnant women without antenatal depression at the time of delivery (TD) were enrolled and followed up at six weeks postpartum (SWP) in Changsha, China. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for plasma 5-HT level at TD, at SWP, changes in 5-HT, and risk of PPD and deterioration in EPDS scores at SWP were estimated by Logistic regressions. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) functions were also used to assess the dose-response relationships. RESULTS: The 6-week cumulative incidence of PPD was 12.05% (95%CI:10.08%, 14.26%). The average level of plasma 5-HT changed from 223.65Â Â±Â 131.47Â ng/ml at TD to 216.43Â Â±Â 122.73Â ng/ml at SWP, with an average change of -7.22Â Â±Â 96.54Â ng/ml. Plasma 5-HT at TD was negatively correlated with EPDS score at TD and SWP (pÂ <Â 0.05), as was the correlation between 5-HT at SWP and EPDS scores at SWP (pÂ =Â 0.038). However, the changes in 5-HT were not associated with the EPDS score at SWP (pÂ =Â 0.346). Neither plasma 5-HT level at TD nor changes in 5-HT was associated with PPD at SWP or deterioration in EPDS scores (pÂ <Â 0.05). Plasma 5-HT at delivery had insignificant discriminatory power for diagnosing PPD and prediction of deterioration in EPDS scores (pÂ &#8805;Â 0.05). CONCLUSION: Plasma 5-HT level at delivery was associated with EPDS score at delivery and SWP, but not with PPD at SWP suggesting that plasma 5-HT is not suitable as PPD diagnostic biomarker.","Huang, Xin; Yin, Hang; Wan, Xin-Xing; Fu, Bing; Tang, Bei; Lei, Jun","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.11.001","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: J Affect Disord;298(Pt A): 284-291, 2021 Nov 05.; Publication details: J Affect Disord;298(Pt A): 284-291, 2021 Nov 05.; Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22510,""

"Association of Stressful Life Events with Dementia in North Indian Populations","Background: Chronic stress is known to be associated with dementia. Aim: This study looked for major stressors and their associations with dementia in the elderly demented population. Methods: Case group consisted of 60 subjects (age group 55-75 years; M:F = 7:3) with postscreening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's type dementia. Control group consisted of two subgroups: related (N = 60) and not-related (N = 60) subjects screened and confirmed not to be suffering from cognitive impairment. Sociodemographic variables were collected using a personal data sheet. The severity of cognitive impairment was assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale. Subjects with a CDR score of range 0.5-1 were included in mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's type dementia. Stressful life events were evaluated using the Presumptive Stressful Life Event Scale (PSLES). A present stress level of caregivers was evaluated using Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). Assessed stress level scores were compared and validated with serum and plasma levels of cortisol and ACTH respectively. Results: Different groups exhibited distinct PSLES and DASS scores with statistical significance. It was also observed that Cortisol and ACTH levels were elevated in case group as compared with that of both sub-group controls. Conclusions: The outcome measures of this study projected that neural degeneration leading to mild cognitive impairment and dementia may be due to accumulative cortisol hormone associated with stressful life events.","Manoj, Shalini; Nehra, Ashima; Dalal, Krishna; Sagar, Rajesh; Tripathi, Manjari","https://dx.doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.329601","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurol India;69(5): 1326-1330, 2021.; Publication details: Neurol India;69(5): 1326-1330, 2021.; Country: IN; ÃNDIA; INDIA; INDIA; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dementia; Stress, Psychological; Aged; Alzheimer Disease/epidemiology; Caregivers; Cognitive Dysfunction/epidemiology; Dementia/epidemiology; Female; Humans; India/epidemiology; Male; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; Middle Aged; Stress, Psychological/epidemiology","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22512,""

"Tai Chi for anxiety and depression symptoms in cancer, stroke, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis","BACKGROUND: Many middle-aged and older adults have more than one chronic health condition. It is therefore important to explore the effectiveness of interventions for multiple chronic conditions. Tai Chi is widely used in China and other countries, and many studies have examined the effect of Tai Chi on anxiety and depression. However, there are no systematic reviews of the effect of Tai Chi on anxiety and depression in various chronic conditions. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of Tai Chi on anxiety and depression symptoms in four chronic conditions: cancer, stroke, heart failure (HF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: We searched Chinese and English databases (Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Wanfang Database, and Sinomed) from inception to October 2020. Review Manager version 5.2 and Stata version 12.0 were used to perform a systematic review. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The study was registered with the PROSPERO database (number CRD42020209594). RESULTS: Of the 596 studies identified, we included 25 randomized controlled trials involving 1819 participants. Combined analysis of the four diseases showed statistically significant differences between the Tai Chi and control groups for anxiety symptoms (SMD -0.99, 95%CI: -1.5, -0.47; PÂ <Â 0.01) and depressive symptoms (SMD 0.70, 95%CI: -1.01, -0.39; PÂ <Â 0.01). Subgroup analyses showed statistically significant differences between the Tai Chi and control groups for depressive symptoms in stroke (SMD -0.43, 95%CI: -0.67, -0.18; PÂ <Â 0.01) and HF (SMD -0.57, 95%CI: -0.8, -0.33; PÂ <Â 0.01). However, no statistically significant differences were found for depressive symptoms in COPD or cancer. There were statistically significant differences between the Tai Chi and control groups for anxiety symptoms in stroke (SMD -0.60, 95%CI: -0.88, -0.32; PÂ <Â 0.01) and cancer (SMD -0.69, 95%CI: -1.22, -0.17; PÂ <Â 0.01), but not in COPD or HF. Subgroup, sensitivity, meta regression, and publication bias analyses showed high heterogeneity correlated with a single study and study quality. Sensitivity analysis showed that most meta-analysis results had good stability, but those for anxiety symptoms in COPD were unstable; therefore, careful interpretation is required. CONCLUSION: Tai Chi has a positive effect on anxiety and depression, especially for patients with cancer, stroke, and HF. However, given the weak evidence, this approach is not a substitute for psychiatric treatment.","Cai, Qian; Cai, Shu-Bin; Chen, Jian-Kun; Bai, Xiao-Hui; Jing, Chun-Xiang; Zhang, Xi; Li, Ji-Qiang","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2021.101510","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Complement Ther Clin Pract;46: 101510, 2021 Nov 02.; Publication details: Complement Ther Clin Pract;46: 101510, 2021 Nov 02.; Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22514,""
"Trends in fatal and nonfatal overdose by race among people who inject drugs in Baltimore, Maryland from 1998 to 2019","OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine trends in fatal and nonfatal overdose in a community-based sample of current and former people who inject drugs (PWID). METHODS: Data from 4826 current and former PWID from the AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE) observational cohort study in Baltimore, Maryland, were used to characterize fatal and nonfatal overdose rates from 1998 to 2019. Poisson regression was used to examine factors associated with nonfatal overdose and differences by race among 1052 PWID between 2014 and 2019. RESULTS: Fatal overdose rates reached a high of 13 per 1000 person-years in 2018. Among 1052 current and former PWID, of whom 75% were Black and one-third were female, the nonfatal overdose rate of 529 per 1000 person-years in 2019 was 8 times higher than 2014 (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=7.76, 95% CI: 3.35, 18.0). The annual adjusted increase in nonfatal overdose rate was 53% among Black PWID (IRR=1.53, 95% CI: 1.34, 1.75), compared to 14% among White PWID (IRR=1.14, 95% CI: 0.88, 1.46). Urban residence, opioid use, depressive symptoms, and hepatitis C infection were positively associated with nonfatal overdose among Black PWID. Recent injection drug use and tranquilizer use was associated with increased overdose among Black and White PWID. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of fatal and nonfatal overdose were high and increased from 2014 to 2019 among current and former PWID, with the most dramatic increases in nonfatal overdose observed among Black PWID. These findings highlight the urgent need for additional resources to reduce the differential harms associated with opioids by race.","Genberg, Becky L; Gicquelais, Rachel E; Astemborski, Jacquie; Knight, Jennifer; Buresh, Megan; Sun, Jing; German, Danielle; Thomas, David L; Kirk, Gregory D; Mehta, Shruti H","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109152","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Drug Alcohol Depend;229(Pt B): 109152, 2021 Oct 30.; Publication details: Drug Alcohol Depend;229(Pt B): 109152, 2021 Oct 30.; Country: IE; IRLANDA; IRELAND; IRLANDA","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22515,""
"Fracture behaviour of human skin in deep needle insertion can be captured using validated cohesive zone finite-element method","Medical needles have shown an appreciable contribution to the development of novel medical devices and surgical technologies. A better understanding of needle-skin interactions can advance the design of medical needles, modern surgical robots, and haptic devices. This study employed finite element (FE) modelling to explore the effect of different mechanical and geometrical parameters on the needle's force-displacement relationship, the required force for the skin puncture, and generated mechanical stress around the cutting zone. To this end, we established a cohesive FE model, and identified its parameters by a three-stage parameter identification algorithm to closely replicate the experimental data of needle insertion into the human skin available in the literature. We showed that a bilinear cohesive model with initial stiffness of 5000Â MPa/mm, failure traction of 2Â MPa, and separation length of 1.6Â mm can lead to a model that can closely replicate experimental results. The FE results indicated that while the coefficient of friction between the needle and skin substantially changes the needle reaction force, the insertion velocity does not have a noticeable effect on the reaction force. Regarding the geometrical parameters, needle cutting angle is the prominent factor in terms of stress fields generated in the skin tissue. However, the needle diameter is more influential on the needle reaction force. We also presented an energy study on the frictional dissipation, damage dissipation, and strain energy throughout the insertion process.","Mohammadi, Hossein; Ebrahimian, Arash; Maftoon, Nima","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104982","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Comput Biol Med;139: 104982, 2021 Oct 29.; Publication details: Comput Biol Med;139: 104982, 2021 Oct 29.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22516,""
"Fear of childbirth: Validation study of the Chinese version of Wijma delivery expectancy/experience questionnaire version A","INTRODUCTION: Fear of childbirth causes significant distress and impact on women's wellbeing. It contributed to the rising trend of non-medically indicated Caesarean births worldwide. The objective of this study was to translate and validate the Chinese version of the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (Version A) (W-DEQ-A), which is a comprehensive instrument for the assessment of fear of childbirth among antenatal women. METHODS: The translated questionnaire was finalised after back-translation and review by an expert panel. Hong Kong Chinese women at an antenatal clinic completed the translated questionnaire, Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), and State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The reliability of the translated questionnaire was analysed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient. Convergent validity was measured by Pearson's correlation between the W-DEQ-A and STAI or EPDS scores. The subscales of the questionnaire were determined using exploratory factor analysis. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty women completed the study. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient and test-retest reliability of the Chinese version were 0.907 and 0.867, respectively. Convergent validity was demonstrated by the moderate correlation between the translated W-DEQ-A and STAI or EPDS. Exploratory factor analysis of the W-DEQ-A revealed a multi-dimensional structure with four factors: sense of isolation, moment of birth, negative emotion, and lack of positive self-evaluation. Using a standard cut-off of 85, 11.3% of women were found to suffer from fear of childbirth. CONCLUSION: The Chinese version of the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (Version A) is a reliable and valid instrument to measure antenatal fear of childbirth among Chinese women.","Lai, Theodora Hei Tung; Kwok, Shuk Tak; Wang, Weilan; Seto, Mimi Tin Yan; Cheung, Ka Wang","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2021.103188","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Midwifery;104: 103188, 2021 Oct 28.; Publication details: Midwifery;104: 103188, 2021 Oct 28.; Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22517,""
"Inadvertent life-threatening total spinal anesthesia following caudal block in a preschool child underwent urologic surgery: A rare case report","INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Caudal block is considered to be safe and provide optimal analgesia for pediatric patients undergoing sub-umbilical operations. It overcomes opioid-related side effects, particularly the dangers associated with respiratory depression in small children. CASE PRESENTATION: A 5-year-old male underwent uneventful hypospadias surgery under general endotracheal anesthesia. Caudal block planned to be administered postoperatively for postoperative analgesia then performed after palpation of sacral cornu with 8Â ml of 0.25% bupivacaine. A few minutes later, the patient became apneic, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation dropped abruptly-immediate resuscitation with ventilatory support, fluid bolus, and atropine administration. After a minute patients' vital signs returned to the normal range then 2Â h later patient started to breathe spontaneously and consciousness is regained. After close follow-up for 24Â h in the post-anesthesia care unit patient was discharged to the pediatric ward then discharged to home without any neurologic sequelae after 3Â days. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Total spinal anesthesia in a very infrequent incident during central neuraxial blocks, especially in the pediatrics population where a caudal block is usually performed. Manifestation of this event can be detected by loss of consciousness, cessation of respiratory effort, hemodynamic instability, and dilated pupils. Delayed treatment can result in cardiopulmonary arrest. CONCLUSION: Unanticipated total spinal anesthesia following central neuraxial blocks can potentially cause severe adverse consequences. Preventive modalities must be employed to avoid this incident. Early recognition and instant management should be instituted to avoid dangerous complications following the total spinal blockade.","Sisay, Amanuel; Girma, Betelihem; Negusie, Teklu; Abdi, Sherif; Horsa, Bayisa; Ayele, Kinfe","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2021.106541","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Int J Surg Case Rep;88: 106541, 2021 Nov.; Publication details: Int J Surg Case Rep;88: 106541, 2021 Nov.; Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22518,""
"Clozapine induced pericarditis: A case report","Clozapine is a second-generation antipsychotic often used for treatment-refractory schizophrenia and has many adverse effects. Cardiac adverse events potentiated by clozapine include myocarditis which is a black box warning. Even more rarely, there are multiple cases of pericarditis reported in the literature. This is a case report of a 32-year old male with paranoid schizophrenia who developed pericarditis after initiation and titration of clozapine in the inpatient psychiatry unit. Patient presented with chest pain, persistent tachycardia, and orthostatic hypotension two weeks after titration of clozapine. The diagnosis of pericarditis was supported by the repeat electrocardiogram which revealed PR depressions, the audible friction rub, and the pleuritic/episodic nature of the chest pain. All other possible causes of pericarditis were ruled out and clozapine was suspected as the most likely explanation. The pericarditis resolved with treatment of colchine and ibuprofen on evidence from a repeat echocardiogram. This case report demonstrates and supports few cases of clozapine induced pericarditis in the literature. Cardiac events of clozapine can be life-threatening; therefore, greater baseline and subsequent cardiac monitoring may be implicated in the future.","Sahyouni, Christine; Hefazi, Elika","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114250","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Res;305: 114250, 2021 Nov.; Publication details: Psychiatry Res;305: 114250, 2021 Nov.; Country: IE; IRLANDA; IRELAND; IRLANDA","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22519,""
"Prefrontal cortex alterations in major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and their comorbidity during a verbal fluency task assessed by multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy","Major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are frequently comorbid with each other, and both associated with substantial cognitive impairments; however, it is still unclear whether their impairments are neurobiologically similar or distinct. This study aims to investigate the cognitive functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in patients with MDD and GAD during the verbal fluency task (VFT) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Fifty-two patients with MDD, fifty-one patients with GAD, fifty-two patients with the comorbidity of MDD and GAD (CMG), and forty-seven healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. Significant hypoactivation in the left ventrolateral and the left dorsolateral PFC was common in all patient groups when compared to HCs, suggesting a shared etiology. Furthermore,Â  MDD patients showed significant hypoactivation at the right frontal pole cortex (FPoC) when compared to HCs and significant hypoactivation at the middle FPoC when compared to the CMG patients. Our work is the first fNIRS study to reveal the shared and unique neurobiological profiles of MDD, GAD and their comorbidity under the same standard experimentation condition, suggesting fNIRS holds promise as an adjutant to assist clinical diagnosis.","Hu, Shuang; Li, Xiao-Jun; Law, Samuel; Shen, Chen-Yu; Yao, Guan-Qun; Zhang, Xiao-Qian; Li, Juan; Chen, Gui-Fang; Xu, Bo; Liu, Xiao-Min; Ma, Xiang-Yun; Feng, Kun; Liu, Po-Zi","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114229","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Res;306: 114229, 2021 Sep 28.; Publication details: Psychiatry Res;306: 114229, 2021 Sep 28.; Country: IE; IRLANDA; IRELAND; IRLANDA","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22520,""
"Identifying patients with major depressive disorder based on tryptophan hydroxylase-2 methylation using machine learning algorithms","OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) by developing different machine learning (ML) models based on tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) methylation and environmental stress. METHODS: The data were collected from 291 patients with MDD and 100 healthy control participants: individual basic information, the Negative Life Events Scale (NLES) scores, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) scores and the methylation level at 38 CpG sites in TPH2. Information gain was used to select critical input variables. Support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) algorithms were used to build recognition models, which were evaluated by the 10-fold cross-validation. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to evaluate features importance. RESULTS: Gender, NLES scores, CTQ scores and 13 CpG sites in TPH2 gene were considered as predictors in the models. Three ML algorithms showed satisfactory performance in predicting MDD and the BPNN model indicated best prediction effects. CONCLUSION: ML models with TPH2 methylation and environmental stress were identified to possess great performance in identifying patients with MDD, which provided precious experience for artificial intelligence to assist traditional diagnostic methods in the future.","Fan, Ru; Hua, Tiantian; Shen, Tian; Jiao, Zhigang; Yue, Qingqing; Chen, Bingwei; Xu, Zhi","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114258","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Res;306: 114258, 2021 Oct 31.; Publication details: Psychiatry Res;306: 114258, 2021 Oct 31.; Country: IE; IRLANDA; IRELAND; IRLANDA","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22521,""
"An App-Based Intervention for Adolescents Exposed to Cyberbullying in Norway: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND: Adolescents exposed to negative online events are at high risk to develop mental health problems. Little is known about what is effective for treatment in this group. NettOpp is a new mobile app for adolescents who have been exposed to cyberbullying or negative online experiences in Norway. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to provide a description of the content of the intervention and about a randomized controlled trial that will be conducted to examine the effectiveness of NettOpp. This protocol is written in accordance with the Spirit 2013 Checklist. METHODS: An effectiveness study with a follow-up examination after 3 months will be conducted to evaluate the mobile app. Adolescents will be recruited through schools and will be randomly assigned to the intervention (NettOpp) group and a waiting-list control group. The adolescents (aged 11 to 16 years) will respond to self-report questionnaires on the internet. Primary outcomes will be changes in mental health assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the WHO-Five Well-being Index, and the Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen. RESULTS: Recruitment will start in January 2022. The results from this study will be available in 2023. CONCLUSIONS: There are few published evaluation studies on app-based interventions.

"Suicide Risk and Protective Factors in Online Support Forum Posts: Annotation Scheme Development and Validation Study","BACKGROUND: Online communities provide support for individuals looking for help with suicidal ideation and crisis. As community data are increasingly used to devise machine learning models to infer who might be at risk, there have been limited efforts to identify both risk and protective factors in web-based posts. These annotations can enrich and augment computational assessment approaches to identify appropriate intervention points, which are useful to public health professionals and suicide prevention researchers. OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study aims to develop a valid and reliable annotation scheme for evaluating risk and protective factors for suicidal ideation in posts in suicide crisis forums. METHODS: We designed a valid, reliable, and clinically grounded process for identifying risk and protective markers in social media data. This scheme draws on prior work on construct validity and the social sciences of measurement. We then applied the scheme to annotate 200 posts from r/SuicideWatch-a Reddit community focused on suicide crisis. RESULTS: We documented our results on producing an annotation scheme that is consistent with leading public health information coding schemes for suicide and advances attention to protective factors. Our study showed high internal validity, and we have presented results that indicate that our approach is consistent with findings from prior work. CONCLUSIONS: Our work formalizes a framework that incorporates construct validity into the development of annotation schemes for suicide risk on social media. This study furthers the understanding of risk and protective factors expressed in social media data. This may help public health programming to prevent suicide and computational social science research and investigations that rely on the quality of labels for downstream machine learning tasks.","Chancellor, Stevie; Sumner, Steven A; David-Ferdon, Corinne; Ahmad, Tahirah; De Choudhury, Munmun","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24471","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(11): e24471, 2021 Nov 08.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(11): e24471, 2021 Nov 08.; Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22523,""
"Mobile Apps That Promote Emotion Regulation, Positive Mental Health, and Well-being in the General Population: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","BACKGROUND: Among the general public, there appears to be a growing need and interest in receiving digital mental health and well-being support. In response to this, mental health apps (MHapps) are becoming available for monitoring, managing, and promoting positive mental health and well-being. Thus far, evidence supports favorable outcomes when users engage with MHapps, yet there is a relative paucity of reviews on apps that support positive mental health and well-being. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to systematically review the available research on MHapps that promote emotion regulation, positive mental health, and well-being in the general population aged 18-45 years. More specifically, the review aimed at providing a systematic description of the theoretical background and features of MHapps while evaluating any potential effectiveness. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of key databases, including MEDLINE (via Ovid), EMBASE (via Ovid), PsycINFO (via Ovid), Web of Science, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), was performed until January 2021. Studies were included if they described standalone mental health and well-being apps for adults without a formal mental health diagnosis. The quality of all studies was assessed against the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. In addition, the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool (RoB-2) was used to assess randomized control trials (RCTs). Data were extracted using a modified extraction form from the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews. A narrative synthesis and meta-analysis were then undertaken to address the review aims. RESULTS: In total, 3156 abstracts were identified. Of these, 52 publications describing 48 MHapps met the inclusion criteria. Together, the studies evaluated interventions across 15 countries. Thirty-nine RCTs were identified suggesting some support for the role of individual MHapps in improving and promoting mental health and well-being. Regarding the pooled effect, MHapps, when compared to controls, showed a small effect for reducing mental health symptoms (k=19, Hedges g=-0.24, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.14; P<.001) and improving well-being (k=13, g=0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.29, P=.004), and a medium effect for emotion regulation (k=6, g=0.49, 95% CI 0.23-0.74, P<.001). There is also a wide knowledge base of creative and innovative ways to engage users in techniques such as mood monitoring and guided exercises. Studies were generally assessed to contribute unclear or a high risk of bias, or to be of medium to low methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS: The emerging evidence for MHapps that promote positive mental health and well-being suggests promising outcomes. Despite a wide range of MHapps, few apps specifically promote emotion regulation. However, our findings may position emotion regulation as an important mechanism for inclusion in future MHapps. A fair proportion of the included studies were pilot or feasibility trials (k=17, 33%), and full-scale RCTs reported high attrition rates and nondiverse samples. Given the number and pace at which MHapps are being released, further robust research is warranted to inform the development and testing of evidence-based programs.","Eisenstadt, Mia; Liverpool, Shaun; Infanti, Elisa; Ciuvat, Roberta Maria; Carlsson, Courtney","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/31170","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(11): e31170, 2021 Nov 08.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(11): e31170, 2021 Nov 08.; Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22524,""
"Risk Factors Associated With Nonfatal Opioid Overdose Leading to Intensive Care Unit Admission: A Cross-sectional Study","BACKGROUND: Opioid overdose (OD) and related deaths have significantly increased in the United States over the last 2 decades. Existing studies have mostly focused on demographic and clinical risk factors in noncritical care settings. Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) are infrequently coded in the electronic health record (EHR) and usually buried in unstructured EHR notes, reflecting possible gaps in clinical care and observational research. Therefore, SBDH often receive less attention despite being important risk factors for OD. Natural language processing (NLP) can alleviate this problem. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were two-fold: First, we examined the usefulness of NLP for SBDH extraction from unstructured EHR text, and second, for intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, we investigated risk factors including SBDH for nonfatal OD. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of admission data from the EHR of patients in the ICU of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. We used patient admission data and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnoses to extract demographics, nonfatal OD, SBDH, and other clinical variables. In addition to obtaining SBDH information from the ICD codes, an NLP model was developed to extract 6 SBDH variables from EHR notes, namely, housing insecurity, unemployment, social isolation, alcohol use, smoking, and illicit drug use. We adopted a sequential forward selection process to select relevant clinical variables. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations with nonfatal OD, and relative risks were quantified as covariate-adjusted odds ratios (aOR). RESULTS: The strongest association with nonfatal OD was found to be drug use disorder (aOR 8.17, 95% CI 5.44-12.27), followed by bipolar disorder (aOR 2.69, 95% CI 1.68-4.29). Among others, major depressive disorder (aOR 2.57, 95% CI 1.12-5.88), being on a Medicaid health insurance program (aOR 2.26, 95% CI 1.43-3.58), history of illicit drug use (aOR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15-3.79), and current use of illicit drugs (aOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.20-3.55) were strongly associated with increased risk of nonfatal OD. Conversely, Blacks (aOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28-0.94), older age groups (40-64 years: aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.96; >64 years: aOR 0.16, 95% CI 0.08-0.34) and those with tobacco use disorder (aOR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32-0.89) or alcohol use disorder (aOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-1.00) had decreased risk of nonfatal OD. Moreover, 99.82% of all SBDH information was identified by the NLP model, in contrast to only 0.18% identified by the ICD codes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to analyze the risk factors for nonfatal OD in an ICU setting using NLP-extracted SBDH from EHR notes. We found several risk factors associated with nonfatal OD including SBDH. SBDH are richly described in EHR notes, supporting the importance of integrating NLP-derived SBDH into OD risk assessment. More studies in ICU settings can help health care systems better understand and respond to the opioid epidemic.","Mitra, Avijit; Ahsan, Hiba; Li, Wenjun; Liu, Weisong; Kerns, Robert D; Tsai, Jack; Becker, William; Smelson, David A; Yu, Hong","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/32851","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Med Inform;9(11): e32851, 2021 Nov 08.; Publication details: JMIR Med Inform;9(11): e32851, 2021 Nov 08.; Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22525,""
"The use of pharmacogenetic testing in psychiatry","ABSTRACT: Psychiatric pharmacogenetic testing is commonly used by providers in primary care and mental health settings. The purpose of this article is to describe the extent to which psychiatric pharmacogenetic testing supports clinical practice. human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A and HLA-B should be tested before initiating carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine due to risk of serious skin reactions. For psychotropic medications metabolized through the liver, limited evidence suggests testing for variation in metabolism through CYP2D6 and CYP2D19. For specific medication and genotype-phenotype variations, guidance through the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) or the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics (ISPG) should be reviewed. Commercial tests interpret this information differently and should not be used for broad guidance. Clinicians should follow current guidelines from professional bodies such as CPIC or ISPG and test for HLA-A or HLA-B before initiating carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine. Evidence is limited for psychiatric pharmacogenetic testing. Clinicians should continue to follow best practice and clinical practice guidelines.","Kumar, Aparna; Kearney, Anne","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JXX.0000000000000666","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: J Am Assoc Nurse Pract;33(11): 849-851, 2021 Nov 10.; Publication details: J Am Assoc Nurse Pract;33(11): 849-851, 2021 Nov 10.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22526,""
"Biased memories contribute to the links between stress and depressive symptoms","Perceived stress undermines emotional wellbeing, and poorer emotional wellbeing may intensify perceived stress. The current studies examined whether biased memories contribute to the possible reciprocal links between perceived stress and depressive symptoms. Two longitudinal studies compared the stress people perceived for several weeks (Study 1, N = 308) or during a conflict interaction (Study 2, N = 261) with memories of perceived stress gathered in subsequent weeks. People with low depressive symptoms remembered their past as involving less perceived stress than they initially experienced (positive bias). By contrast, people with average or higher levels of depressive symptoms remembered their past as involving exactly as much perceived stress as initially experienced (depressive realism) or, at very high levels of depressive symptoms, more perceived stress than initially experienced (negative bias). These memory biases had important implications. Accounting for initial levels of perceived stress, more negative memories of perceived stress predicted greater weekly depressed mood (Study 1) and greater depressive symptoms across time (Study 2). Evaluating whether life has involved as much perceived stress as now remembered may help facilitate emotional wellbeing in the face of rising perceived stress and depressive symptoms.

"Management of sleep disorders in the menopausal transition","The menopausal transition is associated with increasing sleep disorders including sleep apnoea and restless leg syndrome. Insomnia is the most common and is recognised as a core symptom of the menopause. Guidelines to support decision making for women with sleep problems during the menopausal transition are lacking. Sleep problems are associated with negative impacts on healthcare utilisation, quality of life and work productivity. Sleep deprivation is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and neurobehavioral dysfunction. Declining oestrogen is implicated as a cause of menopausal sleep disruption. Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and menopausal mood disturbance are also factors in the complex aetiology. VMS commonly precipitate insomnia and, due to their prolonged duration, they often perpetuate the condition. Insomnia in the general population is most effectively treated with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (also effective in the menopausal transition.) The associations of menopausal sleep disturbance with VMS and depression mean that other treatment options must be considered. Existing guidelines outline effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), CBT and antidepressants. HRT may indirectly help with sleep disturbance by treating VMS and also via beneficial effect on mood symptoms. The evidence base underpinning menopausal insomnia often references risks associated with HRT that are not in line with current international menopause guidelines. This may influence clinicians managing sleep disorders, leading to hesitation in offering HRT, despite evidence of effectiveness. Viewing sleep symptoms on an axis of menopausal symptoms - towards vasomotor symptoms or towards mood symptoms may help tailor treatment options towards the symptom profile.","Schaedel, Zoe; Holloway, Debra; Bruce, Deborah; Rymer, Janice","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/20533691211039151","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Post Reprod Health;: 20533691211039151, 2021 Nov 08.; Publication details: Post Reprod Health;: 20533691211039151, 2021 Nov 08.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22528,""

"Relationship of tissue dimensions and three captive bolt placements on cadaver heads from mature swine (Sus scrofa domesticus) > 200Â kg body weight","Three penetrating captive bolt (PCB) placements were tested on cadaver heads from swine with estimated body weight (BW) >200Â kg (sows = 232.9 Â± 4.1Â kg; boars = 229.3 Â± 2.6Â kg). The objectives were to determine tissue depth, cross-sectional brain area, visible brain damage (BD), regions of BD, and bolt-brain contact; and determine relationships between external head dimensions and tissue depth at each placement. A Jarvis PAS - Type P 0.25R PCB with a Long Stunning Rod Nosepiece Assembly and 3.5 gr power loads was used at the following placements on heads from 111 sows and 46 boars after storage at 2-4Â° C for approximately 62Â h before treatment: FRONTAL (F) - 3.5Â cm superior to the optic orbits at midline, TEMPORAL (T) - at the depression posterior to the lateral canthus of the eye within the plane between the lateral canthus and the base of the ear, or BEHIND EAR (BE) - directly caudal to the pinna of the ear on the same plane as the eyes and targeting the middle of the opposite eye. For sows, the bolt path was in the plane of the brain for 42/42 (100%, 95% CI: 91.6-100.0%) F heads, 39/40 (97.5%, 95% CI: 86.8-99.9%) T heads, and 34/39 (87.5%, 95% CI: 72.6-95.7%) BE heads; for the heads that could reliably be assessed for BD damage was detected in 25/26 (96.2%, 95% CI: 80.4-99.9%) F heads, 24/35 (68.6%, 95% CI: 50.7-83.2%) T heads, and 5/40 (12.5%, 95% CI: 4.2-26.8%) BE heads. For boars, the bolt path was in the plane of the brain for 17/17 (100.0%, 95% CI: 80.5-100.0%) F heads, 18/18 (100.0%, 95% CI: 81.5-100.0%) T heads, and 14/14 (100.0%, 95% CI: 76.8-100.0%) BE heads; damage was detected in 11/12 (91.7%, 95% CI: 61.5-99.8%) F heads, 2/15 (13.3%, 95% CI: 1.7-40.5%) T heads, and 7/14 (50.0%, 95% CI: 23.0-77.0%) BE heads. Tissue depth was reported as mean Â± standard error followed by 95% one-sided upper reference limit (URL). For sows, total tissue thickness was different (P < 0.05) between placements (F: 52.7 Â± 1.0Â mm, URL: 64.1Â mm; T: 69.8 Â± 1.4Â mm, URL: 83.9Â mm; BE: 89.3 Â± 1.5Â mm, URL: 103.4Â mm).

For swine > 200Â kg BW, F placement may be more effective than T or BE due to less soft tissue thickness, which may reduce concussive force.

"Antagonistic postsynaptic and presynaptic actions of cyclohexanol on neuromuscular synaptic transmission and function","KEY POINTS: Intentional ingestion of agricultural organophosphorus insecticides is a significant public health issue in rural Asia, causing thousands of deaths annually. Survivors may develop a severe myasthenic syndrome or paralysis, associated with increased plasma levels of cyclohexanol, an insecticide solvent metabolite. Analysis of synaptic transmission at neuromuscular junctions in isolated mouse skeletal muscle, using isometric tension recording and microelectrode recording of endplate voltages and currents, showed that cyclohexanol reduced postsynaptic sensitivity to acetylcholine neurotransmitter (reduced quantal size) while simultaneously enhancing evoked transmitter release (increased quantal content). Patch recording from transfected cell lines, together with molecular modelling, indicated that cyclohexanol causes selective, allosteric antagonism of postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and block of presynaptic K+ -channel function. The data provide insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of neuromuscular weakness following intentional ingestion of agricultural organophosphorus insecticides. Our findings also extend understanding of the effects of alcohols on synaptic transmission and homeostatic synaptic function. ABSTRACT: Intentional ingestion of agricultural organophosphorus insecticides is a significant public health issue in rural Asia, causing thousands of deaths annually. Some survivors develop a severe, acute or delayed myasthenic syndrome. In animal models, similar myasthenia has been associated with increasing plasma concentration of one insecticide solvent metabolite, cyclohexanol. We investigated possible mechanisms using voltage and current recordings from mouse neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and transfected human cell lines. Cyclohexanol (10-25 mM) reduced EPP amplitudes by 10-40% and enhanced depression during repetitive (2-20 Hz) stimulation by up to 60%. EPP decay was prolonged more than two fold. MEPPs were attenuated by more than 50%. Cyclohexanol inhibited whole-cell currents recorded from CN21 cells expressing human postjunctional acetylcholine receptors (hnAChR) with an IC50 of 3.74 mM. Cyclohexanol (10-20 mM) also caused prolonged episodes of reduced-current, multi-channel bursting in outside-out patch recordings from hnAChR expressed in transfected HEK293T cells, reducing charge transfer by more than 50%. Molecular modelling indicated cyclohexanol binding (-6kcal.mol-1 ) to a previously-identified alcohol binding site on nicotinic AChR &#945;-subunits. Cyclohexanol also increased quantal content of evoked transmitter release by Ã¢<U+0088>Â¼50%. In perineurial recordings, cyclohexanol selectively inhibited pre-synaptic K+ -currents. Modelling indicated cyclohexanol binding (-3.8 kcal.mole-1 ) to voltage-sensitive K+ -channels at the same site as tetraethylammonium (TEA). TEA (10 mM) blocked K+ -channels more effectively than cyclohexanol but EPPs were more prolonged in 20 mM cyclohexanol. The results explain the pattern of neuromuscular dysfunction following ingestion of organophosphorus insecticides containing cyclohexanol precursors and suggest that cyclohexanol may facilitate investigation of mechanisms regulating synaptic strength at NMJs. Graphical Abstract: Cyclohexanol, the principal metabolite of a common agricultural insecticide solvent cyclohexanone, acts both presynaptically and postsynaptically to impair neuromuscular transmission. [1] Cyclohexanol binds to sites in the pore of voltage-sensitive K-channels that also bind the K+ -channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA), with the effect of reducing presynaptic motor nerve terminal K+ -currents and increasing quantal content of evoked transmitter release. [2] Simultaneously, cyclohexanol binds allosterically to an alcohol binding site on postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, altering ligand-gating characteristics and reducing charge transfer. The combined, overall effects of [1] and [2] result in reduced amplitude, prolonged depolarization and enhanced synaptic depression of endplate potentials (EPPs), weakening tetanic tension responses and causing fade in twitch responses to low frequency nerve stimulation. These effects mimic myasthenia or paralysis that occur in self-harming individuals who have swallowed significant quantities of organophosphorus insecticide, a significant public health issue in rural Asia. The present findings therefore provide an explanation for these clinical signs; and indicate potential utility of cyclohexanol in further study of mechanisms of neuromuscular synaptic homeostasis.

"Rural suicide risk and physical ill health: A qualitative study of the Victorian Suicide Register, 2009-2015","OBJECTIVE: To gain new insight into contextual factors shaping how physical ill health acts as a stressor in rural suicides-informing the development of appropriate targeted interventions. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Non-metropolitan Victoria, Australia. SAMPLE: 802 rural (non-metropolitan) suicide deaths between the years 2009 and 2015. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Qualitative data from the Victorian Suicide Register relating to physical ill health of suicide decedents. RESULTS: Thematic analysis identified 4 themes: (a) 'living with physical ill health in a rural area' highlights both practical and cultural challenges associated with managing physical ill health within the context of life in a rural setting; (b) 'causes and experience of chronic pain' highlights rural risk factors for chronic pain, how pain was experienced and treatment managed; (c) 'when living an independent, contributing life is no longer possible' describes the debilitating physical and mental outcomes of chronic ill health and pain; and (d) 'the cumulative impact of physical ill health and other factors on suicide risk' highlights the complexity of risk factors-in combination with (or as a result of) physical ill health-that contribute to a suicide death. CONCLUSION: Identified themes suggest pathways to improve understanding and support for those experiencing physical ill health and associated suicide risk. These supports include contextually and culturally appropriate rural services to provide effective and necessary treatment, pain relief and mental health support; acknowledgement and response to a culture of alcohol misuse as an (ultimately ineffective) coping strategy; proactive psychosocial support mechanisms; and alternative approaches to support including consideration of innovative peer support models.","Kennedy, Alison J; Adams, Jessie; Dwyer, Jeremy; Brumby, Susan","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajr.12801","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Aust J Rural Health;2021 Nov 08.; Publication details: Aust J Rural Health;2021 Nov 08.; Country: AU; AUSTRÃLIA; AUSTRALIA; AUSTRALIA","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22532,""
"Why is formulation daunting? A response to Bagster et al's 'instructions' for developing skills in formulation","OBJECTIVE: To explore the theme identified by Bagster et al.1 in their selective psychiatric literature review that formulation can appear daunting. CONCLUSION: Formulation is understandably daunting, even though it occurs in all human encounters. The plural nature of mental symptoms is such that anxiety-provoking intuitive judgement is required at all points in both the process and explication of formulation, a type of instinctive guessing. There are no rules for this, because the laws of vertical integration of systems are not established. Guidelines are more appropriate than 'instructions'. Much of the wider mental health and clinical reasoning literature addresses intuitive judgement, but the current psychiatric literature tends to focus on pattern recognition as a deliberative cognitive act of Type 2 processes. Arguably this reductionism adds to the dauntingness. Anxiety detected about the intuitive judgement involved can be addressed in supervision, taking into account the psychological mindedness of the trainee.","Smith, Graeme C","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10398562211054038","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Australas Psychiatry;: 10398562211054038, 2021 Nov 08.; Publication details: Australas Psychiatry;: 10398562211054038, 2021 Nov 08.; Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22533,""
"How to resist soil desiccation: Transcriptional changes in a Mediterranean earthworm during aestivation","Earthworms have a central role in ministering the terrestrial ecosystems and are proving to have an important role in modulating the effects climate change has on soil. Aestivation is a form of dormancy employed by the organisms living in deserts and arid environments, when confronted with prolonged periods of drought. Understanding global metabolic adjustments required for withstanding the harsh conditions of the ever more severe Iberian drought, we performed a global transcriptomic exploration of the endogeic earthworm Carpetania matritensis during aestivation. There were a total of 6352 differentially expressed transcripts in the aestivating group, with 65% being downregulated. Based on GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, downregulated genes seem to be indicative of an overall metabolic depression during aestivation. Indeed we noted a reduction of protein turnover and macromolecule metabolism coupled with suppression of genes involved in digestion. Upregulated genes, namely antioxidant genes and DNA repair genes showed clear signs of abiotic stress caused by ROS generation. Abiotic stress led to transcriptomic changes of genes involved in immune response, mostly affecting the NF-kb signaling pathway as well as changes in apoptotic genes indicating the necessity of investigating these processes in a tissue specific manner. Lastly we uncovered a possible mechanism for water retention by nitrogenous waste accumulation. This study provides the first ever transcriptomic investigation done on aestivating earthworms and as such serves as a general framework for investigation on other earthworm species and other soil invertebrates, which is becoming increasingly important with the current scenario of climate change.","Tilikj, Natasha; Novo, Marta","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2021.111112","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol;: 111112, 2021 Nov 05.; Publication details: Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol;: 111112, 2021 Nov 05.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22534,""
"Changes in Work Ability after Weight-Loss Surgery: Results of a Longitudinal Study of Persons with Morbid Obesity before and after Bariatric Surgery","INTRODUCTION: Bariatric surgery is a life-changing treatment, but knowledge of its influence on changes in work ability is still limited. We hypothesized that self-reported work ability improves in response to surgery-induced weight loss and sociodemographical variables (e.g., age, sex, and marital status), and that psychosocial characteristics (e.g., depressive symptoms and dysfunctional eating) may have predictive value as to patients' work ability. METHODS: A total of 200 participants scheduled for bariatric surgery were recruited between September 2015 and June 2018. They completed several self-report measures at the preoperative examination (t1) and at 6- (t2) and 12 months (t3) after bariatric surgery. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was calculated to detect any changes in the work ability and body mass index (BMI) among the 3 time points. Further, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to determine whether any demographical and psychosocial characteristics at (t1) would predict work ability at (t3). RESULTS: Participants (82% of whom were women) were middle-aged and showed a BMI of nearly 46 at the preoperative medical examination. Excess weight loss at (t2) and at (t3) was 49 and 66%, respectively. Work ability increased toward a moderate level after weight-loss surgery. Work ability and dysfunctional eating at (t1) showed significant predictive value with respect to work ability at (t3). DISCUSSION: The results suggest that weight-loss surgery has a positive impact on work ability, and indicate a predictive value for the extent of weight loss and dysfunctional eating behavior. Against our hypothesis and in contrast to former research, a predictive value for depressive symptoms and age was not revealed. Further research must show how interventions can support and maintain improvements in work ability after bariatric surgery, in order to reduce sick leave and unemployment in patients with preoperative morbid obesity.","KÃ¶hler, Hinrich; Markov, Valentin; Watschke, Anna; Gruner-Labitzke, Kerstin; BÃ¶ker, Clara; KrÃ¶ger, Christoph","https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000519269","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Obes Facts;: 1-10, 2021 Nov 08.; Publication details: Obes Facts;: 1-10, 2021 Nov 08.; Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22535,""

"Effect of intensive olfactory training for cognitive function in patients with dementia","AIM: Recent evidence has revealed an association between neurodegenerative disorders and olfactory dysfunction. However, whether olfactory training can improve cognitive impairment in patients with dementia requires further study. The present study aimed to resolve this by developing an intensive olfactory training (IOT) protocol and assessing its impact on each of the cognitive domains in patients with dementia. METHODS: Patients were prospectively recruited between June 2020 and September 2020. Baseline evaluations included demographic data, olfactory function test, depression scale and detailed cognitive function tests. Thirty-four patients in the experimental group underwent IOT twice a day with a 40-odor set for 15 days, while 31 individuals in the control group received conservative management. Follow-up evaluations using the depression scale and detailed cognitive function tests were performed after IOT. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were not different between the two groups. The IOT group showed significant improvements in depression, attention, memory and language functions, but not global cognition, frontal executive, or visuospatial functions compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: This study shows the ability of IOT to alleviate depression and improve some cognitive functions in patients with dementia. These results suggest that IOT may be an effective non-pharmacological approach for improving the symptoms of dementia.

The add-on placebo effects promoted a more positive affect (g = 0.430), greater self-esteem (g = 0.454), improved cardiorespiratory fitness (g = 0.273), and decreased perceived exertion (g = 0.476) and blood pressure (g = 0.268). Improved affect benefits were moderated by placebo type (elaboration > external medium), self-selected exercise intensity (no > yes), and exercise type (running > nonspecific). The results support the proposal that the add-on placebo effect can provide significant positive benefits for exercisers, particularly in terms of psychological responses.","Qiu, Yue; Mao, Zhixiong; Yun, Dongting","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12315","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Appl Psychol Health Well Being;2021 Nov 08.; Publication details: Appl Psychol Health Well Being;2021 Nov 08.; Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22538,""
"PROMIS Scores Should Not be Used in Isolation to Measure Outcomes in Lumbar Stenosis Patients","STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional analysis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish the strength of relationship between the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Adult Depression (AD), Physical Function (PF), and Pain Interference (PI) with the Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire (SSSQ) in assessing lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In 2009, there were >35,000 surgeries for LSS, which amounted to $1.65 billion in health care cost. By 2021, there will be >2.4 million people in the United States with symptomatic LSS. There is an increasing emphasis on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to define value in medicine. Therefore, it would be beneficial to compare PROMIS, a universal PRO, against the SSSQ, the ""criterion standard"" for assessing LSS. METHODS: Eighty-two patients with LSS completing the PROMIS and SSSQ were enrolled. Per existing institutional protocol, PROMIS AD, PF, and PI were completed at every clinic visit. Linear regression analysis was then performed to evaluate how well the SSSQ and PROMIS scores correlated to each other. RESULTS: When linear regression was performed for pre-treatment values, the R2 value for the SSSQ PF versus PROMIS PF was 0.14 (PÃ¢<U+0080><U+008A>=Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>0.0008), whereas the R2 value for the SSSQ symptom severity versus PROMIS PI was 0.03 (PÃ¢<U+0080><U+008A>=Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>0.13). The R2 value for the combined SSSQ physical function and symptom severity versus PROMIS AD was 0.07 (PÃ¢<U+0080><U+008A>=Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>0.02). When post-treatment SSSQ satisfaction scores were correlated to postoperative PROMIS AD, PI, and PF scores, the R2 values for a good linear fit were 0.13, 0.25, and 0.18 respectively (P values: 0.01, 0.003, and 0.003). CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment PROMIS scores do not adequately capture the disease-specific impact of spinal stenosis, but postoperative PROMIS scores better reflect outcomes after surgery for LSS. PROMIS scores should not be used in isolation to assess outcomes in patients with LSS.Level of Evidence: 4.","Phan, Amy; Liu, Andrew Y; Sulovari, Aron; Maqsoodi, Noorullah; Everett, Clifford Richard; Mesfin, Addisu","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/BRS.0000000000004092","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Spine (Phila Pa 1976);46(23): E1262-E1268, 2021 Dec 01.; Publication details: Spine (Phila Pa 1976);46(23): E1262-E1268, 2021 Dec 01.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Spinal Stenosis; Adult; Constriction, Pathologic; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Retrospective Studies; Spinal Stenosis/diagnosis; Spinal Stenosis/surgery","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22539,""
"Neurophysiology of hypnosis in chronic pain: A review of recent literature","Chronic pain is a complex phenomenon which includes biological, psychological, and socio-professional factors that undermine patients' everyday life. Currently, only few patients significantly benefit from pharmacological treatments and many have to stop them because of negative side effects. Moreover, no medication or treatment addresses all aspects of chronic pain at once (i.e., sensations, emotions, behaviors, and cognitions), positioning chronic pain as an important public health issue and thus contributing to high health-care costs. Consequently, patients and health-care providers are increasingly turning to complementary non-pharmacological techniques such as hypnosis. Clinical research has demonstrated a decrease of pain perception, pain interference, depression and anxiety, and an increase in global quality of life when patients with chronic pain have benefited from hypnosis learning. Neuroimaging studies offer a possible explanation of these results by focusing on neural processes of pain modulation in chronic pain patients' brain. Studies conducted with chronic pain patients showed a modulation of pain matrix activity during hypnosis with a specific involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex (related to emotional and cognitive processing of pain). Therefore, hypnosis seems to act upon regions underlying emotion and cognition, with an influence on pain perception and emotional regulation. In this review, we propose to carry out a review of the recent literature on hypnosis in chronic pain management. A better understanding of the beneficial effects of hypnosis on chronic pain and its neurophysiology should enable more systematic use of this technique in the management of this complex health problem.","Bicego, Aminata; Rousseaux, Floriane; Faymonville, Marie-Elisabeth; Nyssen, Anne-Sophie; Vanhaudenhuyse, Audrey","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00029157.2020.1869517","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Am J Clin Hypn;64(1): 62-80, 2022 Aug.; Publication details: Am J Clin Hypn;64(1): 62-80, 2022 Aug.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Chronic Pain; Hypnosis; Anxiety; Chronic Pain/therapy; Humans; Pain Management; Quality of Life","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22540,""
"The added value of cognition-targeted exercise versus symptom-targeted exercise for multiple sclerosis fatigue: A randomized controlled pilot trial","BACKGROUND: Fatigue is considered one of the most common symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and lacks a current standardized treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a cognition-targeted exercise versus symptom-targeted exercise for MS fatigue. METHODS: In this Pilot, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial, sixty participants with multiple sclerosis, were randomly assigned to either a Cognition-Targeted Exercise (CTE) (N = 30, mean age 41) or a Symptom-Targeted Exercise (STE) (N = 30, mean age 42). The participants in the experimental group received eight, 50-minute sessions of weekly Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) in addition to a CTE Program; whereas, participants in the control group received eight, 50-minute sessions of weekly CBT in addition to the standardized physiotherapy program (STE Program). Feasibility was assessed through recruitment rate, participant retention, adherence and safety, in addition to clinical outcome measures, including: (1) Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), (2) Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), (3) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). All outcome measures were assessed at baseline (pretreatment), following completion of the eight visit intervention protocol, and at 3-months follow-up. RESULTS: The recruitment rate was 60% and 93% of participants completed the entire study. The recruited participants complied with 98% of the required visits. No adverse events were recorded. A Generalized Estimation Equation Model revealed a significant difference over time as an interaction term during the post and follow up visit for all clinical outcome measures (p < .001). CONCLUSION: The addition of CTE to CBT exhibited positive and more lasting influence on MS fatigue outcomes compared to Symptom-Targeted Exercise (STE). Feasibility and efficacy data from this pilot study provide support for a full-scale RCT of CTE as an integral component of Multiple Sclerosis fatigue management.","Alketbi, Azza; Basit, Salah; Hamza, Nouran; Walton, Lori M; Moustafa, Ibrahim M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258752","","Database: MEDLINE; Publication type: article; Publication details: PLoS One;16(11): e0258752, 2021.; Publication details: PLoS One;16(11): e0258752, 2021.; Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22541,""
"The Lipstick Effect During COVID-19 Lockdown","Although consumer spending typically declines during times of crisis, some observers have noted the tendency of consumers to spend more on less costly luxury goods instead, calling it the ""The Lipstick Effect."" E-commerce sales in beauty and personal-care categories, compared to pre-COVID-19, saw an increase. The mass lockdowns across many states in the U.S. resulted in hospitals and cosmetic clinics suspending many services. We present several patients who developed complications following home-administered cosmetic procedures and presented via telemedicine clinic at the dermatology department at Boston Medical Center in May 2020. The first case follows a patient who had platelet-rich-plasma concentrate injected into her face by an unauthorized, presumed aesthetician in training. The second and third cases follow patients purchasing products from unregulated e-commerce retailers, to self-administer injectable fillers and perform trichloroacetic acid chemical peels, respectively. We discuss the impact of social media in conjunction with extensive misinformation along with easily accessible products available on the internet, and how this combination has encouraged self-injurious behavior and its consequences while lacking any means of accountability. This paper aims to encourage the spread of patient education and limit personal harm from self-administration of potentially injurious procedures.","Bahl, De La Garza, Lam, Vashi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clindermatol.2021.11.002","20211122","COVID 19; PRP; TCA; chemical peel; cosmetic procedure; filler; lipstick effect; pandemic; platelet-rich plasma; self-administered; trichloroacetic acid","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22542,""
"Changes in physical activity levels and mental health during COVID-19: Prospective findings among adult twin pairs","Physical distancing and other COVID-19 pandemic mitigation strategies have negatively impacted physical activity (PA) levels and mental health in cross-sectional studies. The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between changes in PA and mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, following implementation of mitigation strategies, in a sample of adult twins. This was a prospective study of 3,057 adult twins from the Washington State Twin Registry. Study participants completed online surveys in 2020, at baseline (March 26 -April 5), and three follow-up waves (W1: April 20 -May 3; W2: Jul 16 -Aug 2; W3: Sept 16 -Oct 1). Physical activity was operationalized as self-reported moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and neighborhood walking (minutes/week), and mental health outcomes, operationalized as self-reported anxiety and perceived stress were assessed in the three waves of follow-up. Latent growth curve models (LGCMs) were used to assess changes in PA and mental health outcomes over time. Parallel LGCMs were used to estimate the cross-sectional, parallel, and prospective associations between PA and mental health over time. All models took into within-pair correlations and adjusted for age, sex, and race. Individuals' amount of MVPA and walking decreased over time, whereas levels of anxiety remained stable, and stress increased slightly. Cross-sectional associations observed between both PA predictors and mental health outcomes were weak. After taking into account cross-sectional associations between PA and mental health outcomes, changes in PA over time were not associated with changes in mental health outcomes over time. Over a time period aligned with COVID-19 mitigation strategies and social restrictions, changes in physical activity was not associated with changes in anxiety or stress levels in the current sample. Nonetheless, the average decline in PA over time is worrisome. Public health resources should continue to promote PA as a means to improve physical health during the pandemic.","Duncan, Avery, Tsang, Williams, Seto","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260218","20211122","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22543,""
"Identifying the role of parent-child conflict and intimacy in Chinese adolescents' psychological distress during school reopening in COVID-19 pandemic","School reopening during COVID-19 can be a particularly stressful transition for many adolescents. However, little is known about the impact of parent-child relationships on adolescents' mental health during this transition. Using a 2-wave longitudinal design, this research examined the role of parent-child conflict and intimacy in adolescents' psychological distress after school reopening. Immediately before school reopening, 879 Chinese adolescents (mean age = 13.14 years, 51% girls) reported on their parent-child conflict and intimacy. They also reported on their depressive symptoms and anger problems before and 3 months after school reopening. Youth who reported higher levels of parent-child conflict and lower levels of parent-child intimacy before school reopening were more likely to show increased depressive symptoms and anger problems over time. Moreover, the moderating role of parent-child conflict and intimacy in the link between youth's perceived stress toward school reopening and psychological distress was investigated. Specifically, parent-child conflict moderated the impact of youth's perceived stress on their psychological distress, such that greater perceived stress was only linked with more psychological distress over time in families with higher levels of parent-child conflict, but not in families with lower levels of parent-child conflict. Taken together, the findings highlight the important role of parent-child relationships in shaping adolescent's mental health as they return to school, which provides key insights into reducing adolescents' psychological distress during the transition of school reopening in COVID-19 pandemic.

"COVID-19 disruption gets inside the family: A two-month multilevel study of family stress during the pandemic","Developmental research during COVID-19 suggests that pandemic-related disruptions in family relationships are associated with children's mental health. Most of this research has focused on 1 child per family, thereby obfuscating patterns that are differentially operative at the family-wide (i.e., between-family) versus child-specific (i.e., within-family) levels of analysis. Thus, the current study evaluates multilevel, longitudinal associations between COVID-19 disruption, family relationships, and caregiver/child mental health using a sibling comparison methodology. Caregivers (N = 549 families with 1098 children between 5 and 18 years old) were recruited from the Prolific research panel (73% White-European; 68% female; 76% United Kingdom, 19% U.S.A.; median 2019 income $50,000-$74,999). Caregiver reports of COVID-19 disruption, psychological distress, family functioning, parenting, and child mental health (for 2 children per family) were provided during May (time 1) and July (time 2) 2020. A Bayesian multilevel path analysis with random effects revealed: (a) families were experiencing difficulties across domains when COVID-19 disruption was high; (b) COVID-19 disruption corresponded to greater sibling differences in mental health; and (c) the sibling with poorer mental health received lower quality parenting over time, especially in families who reported higher levels of differential parenting. Findings suggest that understanding children's mental health difficulties during COVID-19 requires a family system lens due to the multiple ways these consequences permeate across the family unit. Comprehensive interventions for children's mental health during this time will likely require an examination of caregiver, sibling, and whole-family dynamics in the context of evidence-based telehealth practice.

"Parent-adolescent relationship quality as a moderator of links between COVID-19 disruption and reported changes in mothers' and young adults' adjustment in five countries","The COVID-19 pandemic has presented families around the world with extraordinary challenges related to physical and mental health, economic security, social support, and education. The current study capitalizes on a longitudinal, cross-national study of parenting, adolescent development, and young adult competence to document the association between personal disruption during the pandemic and reported changes in internalizing and externalizing behavior in young adults and their mothers since the pandemic began. It further investigates whether family functioning during adolescence 3 years earlier moderates this association. Data from 484 families in five countries (Italy, the Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States) reveal that higher levels of reported disruption during the pandemic are related to reported increases in internalizing and externalizing behaviors after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic for young adults (Mage = 20) and their mothers in all five countries, with the exception of one association in Thailand. Associations between disruption during the pandemic and young adults' and their mothers' reported increases in internalizing and externalizing behaviors were attenuated by higher levels of youth disclosure, more supportive parenting, and lower levels of destructive adolescent-parent conflict prior to the pandemic. This work has implications for fostering parent-child relationships characterized by warmth, acceptance, trust, open communication, and constructive conflict resolution at all times given their protective effects for family resilience during times of crisis.

"Connections during crisis: Adolescents' social dynamics and mental health during COVID-19","Adolescence is a critical period for social development, which COVID-19 has dramatically altered. Quarantined youths had limited in-person interactions with peers. The present study used an intensive longitudinal design to investigate changes in interpersonal dynamics and mental health during COVID-19. Specifically, we investigated whether the associations between different social contexts-that is, ""spillover""-changed during COVID-19 and whether changes in social interactions during COVID-19 was associated with changes in depressive symptoms. Approximately 1 year prior to the onset of COVID-19, 139 youths reported depressive symptoms and daily interactions with parents, siblings, and friends, every day for 21 days via online questionnaires. Shortly after schools closed due to COVID-19, 115 of these youths completed a similar 28-day diary. Analyses included 112 youths (62 girls; 73% Caucasian; Mage = 11.77, range = 8 to 15 in Wave 1) who completed at least 13 diary days in each data wave. Our results show that younger adolescents experienced significant decreases in negative and positive interactions with friends, whereas older adolescents showed significant decreases in negative interactions with friends and significant increases in positive interactions with siblings. As predicted, within-day spillover of positive interactions and person-level association of negative interactions increased within the family during COVID-19, whereas within-day spillover of positive interactions between family and friends decreased. We also found a dramatic increase in depressive symptoms. More negative interactions and fewer positive interactions with family members were associated with changes in depressive symptoms. Our study sheds light on how youths' social development may be impacted by COVID-19.

"Family resilience and psychological distress in the COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed methods study","Many changes were thrust upon families by the COVID-19 pandemic, including mandated quarantines, social distancing, transitions to distance learning for children, and remote work. The current study used mixed methods to examine the challenges and resilience of families in the United States during the pandemic (May-July 2020), as well as predictors and moderators of parent/child psychological distress. Our sample included 469 parents (459 mothers) of children aged Ã¢Ë†Â¼2-13 years (239 girls, 228 boys, one nonbinary child, one ""prefer not to answer"" selection), who completed an online survey with closed-ended and open-ended portions. The sample had middle-to-high socioeconomic status and 86% of families were White/non-Hispanic. Qualitative (content and thematic analyses) and quantitative (descriptive statistics and regressions) findings revealed that, even in this relatively privileged sample, parents and families were experiencing struggles in many life domains (e.g., family, school) and shifts in family dynamics and routines, which were related to emotional and mental health. Families experienced many changes in their lives, some positive and some negative, and often exhibited resilience through managing these changes. Our moderation analyses indicated that COVID-19's daily impact was significantly associated with psychological distress for children and parents, and this association was stronger for older versus younger children. Less active/instructive parental media mediation was also related to less child psychological distress. Moving forward, practitioners can focus on preventive efforts including psychoeducation regarding healthy outlets for negative emotions during COVID-19, and practical help troubleshooting childcare and health care challenges impacting many families.

"We are in this together: Maintaining our health care teams' wellness during challenging times","Efforts to prevent or mitigate burnout in health care practice(s) are longstanding in both biomedical and mental health arenas-from early training in classrooms, internships, and residencies to postgraduate work in primary, secondary, tertiary, and other care contexts (Berg &amp; Garrard, 1980; Chen et al., 2019; Prins et al., 2007). From generic advice about work/ life balance, sleep hygiene, physical activity, and healthy eating to specific interventions across individual and organizational levels designed to support trainees and providers who are personally decompensating and/or potentially putting their patients at risk, scientific and lay literature, resources, programming, and protocols are extant. Whether and how we-as individuals, care teams, and care systems-have advanced these efforts effectively are similarly diverse. COVID-19 changed this conversation-or at least the urgency of it. In some ways, this makes perfect sense in light of the increased hours that many of us suddenly found ourselves working (read: <i>no more work/life balance</i>). But there were a lot of other things-less expected things happened. In this issue, Cornelius et al.'s (2021) engagement with health care workers in New York City is illustrative. Unlike traversing something that is difficult but has a clear endpoint (like a 24-hr shift or a four-year residency), we do not know when this pandemic will be over. It feels like running a marathon with no mile markers or celebratory finish line. And unlike offering responsive care to a specific community in a defined geographic area (like one impacted by a terrorist attack or a hurricane), we do not know where this pandemic's virus is. Because we cannot actually see COVID-19, we worry more about catching it. If we catch it, we might bring it home. If we bring it home, we could kill our spouses. Or our children. Maybe our whole families. It is hard to do good work when we carry emotional burdens like that.

"Development and evaluation of employee wellness sessions in response to COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread mental health distress. Few COVID-19 employee wellness initiatives have been evaluated and have primarily focused on frontline health care workers. This study described the feasibility and utilization of, and participant satisfaction for virtual COVID-19 employee wellness sessions at a large university and health system. Thomas Jefferson University behavioral health consultants (BHCs) and behavioral health leaders developed and offered JeffBeWell (JBW) wellness sessions over 17 weeks during March 2020 through July 2020. Sessions were advertised via mass emails and an employee intranet. Multiple live thirty-minute sessions were offered weekly; facilitators provided psychoeducation and offered coping tools. Topics included working remotely, parenting, sleep, nutrition, grief, anxiety, and yoga and relaxation. Attendance was tracked and participants were asked to complete satisfaction surveys; survey data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. A total of 388 sessions were offered with 1,324 participants. Attendance rose in weeks 1-5, followed by a decline and then a second increase in Weeks 15 through 17, 213 participants (16%) responded to the survey. The largest portion of respondents were in academic administrative roles (46%), followed by clinical providers and staff (34%) and faculty and students (9%). Of respondents, 91% of respondents felt that the sessions met their expectations, 92% felt the session helped them, and 92% planned to attend future sessions. JBW sessions were feasible to implement, attended by diverse participants and well received by survey respondents, although attendance has fluctuated during the pandemic. BHCs have refined sessions based on participant feedback and are tailoring more sessions to specific audiences.

"Family well-being and individual mental health in the early stages of COVID-19","The objective of the study was to examine the association of COVID-19 with family well-being and adult mental health 1 month into the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Prior pandemics have had long-term effects on mental health. COVID-19 and its related stressors, such as loss of work and social distancing requirements, may have a profound impact on short-term and long-term mental health. Family stress theory indicates that subjective family meaning making and family resources affect how stressors lead to outcomes. Participants, adults ages 18 years and older (N = 416), completed a cross-sectional online survey measuring depressive and anxiety symptoms, family health, subjective family meaning making, and loss of work resulting from COVID-19. Data were analyzed using a structural equation modeling framework. Results indicated that subjective negative family meaning and effects were associated with more depression and anxiety. Higher family health resources were associated with less depression and anxiety. Family health resources mediated the relationships between COVID-19 loss of work with depression and anxiety. COVID-19 associated stressors 1 month into the pandemic had modest effects on family meaning making and family health resources. Individuals from families whose health resources were negatively impacted by COVID-19 reported more anxiety and depressive symptoms. Health care and public health systems should consider family health resources to help reduce the negative effects of COVID-19 on mental health. Longitudinal research is needed to examine the accumulation of stressors over time and the directionality of relationships.

Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) protocol, studies were gathered via PsycINFO, PubMed/MEDLINE, and preprint databases (published April 29, 2021) that examined individual-level changes in consumption during the initial COVID-19 mitigation measures (before October 2020). Next, sample proportion increases and decreases in consumption, in addition to mean change in consumption variables from pre- to during-COVID, were meta-analyzed, and contextual and individual difference variables related to consumption changes during the pandemic were summarized. One hundred and twenty-eight studies provided data from 58 countries (<i>M n</i> = 3,876; <i>Mdn n</i> = 1,092; aggregate sample <i>n</i> = 492,235). The average mean change in alcohol consumption was nonsignificant (Cohen's <i>d</i> = -0.01, <i>p</i> = .68); however, meta-analysis revealed that 23% of participants reported increases in consumption and 23% reported decreases. These changes were moderated by per capita gross domestic product and country. Narrative synthesis revealed multiple predictors of increased drinking, including contextual changes (e.g., children at home, income loss, working remotely), individual difference variables (being female, a young-to-middle aged adult, or Black), and mental health/alcohol-related risk factors (e.g., depression). The identified factors associated with increased alcohol consumption should be considered in planning behavioral health services during future crisis events that abruptly alter everyday environments in ways that increase stress and decrease access to naturally occurring rewards.

"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Healthcare Workers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: Perceived Stress Scale Measures","The COVID-19 pandemic has been stressful and of considerable concern among health care workers (HCWs). Being particularly at increased risk for exposure, HCWs worry about becoming infected as well as infecting co-workers, patients and family members. Such distress and panic may have destructive effects on individuals and may last long after the pandemic situation leading to depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to measure and investigate the prevalence of the factors affecting psychological stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among HCWs. A self-administered online survey-including perceived stress scale (PSS) questions-was disseminated among HCWs in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (SA) between1st June and 30th July 2020. A total of 469 HCWs responded to the survey for a high response rate (93.8%). The PSS revealed that 15.8% of the respondents were suffering from high stress levels, 77.2% were suffering from moderate stress levels and 7% with low stress levels. Females and junior frontline staff reported more severe stress levels. Participation on the pandemic team shows significant impact on stress levels. COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress levels among HCWs and affects their psychological wellbeing. Designing programs promoting HCWs mental health are crucial and emotional and psychological support strategies should be part of every public health crisis management plan.","Alwaqdani, Amer, Alwaqdani, AlMansour, Alzoman, Saadallah, Alsuwaidan, Soule, Memish","https://doi.org/10.1007/s44197-021-00014-4","20211122","COVID-19 pandemic; Healthcare workers; Psychological stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22553,""

"Adapting evidence-based early psychosis intervention services for virtual delivery: Protocol for a pragmatic mixed-methods implementation and evaluation study","Timely and comprehensive treatment in the form of early psychosis intervention (EPI) has become the standard of care for youth with psychosis. While EPI services were designed to be delivered in person, the COVID-19 pandemic required many EPI programs to rapidly transition to virtual delivery, with little evidence to guide intervention adaptations or to support the effectiveness and satisfaction with virtual EPI services. This study aims to explore the adaptations required to deliver NAVIGATE, a model of coordinated specialty care used in EPI, via a virtual format. This study will evaluate implementation of the NAVIGATE model delivered virtually by describing the nature of the adaptations to the intervention, assessing fidelity to the EPI model, and satisfaction of clients, family members and care providers. We will investigate barriers and facilitators to virtual NAVIGATE implementation, service engagement, and health equity impacts of this work. The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto transitioned to delivering NAVIGATE virtually early in the COVID-19 pandemic. The Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications for Evidence-Based Interventions (FRAME) will be used to describe the adaptations required to deliver NAVIGATE virtually. Fidelity to the EPI model will be measured using the First Episode Psychosis Services Fidelity Scale (FEPS-FS) and fidelity to NAVIGATE will be assessed by investigating adherence to its core components. Implementation facilitators and barriers will be explored using semi-structured interviews with providers informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Satisfaction with virtually delivered NAVIGATE will be assessed with virtual client and provider experience surveys and qualitative interviews with clients, family members and providers. Service engagement data will be collected through chart reviews, and potential impacts of virtually delivered NAVIGATE on different population groups will be assessed with the Health Equity Impact Assessment (HEIA). Virtual clinical delivery of NAVIGATE started in March 2020 with additional adaptations and data collection ongoing. Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and survival analysis for quantitative data. Qualitative data will be analyzed using thematic content analysis. Integration of qualitative and quantitative data will occur at the data collection, interpretation and reporting level following a convergent design. This study will provide knowledge on the type of intervention adaptations required for virtual delivery of NAVIGATE for youth with early psychosis, ensuring access to high-quality care for this population during the pandemic and beyond by guiding future implementation in similar contexts.

From 1 January 2008 through 4 June 2021, the most likely cluster of suicides, although not statistically significant, was identified between March 2020 and June 2021, which coincided with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Army has observed 55%-82% increases in suicide rates among Millennials, Generation Z, and Generation X compared to 1 year before the pandemic. The largest proportional increase in rates affected the members of Generation X, but the highest rates both before and after the onset of the pandemic affected those in Generation Z. Discussion of the findings introduces theories that have been used to explain psychological states that may predispose to suicidal behavior and posits ways in which Army leaders and organizations may be able to reduce suicide risk among soldiers.

"Editorial: Do lockdowns scar? Three putative mechanisms through which COVID-19 mitigation policies could cause long-term harm to young people's mental health","The use of lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19 has been unprecedented in its scale, scope and duration despite early predictions that such a measure would have a negative impact on the mental health and well-being of many young people and their families. From a developmental psychopathology perspective both direct and indirect effects of lockdown-related harms to young people's mental health were predictable: Direct effects, for instance, being due to the negative psychological impact of social isolation and confinement on children; Indirect effects being exerted via negative impacts on family and parent mental health and wellbeing. That these effects would vary from person-to-person was also predicted from this perspective; with vulnerable individuals with pre-existing conditions and those living in high-risk settings being at particular risk. The presumption has been that such negative effects, if they do occur, would be time limited and that everything would return to normal once lockdowns ended. But this is not necessarily the case. In this editorial we ask whether lockdowns could have long-term effects on young people's mental health and then briefly outline three putative mechanisms through which such long-term effects might occur.","Sonuga-Barke, Fearon","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13537","20211122","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22558,""
"Impact of virtual brief wellness based psychosocial intervention on mental wellbeing of stable hospitalised COVID-19 patients - A pilot study","The Optimal Health Program (OHP) is a collaborative self-management program that promotes clients to be actively involved in their own healthcare and overall wellbeing. Program Kesihatan Optimum (SANUBARI) is a Malay version of the OHP after a translational process and cultural adaptation by psychiatrists, clinical psychologist and family medicine specialists in 2017. The program is of a low intensity, patient-centred program, advocating self-health management to improve health literacy by enhancing self-efficacy, building strengths and values, and initiating change and planning, ultimately enhancing wellbeing of people. The programme can be used as a form of early psychosocial intervention during the current pandemic in maintaining the general mental wellbeing of COVID-19 patients. This is an open labelled interventional study of a virtual brief psychosocial intervention, called SANUBARI. The program was conducted among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the COVID-19 wards of two centres from May 2020 until August 2020. Inclusion criteria include patients aged eighteen years and above, diagnosed with COVID-19, medically stable, speaking and reading Bahasa Melayu or English. All study subjects attended two sessions on OHP via telecommunication method and answered questionnaires (General Self-Efficacy (GSE) Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire) via computer-assisted self-interview. Data collection was done before the start of the intervention, at the end of the intervention and a month post-intervention. A total of 37 patients were recruited and more than half of the subjects were males (62.2%), single (75.5%) and from the Malay ethnicity (78.4%). Seventy-three per cent of subjects had received tertiary education, and most of them were students reflecting a higher unemployment status (73%). Most subjects have no comorbid chronic medical illness (89.2%), and none has a comorbid psychiatric illness. Comparison of the GSE score across 3-time points (preintervention, immediate post-intervention and a month postintervention) showed statistically significant improvement in the mean total GSE score immediate and a month postintervention as compared to the pre-intervention; from mean total GSE score of 29.78 pre-intervention to 34.73 (mean difference 4.946, 95% Confidence Interval 95%CI: 3.361, 6.531) immediate post-intervention and 33.08 (mean difference 3.297, 95%CI: 1.211, 5.348) a month post intervention. There was no significant association between the socio-demographic or clinical data, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and changes in GSE scores over three time points. COVID-19 patients improved their self-efficacy levels after the virtual brief OHP intervention, and it maintained a month post-intervention, protecting them from psychological stress and ultimately enhances wellbeing during this coronavirus pandemic.","Thong, Seed","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+virtual+brief+wellness+based+psychosocial+intervention+on+mental+wellbeing+of+stable+hospitalised+COVID-19+patients+-+A+pilot+study.","20211122","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22559,""
"Precision Postbiotics and Mental Health: the Management of Post-COVID-19 Complications","The health catastrophe originated by COVID-19 pandemic construed profound impact on a global scale. However, a plethora of research studies corroborated convincing evidence conferring severity of infection of SARS-CoV-2 with the aberrant gut microbiome that strongly speculated its importance for development of novel therapeutic modalities. The intense exploration of probiotics has been envisaged to promote the healthy growth of the host, and restore intestinal microecological balance through various metabolic and physiological processes. The demystifying effect of probiotics cannot be defied, but there exists a strong skepticism related to their safety and efficacy. Therefore, molecular signature of probiotics termed as ""postbiotics"" are of paramount importance and there is continuous surge of utilizing postbiotics for enhancing health benefits, but little is explicit about their antiviral effects. Therefore, it is worth considering their prospective role in post-COVID regime that pave the way for exploring the pastoral vistas of postbiotics. Based on previous research investigations, the present article advocates prospective role of postbiotics in alleviating the health burden of viral infections, especially SARS-CoV-2.

"Social media and spreading panic among adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, Egypt","The COVID-19 pandemic became a challenge to human well-being. The rapid spread of the coronavirus diseases with quarantine measures make people use social media platforms more than before. The bad use of social media platforms affects the mental health of users leading to spread of panic among persons. This study aimed to determine the impact of social media on spreading panic about COVID-19 among adults in Egypt. This was a cross-sectional study that enrolled 2032 participants through online snowball sampling approach conducted during May 2021 to collect data from adults in Egypt. A self-administered questionnaire was used. It consists of three sections as follows: demographic characteristics, the social media platforms employed during the pandemic, the impact of social media on study participants. Nearly half of both sexes believed that spreading news about COVID-19 on social media platforms has a major role in spreading fear among people. More than half of the study participants reported that the level of Egyptian pages on social media covering COVID-19 was not good. A total of 46% females and 30.1% of males; those with primary, preparatory, higher, and postgraduate education; and 46.7% of medical and 32.1% of nonmedical were psychologically affected. The impact of social media on spreading panic among Egyptians varies according to gender, level of education, and occupation. Therefore, social media played an important role in spreading panic during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shehata, Abdeldaim","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17580-6","20211122","Adults; COVID-19; Egypt; Pandemic; Panic; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22561,""

"Stronger functional network connectivity and social support buffer against negative affect during the COVID-19 outbreak and after the pandemic peak","Health and financial uncertainties, as well as enforced social distancing, during the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected the mental health of people. These impacts are expected to continue even after the pandemic, particularly for those who lack support from family and friends. The salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN), and frontoparietal network (FPN) function in an interconnected manner to support information processing and emotional regulation processes in stressful contexts. In this study, we examined whether functional connectivity of the SN, DMN, and FPN, measured using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging before the pandemic, is a neurobiological marker of negative affect (NA) during the COVID-19 pandemic and after its peak in a large sample (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 496, 360 females); the moderating role of social support in the brain-NA association was also investigated. We found that participants reported an increase in NA during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic, and the NA did not decrease, even after the peak period. People with higher connectivity within the SN and between the SN and the other two networks reported less NA during and after the COVID-19 outbreak peak, and the buffer effect was stronger if their social support was greater. These findings suggest that the functional networks that are responsible for affective processing and executive functioning, as well as the social support from family and friends, play an important role in protecting against NA under stressful and uncontrollable situations.","Xiao, Chen, Yi, Luo, Yan, Feng, He, Lei, Qiu, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ynstr.2021.100418","20211122","COVID-19 pandemic; Default mode network; Frontoparietal network; Negative affect; Salience network; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22563,""
"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children and Adolescents With and Without Mental Disorders","<b>Background:</b> The previous and current studies highlight the psychological distress caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated restrictions among the general population, especially among children and adolescents; however, few studies have examined children and adolescents with a mental disorder. The current study aimed to explore whether youth with mental disorders show a higher pandemic-associated psychological burden than healthy children and adolescents and to determine which psychiatric diagnoses are particularly associated with a higher distress level. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, 144 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 18 years with a mental disorder and 48 children and adolescents within the same age range without a mental disorder, and their caregivers, completed questionnaires assessing the pandemic-associated trauma symptoms (the Child Report of Post-Traumatic Symptoms [CROPS] and the Parents Report of Post-Traumatic Symptoms [PROPS]). Additionally, we asked specific questions about the pandemic-associated stress factors, such as financial problems, prolonged screen times, or loneliness. <b>Results:</b> Children and adolescents with a mental illness showed a significantly higher psychological burden than their mentally healthy peers. Female gender was a risk factor for a higher self-reported psychological burden, and younger age was associated with a more extensive parent-reported psychological burden. The patients with a depressive disorder showed significantly higher levels of psychological distress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic than the patients with an attention deficit and/or a conduct disorder. <b>Conclusions:</b> Children and adolescents with a mental illness, particularly, female children and individuals with a depressive disorder, are at an increased risk of suffering from pandemic-associated psychological distress.

We adopted a sociomaterial analytical approach, seeking to identify how human and nonhuman agents came together to generate states of wellbeing or distress during this challenging period. As the case studies show, feelings of anxiety, fear and risk were generated from the following sociomaterial conditions: loss of face-to-face contact with friends and family members; concerns about hygiene and infecting others; financial stress; loss of regular paid employment or volunteering work; public spaces; and the behaviour of unknown others in public spaces. The agents and practices that emerged as most important for opening capacities for coping and maintaining wellness during lockdown included: the space of the home; contact with a small number of intimate others; online therapeutic care; practising self-care skills learnt from previous difficult times; helping and supporting others; engaging in leisure activities; and the companionship of pets. Contributing to an affirmative approach to more-than-human assemblages of health, distress and recovery, these findings demonstrate what bodies can do in times of crisis and the agents and practices that can generate capacities for coping.","Lupton, Lewis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.emospa.2021.100860","20211122","Affects; Agential capacities; Australia; COVID-19; Mental health; Sociomaterialism; Therapeutic spaces","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22566,""

We used the <i>Z</i>-score to compare different populations (experimental and historical control cohort). <b>Results:</b> 104 patients were included, the majority of which were women (64.4%), were above 65 years of age (57.7%), had either lung and breast cancer (56.7%), had advanced disease (64%) and were undergoing chemotherapy (63.5%). 51% of them expressed greater fear of cancer than of COVID-19 infection or both. In relation to HADS, 52.8% of emotional distress, 42.3% of anxiety and 58.6% of depression rates were detected. The main factors related with higher rates of psychological symptomatology were history of previous psychotropic drug consumption and the adoption of additional infection prevention measures because they considered themselves at risk of severe COVID-19 infection (<i>p</i> = 0.008; <i>p</i> = 0.003 for emotional distress, <i>p</i> = 0.026; <i>p</i> = 0.004 for anxiety, and <i>p</i> = 0.013; <i>p</i> = 0.008 for depression). Tumor type, stage, oncologic treatment or rescheduling of cancer treatments were not related to higher levels of psychological symptomatology. Comparison of our results with another population of similar characteristics was not significant (<i>Z</i> score = -1.88; <i>p</i> = 0.060). <b>Conclusions:</b> We detected high rates of emotional distress during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic among cancer patients in active treatment (52.8%). This was higher and clinically relevant than observed in a comparable population (42.5%), although not significant. Cancer itself is the main factor of concern for cancer patients, above and beyond the emotional distress generated by COVID-19 pandemic.","Toquero, Blanco FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, LÃƒÂ³pez MartÃƒÂ­, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez MarÃƒÂ­n, Vera Cea, Garrido GarcÃƒÂ­a, MÃƒÂ©ndez Carrascosa, BaÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ³n Torres, Donnay Candil, Ballesteros GarcÃƒÂ­a, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Torres, Costas Rojo, MondÃƒÂ©jar, Colomer, Romero-Laorden","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.755965","20211122","COVID-19; HADS Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; anxiety; cancer; depression; emotional distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22567,""
"Psychosocial Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients With Schizophrenia and Their Caregivers","The aim of this study was to analyze the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on 120 patients with schizophrenia, and their caregivers (control group), in the city of Arica, northern Chile. The hypotheses of this study hold that (1) self-reports of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among patients and caregivers would be positively correlated, (2) caregivers would self-report a greater impact of the pandemic on their daily lives, and (3) patients infected with COVID-19 would experience lower levels of mental health improvement and higher levels of psychological distress. Hypotheses were tested using correlations, mean differences, and effect sizes (Cohen's d). The results showed that patients with schizophrenia who had been in quarantine for almost a year showed similar levels of concern as their caregivers in the domains of health and social life. However, caregivers showed significant differences from patients in the areas of income, concern, and employment status. In addition, patients who were infected with COVID-19 showed lower levels of well-being and worse psychological recovery. The implications of the findings highlight the need to incorporate mental health interventions in the pandemic health context for caregivers of people with schizophrenia. Finally, the results suggest that Covid-19 infection has a significant effect on the recovery and psychological well-being of patients with schizophrenia.","Caqueo-UrÃƒÂ­zar, UrzÃƒÂºa, Ponce-Correa, Ferrer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.729793","20211122","COVID-19; psychosocial effects; recovery; schizophrenia; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22568,""
"Understanding the Emotion Coping Strategies During Public Emergencies - From the Perspective of Psychological Distance","Research has investigated behavioral coping strategies for the negative emotions that public emergencies elicit. Accordingly, our current research explored how people coped with negative emotions in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, from a cognitive perspective. Building on the theory of psychological distance and self-construal, we proposed that people who experienced fear, sadness and anxiety responded with independent-self construal, focusing on information that related to themselves and the novel virus (independent information). On the other hand, people who experienced fear, sadness and anger responded with interdependent-self construal, focusing on information that pertained to ""us"", the virus and nature (interdependent information). We collected data from 1,142 participants at both the initial peak of the outbreak and when its spread had subsided. Based on this longitudinal data, we examined the effectiveness of these strategies, and our findings suggested that independent information was effective in decreasing fear and anxiety, while interdependent information effectively mitigated sadness. The findings could help researchers, practitioners, governments, and organizations to implement appropriate information strategies to regulate individuals' negative emotions during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sun, Li, Wang, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.699180","20211122","COVID-19 outbreak; copying strategies; negative emotion; psychological distance; self-construal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22569,""
"Socio-Demographic Variables, Fear of COVID-19, Anxiety, and Depression: Prevalence, Relationships and Explanatory Model in the General Population of Seven Latin American Countries","The COVID-19 pandemic has gravely impacted Latin America. A model was tested that evaluated the contribution of socio-demographic factors and fear of COVID-19 on anxiety and depression in samples of residents in seven Latin American countries (Argentina, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, Colombia, and El Salvador). A total of 4,881 individuals, selected by convenience sampling, participated in the study. Moderate and severe levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety were identified, as well as a moderate average level of fear of COVID-19. In addition, it was observed that about a quarter of the participants presented symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and a major depressive episode. Fear of COVID-19 significantly and positively predicted anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas the effects of socio-demographic variables are generally low [Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>(287) = 5936.96, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; RMSEA = 0.064 [0.062, 0.065]; CFI = 0.947; and SRMR = 0.050].

We have examined their psychological symptoms using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and their readiness to fight the pandemic together with their academic career status, their relationship with the university, and their emotional reactions to the pandemic with Visual Analog Scales. <b>Results:</b> We retrieved a GHQ mean of 21.65 (SD = 40.63) and readiness to fight the pandemic mean of 53.58 (SD = 31.49). Perceived control affects variables: a negative effect on psychological symptoms and a positive effect on the willingness to fight the pandemic. The other variables with an impact were stress, loneliness, and anger that had a significant and positive impact on psychological symptoms. Age and concern for patients had a significant positive impact on readiness to fight for the pandemic, while years of attendance had a significant but negative impact. <b>Conclusion:</b> Universities and Institutions should consider the impact of the pandemic on students, in particular, for its effect on their mental health.","De Micheli, Vergani, Mazzoni, Marton","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648419","20211122","COVID-19; emotional reactions; health-care professionals; pandemic; psychological symptoms; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22571,""
"Evaluation of the E-Mental Health Mindfulness-Based and Skills-Based ""CoPE It"" Intervention to Reduce Psychological Distress in Times of COVID-19: Results of a Bicentre Longitudinal Study","<b>Background:</b> The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses immense challenges for health care systems and population-wide mental health. The e-mental health intervention ""CoPE It"" has been developed to offer standardized and manualized support to overcome psychological distress caused by the pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of ""CoPE It"" in terms of reducing distress (primary outcome), depression and anxiety symptoms, and improving self-efficacy, and mindfulness (secondary outcomes). Furthermore, the intervention's usability, feasibility, and participants' satisfaction with ""CoPE It"" was evaluated (tertiary outcome). The study protocol has been published previously. <b>Methods:</b> A bicentre longitudinal study was conducted from April 27th 2020 to May 3rd 2021. <i>N</i> = 110 participants were included in the analyses. The intervention consisted of four modules featuring different media promoting evidence-based methods of cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction. Difference in psychological distress between baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T1) were analyzed by repeated measure analysis of covariance. Mixed linear models were applied to assess moderating effects. Depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety symptoms, self-efficacy, and mindfulness were compared between baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T1) via <i>t</i>-tests. Usability of the ""CoPE It"" intervention and participants' satisfaction was evaluated by calculation means and frequencies. <b>Results:</b> <i>Primary outcome</i>: A significant effect of time on psychological distress at post-intervention (T1) after controlling for age, gender, education, mental illness and attitudes toward online interventions was found. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, and mindfulness were a significant moderators of the relationship between time and psychological distress for consistent wording. <i>Secondary outcomes:</i> There was a significant decrease in depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety, and a significant increase in self-efficacy and mindfulness between baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T1). <i>Tertiary outcomes:</i> 95.83% of the participants thought the ""CoPE It"" intervention was easy to use and 87.50% were satisfied with the ""CoPE It"" intervention in an overall, general sense. <b>Conclusion:</b> The e-mental health ""CoPE It"" intervention seems to be an effective approach in reducing psychological distress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and in enhancing self-efficacy and mindfulness during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Prevalence and Predictors of Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms Among International Medical Students in China During COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> The rapid spread of Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) infection has been the most important public health crisis across the globe since the end of 2019. Anxiety and depression are the most common mental health problems among people during the pandemic, and many studies have reported anxiety and depressive symptoms in college students. However, information on the mental health status of international medical students during this critical period of time has been scarce, which hinders the efforts in making proper policy or strategies to help these students. The present study aims to explore the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in international medical students in China and to find out the factors that have potential predictive value for anxiety and depressive symptoms. <b>Method:</b> A cross-sectional study was carried out for international medical students during November 2020 at China Medical University in Shenyang, China. Five hundred and nineteen international students were interviewed with questionnaires containing demographic variables, Stressors in school, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R) and Resilience Scale-14 (RS-14). Univariate logistic regression and stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted where appropriate to explore the predictive factors of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms in the sample population was 28.5% (148/519) and 31.6% (164/519), respectively. Stressors in school (ÃŽÂ² = 0.176, OR = 1.192, CI: 1.102-1.289), negative coping style (ÃŽÂ² = 0.639, OR = 1.894, CI: 1.287-2.788) and perceived stress (ÃŽÂ² = 0.230, OR = 1.258, CI: 1.184-1.337) were found to be the predictors of anxiety symptoms among the international medical students; while gender (ÃŽÂ² = -0.594, OR = 0.552, CI: 0.315-0.968), stay up late (ÃŽÂ² = 0.828, OR = 2.288, CI: 1.182-4.431), current place of residence (ÃŽÂ² = 1.082, OR = 2.951, CI: 1.256-6.931), stressors in the school (ÃŽÂ² = 0.303, OR = 1.354, CI: 1.266-1.496), negative coping style (ÃŽÂ² = 0.866, OR = 2.377, CI: 1.516-3.725), perceived stress (ÃŽÂ² = 0.233, OR = 1.262, CI: 1.180-1.351) were found to be predictors of depressive symptoms. <b>Conclusion:</b> The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms was moderate among international medical students in China. The communal predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms were stressors in school, negative coping style and perceived stress; while demographic factors such as gender (male), stay up late at night and current place of residence were found associated with depressive symptoms. These results suggest that proper stress management and specific interventions are needed to help students maintain their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic period.","Yuan, Lu, Wang, Guo, Ren, Gao, Pan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.761964","20211122","COVID-19; anxiety symptoms; depressive symptoms; international medical students; mental health; perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22575,""
"COVID-19 crisis: Influence of eHealth literacy on mental health promotion among Saudi nursing students","This study aims to determine the influence of eHealth literacy on mental health promotion among Saudi nursing students. This cross-sectional study was conducted from 19 April to 21 May 2020. A total of 468 nursing students responded to the self-administered online survey. Two instruments, namely, the eHealth Literacy Scale and the Positive Mental Health Scale, were used. Statistical tools such as frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation were used for the descriptive analysis. Multiple regression analysis was employed to analyse the relationship between eHealth literacy, health promotion, and its predictors. The results showed that 30.3% of nursing students were dissatisfied with their general health. Students perceived high self-assessed eHealth literacy and positive mental health. Students in the 4th year had lower scores than those of students in the 2nd year. Nursing students perceived that the quarantine and public social distancing lowered their mental health scores. Finally, the eHealth literacy mean scores resulted in a 0.21-point increase in the positive mental health scores. The finding of the study shows that the eHealth literacy positively influnce the mental health status of Saudi Nursing students.

"Maternal attachment representation, the risk of increased depressive symptoms and the influence on children's mental health during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic","The social distancing measures and the related closure of education institutions have confronted young families, in particular, with various challenges. Additional risk factors such as an insecure or even unresolved maternal attachment representation may affect mental health of mothers and their children in times of increased stress such as during the ongoing pandemic. We aimed to analyze the interplay between maternal attachment representation and mother's and children's mental health before and during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic. 91 mothers completed a ""SARS-CoV-2 pandemic survey"" examining the pandemic-related stress of their families including their own depressive symptomology and their children's mental health. Our mediation analysis demonstrates that the mothers' depressive symptomology significantly and fully mediated the relationship between maternal attachment representations and children's mental health during the pandemic. In contrast, the indirect effect of the maternal attachment representation on children's mental health before the pandemic through the depressive symptoms experienced by the mothers before the pandemic did not reach significance alongside the total and direct effect. The quality of the maternal attachment representation, promoted by childhood maltreatment, seems to be one relevant risk factor for the mothers' and children's mental health during a stressful time like a pandemic. The risk for mothers to develop depressive symptoms in times of a pandemic is significantly influenced by their current representation of previous attachment experiences. In addition, the mental well-being of mothers showed a considerable influence on the children's mental health during a pandemic. The results underline the necessity to consider unique needs of family members and to offer specific support in the current crisis focusing on attachment issues.","KÃƒÂ¶hler-Dauner, Buchheim, Hildebrand, Mayer, Clemens, Ziegenhain, Fegert","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-021-02162-4","20211122","Depression symptoms; Maternal attachment representation; Parental childhood maltreatment (CM); SARS-CoV-2-pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22577,""
"Six Month Trajectories of COVID-19 Experiences and Associated Stress, Anxiety, Depression, and Impairment in American Adults","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on health and well-being worldwide. There is increasing research seeking to better understand the psychological impact of COVID-19 experiences. However, this research has largely been limited in size and scope. The present study examined longitudinal trajectories of COVID-19 experiences on COVID-19 related stress, anxiety, depression, and functional impairment in a convenience sample of 788 American adults recruited through MTURK. Data was collected across four waves between March and October 2020. COVID-19 experiences were consistently associated with higher odds of probable anxiety and depression diagnoses. COVID-19 related stress also predicted large proportions of variance in anxiety, depression, and functional impairment in latent variable analyses. Overtime, the results indicated that while anxiety and depression decreased, functional impairment remained stable. These findings highlight the emotional toll of the COVID-19 pandemic over time. Decreases in COVID-19 related stress, anxiety, and depression over time may reflect resiliency among respondents. Importantly, these results underscore the continued need for mental health services as associations between COVID-19 and functional impairment remained consistent over time.","Gallagher, Smith, Richardson, Long","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10608-021-10277-7","20211122","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Impairment; Longitudinal; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22578,""
"Medium-term Influence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic on Patients with Diabetes: A Single-center Cross-sectional Study","Objective This study evaluated the lifestyle changes in patients with diabetes and their independent associations with glycemic and body weight control. In addition, the correlation between changes in mental health and lifestyles was evaluated. Methods This single-center cross-sectional study included 340 patients with diabetes who periodically visited our department. Changes in dietary habits, activities of daily living, and mental health before and during approximately six months after the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic were evaluated using a questionnaire, including the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form. Results Approximately 20%, 30%, and over 50% of patients had worsened dietary habits, decreased activities of daily living, and deteriorated mental health, respectively. A multiple regression analysis showed that irregular meal timing was significantly associated with change in HbA1c (ÃŽÂ²=0.328, p=0.001), and decreased walking time was significantly associated with changes in body weight (ÃŽÂ²=-0.245, p=0.025). The change in fear and anxiety was positively associated with changes in meal timing regularity (r=0.129, p=0.019) and carbohydrate consumption (r=0.127, p=0.021). Subsequently, the change in depressed mood was positively associated with changes in carbohydrate (r=0.142, p=0.010) and alcohol (r=0.161, p=0.037) consumption, and the change in psychological stress was positively associated with changes in carbohydrates (r=0.183, p=0.001) and snack (r=0.151, p=0.008) consumption as well as sedentary time (r=0.158, p=0.004). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable medium-term impact on the lifestyle and mental health of patients with diabetes. Lifestyle changes were associated with glycemic and body weight control, and mental health changes were associated with lifestyle changes. These findings may provide important information on diabetes care during the pandemic.","Maruo, Irie, Obata, Takayama, Yamaguchi, Kosugi, Hazama, Yasuda","https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.8010-21","20211122","COVID-19; diabetes; lifestyle; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22579,""
"SHORT-COMMUNICATION-Lesson learnt during COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan","The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a major health crisis affecting the several nations. In particular, the high ratio of COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan is significantly deteriorating human mental as well as physical health. The huge mental and physical loss has taught several lessons, which have been retrieved from already existing literature. The latest researches were consulted to identify the challenges and solution to combat COVID-19. First of all, the pharmacy communities in Pakistan are not sufficient to handle the burden of COVID-19 due to economic issues. However, the Government should provide interest-free loans to students and researchers for conducting scholarly work for manufacturing advance medication to combat against COVID-19. Secondly, the drugs that have been used to control the spread of COVID-19, found to be associated with the development of a neuropsychiatric complication. Therefore, there is a dire need to develop more mental health services to control the medication side effects. Thirdly as the traditional mental health services are not sufficient to provide effective and advanced mental health services, therefore, transformative changes through community psychology are mandatory to implement. Lastly, as communicable disease limit the geographical access to avail mental health services. Therefore, the e-CBT approaches must be provided to mitigate the pre and post-pandemic effects. The findings of the study would provide the direction for preparing to combat communicable diseases in the future.","Rehman","https://www.google.com/search?q=SHORT-COMMUNICATION-Lesson+learnt+during+COVID-19+pandemic+in+Pakistan.","20211122","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22580,""
"Reported effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of emergency healthcare workers: A scoping review","While literature on psychological consequences among frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) flourishes, understanding the psychological burden on this group is particularly crucial, as their exposure to COVID-19 makes them especially at high risk. We explored what is known about psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency HCWs. We used a scoping review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. The search identified 5432 articles, from which a total of 21 were included in the final review. Anxiety, burnout, depression, inadequate sleep, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, distress/stress and secondary trauma, were all reportedly experienced by emergency HCWs. Anxiety, burnout, depression and stress levels were higher among physicians and nurses compared to others. Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were higher among reserve medics, while Red Cross volunteers developed similar reactions of psychological stress and secondary trauma to other healthcare workers. Male HCWs reported more post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms than females, while stress was higher among females than male HCWs. Emergency HCWs providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic are at risk from specific psychological impacts, including anxiety, burnout, depression, inadequate sleep, PTSD symptoms, psychological distress/stress and secondary trauma, and stress TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Emergency healthcare workers are at direct risk of psychological impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alanazi, McKenna, Buck, Alharbi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.auec.2021.10.002","20211122","COVID-19; Emergency; Healthcare worker; Mental health; Psychological impact; Scoping review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22581,""
"Data science approaches to confronting the COVID-19 pandemic: a narrative review","During the COVID-19 pandemic, more than ever, data science has become a powerful weapon in combating an infectious disease epidemic and arguably any future infectious disease epidemic. Computer scientists, data scientists, physicists and mathematicians have joined public health professionals and virologists to confront the largest pandemic in the century by capitalizing on the large-scale 'big data' generated and harnessed for combating the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we review the newly born data science approaches to confronting COVID-19, including the estimation of epidemiological parameters, digital contact tracing, diagnosis, policy-making, resource allocation, risk assessment, mental health surveillance, social media analytics, drug repurposing and drug development. We compare the new approaches with conventional epidemiological studies, discuss lessons we learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight opportunities and challenges of data science approaches to confronting future infectious disease epidemics.

"The Psychological Impact of Coronavirus on University Students and its Socio-Economic Determinants in Malaysia","The objective of this article is to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) upon university students' anxiety level and to find the factors associated with the anxiety level in Malaysia. We collected data from 958 students from 16 different universities using an originally designed questionnaire. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale 7-item (GAD-7) was used to estimate the anxiety. Then we applied the ordered logit model to calculate the odds ratios (OR) and factors associated with the anxiety level. We find that 12.3% of students were normal, whereas 30.5% were experiencing mild anxiety, 31.1% moderate anxiety, and 26.1% severe anxiety. Surprisingly, only 37.2% of students were aware of mental health support that was provided by their universities. However, age above 20Ã‚Â years (OR = 1.30), ethnicity Chinese (OR = 1.72), having any other disease (OR = 2.0), decreased family income (OR = 1.71), more time spent on watching COVID-19-related news (OR = 1.52), and infected relative or friends (OR = 1.62) were risk factors for anxiety among students. We conclude that the government of Malaysia should monitor the mental health of the universities' students more closely and universities should open online mental health support clinics to avoid the adverse impacts of anxiety.","Irfan, Shahudin, Hooper, Akram, Abdul Ghani","https://doi.org/10.1177/00469580211056217","20211122","anxiety; protective factors; risk factors; socio-economic status; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22583,""
"Depression and Suicide Risk during the Covid-19 Pandemic in a Brazilian Public Health Psychosocial Addiction Care Center: A Preliminary Report","To evaluate the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on depressive symptoms and suicide risk among patients undergoing treatment in a Public Health Psychosocial Addiction Care Center (CAPS AD III) of Porto Alegre. Questions retrieved from the Coronavirus Health Impact Survey (CRISIS), translated into Brazilian Portuguese, were used to evaluate the perceptions and behaviors of 70 patients about the covid-19 pandemic. Validated Brazilian versions of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were used to evaluate the severity of depressive symptoms, suicide risk and anxiety symptoms. A multilogistic regression model was performed to evaluate predictors of suicide risk in the sample. Around 70% of patients reported moderate depressive symptoms, 30% severe depressive symptoms, 17% of patients reported suicide or death thoughts in more than half of the days and 10% reported it daily. History of alcohol use was identified as the main predictor of suicide risk in the logistic regression model (OR 13.0, p = 0.03). Individuals with history of alcohol consumption presented with significantly higher suicide risk scores in a psychosocial public health care center in Brazil during covid-19 pandemic. This result can be important to devise better strategies and interventions to support this specific population profile.","de Moura, Rockenbach, Mendes, Mendes, Ghiggi, Diel, Martini, Camozzato, Scafuto, Mello, Kovalski, Mendes, Paz","https://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2021-0259","20211121","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22584,""
"Evaluation of serum total sialic acid in moderate COVID-19 patients with and without gastrointestinal tract manifestations","It is known that SARS-CoV-2 mostly infects the respiratory system causing pneumonia; although it can also affect the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), which covered with a bi-layer of mucus rich in glycosylated proteins that terminated by sialic acid. Therefore; this study aimed to evaluate serum total sialic acid (TSA) in moderate COVID-19 patients with and without GIT manifestations. A total of 161 moderate COVID-19 patients without and with GIT manifestations and 50 controls were enrolled into our study. Serum electrolytes levels were measured by using colorimetric or turbidmetric commercial assay kits, while the level of serum TSA was measured by using a commercial ELISA kit. Our results showed that serum TSA level was highly significantly increased in moderate COVID-19 patients with GIT manifestations (81.43Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.91) when compared with controls (61.24Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.41) or even moderate COVID-19 patients without GIT manifestations (69.46Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.03). ROC curve analysis showed that AUC for TSA is 0.84 with 76.2 % sensitivity and 73.7 % specificity in discrimination between moderate COVID-19 patients with and without GIT manifestations. Serum potassium and sodium levels were highly significantly decreased in moderate COVID-19 patients with GIT manifestations when compared with controls or even moderate COVID-19 patients without GIT manifestations; while serum calcium level was found to be significantly decreased in moderate COVID-19 patients with GIT manifestations when compared with controls. Finally, we can conclude that SA plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of GIT complications associated with COVID-19 and could be a potential biomarker for the COVID-19 gastrointestinal complications.","Haroun, Osman, Eessa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tice.2021.101679","20211121","COVID-19; Gastrointestinal tract; SARS-CoV-2 infection; Sialic acid","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22585,""
"COVID-19 Depression and Its Risk Factors in Asia Pacific - A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to synthesize the extant literature reporting the effects of COVID-19 pandemic based on the pooled prevalence of depression among affected populations in Asia Pacific, as well as its risk factors. A systematic review and meta-analysis approach was adopted as per the PRISMA guidelines, targeting articles published in PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus from January 2021 to March 30, 2021. The screening resulted in 82 papers. The overall pooled depression prevalence among 201,953 respondents was 34% (95%CI, 29-38, 99.7%), with no significant differences observed between the cohorts, timelines, and regions (p &gt; 0.05). Dominant risk factors found were fear of COVID-19 infection (13%), gender (i.e., females; 12%) and deterioration of underlying medical conditions (8.3%), regardless of the sub-groups. Specifically, fear of COVID-19 infection was the most reported risk factor among general population (k=14) and healthcare workers (kÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯8). Gender (k=7) and increased workload (k=7) were reported among healthcare workers whereas education disruption among students (k=7). The review is limited to articles published in three electronic databases. Conclusion The pandemic has caused depression among the populations across Asia Pacific, specifically among the general population, healthcare workers and students. Immediate attention and interventions from the concerned authorities are needed in addressing this issue.","Balakrishnan, Seong, Kaur, Govaichelvan, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.11.048","20211121","Asia Pacific; COVID-19; depression; meta-analysis; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22586,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on dental education- a scoping review","A new corona virus called COVID-19 and its epidemic has affected health care systems in many ways. There have also been significant changes in dental education. The present study summarizes the findings about dental education resulting from a scoping review of COVID-19 and dentistry. First, a comprehensive search of five databases (Google Scholar, Medline through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Central) was conducted with the keywords: COVID-19 and its equivalent terms, dentistry, education, oral, students, curriculum, and academics. Articles related to oral health and COVID-19 were searched. Then articles on the subject of dental education were screened and reviewed. Of the 1389 articles investigating COVID-19 and dentistry, 135 articles were related to dental education and its relationship with COVID-19. The most articles in this field were from the United States, India, and Saudi Arabia. Most of the articles were cross-sectional and then review articles. Based on the review the articles were divided into two main categories of changes and concerns, and opportunities and solutions. Moreover, the following themes were extracted: teaching-learning quality and methods, study career and how students are prepared, infection control policies, theses, exams and assessments, financial and economic security, students and staff's mental health, school's policies and curricula, knowledge of students and staff about COVID-19. Dental education now faces big challenges, some of which have never been experienced before. On the other hand, the epidemic has created opportunities for dental education as well. Most of these challenges and opportunities are the same around the world, and the findings of the present study can be a good help to overcome the challenges ahead as well as a good reference to find the right questions to be answered in future studies.","Farrokhi, Mohebbi, Farrokhi, Khami","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-03017-8","20211121","COVID-19; Corona virus; Dental education; Dentistry; Scoping review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22587,""

From direct interviews prior to (T1), and then in the same individuals after the pandemic onset (T2), we assessed the influence of personal psychiatric history on changes in symptoms and wellbeing. Two hundred and four (19-69 years/117 female) individuals from a multigenerational family study were followed clinically up to T1. Psychiatric symptom changes (T1-to-T2), their association with lifetime psychiatric history (no, only-past, and recent psychiatric history), and pandemic-specific worries were investigated. At T2 relative to T1, participants with recent psychopathology (in the last 2 years) had significantly fewer depressive (mean, M = 41.7 v. 47.6) and traumatic symptoms (M = 6.6 v. 8.1, p &lt; 0.001), while those with no and only-past psychiatric history had decreased wellbeing (M = 22.6 v. 25.0, p &lt; 0.01). Three pandemic-related worry factors were identified: Illness/death, Financial, and Social isolation. Individuals with recent psychiatric history had greater Illness/death and Financial worries than the no/only-past groups, but these worries were unrelated to depression at T2. Among individuals with no/only-past history, Illness/death worries predicted increased T2 depression [B = 0.6(0.3), p &lt; 0.05]. As recent psychiatric history was not associated with increased depression or anxiety during the pandemic, new groups of previously unaffected persons might contribute to the increased pandemic-related depression and anxiety rates reported. These individuals likely represent incident cases that are first detected in primary care and other non-specialty clinical settings. Such settings may be useful for monitoring future illness among newly at-risk individuals.","Murphy, Svob, Van Dijk, Gameroff, Skipper, Abraham, Yangchen, Posner, Shankman, Wickramaratne, Weissman, Talati","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291721004372","20211122","Pandemic; anxiety; depression; functioning; longitudinal; mental health; pre- vs post- pandemic symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-23","",22588,""
