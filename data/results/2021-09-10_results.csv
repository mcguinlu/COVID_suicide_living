"Factors Associated With a Negative Emotional Response to News Media and Nationwide Emergency Text Alerts During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Korea","To prevent the spread of infection in Korea during the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, real-time warnings have been sent to all residents via mobile phones. This study examined the factors associated with the negative emotional response to media news and emergency text alerts in the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey was completed by 1,500 adults from an online public panel in three regions. We used Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) to assess the level of depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. Questionnaires related to COVID-19 included fear of infection, and fear of disclose of contact-tracing information. The negative emotional response on both news media information and emergency alert text messages about COVID-19 was associated with fear of COVID-19 infection and high anxiety. The biggest outbreak city, Daegu was associated with the less negative emotional response on emergency alert text messages. Fear of disclose of contact-tracing information was significantly associated with negative emotional perception on emergency alter text messages. Our results suggest that effective information providing services with considering vulnerable groups are needed to promote acceptance and eliminate negative emotion for disease related information.","Lee, Kim, Jhon, Kim, Ryu, Kim, Kim","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2021.0087","20210909","Anxiety; COVID-19; Emergency text alarm; Media coverage; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","",17805,""
"Opioid-related deaths before and after COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in Los Angeles County","Opioid-related morbidity and mortality has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, yet specific information about the communities most affected remains unknown. Our objective is to evaluate decedent-level associations with an opioid-related death following the implementation of stay-at-home orders in Los Angeles County. This retrospective cohort study used data from the L.A. County Medical Examiner-Coroner to identify opioid-related deaths in 2019 and 2020. We used logistic regression to analyze the change in opioid-related deaths following a 30-day washout period after the start of stay-at-home orders. Independent variables included decedent age, gender, race and ethnicity, heroin or fentanyl present at the time of death, census tract-level education, and a scheduled drug prescription in the year before death. Opioid-related deaths in L.A. County are most common in census tracts where a small percentage of the population has a Bachelor's degree. Following stay-at-home orders, Non-Hispanic Caucasian individuals had significantly more opioid-related deaths than Hispanic individuals (risk ratio (RR): 1.82 [95 % CI, 1.10-3.02]; P &lt; 0.05) after adjusting for age, gender, and heroin or fentanyl use. Racial and ethnic differences in mortality were not explained by census tract-level education or recent scheduled drug prescriptions. There has been an alarming rise in opioid-related deaths in L.A. County during 2020. The increase in opioid-related overdose deaths following the onset of COVID-19 and related policies occurred most often among Non-Hispanic Caucasian individuals. Further research on this trend's underlying cause is needed to inform policy recommendations during these simultaneous public health crises.","Kelley, Lucas, Stewart, Goldman, Doctor","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109028","20210909","COVID-19; Fentanyl; Heroin; Mortality; Opioid overdose","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","",17806,""
"Risks, characteristics, and control strategies of disinfection-residual-bacteria (DRB) from the perspective of microbial community structure","The epidemic of COVID-19 has aroused people's particular attention to biosafety. A growing number of disinfection products have been consumed during this period. However, the flaw of disinfection has not received enough attention, especially in water treatment processes. While cutting down the quantity of microorganisms, disinfection processes exert a considerable selection effect on bacteria and thus reshape the microbial community structure to a great extent, causing the problem of disinfection-residual-bacteria (DRB). These systematic and profound changes could lead to the shift in regrowth potential, bio fouling potential, as well as antibiotic resistance level and might cause a series of potential risks. In this review, we collected and summarized the data from the literature in recent 10 years about the microbial community structure shifting of natural water or wastewater in full-scale treatment plants caused by disinfection. Based on these data, typical DRB with the most reporting frequency after disinfection by chlorine-containing disinfectants, ozone disinfection, and ultraviolet disinfection were identified and summarized, which were the bacteria with a relative abundance of over 5% in the residual bacteria community and the bacteria with an increasing rate of relative abundance over 100% after disinfection. Furthermore, the phylogenic relationship and potential risks of these typical DRB were also analyzed. Twelve out of fifteen typical DRB genera contain pathogenic strains, and many were reported of great secretion ability. Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter possess multiple disinfection resistance and could be considered as model bacteria in future studies of disinfection. We also discussed the growth, secretion, and antibiotic resistance characteristics of DRB, as well as possible control strategies. The DRB phenomenon is not limited to water treatment but also exists in the air and solid disinfection processes, which need more attention and more profound research, especially in the period of COVID-19.","Wang, Wu, Luo, Yu, Xu, Xue, Chen, Ni, Peng, Chen, Wang, Tong, Bai, Xu, Hu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.117606","20210909","Disinfection; Disinfection-residual-bacteria (DRB); Microbial community; Microbial risk; Resistance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","",17807,""
"Effect of a Telecare Case Management Program for Older Adults Who Are Homebound During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial","Older adults who are homebound can be difficult to reach owing to their functional limitations and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving their health needs unrecognized at an earlier stage. To determine the effectiveness of a telecare case management program for older adults who are homebound during the COVID-19 pandemic. This randomized clinical trial was conducted among 68 older adults in Hong Kong from May 21 to July 20, 2020, with a last follow-up date of October 20, 2020. Inclusion criteria were being 60 years or older, owning a smartphone, and going outside less than once a week in the previous 6 months. Participants in the telecare group received weekly case management from a nurse supported by a social service team via telephone call and weekly video messages covering self-care topics delivered via smartphone for 3 months. Participants in the control group received monthly social telephone calls. The primary outcome was the change in general self-efficacy from before the intervention to after the intervention at 3 months. Self-efficacy was measured by the Chinese version of the 10-item, 4-point General Self-efficacy Scale, with higher scores representing higher self-efficacy levels. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. A total of 68 participants who fulfilled the criteria were enrolled (34 in the control group and 34 in the intervention group; 56 [82.4%] were women; and mean [SD] age, 71.8 [6.1] years). At 3 months, there was no statistical difference in self-efficacy between the telecare group and the control group. Scores for self-efficacy improved in both groups (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.68; 95% CI, -0.68 to 4.03; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.16). No significant differences were found in basic and instrumental activities of daily living, depression, and use of health care services. However, the telecare group showed statistically significant interactions of group and time effects on medication adherence (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-8.30; 95% CI, -13.14 to -3.47; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and quality of life (physical component score: ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.99; 95% CI, 0.29-9.69; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.04). In this randomized clinical trial, participants who received the telecare program were statistically no different from the control group with respect to changes in self-efficacy, although scores in both groups improved. After the intervention, the telecare group had better medication adherence and quality of life than the control group, although the small sample size may limit generalizability. A large-scale study is needed to confirm these results.

"Clinical Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Mexican Patients with Thoracic Malignancies","Accumulated evidence indicates that patients with lung cancer are a vulnerable population throughout the pandemic. Limited information is available in Latin America regarding the impact of the pandemic on medical care. The goal of this study was to describe the clinical and social effect of COVID-19 on patients with thoracic cancer and to ascertain outcomes in those with a confirmed diagnosis. This cohort study included patients with thoracic neoplasms within a single institution between March 1, 2020, and February 28, 2021. All variables of interest were extracted from electronic medical records. During this period, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-2) was applied to evaluate and identify more common psychological disorders. The mean age for the total cohort (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°548) was 61.5Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°years; non-small cell lung cancer was the most frequent neoplasm (86.9%), advanced stages predominated (80%), and most patients were under active therapy (82.8%). Any change in treatment was reported in 23.9% of patients, of which 78.6% were due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Treatment delays (Ã¢â€°Â¥7Ã¢â‚¬â€°days) were the most frequent modifications in 41.9% of cases, followed by treatment suspension at 37.4%. Patients without treatment changes had a more prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.21, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001 and HR 0.28, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001, respectively). The mean DASS-21 score was 10.45 in 144 evaluated patients, with women being more affected than men (11.41 vs. 9.08, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). Anxiety was reported in 30.5% of cases, followed by depression and distress in equal proportions (18%). Depressed and stressed patients had higher odds of experiencing delays in treatment than patients without depression (odds ratio [OR] 4.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53-13.23, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .006 and OR 3.18, 95% CI 1.2-10.06, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .006, respectively). Treatment adjustments in patients with thoracic malignancies often occurred to avoid COVID-19 contagion with detrimental effects on survival. Psychological disorders could have a role in adherence to the original treatment regimen. The pandemic has placed an enormous strain on health care systems globally. Patients with thoracic cancers represent a vulnerable population, with increased morbidity and mortality rates. In Mexico, treatment modifications were common during the pandemic, and those who experienced delays had worse survival outcomes. Most treatment modifications were related to a patient decision rather than a lockdown of health care facilities in which mental health impairment plays an essential role. Moreover, the high case fatality rate highlights the importance of improving medical care access. Likewise, to develop strategies facing future threats that may compromise health care systems in non-developed countries.","Arrieta, Lara-MejÃƒÂ­a, Bautista-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Heredia, Turcott, BarrÃƒÂ³n, Ramos-RamÃƒÂ­rez, Cabrera-Miranda, Salinas Padilla, Aguerrebere, Cardona, Rolfo, Arroyo-HernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Soto-PÃƒÂ©rez-de-Celis, BaÃƒÂ©z-SaldaÃƒÂ±a","https://doi.org/10.1002/onco.13962","20210909","Coronavirus disease 2019; Lung cancer; Pandemic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Thoracic neoplasms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","",17809,""
"Perceived Risk and Associated Shielding Behaviors in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis During the Coronavirus 2019 Pandemic","To investigate the perceived risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and outcomes as well as shielding practices among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We surveyed participants with RA in a large health care system between July 16 and November 8, 2020. Participants reported RA treatment, COVID-19 risk perception, and shielding practices (eg, masks, social distancing, and quarantining). We examined the association of demographic and disease-specific factors with risk perception and the association of risk perception with shielding practices. Of 494 participants, 195 (40%), 169 (34%), and 130 (26%) strongly agreed, agreed, or were uncertain/disagreed that their RA put them at higher risk for COVID-19 or poor outcomes, respectively. Younger age (odds ratio [OR]: 0.98), having a comorbidity (OR: 1.60), and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) use (OR: 1.75) were independently associated with a higher perceived risk. Among those who strongly agreed, agreed, or were uncertain/disagreed that they had greater risk, 165 (85%), 118 (70%), and 69 (53%), respectively, practiced all three shielding measures (P &lt; 0.0001). Those who strongly agreed or agreed that they were at higher risk were more likely to use all three shielding practices (OR: 4.16 and 1.97, respectively). bDMARD use and glucocorticoid use were associated with using all three shielding measures (OR: 1.99 and 1.81, respectively). Perception of COVID-19 risk among patients with RA varies substantially. Factors associated with perceived risk are different from those found to be associated with worse outcomes in observational studies. Greater perceived risk is associated with more strict shielding, which has implications for patient education and mental health.","Cook, Cox, Fu, Zhang, Stone, Choi, Wallace","https://doi.org/10.1002/acr2.11340","20210909","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","",17810,""

"Impacts on and Care of Psychiatric Patients during the Outbreak of COVID-19","The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in December 2019 has led to massive lifestyle, economic, and health changes. The COVID-19 pandemic has had broad impacts on psychiatric patients, exacerbating symptoms such as psychosis, depression, and suicidal ideation. Therefore, we aimed to review the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on psychiatric patients and mental healthcare staff and provide practical guidance for medical staff and authorities. The main findings of this review included the impacts of COVID-19 on psychiatric patients and mental health professionals as well as the transformation of mental health care. Greater consideration should be given to the care of patients with psychosis and depression because of their lack of self-care ability, neurocognitive impairment, and impaired immune function. Depressive symptoms can be exacerbated due to several factors, such as economic crises, social isolation, and limited physical activity. Unemployment and financial problems can lead to an increased suicide rate. Consequently, mental healthcare workers' workload can increase, which could lead to burnout and psychological symptoms such as insomnia, depression, and anxiety. A transformation of psychiatric care is needed during the time of the pandemic. While emergency care should be maintained, outpatient care should be limited to decrease viral spread. Shifting care to telemedicine and community-based psychiatry can be helpful. Inpatient services should be adapted by tightening admission criteria, shortening the length of hospital stays, suspending some group activities, limiting visitors, and preparing for quarantine if necessary. Mental healthcare workers can be supported with telecommunication, appropriate work shifts, alternative accommodations, and good communication between the team leader and staff.","Puangsri, Jinanarong, Wattanapisit","https://doi.org/10.2174/1745017902117010052","20210909","COVID-19; Case management; Mental disorders; Mental health services; Patient care; Psychological stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","",17814,""
"The Mediating Role of Loneliness Between Social Support and Depressive Symptoms Among Chinese Rural Adolescents During COVID-19 Outbreak: A Comparative Study Between Left-Behind and Non-left-behind Students","<b>Introduction:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted people's life across the globe. In a public health crisis, rural adolescents are more prone to mental health problems. The current study aimed to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms among Chinese rural adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak, and examine the association between perceived social support and depressive symptoms and its underlying mechanisms. <b>Method:</b> Perceived Social Support Scale, UCLA Loneliness Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were administrated to 826 rural adolescents from Anhui Province, China, amid the COVID-19 crisis. Mackinnon's four-step procedure was employed to examine the mediating effect, while Hayes PROCESS macro was utilized to test the moderated mediation model. <b>Results:</b> The results showed the rate of depressive symptoms among rural adolescents in China was 77.6% during the outbreak of COVID-19. Female left-behind students and non-left-behind students from disrupted families experienced more depressive symptoms (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Loneliness mediated the association between perceive social support and depressive symptoms and the indirect effect was stronger in left-behind adolescents in comparison to non-left-behind adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Conclusion:</b> Depressive symptoms are extremely prevalent among Chinese rural adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak, and perceived social support plays a protective role against depressive symptoms. Chinese rural adolescents, especially left-behind students, could benefit from the interventions aimed at enhancing the perceived social support and reducing loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hou, Xie, Mao, Liu, Zhang, Wen, Chen, Luo, Cai","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.740094","20210909","COVID-19; depression; left-behind students; loneliness; non-left-behind students; perceived social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","",17815,""
"Common Mental Disorders Among Informal Primary Caregivers of Adults With Mental Illness During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic in Eastern Ethiopia: A Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Background:</b> Coronaviruses (CoVs) are emerging respiratory viruses and cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Informal primary caregivers of individuals with mental illness were special populations suffering from both the burden of caring for mentally ill individuals and the danger of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) epidemic. <b>Objective:</b> The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of common mental disorders (CMDs) among the informal primary caregivers of adults with mental illness during the Covid-19 epidemic. <b>Methods:</b> A hospital-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from July 1 to 30, 2020. A systematic random sampling technique was used to get samples of informal primary caregivers. Data were analyzed by bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. In the final model, variables having a <i>p</i>-value &lt; 0.05 were declared as associated with CMDs. <b>Result:</b> Out of a total of 218 informal primary caregivers, 215 responded to this study. The prevalence of CMDs was 40.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 36.66, 44.3%] among informal primary caregivers. Being female informal primary caregivers [adjusted odds ratios (AOR) 1.98, 95% CI = 1.05, 3.76], being student informal primary caregivers (AOR 5.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 28.4), caring patients with psychosis (AOR 3.33, 95% CI: 1.12, 9.92) and caring patients with bipolar disorder (AOR 3.12, 95% CI: 1.35, 7.23) were significantly associated with CMDs. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study cannot show the causal relationship due to its cross-sectional study design nature. However, this study showed relatively higher prevalence of CMDs among informal primary caregivers of adults with any mental illness during the Covid-19 epidemics relative to pre-Covid-19 times. Being a female caregiver, being a student caregiver, and caring for adults with psychosis and bipolar disorder were factors associated with CMDs.

"SafePsych: improving patient safety by delivering high-impact simulation training on rare and complex scenarios in psychiatry","Despite an evidence base demonstrating simulation to be an effective medical education tool, it is not commonly used in postgraduate psychiatry training as it is in other medical specialties. This paper outlines the development and effectiveness of a hybrid-virtual simulation-based workshop designed to improve patient care by improving clinical skills of non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) in detecting and managing rare and complex psychiatric emergencies. Three clinical vignettes based on near-miss psychiatric cases were developed by a multidisciplinary team of physicians and nurses in psychiatry and experts in simulation-based medical education. The workshop, 'SafePsych' was delivered in a simulation laboratory while and broadcast via Zoom video-conferencing platform to observers. Debriefing followed each clinical scenario. Participants completed preworkshop and postworkshop questionnaires to evaluate clinical knowledge. The workshop was attended by consultants (n=12) and NCHDs in psychiatry and emergency medicine (n=19), and psychiatric nurses (n=5). In the psychiatry NCHD group, test scores significantly improved following the workshop (p&lt;0.001). There were significant improvements in the test scores with a mean difference of 2.56 (SD 1.58, p&lt;0.001). Feedback from participants and observers was positive, with constructive appraisals to improve the virtual element of the workshop. Simulation-based training is effective in teaching high risk, rare complex psychiatric cases to psychiatry NCHDs. Further exploration of the learning needs of nursing staff is required. Future workshop delivery is feasible in the COVID-19 environment and beyond, using a virtual element to meet social distancing requirements while enhancing the reach of the training.","Tong, McMahon, Reid-McDermott, Byrne, Doherty","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2021-001533","20210909","medical education; mental health; near miss; patient safety; simulation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","",17817,""
"Impact on Mental, Physical and Cognitive functioning of a Critical care sTay during the COVID-19 pandemic (IMPACCT COVID-19): protocol for a prospective, multicentre, mixed-methods cohort study","The ongoing pandemic could affect the duration, variety and severity of the mental, physical, and cognitive impairments intensive care unit (ICU) survivors and their families frequently present. We aim to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental, physical, and cognitive health of survivors, the experience of their families and their treating healthcare professionals. Prospective, multicentre, mixed-methods cohort study in seven Chilean ICUs. 450 adults, able to walk independently prior to admission, in ICU and mechanical ventilation &gt;48Ã¢â‚¬â€°hours with and without COVID-19. Clinical Frailty Scale, Charlson comorbidity index, mobility (Functional Status Score for the Status Score for the Intensive Care Unit) and muscle strength (Medical Research Council Sum Score) will be assessed at ICU discharge. Cognitive functioning (Montreal Cognitive Assessment-blind), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), post-traumatic stress (Impact of Event Scale-Revised) symptoms, disability (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0), quality of life (European Quality of Life Health Questionnaire), employment and survival will be assessed at ICU discharge, 3 months and 6 months. A sample will be assessed using actigraphy and the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire at 6 months after ICU discharge. Trajectories of mental, physical, and cognitive impairments will be estimated using multilevel longitudinal modelling. A sensitivity analysis using multiple imputations will be performed to account for missing data and loss-to-follow-up. Survival will be analysed using Kaplan-Meier curves. The perceptions of family members regarding the ICU stay and the later recovery will be explored 3 months after discharge. Healthcare professionals will be invited to discuss the challenges faced during the pandemic using semistructured interviews. Interviews will be thematically analysed by two independent coders to identify the main themes of the experience of family members and healthcare professionals. The study was approved by the Clinica Alemana Universidad del Desarrollo Ethics Committee (2020-78) and each participating site.

"Machine-learning-based COVID-19 mortality prediction model and identification of patients at low and high risk of dying","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-Cov2 virus has become the greatest health and controversial issue for worldwide nations. It is associated with different clinical manifestations and a high mortality rate. Predicting mortality and identifying outcome predictors are crucial for COVID patients who are critically ill. Multivariate and machine learning methods may be used for developing prediction models and reduce the complexity of clinical phenotypes. Multivariate predictive analysis was applied to 108 out of 250 clinical features, comorbidities, and blood markers captured at the admission time from a hospitalized cohort of patients (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°250) with COVID-19. Inspired modification of partial least square (SIMPLS)-based model was developed to predict hospital mortality. Prediction accuracy was randomly assigned toÃ‚Â training and validation sets. Predictive partition analysis was performed to obtain cutting value for either continuous or categorical variables. Latent class analysis (LCA) was carried to cluster the patients with COVID-19 to identify low- and high-risk patients. Principal component analysis and LCA were used to find a subgroup of survivors that tends to die. SIMPLS-based model was able to predict hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 with moderate predictive power (Q<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.24) and high accuracy (AUCÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.85) through separating non-survivors from survivors developed using training and validation sets. This model was obtained by the 18 clinical and comorbidities predictors and 3 blood biochemical markers. Coronary artery disease, diabetes, Altered Mental Status, ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°65, and dementia were the topmost differentiating mortality predictors. CRP, prothrombin, and lactate were the most differentiating biochemical markers in the mortality prediction model. Clustering analysis identified high- and low-risk patients among COVID-19 survivors. An accurate COVID-19 mortality prediction model among hospitalized patients based on the clinical features and comorbidities may play a beneficial role in the clinical setting to better management of patients with COVID-19. The current study revealed the application of machine-learning-based approaches to predict hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 and identification of most important predictors from clinical, comorbidities and blood biochemical variables as well asÃ‚Â recognizing high- and low-risk COVID-19 survivors.","Banoei, Dinparastisaleh, Zadeh, Mirsaeidi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-021-03749-5","20210909","COVID-19; Machine learning; Mortality; Prediction model; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","",17820,""
"Risk and protective factors of depression in the general population during the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea","The risk of depression has risen in the general population during the COVID-19 epidemic. This study was conducted to explore risk and protective factors associated with depression among the general population uninfected by COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 1,500 representative South Korean citizens aged 19-65 years through an anonymous online survey. Depression was defined as a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score of 10 or higher. Other questionnaires included one measuring psycho-behavioural and social changes, and stress, due to COVID-19, a six-item version of the Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6), and a three-item version of the UCLA loneliness scale. Of the 1492 participants not infected by COVID-19, 312 (20.9%) exhibited depression. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that depression was positively associated with COVID-19-related stress and psycho-behavioural variables such as disturbances in eating and sleeping, younger age, smoking, underlying mental illness, and loneliness scale scores. In contrast, exercise three or more times per week and GQ-6 scale scores were inversely associated with depression. During the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining daily routines including eating, sleeping, and regular exercise and focusing on gratitude may be important for the prevention of depression. In addition, more attention should be paid to vulnerable populations, including young people, those with mental illnesses, and smokers, who might be more susceptible to depression.","Kim, Park, Kim, Park, Jhon, Kim, Kang, Ryu, Lee, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03449-y","20210909","COVID-19; Depression; exercise; gratitude; loneliness; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","",17821,""
"A qualitative analysis of third-year medical students' reflection essays regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their education","The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed every aspect of healthcare delivery and training. Few studies have reported on the impact of these changes on the experiences, skill development, and career expectations of medical students. Using 59 responses to a short reflection essay prompt, 3rd year medical students in Philadelphia described how the COVID-19 pandemic affected their education in mid-2020. Using conventional content analysis, six main themes were identified across 14 codes. Students reported concerns regarding their decreased clinical skill training and specialty exposure on their career development due to the loss of in-person experience during their family medicine clerkship. A small number felt very let down and exploited by the continued high cost of tuition while missing clinical interactions. However, many students also expressed professional pride and derived meaning from limited patient and mentorship opportunities. Many students developed a new sense of purpose and a call to become stronger public health and patient advocates. The medical field will need to adapt to support medical students adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, from an educational and mental health standpoint. However, there are encouraging signs that this may also galvanize many students to engage in leadership roles in their communities, to become more empathetic and thoughtful physicians, and to redesign healthcare in the future to better meet the needs of their most vulnerable patients.","Kelly, Casola, Smith, Kelly, de la Cruz","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02906-2","20210909","COVID-19; Clinical training; Undergraduate medical education; Workforce development","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","",17822,""
"Breastfeeding Experiences During the COVID-19 Lockdown in the United Kingdom: An Exploratory Study Into Maternal Opinions and Emotional States","The COVID-19 pandemic has hugely impacted upon people's psychological and physical wellbeing; however, the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on mothers of young children, with particular regard to breastfeeding, are unknown. To explore: (1) Sources of advice and support available to breastfeeding mothers during and prior to the COVID-19 lockdown; (2) Mothers' opinions on statements and recommendations made by the World Health Organization on the importance of breastfeeding and breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic; (3) Maternal emotional states (i.e., anxiety and depression symptoms) experienced by breastfeeding mothers during the COVID-19 lockdown; and (4) influence of breastfeeding duration and number of children on breastfeeding opinions and emotional states. Mothers of children aged 0-36 months (<i>N</i> = 4018) took part in an online survey. The survey included demographic questions, as well as the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire and the Patient Health Questionnaire. Mothers were further probed on opinions regarding breastfeeding practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants strongly agreed with the importance of breastfeeding, even if a mother showed symptoms of COVID-19. Differences in opinions on breastfeeding practices (e.g., the use of donor human milk and relactation), were found between participants in relation to breastfeeding duration and number of children. Participants with more than one child showed higher negative emotional states, namely anxiety symptoms. Except for Internet usage, participants indicated a decline in all sources of advice and support for breastfeeding during the COVID-19 lockdown. Health bodies and professionals should consider maternal viewpoints and opinions regarding breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions are urgently needed in order to support breastfeeding mothers and prevent the development of mental health issues.","Costantini, Joyce, Britez","https://doi.org/10.1177/08903344211026565","20210909","COVID-19; COVID-19 lockdown; COVID-19 pandemic; breastfeeding; breastfeeding experience; breastfeeding support; maternal psychology; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","",17823,""
"COVID-19 Health Crisis and Chronic Illness: Protocol for a Qualitative Study","The acute nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on health resources that are usually dedicated to chronic illnesses. Resulting changes in care practices and networks have had major repercussions on the experience of people with chronic disorders. This paper presents the protocol of the Parcours, Associations, RÃƒÂ©seau, ChronicitÃƒÂ©, Organisation, Usagers, Retour d'expÃƒÂ©rience, Soins (PARCOURS)-COVID study. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of reorganization of the health system on the usual care network of patients with chronic illness, which fosters and qualifies the quality and continuum of care provided. The first objective of this study is to document these patients' experiences through transformations and adaptations of their network, both in the practical dimension (ie, daily life and care) and subjective dimension (ie, psychosocial experience of illness and relationship to the health system). The second objective of the study is to understand and acknowledge these reorganizations during the COVID-19 lockdown and postlockdown periods. The third objective is to produce better adapted recommendations for patients with chronic illness and value their experience for the management of future health crisis. The PARCOURS-COVID study is a qualitative and participatory research involving patient organizations as research partners and members of these organizations as part of the research team. Three group of chronic diseases have been selected regarding the specificities of the care network they mobilize: (1) cystic fibrosis and kidney disease, (2) hemophilia, and (3) mental health disorders. Four consecutive phases will be conducted, including (1) preparatory interviews with medical or associative actors of each pathology field; (2) in-depth individual interviews with patients of each pathology, analyzed using the qualitative method of thematic analysis; (3) results of both these phases will then be triangulated through interviews with members of each patient's care ecosystem; and finally, (4) focus groups will be organized to discuss the results with research participants (ie, representatives of chronic disease associations; patients; and actors of the medical, psychosocial, and family care network) in a research-action framework. The protocol study has undergone a peer review by the French National Research Agency's scientific committee and has been approved by the research ethical committee of the University of Paris (registration number: IRB 00012020-59, June 28, 2020). The project received funding from August 2020 through April 2021. Expected results will be disseminated in 2021 and 2022. Our findings will better inform the stakes of the current health crisis on the management of patients with chronic illness and, more broadly, any future crisis for a population deemed to be at risk. They will also improve health democracy by supporting better transferability of knowledge between the scientific and citizen communities.

"Predictors of online compulsive buying: The role of personality and mindfulness","Background Online shopping has been steadily growing in popularity, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of the current study was to investigate both the roles of a personality model validated in substance-related disorders and mindfulness in online compulsive buying (CB). Methods A total of 534 individuals from university (nÂ =Â 334) and online communities (nÂ =Â 200) completed the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale (i.e., Hopelessness, Anxiety Sensitivity, Impulsivity, and Sensation Seeking), the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire and the Bergen Shopping Addiction Scale. Results Analyses indicated that higher impulsivity, higher anxiety sensitivity and lower nonreactivity and awareness mindfulness scores predicted online CB. In addition, lower nonreactivity and awareness were found to partially mediate the relationship between high impulsivity and online CB. Specifically, lower awareness accounted for 30.77% of this relationship and lower nonreactivity accounted for 7.93% of the relationship between impulsivity and CB. These findings offer support for the conceptualization of CB as a behavioural addiction and suggest that mindfulness interventions may be useful in the context of reducing online CB.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111237","20220201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","",17825,""
"Preparation of a composite coating film via vapor induced phase separation for air purification and real-time bacteria photocatalytic inactivation","Infectious diseases resulted from transmitting of bacteria or virus like COVID-19 via air-borne droplets have brought severe threat to human beings worldwide. Cutting the spreading paths to obtain clean air is one of the promising strategies to prevent people from such dangerous diseases. In this work, we have employed a strategy of spray coating in combination with vapor induced phase separation to prepare a composite coating film to fulfill that purpose. A stable mixture suspension containing micelles of block copolymer of poly(styrene-block-butadiene-block-styrene) and TiO2 nanoparticles was sprayed onto stainless steel mesh to evaporate solvent in non-solvent vapor atmospheres. A water vapor atmosphere and an ethanol vapor atmosphere were in turn employed to improve the mechanical strength of the obtained coating film. The porous microstructure, the porosity, and the superhydrophobicity of the coating film were carefully characterized and analyzed. The air pressure-drop of the coating film was determined to be lower than 100Â Pa, indicating a high air permeability. Moreover, a foggy air containing E. coli was pressed through the coating film via a home-made apparatus to simulate the air purification system, where E. coli contained air-borne droplets were intercepted by the film matrix in a physical manner, and the bacteria was photocatalytically inactivated at the meantime. A filtration efficiency of 99.7% and a 99.6% efficiency of real-time photocatalytic inactivation of E. coli demonstrate the promising potential of the coating film.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.porgcoat.2021.106486","20211201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","",17826,""
"Parent-for-child mask behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada and the United States: An investigation of attitudes, norms, and perceived control using the theory of planned behavior","Face masks continue to be a necessity until a large proportion of the population, including children, receive immunizations for COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between parental attitudes and beliefs about masks and parent-for-child mask behavior using the Theory of Planned Behavior. We administered a survey in August 2020 to parents of school-aged children residing in the United States and Canada. Measures included sociodemographic variables for the parent and child, attitudes, norms, perceived control over childrenâ€™s mask use, intentions and enforcement of mask wearing among children (also titled â€œparent-for-child mask behaviorâ€). Data were analyzed using structural equation modelling. We collected data from 866 parents and 43.5% had children with pre-existing conditions (e.g., allergies, anxiety, impulsivity, skin sensitivity, asthma) that made extended mask wearing difficult, as per parentâ€™s report. Among the full sample, negative attitudes (ÃŸ = -0.20, p = .006), norms (ÃŸ = 0.41, p = .002), and perceived control (ÃŸ = 0.33, p = .006) predicted intentions. Norms (ÃŸ = 0.50, p = .004) and intentions (ÃŸ = 0.28, p = .003) also predicted parent-for-child mask use, while attitudes and perceived control did not. Intentions mediated the associations between attitudes, norms, perceived control, respectively, and mask behavior. Subgroup analyses revealed intentions as the key predictor of parent-for-child mask use among children with pre-conditions and norms as the key predictor among children without pre-conditions (i.e. healthy). Future public health messaging should target parental intentions, attitudes, norms, and perceived control about childrenâ€™s masks wearing.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101533","20211201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","",17827,""
"How do students perceive face-to-face/blended learning as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic?","The impact of Covid-19 has had a far reaching effect on higher education institutions. However, few studies report on the relative perceptions of students about face-to-face (F2F) and blended learning (BL) in periods when Covid-19 is/not a consideration. Using a sample of 103/79 undergraduate students, a mixed-method approach is utilized to report qualitative and quantitative evidence regarding student perceptions. The results demonstrate BL is perceived more positively during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, F2F is preferred to BL when Covid is not an issue. F2F learning is perceived more positively to BL because students feel that there are limitations to BL in terms of; interactions with the lecturer; group work; peer engagement; class involvement; and the ability to ask questions about technical information. Moreover, qualitative evidence shows that students perceive F2F to be superior to BL because social elements expected in a F2F environment may not be embedded into netiquette frameworks. From a policymaking standpoint, we encourage embedding social elements into BL to enhance student experience so that student's negative attitudes regarding the transition from F2F delivery to online/BL can be minimized. From a practical standpoint, we provide insights about strategies to embed socials elements into netiquette frameworks.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijme.2021.100552","20211101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-10","",17828,""
