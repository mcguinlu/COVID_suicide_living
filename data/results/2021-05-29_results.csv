"Fear, Anxiety, Stress, and Depression of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic among patients and their healthcare workers","Background Disease pandemics are known to cause psychological distress. The ensuing mental health issues are not only restricted to the patients and their relatives/friends but affect the healthcare workers (HCWs) as well. Our study aims to assess these psychological trends during the COVID-19 pandemic between the two most affected population groups, that is, patients and frontline healthcare workers. Methods A survey questionnaire including scales to assess fear, anxiety, stress, depression - PSS 10, and DASS 21 was distributed and sent to all COVID-19 suspected/confirmed individuals and healthcare workers at a tertiary care center along with a second visit after 14 days of answering the first questionnaire and this continued as follow up. Data were analyzed with the SPSS Version 23 using various tests of significance. Results In the community, COVID-19 patients in the age group 41-50 with respiratory tract symptoms and those who were home isolated/quarantined experienced a greater tendency of mental health problems. Healthcare workers posted in COVID-19 designated areas of the hospital displayed higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Conclusion The high degree of uncertainty associated with novel pathogens has a profound effect on the psychological state of suspected/confirmed cases as well as healthcare workers. Within the community, individuals suspected of having COVID-19 display a significant mental health burden, while HCWs also experience an unprecedented amount of stress during such enduring situations.","Ashwin Parchani; K Vidhya; Prasan Kumar Panda; Vikram Singh Rawat; Yogesh Arvind Bahurupi; Deepjyoti Kalita; Harsh Kumar; Naveen Dr","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.28.21258006","20210528","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14127,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health, wellbeing, and access to services of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities","Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) may be especially vulnerable to changes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic given an increased likelihood of health concerns, low socioeconomic status, and difficulty accessing services. The purpose of this study was to explore mental health problems and services in individuals with IDD during the pandemic. We explored whether number of mental health problems differed by disability, age, gender, living situation, physical health, and access to services. An online survey about experiences during the pandemic was administered to adults with IDD and their caregivers in the United States and in Chile. In both Chile and the United States, few people endorsed increased health problems. Half of the sample in Chile and 41 % of the sample in the United States endorsed increased mental health problems. Approximately 15 % of the sample in the US reported no longer receiving state developmental disability services. Healthcare and disability-specific agencies should consider strategies to tailor supports to improve mental health functioning and access to community.","Rosencrans, Arango, Sabat, Buck, Brown, Tenorio, Witwer","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103985","20210528","COVID-19; Healthcare; Intellectual and developmental disabilities; Mental health; Physical health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14128,""

"Characteristics and correlates of US clinicians prescribing buprenorphine for opioid use disorder treatment using expanded authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic","To determine how clinicians with a DATA waiver to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (OUD) adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic to emergency authorities, including use of telehealth to prescribe buprenorphine, the challenges faced by clinicians, and strategies employed by them to manage patients with OUD. From June 23, 2020 to August 19, 2020, we conducted an electronic survey of U.S. DATA-waivered clinicians. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used for analysis. Among 10,238 respondents, 68 % were physicians, 25 % nursing-related providers, and 6% physician assistants; 28 % reported never prescribing or not prescribing in the 12 months prior to the survey. Among the 72 % of clinicians who reported past 12-month buprenorphine prescribing (i.e. active practitioners during the pandemic) 30 % reported their practice setting closed to in-person visits during COVID-19; 33 % reported remote prescribing to new patients without an in-person examination. The strongest predictors of remote buprenorphine prescribing to new patients were prescribing buprenorphine to larger numbers of patients in an average month in the past year and closure of the practice setting during the pandemic; previous experience with remote prescribing to established patients prior to COVID-19 also was a significant predictor. Among clinicians prescribing to new patients without an in-person examination, 5.5 % reported difficulties with buprenorphine induction, most commonly withdrawal symptoms. Telehealth practices and prescribing to new patients without an in-person examination were adopted by DATA-waivered clinicians during the first six months of COVID-19. Permanent adoption of these authorities may enable expanded access to buprenorphine treatment.","Jones, Diallo, Vythilingam, Schier, Eisenstat, Compton","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108783","20210528","Buprenorphine; COVID-19; Medication treatment for opioid use disorder; Opioid overdose; Opioid use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14130,""
"Change in marijuana use and its associated factors among persons living with HIV (PLWH) during the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from a prospective cohort","Emerging literature shows increased drug use during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, limited research has examined the change in marijuana use among persons living with HIV (PLWH). This study aimed to investigate how marijuana use changed in a cohort of PLWH during the first year of the pandemic and identify factors associated with the change. 222 PLWH (mean age = 50.2 Ã‚Â± 11.2, 50.9 % female, 14.5 % Hispanic, 64.7 % Black, 15.8 % White, 5 % other, 80.2 % persons using marijuana [at least weekly use], 19.8 % persons not using marijuana) completed a baseline survey on demographics and behavioral/health characteristics between 2018 and 2020 and a brief phone survey between May and October 2020 that assessed changes in marijuana use and overall/mental health, and perceived risks/benefits of marijuana use during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, 64/222(28.8 %) of the whole sample reported increased marijuana use, 36(16.2 %) reported decreased use, and 122(55 %) reported no change. Multinomial logistic regression results indicated that: Compared to those reporting no change, increased marijuana use during the pandemic was associated with more frequent marijuana use and PTSD symptoms at baseline, worsened mental health during the pandemic, and not perceiving marijuana use as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection. More frequent marijuana use at baseline was the only factor significantly associated with decreased marijuana use during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in marijuana use among a considerable proportion (45 %) of PLWH. Future research is needed to understand the temporality of the increases in marijuana use with worsening mental health.","Wang, IbaÃƒÂ±ez, Vaddiparti, Stetten, Sajdeya, Porges, Cohen, Cook","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108770","20210528","COVID-19; Cannabis; Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); Marijuana","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14131,""
"Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM) Position Statement: increase access to mental health services due to COVID-19-related parent and family stress","COVID-19 has caused drastic increases in family stress contributing to deleterious social and emotional ramifications. Before COVID-19, millions of Americans lacked access to mental health resources, and now in the midst of a global pandemic, resources are more limited in times of greater need. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided funding for mental health reforms; yet many barriers remained to receiving sufficient care. In February 2021, the Society of Behavioral Medicine recommended federal legislators expand Community Behavioral Healthcare Centers, increase funding for Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers and School Based Health Centers, incentivize providers to accept Medicaid, and institute more statewide licensing flexibilities to expand the reach of mental health care. In March 2021, the American Rescue Plan was signed into law and provided an additional ~$4 billion in funding for community mental health services, implementing substance abuse prevention and treatment programs, increasing the behavioral health workforce, promoting behavioral telehealth within primary care, increasing school-based mental health services, implementing suicide prevention programs, and improving services for traumatized families. This significant investment in parents and children's mental health is a tremendous step in the right direction and provides reassurance that relief is underway. Ongoing surveillance of the programmatic and clinical outcomes that result from these new policy reforms will be important for identifying areas that may need continual support as our nation recovers from COVID-19.","Bean, Adams, Buscemi, Ford, Wischenka, Behrman, Wilson, Gladstone, Fitzgibbon","https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibab063","20210528","Behavioral health; COVID-19 pandemic; Child stress; Mental health; Parent stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14132,""
"A systematic review to identify research priority setting in Black and minority ethnic health and evaluate their processes","Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities suffer from disproportionately poorer health than the general population. This issue has been recently exemplified by the large numbers of infection rates and deaths caused by covid-19 in BAME populations. Future research has the potential to improve health outcomes for these groups. High quality research priority setting is crucial to effectively consider the needs of the most vulnerable groups of the population. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify existing research priority studies conducted for BAME health and to determine the extent to which they followed good practice principles for research priority setting. Included studies were identified by searching Medline, Cinnahl, PsychINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, as well as searches in grey literature. Search terms included &quot;research priority setting&quot;, &quot;research prioritisation&quot;, &quot;research agenda&quot;, &quot;Black and minority ethnic&quot;, &quot;ethnic group&quot;. Studies were included if they identified or elicited research priorities for BAME health and if they outlined a process of conducting a research prioritisation exercise. A checklist of Nine Common Themes of Good Practice in research priority setting was used as a methodological framework to evaluate the research priority processes of each study. Out of 1514 citations initially obtained, 17 studies were included in the final synthesis. Topic areas for their research prioritisation exercise included suicide prevention, knee surgery, mental health, preterm birth, and child obesity. Public and patient involvement was included in eleven studies. Methods of research prioritisation included workshops, Delphi techniques, surveys, focus groups and interviews. The quality of empirical evidence was diverse. None of the exercises followed all good practice principles as outlined in the checklist. Areas that were lacking in particular were: the lack of a comprehensive approach to guide the process; limited use of criteria to guide discussion around priorities; unequal or no representation from ethnic minorities, and poor evaluation of their own processes. Research priority setting practices were found to mostly not follow good practice guidelines which aim to ensure rigour in priority setting activities and support the inclusion of BAME communities in establishing the research agenda. Research is unlikely to deliver useful findings that can support relevant research and positive change for BAME communities unless they fulfil areas of good practice such as inclusivity of key stakeholders' input, planning for implementation of identified priorities, criteria for deciding on priorities, and evaluation of their processes in research priority setting.","Iqbal, West, Haith-Cooper, McEachan","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251685","20210528","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14133,""
"Depression, anxiety, stress and their associated factors among Ethiopian University students during an early stage of COVID-19 pandemic: An online-based cross-sectional survey","The occurrence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects the mental health situation of almost everyone, including University students who spent most of their time at home due to the closure of the Universities. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing depression, anxiety, stress and identifying their associated factors among university students in Ethiopia during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. We invited students to complete an online survey using Google forms comprising consent, socio-demographic characteristics, and the standard validated depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) questionnaire. After completion of the survey from June 30 to July 30, 2020, we exported the data into SPSS 22. Both descriptive and analytical statistics were computed. Associated factors were identified using binary logistic regression and variables with a p-value &lt;0.05 were declared as statistically significant factors with the outcome variables. A total of 423 students completed the online survey. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in this study was 46.3%, 52%, and 28.6%, respectively. In the multivariable model, female sex, poor self-efficacy to prevent COVID-19, those who do not read any material about COVID-19 prevention, lack of access to reading materials about their profession, and lack of access to uninterrupted internet access were significantly associated with depression. Female sex, lower ages, students with non-health-related departments, those who do not think that COVID-19 is preventable, and those who do not read any materials about COVID-19 prevention were significantly associated with anxiety. Whereas, being female, students attending 1st and 2nd years, those who do not think that COVID-19 is preventable, presence of confirmed COVID-19 patient at the town they are living in, and lack of access to reading materials about their profession were significantly associated with stress. Depression, anxiety, and stress level among University students calls for addressing these problems by controlling the modifiable factors identified and promoting psychological wellbeing of students.","Simegn, Dagnew, Yeshaw, Yitayih, Woldegerima, Dagne","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251670","20210528","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14134,""
"Professional Social Media Usage and Work Engagement: A Four-Wave Follow-Up Study of Finnish Professionals Before and During the COVID-19 Outbreak","COVID-19 pandemic has changed work life profoundly and concerns of employees' mental well-being have risen. Organizations have taken rapid digital leaps and started to use new collaborative tools such as social media platforms overnight. Our study investigated how professional social media communication has affected work engagement before and during the COVID-19 and the role of perceived social support, task resources and psychological distress as predictors and moderators of work engagement. Nationally representative longitudinal survey data were collected in 2019-2020, and 965 respondents participated to all four surveys. Measures included work engagement (UWES-9), perceived social support and task resources (COPSOQ II) and psychological distress (GHQ-12). The data was analyzed using hybrid linear regression modeling. Work engagement remained stable and only decreased in autumn 2020. Within-person changes in social media communication at work, social support, task resources, and psychological distress were all associated with work engagement. The negative association between psychological distress and work engagement was stronger in autumn 2020 than before the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19 puts pressure on mental health at work. Fostering social support and task resources at work are important in maintaining work engagement. Social media communication could help in sustaining supportive work environment.","Oksa, Kaakinen, Savela, Hakanen, Oksanen","https://doi.org/10.2196/29036","20210528","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14135,""

A web-based cross-sectional survey was administered to 117 infertile patients at our center who had their infertility treatment delayed due to suspension of care at our hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey consisted of 52-question multiple-choice questions including the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) instruments. Characteristics of respondents who &quot;agreed&quot; (strongly agree and agree) that &quot;delaying treatment has permanently impacted my chances at future conception&quot; were compared with participants who &quot;disagreed&quot; (neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree) using Fischer's exact test. In total, 79.5% agreed that delaying treatment has permanently impacted their chances at future conception. There were no discernible demographic differences between patients who &quot;agreed&quot; versus &quot;disagreed&quot; with the above statement.

"Prevalence and Predictors of Loneliness Among Youth During the Time of COVID-19: A Multinational Study","Given the restrictions associated with COVID-19, feelings of loneliness among youth may increase. The aims of the current study were to assess the prevalence of loneliness among young people at the time of COVID-19 and to identify whether selected variables related to the pandemic predicted the level of loneliness. A cross-sectional study using WhatsApp and Facebook social media platforms was conducted to survey 1,057 young people aged 15 to 24 years from six Middle Eastern countries. Participants completed survey items including demographic and COVID-19-related questions; the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS); the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS); and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. The prevalence of experienced loneliness was 1 (0.1%), 625 (59.1%), 429 (40.6%), and 2 (0.2%), reflecting low, moderate, moderately high, and high experiences for loneliness, respectively. History of depression or anxiety, being dissatisfied with life, and having depression at the time of COVID-19 were significant predictors of loneliness among youth. The model was significant (<i>F</i> = 44.95, <i>p</i> &lt; .05) and accounted for 29.8% of the variance in UCLA Loneliness Scale scores. We found that the high prevalence rate of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic was correlated with depression and impaired life satisfaction among Middle Eastern youth.

"Older adults report cancellation or avoidance of medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic: results from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam","Delay of routine medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic may have serious consequences for the health and functioning of older adults. The aim of this study was to investigate whether older adults reported cancellation or avoidance of medical care during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore associations with health and socio-demographic characteristics. Cross-sectional data of 880 older adults agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°62Ã‚Â years (mean age 73.4Ã‚Â years, 50.3% female) were used from the COVID-19 questionnaire of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, a cohort study among community-dwelling older adults in the Netherlands. Cancellation and avoidance of care were assessed by self-report, and covered questions on cancellation of primary care (general practitioner), cancellation of hospital outpatient care, and postponed help-seeking. Respondent characteristics included age, sex, educational level, loneliness, depression, anxiety, frailty, multimorbidity and information on quarantine. 35% of the sample reported cancellations due to the COVID-19 situation, either initiated by the respondent (12%) or by healthcare professionals (29%). Postponed help-seeking was reported by 8% of the sample. Multimorbidity was associated with healthcare-initiated cancellations (primary care ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.92, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.09-3.50; hospital ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.86, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.28-2.74) and respondent-initiated hospital outpatient cancellations (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.02, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.04-4.12).

"Do concerns about COVID-19 impair sustained attention?","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has considerably heightened health and financial concerns for many individuals. Similar concerns, such as those associated with poverty, impair performance on cognitive control tasks. If ongoing concerns about COVID-19 substantially increase the tendency to mind wander in tasks requiring sustained attention, these worries could degrade performance on a wide range of tasks, leading, for example, to increased traffic accidents, diminished educational achievement, and lower workplace productivity. In two pre-registered experiments, we investigated the degree to which young adults' concerns about COVID-19 correlated with their ability to sustain attention. Experiment 1 tested mainly European participants during an early phase of the pandemic. After completing a survey probing COVID-related concerns, participants engaged in a continuous performance task (CPT) over two, 4-min blocks, during which they responded to city scenes that occurred 90% of the time and withheld responses to mountain scenes that occurred 10% of the time. Despite large and stable individual differences, performance on the scene CPT did not significantly correlate with the severity of COVID-related concerns obtained from the survey. Experiment 2 tested US participants during a later phase of the pandemic. Once again, CPT performance did not significantly correlate with COVID concerns expressed in a pre-task survey. However, participants who had more task-unrelated thoughts performed more poorly on the CPT. These findings suggest that although COVID-19 increased anxiety in a broad swath of society, young adults are able to hold these concerns in a latent format, minimizing their impact on performance in a demanding sustained attention task.","Jun, Toh, Sisk, Remington, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-021-00303-3","20210528","COVID-19; Mental health; Sustained attention; Vigilance decrement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14141,""
"The Mental Health Impact of 2019-nCOVID on Healthcare Workers From North-Eastern Piedmont, Italy Focus on Burnout","The 2019-nCOVID pandemic as a public health emergency has faced healthcare systems with unprecedented challenges. Our study aimed to focus on the mental health impact of the 2019-nCOVID pandemic on healthcare workers (HCWs) from North-Eastern Piedmont, Italy. For this purpose, we performed an online survey which was e-mailed to HCWs at the end of the first peak of the pandemic. We involved both frontline and not-frontline HCWs, employed in the hospital or in healthcare services outside the hospital. The primary outcome of our research was the assessment of burnout, while secondary outcomes included the investigation of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. We observed higher levels of burnout (especially in the Depersonalization and Personal Accomplishment dimensions), in females, in HCWs aged &lt;30 years, in those exposed to changes in their daily and family habits, in those who had to change their duties at work and in residents in training. In our HCWs sample we found lower levels of anxiety and depression than those reported in the literature. The problematic levels of burnout and adverse psychological outcomes observed during the pandemic cannot be underestimated. Given the recurrence in autumn 2020 of a new pandemic peak, which has once again put a strain on the health system and HCWs, it is supported the importance of a careful assessment of HCWs' mental health, and of the possible risk and protective factors both in the work environment and in the extra-work one.","Gramaglia, Marangon, Azzolina, Guerriero, Lorenzini, Probo, Rudoni, Gambaro, Zeppegno","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.667379","20210528","COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; depression; healthcare worker","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14142,""
"Mental Health Help-Seeking and Associated Factors Among Public Health Workers During the COVID-19 Outbreak in China","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 outbreak in China has created multiple stressors that threaten individuals' mental health, especially among public health workers (PHW) who are devoted to COVID-19 control and prevention work. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental help-seeking and associated factors among PHW using Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use (BMHSU). <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 9,475 PHW in five provinces across China between February 18 and March 1, 2020. The subsample data of those who reported probable mental health problems were analyzed for this report (<i>n</i> = 3,417). Logistic and hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations of predisposing, enabling, need, and COVID-19 contextual factors with mental health help-seeking. <b>Results:</b> Only 12.7% of PHW reported professional mental help-seeking during the COVID-19 outbreak. PHW who were older, had more days of overnight work, received psychological training, perceived a higher level of support from the society, had depression and anxiety were more likely to report mental help-seeking (OR<sub>m</sub> range: 1.02-1.73, all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) while those worked in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were less likely to seek help (OR<sub>m</sub> = 0.57, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). The belief that mental health issues were not the priority (64.4%), lack of time (56.4%), and shortage of psychologists (32.7%) were the most frequently endorsed reasons for not seeking help. <b>Conclusions:</b> The application of BMHSU confirmed associations between some factors and PHW's mental health help-seeking. Effective interventions are warranted to promote mental health help-seeking of PHW to ameliorate the negative impact of mental illness and facilitate personal recovery and routine work.","She, Wang, Zhang, Li, Xu, You, Li, Liang, Li, Ma, Wang, Chen, Zhou, Lau, Hao, Zhou, Gu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.622677","20210528","COVID-19; China; help-seeking; mental health; public health workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14143,""
"The Unintended Consequences of the Pandemic: The New Normal for College Students in South Korea and Taiwan","This study attempts to compare the impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on college students' lifestyles and mental health conditions in South Korea and Taiwan. As the COVID-19 outbreak has spread across the globe, it has brought significant changes to college campuses worldwide. College students have been heavily affected by the closure, as online learning has become increasingly common in higher education institutions. Using data collected from college students in South Korea and Taiwan in the spring of 2020, this study examines the effects of pandemic-related lifestyle changes on mental health conditions for college students in the two countries. The results were 3-fold. First, compared to college students in Taiwan, college students in South Korea reported greater decreases in time spent traveling, being with friends, eating at restaurants, and engaging in part-time employment, and greater increases in online shopping and ordering food for delivery. Second, college students in South Korea reported a higher level of worry, a greater possibility of contact with a person with COVID-19, and a lower level of happiness than did college students in Taiwan. Third, our findings indicate that social activities, including spending time with friends, were positively correlated with mental health conditions in South Korea and Taiwan. Comparing Korean and Taiwanese students' lifestyle changes and mental health conditions amid the pandemic, the study argues that the decrease in socialization and interaction under these new circumstances may be a significant factor that explains an increase in mental health issues in Korean college students compared to Taiwanese students, given the increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Korea and the corresponding greater use of online teaching platforms there than in Taiwan.","Chen, Song, Yap","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.598302","20210528","COVID-19; South Korea; Taiwan; college student; higher education; lifestyle change; mental health; the new normal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14144,""

"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the level of depression among health care workers: cross-sectional study","The outbreak of the novel Corona Virus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly to many countries leading to thousands of deaths globally. The burden of this pandemic has affected the physical and mental health of the frontline health care workers (HCWs) who are exposed to high risk of infection and psychological stressors. The aim is to measure the level of depression among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia during COVID-19 pandemic to establish interventional strategies. A descriptive cross-sectional study was used to conduct the current study. The data of this study was recruited between 15 June and 15 July 2020 from healthcare providers who work in both public and private healthcare sectors in Riyadh and Eastern province in Saudi Arabia utilizing a self-administered questionnaire. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Dr. Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Group (IRB Log No. RC20.06.88-2). Data were collected by using The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale SDS. A total of 900 healthcare providers working in the healthcare setting during COVID-19 pandemic were invited to participate in the study. A total of 650 healthcare providers participated in the study by completing and submitting the survey. Almost 30% suffered from depression which can be divided into three categories; mild depression (26.2%), moderate/major (2.5%) and severe/extreme (0.8%). The finding shows that the level of depression among respondents at the age range of 31-40 years old was significantly higher than the level of depression among respondents with the age above 50 years old. Non-Saudi healthcare workers experienced more depression than Saudi workers. It also shows how nurses suffered from depression compared to their physician colleagues. Those who did not suffer from sleeping disorder perceived more depression as compared to those who are having sleeping disorder. It is recommended that health care facilities should implement strategies to reduce the prevalence of mental health problems among healthcare providers and eventually it will improve their performance in provision of safe and high-quality care for patients.","Al Mutair, Al Mutairi, Ambani, Shamsan, AlMahmoud, Alhumaid","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11469","20210528","COVID-19; Depression; Health care facilities; Health care workers; Mental health; Saudi Arabia; Sleeping disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14146,""
"Communication Across Maternal Social Networks During England's First National Lockdown and Its Association With Postnatal Depressive Symptoms","Postnatal/postpartum depression (PND/PPD) had a pre-COVID-19 estimated prevalence ranging up to 23% in Europe, 33% in Australia, and 64% in America, and is detrimental to both mothers and their infants. Low social support is a key risk factor for developing PND. From an evolutionary perspective this is perhaps unsurprising, as humans evolved as cooperative childrearers, inherently reliant on social support to raise children. The coronavirus pandemic has created a situation in which support from social networks beyond the nuclear family is likely to be even more important to new mothers, as it poses risks and stresses for mothers to contend with; whilst at the same time, social distancing measures designed to limit transmission create unprecedented alterations to their access to such support. Using data from 162 mothers living in London with infants aged Ã¢â€°Â¤6 months, we explore how communication with members of a mother's social network related to her experience of postnatal depressive symptoms during the first &quot;lockdown&quot; in England. Levels of depressive symptoms, as assessed via the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, were high, with 47.5% of the participants meeting a Ã¢â€°Â¥11 cut-off for PND. Quasi-Poisson regression modelling found that the number of network members seen in-person, and remote communication with a higher proportion of those not seen, was negatively associated with depressive symptoms; however, contact with a higher proportion of relatives was positively associated with symptoms, suggesting kin risked seeing mothers in need. Thematic qualitative analysis of open text responses found that mothers experienced a burden of constant mothering, inadequacy of virtual contact, and sadness and worries about lost social opportunities, while support from partners facilitated family bonding. While Western childrearing norms focus on intensive parenting, and fathers are key caregivers, our results highlight that it still &quot;takes a village&quot; to raise children in high-income populations and mothers are struggling in its absence.","Myers, Emmott","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648002","20210528","COVID-19; cooperative breeding; lockdown; maternal social networks; mothers; postnatal depression; social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14147,""
"Effectiveness of Mobile App-Based Psychological Interventions for College Students: A Systematic Review of the Literature","Serious mental health disorders are increasing among college students and university counseling services are often overburdened. Mobile applications for mental health have been growing exponentially in the last decade and they are emerging in university settings as a promising tool to promote and intervene in college students' mental health. Additionally, considering the recent covid-19 pandemic, mHealth interventions, due to its nature and possibilities, may play an important role in these institutions. Our main objectives are to explore mhealth interventions in universities, regarding its conceptual framework, acceptability and efficacy outcomes and understand its impact and contributions to address treatment delivery and psychological difficulties resulting from covid-19 pandemic. The literature search was conducted in scientific databases, namely, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Scopus. A search in app stores was not conducted, thus regarding commercially available apps, only those found in our database search were included in our review. We selected studies with mobile applications addressing psychological interventions for college students. A total of 2,158 participants were included in the 8 selected studies and most interventions were delivered through mobile apps only and based in cognitive behavioral therapy. Results suggested that college students accept and adhere to these interventions and preliminary evidence of efficacy was demonstrated in different disorders, such as stress, anxiety, depression and risky behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco abuse and sexual knowledge. We conclude that universities, particularly college counseling services, may benefit from mhealth interventions, not only to address college students' mental health but to decrease some of its difficulties related to lack of human resources. Specifically in covid-19 pandemic context, these interventions may contribute significantly by promoting and delivering psychological interventions at a safe distance.","Oliveira, Pereira, Vagos, NÃƒÂ³brega, GonÃƒÂ§alves, Afonso","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647606","20210528","cognitive-behavioral therapy; college students; counseling services; mHealth; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14148,""
"In vivo and in vitro Evaluation of Cytokine Expression Profiles During Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Infection","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) first emerged in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is associated with a high mortality rate. To determine the effect of MERS-CoV on the immune response in infected patients and investigate cytokine production in the A549 epithelial cell line in response to a recombinant MERS-CoV spike protein (rSP) in the presence or absence of anti-dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) antibody (3 independent experiments). Cytokine levels were measured using a cytokine ELISA array. A Bio-Plex multiplex assay and cytokine ELISA were used in our study to measure the cytokine levels. Comparative analysis of MERS-CoV-infected patients (4 samples) and noninfected healthy controls (HCs) (5 samples) showed that serum levels of the following cytokines and chemokines were significantly higher in MERS-CoV patients than in the HCs (*p &lt; 0.05): interferon (IFN)-ÃŽÂ±2 (43.4 vs 5.4), IFN-ÃŽÂ² (17.7 vs 6.2), IFN-ÃŽÂ³ (43.4 vs 9.7), interleukin (IL)-8 (13.7 vs 0), IL-2 (11.2 vs 3), IL-27p28 (57.8 vs 13.8), and IL-35 (167.5 vs 87.5). Our results revealed that MERS-CoV infection induced a slight increase in IFN levels but triggered a more pronounced increase in expression of the regulatory cytokines IL-27 and IL-35. A recombinant version of the full-length MERS-CoV spike protein increased the expression of IL-8 (160 pg/mL), IL-2 (100 pg/mL) and IL-12 (65 pg/mL) in A549 lung epithelial cells compared to that in the unstimulated control cells. The presence of anti-DPP4 antibody did not affect cytokine suppression or induction in A549 cells in vitro but decreased the level of IL-8 from 160 pg/mL to 65 pg/mL. MERS-CoV can decrease IFN levels to interfere with the IFN pathway and enhance the production of regulatory cytokines. Inhibition of the increases in IL-27 and IL-35 may contribute to halting MERS-CoV in the early stage of infection.","Mubarak, Alrfaei, Aljurayyan, Alqafil, Farrag, Hamed, Alosaimi, Almajhdi, Alturaiki","https://doi.org/10.2147/JIR.S312337","20210528","A549 lung cells; IFNs; MERS-CoV; anti-DPP4; proinflammatory cytokines; regulatory cytokines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14149,""
"Covid-19 Pandemic-Related Stress and Coping Strategies Among Adults with Chronic Disease in Southwest Ethiopia","The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presented a great threat to the physical and mental health of the general population. Patients with chronic disease have always been vulnerable to stressful life conditions. Therefore, determining the perceived stress and coping strategies among chronic disease patients is crucial to minimize the mental health consequences related to the outbreak. This study aimed to determine COVID-19-related stress and coping strategies among adults with chronic disease in southwest Ethiopia. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 613 randomly selected adults with chronic disease in southwest Ethiopia. A multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between the COVID-19-related stress score and coping strategy types, and independent sample <i>t</i>-tests and ANOVA tests were conducted. Statistical significance was accepted at <i>p</i>-values &lt;0.05. More than two-thirds of study participants (68.4%) were moderately stressed, 13.9% were severely stressed, and 17.8% had low levels of perceived stress. Active coping (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=1.238, 95% CI: 0.0 to 2.477), denial (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=3.678, 95% CI: 2.44 to 4.915), behavioral disengagement (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=3.669, 95% CI: 2.193 to 5.146), self-blame (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=1.722, 95% CI: 0.146 to 3.297), and religion (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=3.443, 95% CI: 2.028 to 4.858) coping strategies positively predicted the COVID-19-related stress score. Only the acceptance coping strategy (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=-2.710, 95% CI: -3.926 to -1.493) negatively predicted the COVID-19-related stress score. Significant numbers of participants suffered from moderate to severe perceived stress levels due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Both adaptive and maladaptive coping strategy types were significantly associated positively and negatively with perceived stress score among adults with chronic disease. There were significant differences in the mean scores of perceived stress and categories of variables such as family size, duration of disease, and age of the participants.","Girma, Ayalew, Mesafint","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S308394","20210528","COVID-19-related stress; chronic disease; coping strategies; southwest Ethiopia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14150,""

"COVID-19 and perinatal intimate partner violence: a cross-sectional survey of pregnant and postpartum individuals in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic","The objectives of this study were to: (1) document violent and controlling behaviours within intimate partnerships during the perinatal period; and (2) determine individual, interpersonal and household-level factors influencing the risk of perinatal intimate partner violence (IPV). Cross-sectional survey. The Ottawa Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Patients who gave birth at The Ottawa Hospital and were &gt;20Ã¢â‚¬â€°days post partum between 17 March and 16 June 2020. Perinatal IPV was defined as regular controlling behaviours or act-based forms of emotional/physical/sexual abuse in the 12 months before pregnancy, during pregnancy and/or post partum. Log-binomial multivariable regression models were used to compute adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% CIs to identify potential risk factors for IPV: maternal age, postpartum depression, parity, increase in partner substance use and household income. Among 216 participants, the median maternal age was 33 years (IQR: 30-36). In total, 52 (24.07%) reported some form of perinatal IPV, 37 (17.13%) reported regular controlling behaviour and 9 (4.17%) reported both. Household income below the municipal median was the strongest risk factor for perinatal IPV (aRR: 3.24, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI: 1.87 to 5.59). There was no apparent association between maternal age (aRR: 0.99, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI: 0.94 to 1.04), postpartum depression (aRR: 1.03, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI: 1.00 to 1.07), nulliparity (aRR: 1.18, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI: 0.71 to 1.97) or increases in partner substance use (aRR: 0.73, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI: 0.42 to 1.25) with IPV. One in four individuals in this study experienced perinatal IPV. Household income was the strongest risk factor, and surprisingly, many hypothesised risk factors (eg, mental health, partner substance use, etc) were not significantly associated with perinatal IPV in this sample. This highlights the challenges in both measuring IPV and identifying individuals exposed to perinatal IPV during the high stress of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Muldoon, Denize, Talarico, Boisvert, Frank, Harvey, Rennicks White, Fell, O'Hare-Gordon, Guo, Murphy, Corsi, Sampsel, Wen, Walker, El-Chaar","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049295","20210528","COVID-19; maternal medicine; obstetrics; public health; social medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-29","",14152,""
"Lived Experiences of Surgical Residents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Assessment","As the COVID-19 pandemic dynamically changes our society, it is important to consider how the pandemic has affected the training and wellness of surgical residents. Using a qualitative study of national focus groups with general surgery residents, we aim to identify common themes surrounding their personal, clinical, and educational experiences that could be used to inform practice and policy for future pandemics and disasters. Six 90-minute focus groups were conducted by a trained qualitative researcher who elicited responses on six predetermined topics. De-identified transcripts and audio recordings were later analyzed by two independent researchers who organized responses to each topic into themes. Focus groups were conducted virtually and anonymously. General surgery residents were recruited from across the country. Demographic information of potential participants was coded, and subjects were randomly selected to ensure a diverse group of participants. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on residents' clinical, educational, and personal experiences varied depending on the institutional response of the program and the burden of COVID-19 cases geographically. Many successes were identified: the use of telehealth and virtual didactics, an increased sense of camaraderie amongst residents, and flexibility in scheduling. Many challenges were also identified: uncertainty at work regarding personal protective equipment and scheduling, decreased case volume and educational opportunities, and emotional trauma and burnout associated with the pandemic. These data gathered from our qualitative study highlight a clear, urgent need for thoughtful institutional planning and policies for the remainder of this and future pandemics. Residency programs must ensure a balanced training program for surgical residents as they attempt to master the skills of their craft while also serving as employed health care providers in a pandemic.

"Toxicology Practice During COVID-19 Pandemic: Experience of the Dammam Poison Control Center-Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia","The sudden emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and scarcity of the accurate information especially in the initial phase of the struggle presented a series of challenges to health systems. To evaluate the changes in poisoning cases regarding distribution, types, and characteristics for better framing and planning of the role of our field in responding to pandemics. Study of telephone consultation calls and toxicology analysis records of poisoning cases referred to the Dammam Poison Control Center in Saudi Arabia during the first half of 2020. Their distribution according to frequencies, causes, and other characteristics was compared to the first half of 2019.
