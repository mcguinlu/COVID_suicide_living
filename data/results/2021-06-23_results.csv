"Prior sleep-wake behavior predicts mental health resilience among adults in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic","Rigorous nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., stay-at-home orders, remote-work directives) were implemented in early 2020 for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic containment in the U.S. During this time, increased sleep duration and delayed sleep timing were reported through surveys (Leone et al., 2021) and wearable data (Rezaei and Grandner, 2021), as were elevated adverse mental health symptom (Czeisler et al., 2020). Inter-relationships between sleep and mental health have not been examined using longitudinal objective sleep-wake data, during these abruptly imposed lifestyle changes. We examined objective sleep-wake data and surveyed mental health data collected among 4,912 U.S. adult users of a validated sleep wearable (WHOOP, Boston, Massachusetts) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comparing the pre-pandemic (January 1 to March 12, 2020) and acute pandemic-onset intervals (March 13 to April 12, 2020), participants exhibited increased mean sleep duration (0.25h [95% CI = 0.237-0.270]), later sleep onset (18m [17.378-20.045]) and offset (36m [35.111-38.106]), and increased consistency of sleep timing (3.51 [3.295-3.728] out of 100); all P < 0.0001. Generally, participants with persistent sleep deficiency and low sleep consistency had higher odds of symptoms of anxiety or depression, burnout, and new or increased substance use during the pandemic. Decreases in sleep duration (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.03-1.65, P = 0.025) and sleep consistency (2.05 [1.17-3.67], P = 0.009) were associated with increased anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic. We suggest that sleep duration and consistency may be important predictors of risk of adverse mental health outcomes during a pandemic. M.J. Leone, M. Sigman, D.A. Golombek.

"Did social factors buffer against the effect of adversities on self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic? A longitudinal analysis of 49,227 UK adults","Background: Little is known about which factors exacerbate and buffer the impact of COVID-19 -related adversities on changes in thinking about and engaging in self-harm over time. Aims: To examine how changes in four social factors contribute to changes in self-harm thoughts and behaviours over time and how these factors in turn interact with adversities and worries about adversities to increase risk for these outcomes. Method: Data from 49,227 UK adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed across the first 59 weeks of the pandemic. Fixed effects logistic regressions examined time-varying associations between social support quality, loneliness, number of days of face-to-face contact for > 15 minutes, and number of days phoning/video calling for >15 minutes with self-harm thoughts and behaviours. We then examined how these four factors in turn interacted with the total number of adversities and worries about adversity on outcomes. Results: Increases in the quality of social support decreased the likelihood of both outcomes, whilst greater loneliness increased their likelihood. Associations were inconsistent for telephone/video contact and face-to-face contact with outcomes. Social support buffered and loneliness exacerbated the impact of adversity experiences with self-harm behaviours. Other interactions were inconsistent, and some were in the unexpected direction. Conclusions: These findings suggest the importance of the quality of social support, rather than the mere presence of contact, is important for reducing the likelihood of self-harm behaviours in the context of COVID-19 pandemic-related adversity and worry.","Elise Paul; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.19.21259173","20210622","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-23","",15270,""

"The Risk Factors of Psychological Responses for Chinese University Students on COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Online Survey Study","The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a highly contagious and highly pathogenic disease caused by a novel coronavirusÃ¯Â¼Ë†SARS-CoV-2Ã¯Â¼â€°and has become a pandemic. As a vulnerable population, university students are at high-risk during the epidemic because they have high mobility and often overlook the severity of the disease due to incomplete information about the epidemic. The epidemic has brought not only the risk of death from infection but also unbearable psychological pressure. In this respect, university students are prone to psychological problems induced by the epidemic compared to the general population, because the university life is the first time out of the structure of family for most students and their mental development is still immature. The internal and external expectations and academic stress lead to excessive pressure, and unhealthy lifestyle also deteriorate their mental health. The outbreak of COVID-19 was a significant social event, and it could potentially have a great impact on the life and the mental health of the university students. Therefore, it is of importance to investigate university students' mental health status during the outbreak of COVID-19. The principal objective of this project was to investigate the influencing factors of psychological responses for Chinese university students on COVID-19 outbreak. This study used survey data conducted in China between 21 and 24 February 2020, and the dataset contains demographic information and psychological measures including the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and the compulsive behaviors part of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). A total of 2284 valid questionnaires were returned, and 2270 of them are valid and used for analysis. Mann-Whitney-U Test for two independent samples and binary logistic regression models were used for statistical analysis. Our study surveyed 563 medical students and 1707 non-medical students. Of these, 251 out of 2270 students (11.06%) had mental health issues. The results showed that contact history of similar infectious disease (OR=3.363, P=.015), PMH (OR=3.282, P&lt;.001), and compulsive behaviors (OR =3.525, P&lt;.001) contributed to the risk of mental health. Older students (OR=0.928, P=.021), regular daily life during the epidemic outbreak (OR=0.410, P&lt;.001), exercise during the epidemic outbreak (OR=0.456, P&lt;.001), and concern on COVID-19 (OR=0.638, P=.002) were protective factors for mental health issues. According to the study, the mental health issues have seriously affected university students, and our results are benefit for identifying the risky group of universities students on the possible mental health so that universities and families could prevent or intervene the potential mental health development at the early stage of the disease development.","Zhang, Shi, Wang, Jing, Zhai, Li, Zhao, Zhong, Song, Zhang, Bao","https://doi.org/10.2196/29312","20210622","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-23","",15272,""

"Adolescents Emotional State and Behavioral and Dietary Habit Changes during Isolation Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. As an infectious disease with no specific treatment, several measures have been established to minimize the outbreak of this disease, including social isolation. To evaluate the behavior of adolescents during the isolation period. This is a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted at the Adolescent Health Studies Center. Data were obtained from a questionnaire prepared on Google Forms, sent by a multiplatform instant messaging application, and analyzed using the Stata 14 software. A total of 208 adolescents with a mean age of 15.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (SD Ã‚Â± 1.8) answered the questionnaire, 57.7% were female. About 93.3% of adolescents said they were in isolation with a changed routine, 67.3% increased their food consumption, 86.5% were inactive, and 58.7% reported screen time over 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°h/d. There was an association between anxiety and increased food consumption (odds ratio: 3.9; CI 95% 2-7.5; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00), sleeping difficulty (odds ratio: 3.6; CI 95% 1.9-6.8; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00), and conflicting family relationship (odds ratio: 5.7; CI 95% 1.6-7.8; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). The study revealed that social isolation due to an infectious disease was associated with several effects on the behavior and eating behavior of adolescents, which need to be acknowledged to encourage them to lead a healthy lifestyle after the COVID-19 confinement.","Giannini, Tavares, Takey, Aloise, da Costa, de Carvalho, da Silva, Pontes, Monteiro","https://doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2021.1897899","20210622","SARS-CoV-2; adolescents; depression; feeding behavior; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-23","",15274,""
"Using the PRAPARE Tool to Examine Those Tested and Testing Positive for COVID-19 at a Community Health Center","The PRAPARE (Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients' Assets, Risks, and Experiences) tool is an instrument that has been used to assess social determinants of health within community health centers in the US. We sought to examine the association between PRAPARE scores and getting tested for and testing positive with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We used medical record data collected from a community health center in the US between March-August 2020. Employing logistic regression analyzes, we explored the association between demographic factors, history of screening positive for depression, and PRAPARE scores and patients' odds of getting tested and testing positive for COVID-19. While variables such as ethnicity mirrored similar findings from other sources, we found the PRAPARE score to be associated with increased odds of being tested for COVID-19; however, it was not significantly associated with testing positive. These findings can help health care workers and health educators craft messages to explain screening protocols for communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, to best reach vulnerable populations.","Luzius, Dobbs, Hammig, Kirkish, Mojica","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-01091-8","20210622","COVID-19; Community health center; PRAPARE; Social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-23","",15275,""
"Assessing forgetfulness and polypharmacy and their impact on health-related quality of life among patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia in Greece during the COVID-19 pandemic","We estimate the association between forgetfulness to take medications as prescribed and polypharmacy and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among a cohort of patients with hypertension, dyslipidemia or both in Greece during the COVID-19 pandemic. A telephone survey of 1018 randomly selected adults was conducted in Greece in June 2020. Participants were included in the survey, if they (a) had a diagnosis of hypertension, dyslipidemia or both and (b) were on prescription treatment for these conditions. HRQoL was calculated using the short form (SF) -12 Patient Questionnaire. A multivariable generalized linear regression model (GLM) was used to estimate the association between forgetfulness and polypharmacy and HRQoL, controlling for sociodemographic and health-related covariates. Overall, 351 respondents met the inclusion criteria, of whom 28 did not fully complete the questionnaire (response rate: 92%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°323). Of those, 37% were diagnosed with hypertension only, 28% with dyslipidemia only, and 35% with both. Most reported good to average physical (64.1%) and mental health (48.6%). Overall, 25% indicated that they sometimes forget to take their prescribed medications, and 12% took two or more pills multiple times daily. Total HRQoL score was 68.9% (s.d.Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18.0%). About 10% of participants reported paying less attention to their healthcare condition during the pandemic. Estimates of multivariable analyses indicated a negative association between forgetfulness (-Ã‚Â 9%, adjusted ÃŽÂ²: -Ã‚Â 0.047, 95% confidence interval -Ã‚Â 0.089 to -Ã‚Â 0.005, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.029), taking two or more pills multiple times daily compared to one pill once a day (-Ã‚Â 16%, adjusted ÃŽÂ²: -Ã‚Â 0.068, 95% confidence interval -Ã‚Â 0.129 to -Ã‚Â 0.008, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.028) and total HRQoL. Our results suggest that among adult patients with hypertension, dyslipidemia or both in Greece, those who forget to take their medications and those with more complex treatment regimens had lower HRQoL. Such patients merit special attention and require targeted approaches by healthcare providers to improve treatment compliance and health outcomes.","Souliotis, Giannouchos, Golna, Liberopoulos","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-021-02917-y","20210622","Dyslipidemia; Forgetfulness; Hypertension; Patient reported outcomes; Polypharmacy; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-23","",15276,""
"Associations between changes in daily behaviors and self-reported feelings of depression and anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic among older adults","Due to the significant mortality and morbidity consequences of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic among older adults, these individuals were urged to avoid going out in public and socializing with others, among other major disruptions to daily life. While these significant and often unavoidable disruptions have been shown to bear consequences for mental health, less attention has been devoted to behavioral changes, such as changes to sleeping or eating due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and their implications for emotional well-being. We utilized data from a nationally representative survey of Medicare beneficiaries (aged Ã¢â€°Â¥65 years), which was administered between June and October 2020 (n=3,122). We examine the relationship between self-reported changes to daily behaviors (e.g., sleep, drinking alcohol, and exercise) and emotional impacts of COVID-19 (i.e., feelings of depression and anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic) using stepwise hierarchical multivariable Poisson regression. We found that worse sleep quality, sleeping more or less, watching more television, and walking less, were associated with more feelings of depression and anxiety about COVID-19. Previous research has shown a connection between the significant and often unavoidable disruptions to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., sheltering-in-place) and adverse mental health symptoms. Less attention has been paid to potentially modifiable behaviors, such as sleep and exercise. Our findings highlight the behavioral changes associated with adverse emotional impacts among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research may evaluate whether behavioral interventions may aim to attenuate the impact of pandemics on daily, modifiable behaviors to buffer against adverse emotional impacts.","Robbins, Weaver, Czeisler, Barger, Quan, Czeisler","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbab110","20210622","COVID-19; life changes; lifestyle; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-23","",15277,""

"The psychological impact of threat and lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic: exacerbating factors and mitigating actions","In spring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was declared. The threat the pandemic poses as well as associated lockdown measures created challenging times for many. This study aimed to investigate the individual and social factors associated with low mental health, particularly perceived threat and lockdown measures, and factors associated with psychological well-being, particularly sense of control. An online survey was completed by participants (N = 8,229) recruited from 79 countries. In line with pre-registered hypotheses, participants showed elevated levels of anxiety and depression worldwide. This poor mental health was predicted by perceived threat. The effect of threat on depression was further moderated by social isolation, but there was no effect of sense of control. Sense of control was low overall, and was predicted negatively by maladaptive coping, but positively by adaptive coping and the perception that the government is dealing with the outbreak. Social isolation increased with quarantine duration, but was mitigated by frequent communication with close ones. Engaging in individual actions to avoid contracting the virus was associated with higher anxiety, except when done professionally. We suggest that early lockdown of the pandemic may have had detrimental psychological effects, which may be alleviated by individual actions such as maintaining frequent social contact and adaptive coping, and by governmental actions which demonstrate support in a public health crisis. Citizens and governments can work together to adapt better to restrictive but necessary measures during the current and future pandemics. The COVID-19 pandemic is a difficult time for many; not only are people isolated at home, they may also experience the threat that COVID-19 will have a severe impact on their lives. We ran an online survey with 8,229 individuals from 79 countries in April 2020. After establishing levels of psychological well-being, we investigated which factors contribute to better psychological well-being, and which to worse. We found that levels of anxiety and depression were markedly elevated worldwide. The more people thought that COVID-19 was going to have severe effects on their lives, the more anxious and depressed they felt. This effect was even stronger when the individuals felt socially isolated, which was increased when people had been in quarantine for a long time, but reduced when people frequently communicated with their close ones. People felt more in control of their lives when they engaged in positive coping behaviors, such as reframing their situation positively, but not negative coping behaviors, such as substance use. People also felt in control when their government was dealing with the crisis well. We conclude that there are several ways in which psychological well-being can be supported, in the current pandemic but also potential future pandemics.","van Mulukom, Muzzulini, Rutjens, van Lissa, Farias","https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibab072","20210622","COVID-19; Government action; Mental health; Quarantine; Sense of control; Social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-23","",15280,""
"Psychological impact of mandatory COVID-19 quarantine on small business owners and self-employed in China","A massive home-quarantine took place in China due to the novel coronavirus in the end of 2019. The purpose of the present study was to explore the potential mental health impact of this forced quarantine and widespread shutdown among small business owners and the self-employed. A semi-structured interview was employed among 14 participants from three different cities in China. Grounded Theory was employed to analyze the data using Nvivo11 plus. Based on a qualitative analysis, 9 categories of responses emerged to describe the experience and actions of participants towards the quarantine: enjoyment of life, emotional disturbance, hope, comparisons to others, social support, patriotism, making changes, and obedience. Further analysis suggested that the mental state of participants was either positive or negative depending on enjoyment of life, loss, emotional disturbance, and hope, and that these were impacted by intervening conditions (national measures, social support, patriotism), personal strategies (exercising, studying, comparisons to others), and personal consequences (making change, obedience). Rather than observing a linear pattern of negative outcomes, mental state was found to be variable in that positive outcomes were experienced earlier in the quarantine (making connections with family), negative states were encountered midway through the quarantine (fear of financial loss, anxiety), and more positive mental states (hope) emerged towards the end of the quarantine depending on intervening conditions, personal strategies, and consequences. It can be concluded that the nature of the impact of mandatory quarantine in China among small business owners and the self-employed is complex and depends on a variety of personal and situational factors.","Wang, Huang, Liu, Hennessy","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01983-2","20210622","Business owners; COVID-19; Home-quarantine; Psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-23","",15281,""

"Study protocol of a factorial trial ECHO: optimizing a group-based school intervention for children with emotional problems","Youth mental health problems are a major public health concern. Anxiety and depression are among the most common psychological difficulties. The aim of this study is to evaluate an optimized version of a promising indicated group intervention for emotional problems. The program (EMOTION Coping Kids Managing Anxiety and Depression) targets school children 8-12Ã‚Â years with anxious and depressive symptoms and examines three factors. Factor 1 compares the standard EMOTION intervention delivered in 16 group-based sessions (Group), versus a partially-digital EMOTION intervention (DIGGI) delivered as eight group sessions and eight digital sessions. Both versions use virtual reality technology (VR) to improve behavioral experiments. Factor 2 compares parent participation in a 5-session parent group (high involvement) versus sharing information with parents via a brochure (low involvement). Factor 3 compares the use of a measurement and feedback system (MFS) designed to help group leaders tailor the intervention using feedback from children with no MFS. Using a cluster-randomized factorial design, 40 schools across Norway will be randomized to eight different experimental conditions based on three, two-level factors. To assess internalizing symptoms in children, children and their parents will be given self-report questionnaires pre-, post-, and one year after intervention. Parents also report on demographics, user satisfaction, personal symptoms and perception of family related factors. Teachers report on child symptoms and school functioning. Group leaders and the head of the municipal services report on implementation issues. The primary outcomes are changes in depressive and anxious symptoms. Some secondary outcomes are changes in self-esteem, quality of life, and user satisfaction. Questions regarding the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are included. Treatment fidelity is based on checklists from group leaders, and on user data from the participating children. This study is a collaboration between three regional centers for child and adolescent mental health in Norway. It will provide knowledge about: (1) the effect of school-based preventive interventions on anxiety and depression in children; (2) the effect of feedback informed health systems, (3) the effect and cost of digital health interventions for children, and (4) the effect of parental involvement.","Neumer, Patras, Holen, LisÃƒÂ¸y, Askeland, Haug, Jeneson, Wentzel-Larsen, Adolfsen, Rasmussen, Ingul, Ytreland, Bania, Sund, Martinsen","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-021-00581-y","20210622","Anxiety; Children; Depression; Digital interventions; Effectiveness; Factorial design; Implementation; Indicated prevention; MFS; Parental involvement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-23","",15283,""
"An assessment of the mental health of front-line medical staff involved in the COVID-19 outbreak in Chongqing, China","In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in December 2019 in China, medical staff went to work across the country to combat widespread infection. When health workers are suddenly faced with such a serious event, it is important to assess their mental health in order to determine whether they can meet the challenge effectively. Herein, Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) was used to assess the psychological problems of 382 front-line medical staff in Chongqing. The average SCL-90 score was low, and no specific mental health problems were found. With the exception of the phobic-anxiety factor, the scores were close to normal values. A single-factor analysis of variance showed that the SCL-90 scores of male and older staff were higher than those of female and younger staff, implying that they were at greater psychological risk. We found that both gender and age have a significant impact on mental health, and our findings suggest that more attention should be given to the mental health of male and older front-line medical staff.","Wang, Li, Li, Du, Yang, Xiong, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1939889","20210622","Mental health; SCL-90; coronavirus disease 2019; front-line medical staff","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-23","",15284,""
"Predictors of Lower Depression Levels in Older Adults During COVID-19 Lockdown","Social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to adverse mental health consequences, such as depression, among older adults. This study aimed to investigate the predictors of lower depression scores in older adults living under lockdown. 1,123 older Brazilian adults were cross-sectionally assessed for depression, physical activity (PA), pet ownership (dogs, cats, and birds), ability to make video calls, leaving home during lockdown, and not living alone. The statistical procedures included linear regression and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). After adjusting for age, sex, and race, moderate to vigorous PA (ÃŽÂ² = -0.014, <i>p</i> &lt; .001), it was found that PA (ÃŽÂ² = -0.905, <i>p</i> &lt; .001) and dog ownership (ÃŽÂ² = -0.545, <i>p</i> = .004) were associated with lower depression. No association was observed between depression and other conditions. With the likelihood of subsequent COVID-19 waves, remotely delivered PA programs might be a strategy to counteract the negative psychological effects of lockdown on older adults.","Bohn, Gomes, Neto, Lage, de Freitas, MagalhÃƒÂ£es, Mota, Soares Miranda","https://doi.org/10.1177/07334648211025116","20210622","confinement; mental disorders; pandemic; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-23","",15285,""
"The current pandemic, a complex emergency? Mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on highly vulnerable communities in Guatemala","On March 5th, Guatemala declared a 'State of Calamity' in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and strict lockdown measures were initiated. The psychological consequences of these measures are yet to be fully understood. There is limited research on the psychological impact of the virus in the general population, and even less focused on Latin America and high-risk communities characterized by poverty, limited mental health resources, and high rates of stigma around mental illness. The goal of this study is to examine the psychological impact of COVID-19 across several highly vulnerable districts in Guatemala. A semi-structured phone interview was conducted of 295 individuals in multiple districts in Guatemala City to assess self-perceived mental health consequences related to the pandemic. Sociodemographic, medical, and mental health data were collected. Chisquares and <i>t</i>-tests used for categorical and continuous variables, as appropriate, to describe the sample. Binary logistic regressions were estimated to examine associations between sociodemographic characteristics and mental health symptoms (anxiety, stress, depression, burnout, escalation of pre-existing mental health symptoms, and a sense of safety). The results indicate high levels of anxiety and stress in all target communities. Significant differences based on gender, age, and the number of children in the household were identified: women and older adults experience higher rates of stress and anxiety associated with the pandemic; while families with greater number of children experience higher levels of burnout. Contextualizing the current pandemic as a complex emergency can help inform further studies focusing on socioeconomic challenges and higher vulnerabilities as preconditions affecting the impact of the pandemic on mental health. Given the limited available resources for mental health care in Guatemala, informal networks of care may play an important role in meeting the needs of those individuals experiencing increased psychological distress resulting from the pandemic.","Alonzo, Popescu, Zubaroglu-Ioannides","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640211027212","20210622","COVID-19; Guatemala; complex emergency; low-income; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-23","",15286,""
