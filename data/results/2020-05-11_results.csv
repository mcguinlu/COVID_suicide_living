"Mental Health Impact of COVID-19: A global study of risk and resilience factors","This study anonymously screened 13,332 individuals worldwide for psychological symptoms related to Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from March 29th to April 14th, 2020. A total of n=12,817 responses were considered valid with responses from 12 featured countries and five WHO regions. Female gender, pre-existing psychiatric condition, and prior exposure to trauma were identified as notable riskfactors, whereas optimism, ability to share concerns with family and friends like usual,positive prediction about COVID-19, and daily exercise predicted fewer psychologicalsymptoms. These results could aid in dynamic optimization of mental health services during and following the COVID-19 pandemic.","Plomecka, M.

"Risk Stratification for Healthcare workers during the CoViD-19 Pandemic; using demographics, co-morbid disease and clinical domain in order to assign clinical duties","Background: Healthcare workers have a greater exposure to individuals with confirmed SARS-novel coronavirus 2, and thus a higher probability of contracting corona virus disease (CoViD)-19, than the general population. It is critically important, therefore, for health systems to protect the lives of their staff especially those on the frontline. Urgent work is needed to identify how best to protect those most at risk in an evidence-based way in order to implement protective allocations. We wished to explore the predictive role of basic demographics in order to establish a simple tool that could help risk stratify healthcare workers. Objectives and Study question: To develop a risk stratification tool for use to assist staff allocation by examining reported demographics of hospitalisation and mortality in the UK from CoViD-19 compared to population demographics and historic admissions for viral pneumoniae. Setting: Secondary Care in the UK and worldwide. Participants: Patients and Health Care Professionals hospitalised and dying of CoViD-19. Methods: We undertook a review of the published literature (including multiple search strategies in MEDLINE with PubMed interface) and critically assessed early reports on medRxiv, a pre-print server (https://www.medrxiv.org/) (date of last search: April 30, 2020). We explored the relative risk of mortality from readily available demographics in order to identify the population at highest risk. Results: The only published studies specifically assessing the risk of healthcare workers had limited demographics available, therefore we explored the general population in the literature. Clinician Demographics. Mortality increased with increasing age from 50 years onwards. Male sex at birth, people of black and minority ethnicity groups had higher susceptibility to both hospitalisation and mortality. Co-morbid Disease. Vascular disease, diabetes and chronic pulmonary disease further increased risk. Those with pre-existing mental health issues may also be more likely to experience emotional trauma, depression and anxiety with consequences for self-harm too. Risk stratification tool. A risk stratification tool was compiled using a Caucasian female <50years with no comorbidities as a reference. A point allocated to risk factors associated with an approximate doubling in risk. This tool provides numerical support for healthcare workers when determining which team members should be allocated to patient facing clinical duties compared to remote supportive roles. Clinical Domain. Those working with aerosol generating procedures were at increased risk, however healthcare workers in any clinical domain are at higher risk than the general population. Conclusions. We have generated a tool which can provide a framework for objective risk stratification of doctors and health care professionals during the CoViD-19 pandemic.","Jankowski, j.; davies, A.; English, P.; Friedman, E.; mcKeown, H.; Rao, M.; Sethi, S.; Strain, W.

"Anxiety and Depression in Health Workers and General Population During COVID-19 Epidemic in IRAN: A Web-Based Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 outbreak has exerted a great deal of psychological pressure on Iranian health workers and the general population. In the present study, the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms along with the related variables in this epidemic were investigated.An online cross-sectional study was conducted for the general public and healthcare workers in IRAN using a questionnaire comprised of demographic questions and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Chi square test was used to compare categorical variables, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were conducted.Of the 2045 participants,1136 (65.6%) were considered to have moderate and severe anxiety symptoms, and 865(42.3%) had moderate and severe depression symptoms. Based on the logistic regression models, the prevalence of anxiety was higher in the females than in the males (OR=1.4, 95% CI: 1.123-1.643, P=.002); the prevalence of anxiety was significantly higher in those aged 30-39 years than in other age groups (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.123-2.320, P=0.001); furthermore, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was significantly higher in doctors and nurses compared with other occupations (OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.367-2.491, P< 0.001) and(OR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.154-2.021, P=0.003). In addition, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms in the likely-infected COVID-19 group was higher than in the noninfected COVID-19 group (OR=1.35, 95% CI: 1.093-1.654, P=0.005).A majority of health workers and general population have anxiety and depression symptoms. These symptoms are more widespread in doctors and nurses in comparison to other occupations, and psychological interventions might be conducive to reducing the negative symptoms.","Taghizadeh, F.; Hassannia, L.; Moosazadeh, M.; Zarghami, M.; Taghizadeh, H.; Fathi Dooki, A.; Alizadeh Navaei, R.; Hedayatizadeh-Omran, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.05.20089292v1?rss=1""","20200509","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",738,""
"Who maintains a good mental health in a locked-down country? A French nationwide online survey of 11,391 participants","Background: Lockdown measures induce massive societal perturbations and can differentially affect mental wellbeing in populations depending on individual determinants. We aim at investigating the sociodemographic and environmental determinants of wellbeing during global lockdown due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: A nationwide survey was sent online to the French population during the second week of global lockdown during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, between March 25, 2020 and March 30, 2020. Volunteers were recruited on social networks, online newspapers, and mailing lists. We analyzed sociodemographic and environmental variables obtained from a co-built and evidence-based questionnaire. Mental wellbeing was measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS). Results: We analyzed data from 11,391 (56.6%) out of 20,235 participants who answered the questionnaire. After weighting data on age and gender distributions, 5415 of the respondents were male (47.5%), 5932 were female (52.1%), and 52 (0.5%) registered as other. Multivariate analyses indicated that various factors impacted mental wellbeing. Being female (p < .001), a student (p < .001), disabled (p = .001), or having no access to outdoor space (p = 0.02) was associated with lower WEMWBS scores. Conversely, being employed (p < .001) and having more social contacts (p < .01) were both associated with greater mental wellbeing. Interpretation: We revealed differences in mental wellbeing among the French population at the early stages of global lockdown. Authorities should consider the particular vulnerability of students, persons with disabilities, and those living in constrained housing conditions that could increase the negative impact of lockdown on mental health.","HAESEBAERT, F.; Haesebaert, J.; Zante, E.; Franck, N.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089755v1?rss=1""","20200508","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",739,""
"Health Care WorkersMental Health During the First Weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in Switzerland: A Cross-Sectional Study","Background: The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses various challenges for health care workers (HCWs), which may impair their mental health. First evidence from China suggests that HCWs are at risk for anxiety and depression. However, generalizability to western countries is limited. The current study aimed at exploring HCWs mental health during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Switzerland. In addition, we conducted a network analysis to investigate the independent effect of risk and protective factors on HCWs mental health and their interplay. Methods: In an exploratory, cross-sectional, nation-wide online survey, we assessed demographics, work characteristics, COVID-19 exposure, and anxiety, depression, and burnout in 857 physicians and 553 nurses during the pandemic in Switzerland. At the time of data collection, Switzerland had among the highest per capita rate of COVID-19 cases in the world. Results: Overall symptom levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout were elevated. Women, nurses, frontline staff and HCWs exposed to COVID-19 patients reported more symptoms than their peers. However, these effects were all small and, in the network analysis, most of them did not remain significant after controlling for the other factors. Whereas COVID-19 exposure was only partially associated with mental health, perceived support by the employer independently predicted anxiety and burnout. Conclusions: Our finding that HCWs had elevated levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout underscores the importance to systematically monitor HCWs mental health during this ongoing pandemic. Because perceived support and mental health impairments were negatively related, we encourage the implementation of supportive measures for HCWs well-being during this crisis.","Weilenmann, S.; Ernst, J.; Petry, H.; Sazpinar, O.; Pfaltz, M.

"Quantitative Estimation of Covid-19 Related Unemployment On Suicide and Excess Mortality in the United States","Introduction: To date, reducing virus transmission to mitigate demand on health care systems has been a singular objective of Covid-19 policy action. This aim has driven widespread and rapid application of untested policies to control contagion, including the deployment of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including travel restrictions, bans on gathering, and community-wide lockdowns. Risk models, public health experts and political leadership alike have given almost no attention to related, anticipated, and predictable societal and health impacts likely to result from behavioral responses to Covid-19 combined with the application of NPIs. Methods: This analysis demonstrates a standard risk assessment approach to quantify the impacts of Covid-19 unemployment in the United States on suicide and all cause mortality. Results: Applying observational epidemiological data to the population recently unemployed predicts 7444 deaths from suicide in the coming year and 556,000 avoidable deaths from all causes over the next ten years. Discussion: Indirect health impacts of societal responses to Covid-19 are likely and quantifiable. Decision-makers can now include indirect health impacts into their policy making calculus for Covid-19 to strike a balance between the benefits and costs of mitigation. A full trade-offs analysis of alternative planning scenarios will likely reveal multiple unconsidered ethical challenges that need transparent public discussion and solution.","Bhatia, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.20089086v1?rss=1""","20200508","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",741,""
"PREEXISTING COMORBIDITIES PREDICTING SEVERE COVID-19 IN OLDER ADULTS IN THE UK BIOBANK COMMUNITY COHORT","Background: Older COVID-19 hospitalized patients frequently have hypertension, diabetes or coronary heart disease (CHD), but whether these are more common than in the population is unclear. During the initial epidemic in England, virus testing for older adults was restricted to symptomatic hospitalized patients. We aimed to estimate associations between pre-existing diagnoses and COVID-19 status, in a large community cohort. Methods: UK Biobank (England) participants assessed 2006 to 2010, followed in hospital discharge records to 2017. Demographic and pre-existing common diagnoses association tested with COVID-19 status (16th March to 14th April 2020) in logistic models, adjusted for demographics, study site and other diagnoses. Results: There were 274,356 participants aged 65+, including 448 (0.16%) hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Common co-morbidities in patients were hypertension (58.5%), coronary heart disease (CHD, 21.1%), history of fall or fragility fractures (30.6%), and type 2 diabetes (19.6%). However, in adjusted models, COVID-19 patients were more likely than other participants to have pre-existing dementia (OR=3.07 95% CI 1.71 to 5.50), COPD (OR= 1.82 CI 1.33 to 2.49), depression (OR=1.81 CI 1.36 to 2.40), type 2 diabetes (OR=1.70 CI 1.30 to 2.21), chronic kidney disease and atrial fibrillation. Hypertension was modestly associated (OR=1.29 CI 1.04 to 1.59), but CHD (OR=0.92 CI 0.71 to 1.20) prevalence was similar in COVID-19 patients and other participants. Conclusion: Specific co-morbidities are disproportionally common in older adults who develop severe COVID-19. Tailored interventions may be needed, as these results do not support simple age-based targeting to prevent severe COVID-19 infection.","Atkins, J. L.; Masoli, J. A.; Delgado, J.; Pilling, L.

"Acute mental health responses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia","The acute and long-term mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown. The current study examined the acute mental health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in 5070 adult participants in Australia, using an online survey administered during the peak of the outbreak in Australia (27th March to 7th April 2020). Self-report questionnaires examined COVID-19 fears and behavioural responses to COVID-19, as well as the severity of psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress), health anxiety, contamination fears, alcohol use, and physical activity. 78% of respondents reported that their mental health had worsened since the outbreak, one quarter (25.9%) were very or extremely worried about contracting COVID-19, and half (52.7%) were worried about family and friends contracting COVID-19. Uncertainty, loneliness and financial worries (50%) were common. Rates of elevated psychological distress were higher than expected, with 62%, 50%, and 64% of respondents reporting elevated depression, anxiety and stress levels respectively, and one in four reporting elevated health anxiety in the past week. Participants with self-reported history of a mental health diagnosis had significantly higher distress, health anxiety, and COVID-19 fears than those without a prior mental health diagnosis. Demographic (e.g., non-binary or different gender identity; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status), occupational (e.g., being a carer or stay at home parent), and psychological (e.g., perceived risk of contracting COVID-19) factors were associated with distress. Results revealed that precautionary behaviours (e.g., washing hands, using hand sanitiser, avoiding social events) were common, although in contrast to previous research, higher engagement in hygiene behaviours was associated with higher stress and anxiety levels. These results highlight the serious acute impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of respondents, and the need for proactive, accessible digital mental health services to address these mental health needs, particularly for those most vulnerable, including people with prior history of mental health problems. Longitudinal research is needed to explore long-term predictors of poor mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Newby, J.; O'Moore, K.; Tang, S.; Christensen, H.; Faasse, K.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089961v1?rss=1""","20200508","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",743,""
"The prevalence of common and stress-related mental health disorders in healthcare workers based in pandemic-affected hospitals: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are considered at elevated risk of experiencing mental health disorders in working with patients with COVID-19. Aims: To estimate the prevalence of common mental health disorders in HCWs based in hospitals where pandemic-affected patients were treated. Method: Databases were searched for studies published before 30th March 2020. Quantitative synthesis was used to obtain estimates of the prevalence of mental health disorders in four time windows, determined a priori (the acute phase, i.e. during and up to 1.5 months post-pandemic; 1.5-5.9 months; 6-11.9 months; 12 months and later). Results: Nineteen studies met the review criteria. They predominantly addressed the acute phase of the SARS outbreak in Asia. The most studied outcomes were clinically-significant post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and general psychiatric caseness. For clinically significant PTSS in the acute phase, the prevalence estimate was 23.4% (95% CI 16.3, 31.2; N=4147; I2=96.2%); in the 12 months plus window, the estimate was 11.9% (8.4, 15.8; N=1136; I2=74.3%). For general psychiatric caseness, prevalence estimates were: acute phase, 34.1% (18.7, 51.4; N=3971; I2=99.1%); 6-12 months, 17.9% (13.1, 23.2; N=223; I2=0.0%); 12 months plus, 29.3% (6.0, 61.0; N=710; I2=97.8%). Conclusions: Mental health disorders are particularly common in HCWs working with pandemic-afflicted patients immediately following a pandemic, but the course of disorders following this period is poorly understood. PTSS remained elevated compared to the general population at 12 months, despite there being some evidence for natural recovery. There was considerable heterogeneity, likely linked to methodological differences. More extended follow up of HCWs is needed.","Allan, S.

"Emotional consequences of COVID-19 home confinement: The ECLB-COVID19 multicenter study","Abstract: Background: Public health recommendations and government measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have enforced restrictions on daily living, which may include social distancing, remote work/school, and home confinement. While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched on April 6, 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on mental health and emotional well-being. This report presents the preliminary results from the first thousand responders on mental wellbeing and mood and feelings questionnaires. Methods: The ECLB-COVID19 electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics, following a structured review of the literature. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform. Thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the multi-languages survey through their networks to general society. Of the 64 questions, 7 were from the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS), and 13 were from the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ), which are both validated instruments. Results: Analysis was conducted on the first 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%). The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on both mental wellbeing and on mood and feelings. Specifically, a significant decrease (p<0.001 and {Delta}%= 9.4 %) in the total score of mental wellbeing was noted. More individuals (+12.89%) reported a low mental wellbeing during compared to before home confinement. Furthermore, results from the mood and feelings questionnaire (i.e., depressive symptoms) showed a significant increase by 44.9% (p<0.001) in total score with more people (+10%) developing depressive symptoms during compared to before home confinement. Conclusion: The ECLB-COVID19 survey revealed an increased psychosocial strain triggered by the enforced home confinement. To mitigate this high risk of mental disorders and to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle (AHCL), a crisis-oriented interdisciplinary intervention is urgently needed.","AMMAR, A.; Mueller, P.; Trabelsi, K.; Chtourou, H.; Boukhris, O.; Masmoudi, L.; Bouaziz, B.; Brach, M.; Schmicker, M.; Bentlage, E.; How, D.; Ahmed, M.; Aloui, A.; Hammouda, O.; Paineiras-Domingos, L.

"Effects of home confinement on mental health and lifestyle behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak: Insight from the ""ECLB-COVID19"" multi countries survey","Background: Although recognised as effective measures to curb the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, social distancing and self-isolation, have been suggested to generate burden throughout the population. To provide scientific data to help identify risk-factors for the psychosocial strain during the COVID-19 outbreak, an international cross-disciplinary online survey was circulated in April 2020. This report outlines the mental, emotional and behavioural consequences of COVID-19 home confinement. Method: Thirty-five research organisations from four continents promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in Ten different languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement period. Results: 1047 replies (54% women) from Western-Asia (36%), North-Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other countries (3%) were analysed. The COVID-19 home confinement evoked a negative effect on mental wellbeing and emotional status (P < 0.001; 0.43 [&le;] d [&le;] 0.65) with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing psychosocial and emotional disorders (10% to 16.5%). These psychosocial tolls were associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours with a greater proportion of individuals experiencing (i) physical (+15.2%) and social (71.2%) inactivity, (ii) poor sleep quality (12.8%), (iii) unhealthy diet behaviours (10%), and (iv) unemployment (6%). Conversely, participants demonstrated a greater use (15%) of technology solutions during the confinement period.

"Scaling COVID-19 against inequalities: should the policy response consistently match the mortality challenge?","Background The mortality impact of COVID-19 has thus far been described in terms of crude death counts. We aimed to calibrate the scale of the modelled mortality impact of COVID-19 using age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contribution against other, socially-determined, causes of death in order to inform governments and the public. Methods We compared mortality attributable to suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality with estimates of mortality from an infectious disease model of COVID-19. We calculated age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contributions for the UK and its constituent nations. Results Mortality from a fully unmitigated COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to be responsible for a negative life expectancy contribution of -5.96 years for the UK. This is reduced to -0.33 years in the fully mitigated scenario. The equivalent annual life expectancy contributions of suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality-related deaths are -0.25, -0.20 and -3.51 years respectively. The negative impact of fully unmitigated COVID-19 on life expectancy is therefore equivalent to 24 years of suicide deaths, 30 years of drug poisoning deaths, and 1.7 years of inequality-related deaths for the UK. Conclusion Fully mitigating COVID-19 is estimated to prevent a loss of 5.63 years of life expectancy for the UK. Over 10 years there is a greater negative life expectancy contribution from inequality than around six unmitigated COVID-19 pandemics. To achieve long-term population health improvements it is therefore important to take this opportunity to introduce post-pandemic economic policies to build back better.","McCartney, G.; Leyland, A.; Walsh, D.; Dundas, R.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.04.20090761v1?rss=1""","20200507","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",747,""
"Depression, Anxiety and Depression-anxiety comorbidity amid COVID-19 Pandemic: An online survey conducted during lockdown in Nepal","Background: Little is known about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health status during the lock-down period. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess prevalence of depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety comorbidity, and associated factors during the COVID-19 lock-down in Nepal. Methods A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted among the general population of Nepal. Data was collected from April 9 to April 16, 2020 using an e-questionnaire which was shared through different popular social media. A total of 349 participants were included. Self-reported depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety tools respectively. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors associated with depression, anxiety and depression and anxiety co-morbidity. Results The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety co-morbidity were found to be 34.0%, 31.0% and 23.2% respectively. The multi-variate analysis showed that females, those living alone, health professionals and those who spent more time in accessing information about COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety co-morbidity. Conclusions High rates of depression and anxiety and co-morbidity were found to be prevailing among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic lock-down in Nepal. The results suggest that only the scientific, but contextually appropriate messages about the disease should be disseminated to reduce unnecessary fears and anxiety. Awareness interventions to promote mental well-being need to be integrated into the response interventions. Community mental health care should be made accessible to at-risk groups.","Sigdel, A.; Bista, A.; Bhattarai, N.; Poon, B.

"FACTORS INFLUENCING MENTAL HEALTH DURING COVID-19 OUTBREAK: AN EXPLORATORY SURVEY AMONG INDIAN POPULATION","Purpose: Research on the impact of social distancing on mental health during epidemics is limited, especially in India. The purpose of this study is to scale the association between anxiety and socio-demographic factors during Covid19 lockdown among the general Indian population. Design/methodology/approach: A descriptive cross-sectional nationwide study was designed to enrol the general population. The inclusion criteria for this study were Indian citizens aged 15 years and above. The study was conducted from 29th March to 12th April 2020, using an online google questionnaire. The anxiety among respondents was detected and measured using a Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale which consists of 7 questions (in English), i.e. GAD-7. Findings: Respondees were 398, and from these participants, the prevalence of anxiety was 25.4 per cent. Based on the bivariate logistic regression analysis, the predictors of anxiety were gender, religion, occupation as business/self- employed, marital status, family size, health status and sleep deprivation. Conclusion: This study reports the prevalence of anxiety among Indian population who were grounded at their homes during lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic in the country. Limitations: (1) The selection of participants through non-random sampling. (2) Because of the cross-sectional character of the study, causal conclusions cannot be drawn. Originality/Value: This paper fulfils an identified need to study the mental health status of the population under situations like lockdown, thereby helping fill a persistent gap in Indian research on this issue.

"Coronavirus Infection and PARP Expression Dysregulate the NAD Metabolome: A Potentially Actionable Component of Innate Immunity","SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus (CoV) and cause of COVID-19, which is much more lethal in older people and those with comorbid conditions for unknown reasons. Innate immune responses to CoVs are initiated by recognition of double-stranded RNA and induction of interferon, which turns on a gene expression program that inhibits viral replication. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, ferrets and a person strikingly dysregulates the NAD gene set by inducing a set of PARP family members that includes enzymes required for the innate immune response to CoVs. CoV infection also induces a severe attack on host cell NAD. Overexpression of one induced enzyme, PARP10, is sufficient to depress host NAD. Gene expression and pharmacological data suggest that boosting NAD through the nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside kinase pathways may restore antiviral PARP functions to support innate immunity to CoVs, whereas PARP1,2 inhibition does not restore PARP10 activity.

Impact statementSpecific disturbances in the NAD gene set, NAD metabolome and PARP activity were discovered as a defining feature of coronavirus infection that may lead to methods to boost innate immunity.","Heer, C.

Data from China suggest that the new virus poses additional risks as case fatality of patients with cancer was higher at 5.6% compared to 2.3% of the general population. There are three proposed major strategies to address care for patients with cancer in this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with postponing treatment for those with stable cancer, increasing personal protection provisions for patients with cancer, and increasing monitoring if a patient becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this present commentary, we discuss the unique mental health challenges and burdens of patients with head and neck cancer in the times of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and approaches to mitigate these stressors through telemedicine to reduce future burdens to the patient and the health care system.","Huang, Victoria W.; Imam, Sarah A.; Nguyen, Shaun A.","https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26235","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",754,""

"Impact of home quarantine on physical activity for older adults living at home during the Covid-19 pandemic: Qualitative interview study","BACKGROUND: Older adults and those with pre-existing medical conditions are at risk for dying of SARS CoV-2. In this periodof quarantine, one of the reasons for going out is physical activity (PA). This issue is important as the impact of a sedentarylifestyle might be lower for children and young adults, but far more crucial for older adults. Indeed, they need to stay at homebecause they have a higher risk of a Covid-19 infection but they also need to avoid sedentarily. PA is important for older adults,especially to maintain their level of independence, their mental health, and well-being. Maintaining mobility in old age is,therefore, necessary, as it may predict loss of independence in older adults. OBJECTIVE: Our first objective was to evaluate the impact of this quarantine period on PA program organizations and on thephysical and mental health of older adults. Our second objective was to discuss which alternatives could be suggested to thispopulation to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. METHODS: We decided to conduct a qualitative survey by semi-structured interviews with professionals (managers in charge ofPA programs for older adults and sports trainers who run these PA programs) from the French Federation of Physical Educationand Voluntary Gymnastics (FFPEVG) and older adults participating in a PA program of the FFPEVG. We followed a commoninterview guide (appendix 1 and 2). For analysis, we carried out a thematic analysis of the interviews. RESULTS: This study suggests that the Covid-19 epidemic has affected, before quarantine measures, the number of seniorsattending group PA programs in our two study territories. Another result of our study is that despite the decline in older adults'participation in-group physical activities before the quarantine, they expressed the need to do physical activity at home. There isa need to help older adults integrate simple, safe ways to stay physically active in limited space. A national policy to supportolder adults for PA at home appears essential in this context. Given the results of our study, it seems necessary to address globalcommunication toward older adults about the importance of maintaining PA at home. CONCLUSIONS: We wonder about the level of independence and mental health in which the older adults will be after the end ofquarantine if there is no appropriate campaign to promote PA at home for them.","Goethals, Luc; Barth, Nathalie; Guyot, Jessica; Hupin, David; Celarier, Thomas; Bongue, Bienvenu","https://doi.org/10.2196/19007","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",758,""

Cancer care in LMICs, including Ghana, is faced with inadequate numbers of skilled healthcare professionals and essential material resources which negatively impacts the quality of healthcare and wellbeing of patients. In the face of COVID-19, cancer patients are likely to be affected in three key ways: access to healthcare, increased financial toxicity and increased mental health burden as a consequence of strict measures being implemented to contain the virus in Ghana, including partial lockdowns and social distancing. Some cultural beliefs regarding COVID-19 and its influence on the health and wellbeing of cancer patients have also been discussed. Measures by the government to lessen the burden on citizens and health workers are highlighted with possible recommendations for improvement in cancer care in Ghana and other LMICs during this pandemic.","Kugbey, Nuworza; Ohene-Oti, Naomi; Vanderpuye, Verna","https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.ed99","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",760,""
"Agile requirements engineering and software planning for a digital health platform to engage the effects of isolation caused by social distancing: A case study and feasibility study protocol","BACKGROUND: Social distancing measures have been put in place to reduce social interaction to slow transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19). For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships. As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns. OBJECTIVE: This project aims to provide a tool for older people, their families, and peers to improve their wellbeing and health during and after regulated social distancing. Firstly, we will evaluate the tool's feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction during social-distancing. Secondly, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting. Anonymised data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine-learning algorithm to improve COVID-19 patient identification and track for real-time use by health systems. METHODS: Development of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress. To mitigate potential issues of non-adoption of the proposed intervention, the system was designed using the non-adoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread and sustainability (NASSS) framework. The application development framework utilised was based on Agile methods. RESULTS: Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behaviour change, a proof of concept was developed, and multi-stage application development and deployment for the solution created. Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and pre-discovery iteration of the solution has begun. Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought. CONCLUSIONS: This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures. The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app. This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation and loneliness.

"Prevalence and socio-demographic correlates of psychological health problems in Chinese adolescents during the outbreak of COVID-19","Psychological health problems, especially emotional disorders, are common among adolescents. The epidemiology of emotional disorders is greatly influenced by stressful events. This study sought to assess the prevalence rate and socio-demographic correlates of depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional study among Chinese students aged 12â€“18Â years during the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to conduct rapid assessment. A total of 8079 participants were involved in the study. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, assess studentsâ€™ awareness of COVID-19, and assess depressive and anxiety symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, respectively. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and a combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 43.7%, 37.4%, and 31.3%, respectively, among Chinese high school students during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender was the higher risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms. In terms of grades, senior high school was a risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms; the higher the grade, the greater the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Our findings show there is a high prevalence of psychological health problems among adolescents, which are negatively associated with the level of awareness of COVID-19. These findings suggest that the government needs to pay more attention to psychological health among adolescents while combating COVID-19.","Zhou, Shuang-Jiang; Zhang, Li-Gang; Wang, Lei-Lei; Guo, Zhao-Chang; Wang, Jing-Qi; Chen, Jin-Cheng; Liu, Mei; Chen, Xi; Chen, Jing-Xu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-020-01541-4","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",764,""

"Battle Buddies: Rapid Deployment of a Psychological Resilience Intervention for Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its rapid global spread have created unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems. Significant and sustained efforts have focused on mobilization of personal protective equipment, intensive care beds, and medical equipment, while substantially less attention has focused on preserving the psychological health of the medical workforce tasked with addressing the challenges of the pandemic. And yet, similar to battlefield conditions, healthcare workers are being confronted with ongoing uncertainty about resources, capacities, and risks; as well as exposure to suffering, death, and threats to their own safety. These conditions are engendering high levels of fear and anxiety in the short-term, and place individuals at risk for persistent stress-exposure syndromes, sub-clinical mental health symptoms, and professional burnout in the long-term. Given the potentially wide-ranging mental health impact of COVID-19, protecting healthcare workers from adverse psychological effects of the pandemic is critical.Therefore, we present an overview of the potential psychological stress responses to the COVID-19 crisis in medical providers and describe pre-emptive resilience-promoting strategies at the organizational and personal level. We then describe a rapidly deployable Psychological Resilience Intervention founded on a peer-support model (Battle Buddies) developed by the United States Army. This intervention-- the product of a multidisciplinary collaboration between the Departments of Anesthesiology and Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences at the University of Minnesota Medical Center-- also incorporates evidence-informed ""stress inoculation"" methods developed for managing psychological stress exposure in providers deployed to disasters. Our multi-level, resource-efficient, and scalable approach places two key tools directly in the hands of providers: 1) A peer-support Battle Buddy; and 2) A designated mental health consultant who can facilitate training in stress inoculation methods, provide additional support, or coordinate referral for external professional consultation. In parallel, we have instituted a voluntary research data-collection component that will enable us to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness while also identifying the most salient resilience factors for future iterations. It is our hope that these elements will provide guidance to other organizations seeking to protect the well-being of their medical workforce during the pandemic. Given the remarkable adaptability of human beings, we believe that, by promoting resilience, our diverse healthcare workforce can emerge from this monumental challenge with new skills, closer relationships, and greater confidence in the power of community.","Albott, Cristina Sophia; Wozniak, Jeffrey R.; McGlinch, Brian P.; Wall, Michael H.; Gold, Barbara S.; Vinogradov, Sophia","https://doi.org/10.1213/ANE.0000000000004912","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",768,""

This provides challenges for the use of secondary prevention measures in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this Position Statement is to review the implications for effective delivery of secondary prevention strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Challenges The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced limitations for many patients to access standard health services such as visits to health care professionals, medications, imaging and blood tests as well as attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. In addition, the pandemic is having an impact on lifestyle habits and mental health. Taken together, this has the potential to adversely impact the ability of practitioners and patients to adhere to treatment guidelines for the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events. Recommendations Every effort should be made to deliver safe ongoing access to health care professionals and the use of evidenced based therapies in individuals with CVD. An increase in use of a range of electronic health platforms has the potential to transform secondary prevention. Integrating research programs that evaluate the utility of these approaches may provide important insights into how to develop more optimal approaches to secondary prevention beyond the pandemic.","Nicholls, Stephen J.; Nelson, Mark; Astley, Carolyn; Briffa, Tom; Brown, Alex; Clark, Robyn; Colquhoun, David; Gallagher, Robyn; Hare, David L.; Inglis, Sally; Jelinek, Michael; Oâ€™Neil, Adrienne; Tirimacco, Rosy; Vale, Margarite; Redfern, Julie","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2020.04.007","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",769,""

"[Public Mental Health as One of the Key Factors in Dealing with COVID-19]","AIM: The aim of the article is to point out the important role of prevention and reduction of mental stress in the general population and in sensitive groups in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: This article includes the analysis and evaluation of studies and recommendations from organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) that have examined the psychological consequences of epidemics/pandemics on people and their impact on the further course. RESULTS: Fear-related behaviors can adversely affect the course of epidemics. Past outbreaks of infectious diseases (Ebola and Zika virus) have shown that maladaptive behavior, related to increased psychological stress and anxiety, can interfere with the implementation of treatment strategies and actions and can contribute to a further spread. Hereby, strategies for dealing with infectious diseases, that include the suppression of fear, can trigger a vicious circle in which fear and suppression mutually reinforce each other. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic poses an immense challenge to governments, health systems and people, with an uncertain outcome, which is associated with a significant burden of mental health in the population. In line with WHO recommendations, national guidelines and preventive measures should include the psychological consequences, the acceptance and normalization of fears and the promotion of resilience in the population in dealing with COVID-19 in order to counteract a further spread.","Hahad, Omar; Gilan, Donya A.; Daiber, Andreas; MÃ¼nzel, Thomas","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1160-5770","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",772,""

"How an Epidemic Outbreak Impacts Happiness: Factors that Worsen (vs Protect) Emotional Well-being during the Coronavirus Pandemic","What are the factors that worsen (vs. protect) emotional well-being during a pandemic outbreak such as COVID-19? Through two large-scale nationwide surveys (N1<U+202F>=<U+202F>11,131; N2<U+202F>=<U+202F>3,000) conducted in China immediately before versus during the coronavirus outbreak, we found that the onset of the coronavirus epidemic led to a 74% drop in overall emotional well-being. Factors associated with the likelihood of contracting the disease (e.g., residing near the epicenter), extent of potential harm (e.g., being an elderly), and relational concerns (e.g., those within a marriage) exacerbated the detrimental effect of the outbreak on emotional well-being. Further, individualsâ€™ perception of their knowledge about coronavirus infection was another factor. Regardless of the actual amount of knowledge they possessed, those perceiving themselves as more knowledgeable, were able to experience more happiness during the outbreak. Higher perceived knowledge was associated with a stronger sense of control, which mediated the differences in emotional well-being. These patterns persisted even after controlling for a host of demographic and economic variables.

"A cutting-edge immunoinformatics approach for design of multi-epitope oral vaccine against dreadful human malaria","Human malaria is a pathogenic disease mainly caused by Plasmodium falciparum, which was responsible for about 405,000 deaths globally in the year 2018. To date, several vaccine candidates have been evaluated for prevention, which failed to produce optimal output at various preclinical/clinical stages. This study is based on designing of polypeptide vaccines (PVs) against human malaria that cover almost all stages of life cycle of Plasmodium and for the same 5 genome derived predicted antigenic proteins (GDPAP) have been used. For the development of a multi-immune inducer, 15 PVs were initially designed using T cell epitope ensemble which covered >99% human population as well as linear B cell epitopes with or without adjuvants. The immune simulation of PVs showed higher levels of T-cell and B-cell activities compared to positive and negative vaccine controls. Furthermore, in silico cloning of PVs and codon optimization followed by enhanced expression within Lactococcus lactis host system was also explored. Although, the study has sound theoretical and in silico findings, the in vitro/in vivo evaluation seems imperative to warrant the immunogenicity and safety of PVs towards management of P. falciparum infection in the future.","Pritam, Manisha; Singh, Garima; Swaroop, Suchit; Singh, Akhilesh Kumar; Pandey, Brijesh; Singh, Satarudra Prakash","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.04.191","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",777,""
"Letter to the editor: Evidence on school closure and childrenâ€™s social contact: useful for coronavirus disease (COVID-19)?","We read with interest the recent rapid evidence review by Brooks and colleagues about the impact of unplanned school closure on childrenâ€™s social contact [1]. This review substantially aimed at investigating if children adhere to social isolation or continue to mix with others, limiting the effects of school closure and of quarantine. This is an important topic, the of dark side of which resides on effects of prolonged school closure on well-being of children, poorly considered in the current public debate on management of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [2]. In this perspective, mental health of children and adolescents undergoes a sudden stress test during school closure, with increased risk of loneliness, addiction to videogames and binge watching, alteration of circadian rhythms, direct or assisted domestic violence, and academic achievement gaps. Especially for the latter, inequalities related to socioeconomic status and differences related to pre-existing vulnerabilities will be further amplified [2-4]. Brooks and colleagues [1] clearly reviewed literature on unplanned school closure to extract potential clues in relation to the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic, but generalisability of findings for this aim is questionable, as acknowledged by authors in the discussion. Two intertwined main obstacles for the generalisability of findings relate to the geographic expansion of the pandemic and to the temporal duration of school closures. Examined studies were almost entirely based on experiences in context with the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic or other influenza-like outbreaks, that did not have the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, being geographically limited in some areas. Moreover, duration of previous experiences of school closures ranged from 1 day to 2 weeks, while the current COVID-19 pandemic is causing much longer school closures. For example, in Italy, children and adolescents will be away from schools for almost 6 months (3 months of school closure plus 3 months of usual summer vacation), with the vague possibility of summer camps, in our opinion actually with low probability to be allowed and implemented. Therefore, findings based on geographically and temporally limited school closures may be poorly informative for a pandemic at the scale of COVID-19 and consequent temporally extended school closures. This is the case because risk perception of children and also of their parents (other factors that Brooks and colleagues found related to the respect of social isolation [1]) is clearly different in the two scenarios and therefore also adherence to social isolation is probably different [5]. In this perspective, one of the main conclusions of the review, i.e. during school closure children continue having social contacts with others, is very poorly informative to predict adherence to social isolation of children during school closure along the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, considering how much social isolation may affect mental health of children and adolescents [2-4], we strongly suggest that medical, educational and economical authorities should implement as soon as possible strategic plans for a progressive re-start of school or educational activities. This re-start should ensure a calculated trade-off between risk of COVID-19 infection and reduction of risk for childrenâ€™s well-being, especially for more vulnerable subgroups, as those of families with low socioeconomic status and those with pre-existing mental health problems or learning difficulties.","Poletti, Michele; Raballo, Andrea","doi:https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.17.2000758","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",778,""
"Peer mentoring for medical students during COVID-19 pandemic via a social media platform","Abstract In many contexts, medical students collaborate with health care workers to deliver patient management and care in emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. In others, medical students are experiencing an unintended pause in their education due to global university closure over COVID-19 concerns. In either situation, students find themselves coping with mental and emotional issues, including stress, anxiety, and fear, that may require significant psychological and physical effort. Therefore, it is important that medical schools not only care about students' mental health but also implement strategies to support their understanding of crisis management, self-mental care, and other principal measures in order to strengthen their coping skills and mental preparedness.","Rastegar Kazerooni, AmirAli; Amini, Mitra; Tabari, Parinaz; Moosavi, Mahsa","https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14206","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",779,""

"Immediate and long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on delivery of surgical services","BACKGROUND: The ongoing pandemic is having a collateral health effect on delivery of surgical care to millions of patients. Very little is known about pandemic management and effects on other services, including delivery of surgery. METHODS: This was a scoping review of all available literature pertaining to COVID-19 and surgery, using electronic databases, society websites, webinars and preprint repositories. RESULTS: Several perioperative guidelines have been issued within a short time. Many suggestions are contradictory and based on anecdotal data at best. As regions with the highest volume of operations per capita are being hit, an unprecedented number of operations are being cancelled or deferred. No major stakeholder seems to have considered how a pandemic deprives patients with a surgical condition of resources, with patients disproportionally affected owing to the nature of treatment (use of anaesthesia, operating rooms, protective equipment, physical invasion and need for perioperative care). No recommendations exist regarding how to reopen surgical delivery. The postpandemic evaluation and future planning should involve surgical services as an essential part to maintain appropriate surgical care for the population during an outbreak. Surgical delivery, owing to its cross-cutting nature and synergistic effects on health systems at large, needs to be built into the WHO agenda for national health planning. CONCLUSION: Patients are being deprived of surgical access, with uncertain loss of function and risk of adverse prognosis as a collateral effect of the pandemic. Surgical services need a contingency plan for maintaining surgical care in an ongoing or postpandemic phase.","SÃ¸reide, K.; Hallet, J.; Matthews, J. B.; Schnitzbauer, A. A.; Line, P. D.; Lai, P. B.

"Survey of Insomnia and Related Social Psychological Factors Among Medical Staff Involved in the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outbreak","Objective: The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) not only caused particularly large public health problems, but also caused great psychological distress, especially for medical staff. We aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of insomnia and to confirm the related social psychological factors among medical staff in hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method: Medical staff members in China were recruited, including frontline medical workers. The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self-design questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress-related symptoms. We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms. Result: There were a total of 1,563 participants in our study. Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score >/= 8). A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, p = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.0-7.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, p = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.2-0.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, p = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.0-2.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.6-3.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID-19 (OR = 2.10, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.3-3.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, p = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.3-8.5). Conclusion: Our study found that more than one-third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. The related factors included education level, an isolation environment, psychological worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, and being a doctor. Interventions for insomnia among medical staff are needed considering the various sociopsychological factors at play in this situation.","Zhang, Chenxi; Yang, Lulu; Liu, Shuai; Ma, Simeng; Wang, Ying; Cai, Zhongxiang; Du, Hui; Li, Ruiting; Kang, Lijun; Su, Meilei; Zhang, Jihui; Liu, Zhongchun; Zhang, Bin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00306","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",782,""

While gradual release from lockdown will maintain protection of those most at risk from covid-19, older people will experience social isolation for the longest period as the over 75s carry the highest mortality risk (WHO, 2020). Isolation is strongly linked to depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline, and reduces resilience factors such as self-worth, sense of purpose and feeling valued (Novotney, 2019).

"Adapting IAPT Services to Support Frontline NHS Staff during the Covid-19 Pandemic: The Homerton Covid Psychological Support (HCPS) Pathway","The Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic is exerting unprecedented pressure on NHS Health and Social Care provisions, with frontline staff, such as those of critical care units, encountering vast practical and emotional challenges on a daily basis. Although staff are being supported through organisational provisions, facilitated by those in leadership roles, the emergence of mental health difficulties or the exacerbation of existing ones amongst these members of staff is a cause for concern. Acknowledging this, academics and healthcare professionals alike are calling for psychological support for frontline staff, which not only addresses distress during the initial phases of the outbreak but also over the months, if not years, that follow. Fortunately, mental health services and psychology professional bodies across the United Kingdom have issued guidance to meet these needs. An attempt has been made to translate these sets of guidance into clinical provisions via the recently established Homerton Covid Psychological Support (HCPS) pathway delivered by Talk Changes (Hackney &amp; City IAPT). This article describes the phased, stepped-care and evidence-based approach that has been adopted by the service to support local frontline NHS staff. We wish to share our service design and pathway of care with other IAPT services who may also seek to support hospital frontline staff within their associated NHS Trusts and in doing so, lay the foundations of a coordinated response.","Cole, C.

"Severe psychological distress among epilepsy patients during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwest China","Summary Objective To compare the severity of psychological distress between epilepsy patients and healthy controls during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwest China, as well as identify potential risk factors of severe psychological distress among epilepsy patients. Methods This cross-sectional case control study examined a consecutive sample of patients older than 15 years treated at the epilepsy center of West China Hospital between 01 and 29 February 2020. As controls, sex- and age-matched healthy visitors of inpatients (unrelated to the patients) were also enrolled during the same period. Data on demographics and attention paid to COVID-19 were collected by online questionnaire, data on epilepsy features were collected from electronic medical records, and psychological distress was evaluated using the Kessler 6-item (K-6) psychological distress scale. Potential risk factors of severe psychological distress were identified using multivariate logistic regression. Results The 252 patients and 252 controls in this study were similar along all demographic variables except family income. Patients with epilepsy showed significantly higher K-6 scores than healthy controls and spent significantly more time following the COVID-19 outbreak (both p < 0.001). Univariate analyses associated both diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy and time spent paying attention to COVID-19 with severe psychological distress (defined as K-6 score > 12) (both p = 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression identified two independent predictors of severe psychological distress: time spent paying attention to COVID-19 (OR 1.172, 95%CI 1.073, 1.280) and diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy (OR 0.283, 95%CI 0.128, 0.623). Significance During public health outbreaks, clinicians and caregivers should focus not only on seizure control but also on mental health of epilepsy patients, especially those with drug-resistant epilepsy. K-6 scores more than 12 should be indicated as severe psychological distress. This may mean, for example, encouraging patients to engage in other activities instead of excessively following media coverage of the outbreak.","Hao, Xiaoting; Zhou, Dong; Li, Zhe; Zeng, Guojun; Hao, Nanya; Li, Enzhi; Li, Wenjing; Deng, Aiping; Lin, Mintao; Yan, Bo","https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.16544","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",790,""
"Mental Health in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Emergency-The Italian Response","IMPORTANCE: This article briefly reports the experience of mental health services and the lessons learned during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis. In particular, this report offers opportunities to build on experience gained in managing the COVID-19 emergency in the Departments of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHAs) in Lombardy, the wealthiest Italian region, which has approximately 10 million inhabitants. OBSERVATIONS: Italy has a National Mental Health System divided into 134 DMHAs, 27 of which are in Lombardy. In the 4 weeks after the epidemic started, important changes occurred in the management of DMHAs in Lombardy. Many challenges have occurred in the management of health services. In many hospitals, entire wards, including some psychiatric wards, have been reorganized to admit patients with COVID-19, and many physicians and nurses have been diverted to wards managing patients with COVID-19. Most day facilities for patients with psychiatric needs have been temporarily closed, whereas in residential facilities, patients who usually are free to come and go during the day have had to be confined in the facilities with very limited or no leave. These changes have produced considerable stresses on people with severe mental disorders. Many outpatient clinics have limited appointments to those with the most urgent cases, and home visits, a common practice in most DMHAs, have been drastically reduced with potentially detrimental consequences for patients' well-being. Another potential detrimental consequence of being forced to stay at home has been an increase in the hours spent face to face with families with high amounts of conflict. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Departments of Mental Health need to be equipped with appropriate e-health technologies and procedures to cope with situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, interventions are needed to mitigate the potentially harmful consequences of quarantine. Departments of Mental Health should be able to assume a leadership position in the psychosocial management of disasterlike situations, and this requires the acquisition of new skills, notably how to correctly inform the population about risk, train and disseminate effective preventive and management procedures for disasters, support health personnel and rescuers, and support those experiencing bereavement.","de Girolamo, Giovanni; Cerveri, Giancarlo; Clerici, Massimo; Monzani, Emiliano; Spinogatti, Franco; Starace, Fabrizio; Tura, Giambattista; Vita, Antonio","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.1276","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",791,""

Anxiety regarding contracting the virus is prominent in the public. Specific routes to anxiety over disease contraction are under studied. It is expected that a contributory feature of fear of contracting COVID-19 involve disgust propensity and sensitivity, emotional reactions that are part of a broader behavioral immune system (BIS). A total of N<U+2009>=<U+2009>908 Chinese adults (mean age<U+2009>=<U+2009>40.37 years, SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.27; n<U+2009>=<U+2009>752 female) participated in a survey distributed between February 24 and March 15, 2020. Participants completed measures of anxiety sensitivity, disgust propensity and sensitivity, and fear of contracting COVID-19. Results support a moderating relationship between both disgust propensity and sensitivity in the relationship between physical concerns associated with anxiety sensitivity and fear of contracting COVID-19.

Multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to examine the associations between sociodemographic variables; personality traits; depression, anxiety, and stress. Female gender, negative affect, and detachment were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Having an acquaintance infected was associated with increased levels of both depression and stress, whereas a history of stressful situations and medical problems was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Finally, those with a family member infected and young person who had to work outside their domicile presented higher levels of anxiety and stress, respectively. This epidemiological picture is an important benchmark for identifying persons at greater risk of suffering from psychological distress and the results are useful for tailoring psychological interventions targeting the post-traumatic nature of the distress.","Mazza, Cristina; Ricci, Eleonora; Biondi, Silvia; Colasanti, Marco; Ferracuti, Stefano; Napoli, Christian; Roma, Paolo","https://doi.org/10.3390/IJERPH17093165","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",802,""
"Focus on Mental Health During the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic: Applying Learnings from the Past Outbreaks","The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has gained global attention after it originated from China at the end of 2019, and later turned into pandemic as it affected about 118,000 in 114 countries by March 11, 2020. By March 13, 2020, it was declared a national emergency in the United States as the number of COVID-19 cases, and the death toll rose exponentially. To contain the spread of the disease, the world scientist community came together. However, the unpreparedness of the nations, even with the advanced medical sciences and resources, has failed to address the mental health aspect amongst the public, as all efforts are focused on understanding the epidemiology, clinical features, transmission patterns, and management of COVID-19 pneumonia. Our efforts in this review are to evaluate and study similar outbreaks from the past to understand its adverse impact on mental health, implement adequate steps to tackle and provide a background to physicians and healthcare workers at the time of such outbreaks to apply psychological first aid.","Shah, Kaushal; Kamrai, Dhwani; Mekala, Hema; Mann, Birinder; Desai, Krishna; Patel, Rikinkumar S.","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7405","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",803,""
"Health Communication Through News Media During the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Outbreak in China: Digital Topic Modeling Approach","Background: In December 2019, a few coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China. Soon after, increasing numbers of cases were detected in other parts of China, eventually leading to a disease outbreak in China. As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus, such as its pathogenesis, spread, prevention, and containment. Objective: The aim of this study was to collect media reports on COVID-19 and investigate the patterns of media-directed health communications as well as the role of the media in this ongoing COVID-19 crisis in China. Methods: We adopted the WiseSearch database to extract related news articles about the coronavirus from major press media between January 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. We then sorted and analyzed the data using Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a suitable topic number with evidence of the coherence number. We operated latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling with a suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. We then divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into a 2D plane via multidimensional scaling. Results: After removing duplications and irrelevant reports, our search identified 7791 relevant news reports. We listed the number of articles published per day. According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as the number of topics and generated the topicsâ€™ themes and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine main primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. The top three most popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, and global or local social and economic influences, accounting for 32.57% (n=2538), 16.08% (n=1258), and 11.79% (n=919) of the collected reports, respectively. Conclusions: Topic modeling of news articles can produce useful information about the significance of mass media for early health communication. Comparing the number of articles for each day and the outbreak development, we noted that mass media news reports in China lagged behind the development of COVID-19. The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society rather than on individuals. The COVID-19 crisis has become a worldwide issue, and society has become concerned about donations and support as well as mental health among others. We recommend that future work addresses the mass mediaâ€™s actual impact on readers during the COVID-19 crisis through sentiment analysis of news data.","Liu, Qian; Zheng, Zequan; Zheng, Jiabin; Chen, Qiuyi; Liu, Guan; Chen, Sihan; Chu, Bojia; Zhu, Hongyu; Akinwunmi, Babatunde; Huang, Jian; Zhang, Casper J P; Ming, Wai-Kit","https://doi.org/10.2196/19118","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",804,""

"Is Returning to Work during the COVID-19 Pandemic Stressful? A Study on Immediate Mental Health Status and Psychoneuroimmunity Prevention Measures of Chinese Workforce","This study aimed to quantify the immediate psychological effects and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of a workforce returning to work during the COVID-19 epidemic. Workforce returning to work was invited to complete an online questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the COVID-19 epidemic and return-to-work along with psychological parameters including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures include precautions at personal and organization levels. From 673 valid questionnaires, we found that 10.8% of respondents met the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after returning to work. The respondents reported a low prevalence of anxiety (3.8%), depression (3.7%), stress (1.5%) and insomnia (2.3%). There were no significant differences in the severity of psychiatric symptoms between workers/technicians and executives/managers. More than 95% reported psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including good ventilation in the workplace and wore a face mask as protective. Factors that were associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce were marital status, presence of physical symptom, poor physical health and viewing return to work as a health hazard (p<0.05). In contrast, personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company were associated with less severe psychiatric symptoms (p<0.05). Contrary to expectations, returning to work had not caused a high level of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce. The low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms could be due to confidence instilled by psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures before the resumption of work. Our findings would provide information for other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tan, Wanqiu; Hao, Fengyi; McIntyre, Roger S.; Jiang, Li; Jiang, Xiaojiang; Zhang, Ling; Zhao, Xinling; Zou, Yiran; Hu, Yirong; Luo, Xi; Zhang, Zhisong; Lai, Andre; Ho, Roger; Tran, Bach; Ho, Cyrus; Tam, Wilson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.055","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",806,""
"Comparison of Prevalence and Associated Factors of Anxiety and Depression Among People Affected by versus People Unaffected by Quarantine During the COVID-19 Epidemic in Southwestern China","BACKGROUND At the end of 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak began in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and spread rapidly to the whole country within 1 month. This new epidemic caused a great mental reaction among the public. This study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression among the public affected by quarantine and those unaffected during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data were collected using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and the self-rating depression scale (SDS) administered to 1593 respondents aged 18 years and above. The respondents were grouped as 'affected group' and 'unaffected group' on the basis of whether they or their families/colleagues/classmates/neighbors had been quarantined. RESULTS Among 1593 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was approximately 8.3% and 14.6%, respectively, and the prevalence in the affected group (12.9%, 22.4%) was significantly higher than that in the unaffected group (6.7%, 11.9%). Lower average household income, lower education level, having a higher self-evaluated level of knowledge, being more worried about being infected, having no psychological support, greater property damage, and lower self-perceived health condition were significant associated with higher scores on the SAS and SDS. People living in Chongqing had higher SAS and SDS scores than those living in Yunnan Province. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of anxiety and depression of the affected group are higher than in the unaffected group during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. The government should focus more on providing economic and medical support to improve the general population's mental state.","Lei, Lei; Huang, Xiaoming; Zhang, Shuai; Yang, Jinrong; Yang, Lin; Xu, Min","https://doi.org/10.12659/MSM.924609","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",807,""
"Do psychiatric patients experience more psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown? A Case-Control Study with Service and Research Implications for Immunopsychiatry","This study aimed to assess and compare the immediate stress and psychological impact experienced by people with and without psychiatric illnesses during the peak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Seventy-six psychiatric patients and 109 healthy control subjects were recruited from Chongqing, China and completed a survey on demographic data, physical symptoms during the past 14 days and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale- Revised (IES-R), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. The mean IES-R, DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress subscale and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p<0.001). Serious worries about their physical health, anger and impulsivity and intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p<0.05). More than one-third of psychiatric patients might fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More than one-quarter of psychiatric patients suffered from moderately severe to severe insomnia. Respondents who reported no change, poor or worse physical health status and had a psychiatric illness were significantly more likely to have higher mean IES-R, DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscale scores and ISI scores (p<0.05). This study confirms the severity of negative psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Understanding the psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to provide insight into how to develop a new immunopsychiatry service. Further research is required to compare pro-inflammatory cytokines between psychiatric patients and healthy controls during the pandemic.","Hao, Fengyi; Tan, Wanqiu; Jiang, Li; Zhang, Ling; Zhao, Xinling; Zou, Yiran; Hu, Yirong; Luo, Xi; Jiang, Xiaojiang; McIntyre, Roger S.; Tran, Bach; Sun, Jiaqian; Zhang, Zhisong; Ho, Roger; Ho, Cyrus; Tam, Wilson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.069","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",808,""

There is risk that the outbreak will create a ?second pandemic? of mental health crises in health systems and communities. Thus, a comprehensive public health response to the pandemic must include (a) attention to the psychological aspects of hospitalization for patients, families, and staff affected by COVID-19; (b) planning for emergency and acute psychiatric patient care if hospitals become overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients; and (c) innovations for providing mental health care in communities while social distancing is required and health system resources are strained.

"Role of increasing the aerobic capacity on improving the function of immune and respiratory systems in patients with coronavirus (COVID-19): A review","Background and aims COVID-19 is a public world crisis, however, it is a self-limited infection. In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders. Methods This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections. Results This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19. Conclusion This review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19.","Mohamed, Ayman; Alawna, Motaz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.038","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",810,""
"Reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: clinical perspectives from a case series","Introduction: The world is currently undergoing an extremely stressful scenario due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This unexpected and dramatic situation could increase the incidence of mental health problems, among them, psychotic disorders. The aim of this paper was to describe a case series of brief reactive psychosis due to the psychological distress from the current coronavirus pandemic. Materials and methods: We report on a case series including all the patients with reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 crisis who were admitted to the Virgen del RocÃ­o and Virgen Macarena University Hospitals (Seville, Spain) during the first two weeks of compulsory nationwide quarantine. Results: In that short period, four patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for a brief reactive psychotic disorder. All of the episodes were directly triggered by stress derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and half of the patients presented severe suicidal behavior at admission. Conclusions: We may now be witnessing an increasing number of brief reactive psychotic disorders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This type of psychosis has a high risk of suicidal behavior and, although short-lived, has a high rate of psychotic recurrence and low diagnostic stability over time. Therefore, we advocate close monitoring in both the acute phase and long-term follow-up of these patients. Resumen IntroducciÃ³n: El mundo estÃ¡ experimentando un escenario extremadamente estresante a causa de la pandemia del COVID-19. Esta situaciÃ³n inesperada y dramÃ¡tica podrÃ­a incrementar la incidencia de los problemas de salud mental y, entre estos, los trastornos psicÃ³ticos. El objetivo de este documento es describir una serie de casos de psicosis reactiva breve, debidos al distrÃ©s psicolÃ³gico debido a la pandemia actual de coronavirus. Materiales y mÃ©todos: Reportamos una serie de casos, que incluye a todos los pacientes con psicosis reactiva en el contexto de la crisis del COVID-19, ingresados en los hospitales universitarios Virgen del RocÃ­o y Virgen Macarena (Sevilla, EspaÃ±a) durante las dos primeras semanas de la cuarentena obligatoria a nivel nacional. Resultados: En este breve espacio de tiempo, cuatro pacientes cumplieron los criterios de trastorno psicÃ³tico breve del Manual diagnÃ³stico y estadÃ­stico de trastornos mentales (DSM-5). Todos los episodios fueron desencadenados por el estrÃ©s derivado de la pandemia del COVID-19, y la mitad de los pacientes presentaron un comportamiento suicida grave a su ingreso. Conclusiones: Actualmente podemos estar asistiendo a un incremento del nÃºmero de trastornos psicÃ³ticos reactivos breves, como resultado de la pandemia del COVID-19. Este tipo de psicosis tiene un elevado riesgo de comportamiento suicida y, aunque es transitorio, tiene una elevada tasa de recurrencia psicÃ³tica y baja estabilidad diagnÃ³stica a lo largo del tiempo.

"Emergency Responses to Covid-19 Outbreak: Experiences and Lessons from a General Hospital in Nanjing, China","The novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused wide dissemination across the world. Global health systems are facing the unprecedented challenges. Here we shared the experiences and lessons in emergency responses and management from our hospital, a government-assigned regional anti-Covid-19 general hospital in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. Our periodic strategies in dealing with Covid-19 were described in detail. An administrative response including the establishment of Emergency Leadership Committee that was in full charge of management was established. Modifications of infrastructure including the Fever Clinic, inpatient ward, outpatient clinic and operation room were carried out. Special arrangements for outpatient services, hospitalization and surgeries were introduced. Medical personnel training and patient educations were performed. Initiations of Covid-19 researches and application of information technology were introduced. Since January 16, three cases have been confirmed in our hospital and no healthcare-associated infection was found. During the epidemics, 6.46% staffs suffered depression, 9.87% had anxiety, and 98% were satisfied with the infection control policy. Shortages in staffs and medical consumables, and limitation in space were the obstacles we encountered. As the cost of in-hospital transmission is unbearable, our experiences and lessons suggested that prompt actions should be taken immediately to decrease or eliminate potential in-hospital transmission. Experience shared herein may be useful for those facilities that are and may encounter Covid-19.","Shen, Yang; Cui, Ying; Li, Ning; Tian, Chen; Chen, Ming; Zhang, Ye-Wei; Huang, Ying-Zi; Chen, Hui; Kong, Qing-Fang; Zhang, Qun; Teng, Gao-Jun","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-020-02474-w","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",813,""

"[An analysis of global research on SARS-CoV-2]","The SARS-CoV-2 has been spread to 26 countries around the world since its outbreak. By February 16, 2020, more than 68 000 people had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Researchers from all over the world have carried out timely studies on this public health emergency and produced a number of scientific publications. This review aims to re-analyze and summarize the current research findings in a timely manner to guide scholars in relevant fields to further SARS-CoV-2 research and assist healthcare professionals in their work and decision-making. The SARS-CoV-2 related terms were selected in both English and Chinese and were searched in several major databases, including Pubmed, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP databases. The reference list of each search result was screened for relevance, which was further supplemented to the search results. The included studies were categorized by topics with key characteristics extracted, re-analyzed, and summarized. A total of 301 articles were finally included with 136 in Chinese and 165 in English. The number of publications has rapidly increased since mid-January, 2020, and a peak day was 6th February on which 50 articles were published. The top three countries publishing articles were China, the United States and the United Kingdom. The Lancet and its specialty journals have published the most articles, with contribution also from journals such as New England Journal of Medicine ( NEJM), The Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA), and Nature. All articles were categorized into epidemiology, clinical diagnosis and treatment, basic research, pregnant women and children, mental health, epidemic prevention & control, and others.

"The Balanced Opioid Initiative: protocol for a clustered, sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial to construct an adaptive implementation strategy to improve guideline-concordant opioid prescribing in primary care","Rates of opioid prescribing tripled in the USA between 1999 and 2015 and were associated with significant increases in opioid misuse and overdose death. Roughly half of all opioids are prescribed in primary care. Although clinical guidelines describe recommended opioid prescribing practices, implementing these guidelines in a way that balances safety and effectiveness vs. risk remains a challenge. The literature offers little help about which implementation strategies work best in different clinical settings or how strategies could be tailored to optimize their effectiveness in different contexts. Systems consultation consists of (1) educational/engagement meetings with audit and feedback reports, (2) practice facilitation, and (3) prescriber peer consulting. The study is designed to discover the most cost-effective sequence and combination of strategies for improving opioid prescribing practices in diverse primary care clinics. The study is a hybrid type 3 clustered, sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) that randomizes clinics from two health systems at two points, months 3 and 9, of a 21-month intervention. Clinics are provided one of four sequences of implementation strategies: a condition consisting of educational/engagement meetings and audit and feedback alone (EM/AF), EM/AF plus practice facilitation (PF), EM/AF + prescriber peer consulting (PPC), and EM/AF + PF + PPC. The studyâ€™s primary outcome is morphine-milligram equivalent (MME) dose by prescribing clinicians within clinics. The studyâ€™s primary aim is the comparison of EM/AF + PF + PPC versus EM/AF alone on change in MME from month 3 to month 21. The secondary aim is to derive cost estimates for each of the four sequences and compare them. The exploratory aim is to examine four tailoring variables that can be used to construct an adaptive implementation strategy to meet the needs of different primary care clinics. Systems consultation is a practical blend of implementation strategies used in this case to improve opioid prescribing practices in primary care. The blend offers a range of strategies in sequences from minimally to substantially intensive. The results of this study promise to help us understand how to cost effectively improve the implementation of evidence-based practices. NCT 04044521 (ClinicalTrials.gov).

"Recommendations for Deep Brain Stimulation Device Management During a Pandemic","Most medical centers are postponing elective procedures and deferring non-urgent clinic visits to conserve hospital resources and prevent spread of COVID-19. The pandemic crisis presents some unique challenges for patients currently being treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS). Movement disorder (Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia), neuropsychiatric disorder (obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, depression), and epilepsy patients can develop varying degrees of symptom worsening from interruption of therapy due to neurostimulator battery reaching end of life, device malfunction or infection. Urgent intervention to maintain or restore stimulation may be required for patients with Parkinson's disease who can develop a rare but potentially life-threatening complication known as DBS-withdrawal syndrome. Similarly, patients with generalized dystonia can develop status dystonicus, patients with obsessive compulsive disorder can become suicidal, and epilepsy patients can experience potentially life-threatening worsening of seizures as a result of therapy cessation. DBS system infection can require urgent, and rarely emergent surgery. Elective interventions including new implantations and initial programming should be postponed. For patients with existing DBS systems, the battery status and electrical integrity interrogation can now be performed using patient programmers, and employed through telemedicine visits or by phone consultations. The decision for replacement of the implantable pulse generator to prevent interruption of DBS therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration battery status and a patient's tolerance to potential therapy disruption. Scheduling of the procedures, however, depends heavily on the hospital system regulations and on triage procedures with respect to safety and resource utilization during the health crisis.","Miocinovic, Svjetlana; Ostrem, Jill L.; Okun, Michael S.; Bullinger, Katie L.; Riva-Posse, Patricio; Gross, Robert E.; Buetefisch, Cathrin M.","https://doi.org/10.3233/JPD-202072","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",821,""
"[Explore the Optimal Resolvent of Medical Needs and Mental Health for Patients with Lung Cancer during Epidemic Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia]","BACKGROUND: With the rapid spread of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) worldwide and the escalation of prevention and control efforts, the routine medical needs of patients have been restricted. The aims were to investigate medical needs of lung cancer patients and their mental health status during the epidemic periods, so as to provide rational recommendations for subsequent diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: The questionnaire was sent in the form of an electronic questionnaire at 7am on 4th, March, 2020, until 7am 6th, March, 2020, 368 questionnaires were recollected from 25 provinces (autonomous regions/municipalities) in 48 h. RESULTS: Of the 368 patients, 18 patients were excluded as they didn't receive anti-tumor treatment, and 350 patients were included in the final analysis. 229 cases were treated with oral targeted drugs, and 121 cases were treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. 41.3% of patients treated with intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy experienced treatment discontinuation, and the proportion of treatment discontinuation in chemotherapy or immunotherapy was higher than those treated with oral targeted drugs (21.0%). Whether oral targeted drugs or intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy, more than 60% of patients experienced delays in imaging examinations. Nearly one third of patients developed new symptoms or exacerbation of existing symptoms. 26.6%-28.9% of patients have changed their treatment plans through online consultation. During novel coronavirus pneumonia, 40%-75% of lung cancer patients have mental health problems, and more than 95% of patients support government's prevention and control measures.

"Lactose Dehydrogenase in Patients with Severe COVID-19: A Meta-Analysis of Retrospective Study","Since December 8th 2019 and the onset of the first cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China, the disease rapidly spread around the world, with hundred-thousand cases and thousands of deaths (Dutheil et al., 2020). Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe mental health condition caused by a terrifying event outside the normal range of usual human experience (Belrose et al., 2018). Exceptional epidemic situations also promoted PTSD in the past (Xu et al., 2011; CÃ©nat et al., 2020). Considering that humanity is undergoing the most severe pandemic since Spanish Influenza (Morens et al., 2020), the actual pandemic of COVID-19 is very likely to also promote PTSD. Moreover, the COVID-19 was renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis of related coronaviruses (Jiang et al., 2020). The SARS in 2003 was very traumatizing for population, with a poor understanding of viruses and spreading mechanisms (Koralek et al., 2015; Wendlandt et al., 2018). The evocation of SARS is thus generating a great anxiety and biased responses to threat, which can both promote PTSD (Bo et al., 2020; Mekawi et al., 2020).

"European Public Health News","This is the 22nd Presidentâ€™s column I am writing since I penned my first column in October 2016. Over the past four years I have proudly seen EUPHA grow from strength to strength. This is definitely in part due to the fact that EUPHA gives space to individuals of all ages, nationalities and disciplines to participate. The only requisite is to be passionate about improving health and well-being for allâ€”be it through research, policy, practice or education and training. This openness has allowed us to draw the best talent and most highly motivated individuals in European Public Health to contribute on a voluntary basis to take forward analysis, advocacy and action for the future of health and humanity. EUPHA is now in a strong position and well recognized as a credible partner by key supranational organizations including the World Health Organization and the European Commission. Having established a Brussels-based office, developed new sections, grown the conference into the largest and most important public health event in Europe and leaving a vibrant office and community of engaged young persons, augurs well for the sustainability of the organization. This could not have happened at a more significant moment in the history of public health. As the world follows with interest and intensity the international public health emergency posed by the novel corona virus #COVID19, we are starkly reminded of the importance and role of public health and health systems. This outbreak is a convergence of an infectious disease epidemic triggered through zoonotic transmission, abetted by an epidemic of misinformation having a marked social, economic and political impact. It is a watershed in the history of global health and after this nothing will ever else be the same in European and global public health. Whilst lessons are still being learned and much will eventually be written, this outbreak has underlined the interdependence of nations through economic global interconnectedness, the value of science and the importance of democracy, transparency and respect for human rights as issues that merit a new approach and a new order. For months now, I have written about the dangers of complacency when it comes to health policy in Europe and about the risks of considering health as having been well achieved in the developed world due to the spectacular increases in life expectancy achieved over the past decades. This outbreak has confirmed without any doubt the need to continue to invest in science and research, but also in strong health systems and in new areas of scholarly endeavour based on anthropological and social science. No doubt the World Congress of Public Health being organized in Rome in October 2020 comes at a most timely manner and is well placed to discuss what needs to be done no holds barred to prevent and manage public health emergencies not only linked to infectious disease but also other health â€˜emergenciesâ€™ including climate change, air pollution, mental health, obesity, diabetes and cancer. On a personal note, this column is the last one I shall be writing as EUPHA President. The Executive Council has accepted my proposal to move slightly earlier than originally planned into the role of past President since I have assumed a temporary position in the Transition Team of Dr Hans Kluge, the incoming WHO Regional Director for the European Region. This is the moment for me to thank all those who have supported EUPHA and myself personally over the past 4 years. To my colleagues in the Executive Council, Conference Foundation and Section Councilâ€”thank you for walking with me in this journey to continue to build EUPHA into a strong, visible and credible actor for public health in the European region. To the wonderful EUPHA office staff working with the incredible Director Dineke Zeegers Pagetâ€”thank you for working tirelessly to make our thoughts, dreams and projects come true. To our partner organizations on the European Public Health scene and to colleagues working in supranational organizationsâ€”thank you for working with us particularly on the European Public Health conferences and the European Public Health Weekâ€”these would not happen without your joint participation! Finally, I wish to close by thanking my past Presidents, friends and mentors Martin McKee and Walter Ricciardi for having encouraged, advised and supported me over these years. I am wishing my successor Dr Iveta Nagyova every success during her tenure as EUPHA President. Under her leadership, I am convinced that EUPHA will continue to flourish and play an important role in European Public Health.","Droogers, Maaike","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckaa051","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",824,""

"Mobilization of Telepsychiatry in Response to COVID-19-Moving Toward 21(st) Century Access to Care","The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt the provision of mental health services. In response, policymakers, administrators, and providers have taken bold steps toward enabling telepsychiatry to bridge this sudden gap in care for our most vulnerable populations. With rapid deregulation and adoption of this modality of care, careful consideration of issues related to policy and implementation is essential to maximize its effectiveness and mitigate unintended consequences. Though the crisis places the healthcare system under strain, it sets the stage for a lasting shift in not only how care is delivered, but also our beliefs around the system's capacity for rapid, innovative change.","Kannarkat, Jacob T.; Smith, Noah N.; McLeod-Bryant, Stephen A.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10488-020-01044-z","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",826,""
"Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine for the Prevention or Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in Africa: Caution for Inappropriate Off-Label Use in Healthcare Settings","The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 pandemic has spread to Africa, where nearly all countries have reported laboratory-confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Although there are ongoing clinical trials of repurposed and investigational antiviral and immune-based therapies, there are as yet no scientifically proven, clinically effective pharmacological treatments for COVID-19. Among the repurposed drugs, the commonly used antimalarials chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have become the focus of global scientific, media, and political attention despite a lack of randomized clinical trials supporting their efficacy. Chloroquine has been used worldwide for about 75 years and is listed by the WHO as an essential medicine to treat malaria. Hydroxychloroquine is mainly used as a therapy for autoimmune diseases. However, the efficacy and safety of CQ/HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 remains to be defined. Indiscriminate promotion and widespread use of CQ/HCQ have led to extensive shortages, self-treatment, and fatal overdoses. Shortages and increased market prices leave all countries vulnerable to substandard and falsified medical products, and safety issues are especially concerning for Africa because of its healthcare system limitations. Much needed in Africa is a cross-continental collaborative network for coordinated production, distribution, and post-marketing surveillance aligned to low-cost distribution of any approved COVID-19 drug; this would ideally be piggybacked on existing global aid efforts. Meanwhile, African countries should strongly consider implementing prescription monitoring schemes to ensure that any off-label CQ/HCQ use is appropriate and beneficial during this pandemic.","Abena, Pascale M.; Decloedt, Eric H.; Bottieau, Emmanuel; Suleman, Fatima; Adejumo, Prisca; Sam-Agudu, Nadia A.; Muyembe TamFum, Jean-Jacques; Seydi, Moussa; Eholie, Serge P.; Mills, Edward J.; Kallay, Oscar; Zumla, Alimuddin; Nachega, Jean B.","https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0290","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",827,""
"Internet-based self-help intervention aimed at increasing social self-efficacy among internal migrants in Poland: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Background Migration is a challenging life transition that may be a source of various problems related to well-being and mental health. However, the psychological adaptation of migrants may be potentially facilitated by social self-efficacyâ€”the beliefs in one's ability to initiate and maintain interpersonal relationships. Previous research suggests that social self-efficacy is positively related to adjustment and negatively related to loneliness, depression, and psychological distress. Research also confirms that self-efficacy beliefs can be effectively enhanced using Internet-based interventions. These results served as a background for creating the New in Town, a self-help Internet-based intervention for internal migrants in Poland that aims at increasing social self-efficacy. Exercises in the intervention are based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and relate to sources of self-efficacy beliefs: mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasions, and emotional and physiological states. Users complete increasingly challenging tasks that encourage them to interact with their environment. The aim of this trial was to investigate the efficacy of the New in Town intervention. Methods The efficacy of the New in Town intervention will be tested in a two-arm randomized controlled trial with a waitlist control group. Social self-efficacy will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include loneliness, perceived social support, and satisfaction with life. Additionally, we will measure user experience among participants allocated to the experimental group. We aim to recruit a total of N<U+202F>=<U+202F>280 participants aged at least 18<U+202F>years who have changed their place of residence in the last 6<U+202F>months and have an Internet connection. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3-week post-test, and 8-week follow-up. Discussion The trial will provide insights into the efficacy of Internet-based self-help interventions in increasing social self-efficacy. Given that the intervention works, New in Town could provide an easily accessible support option for internal migrants in Poland. Trial registration The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT04088487) on 11th September 2019.","Rogala, Anna; Szczepaniak, Maria; Michalak, Natalia; Andersson, Gerhard","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100322","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",828,""

"Mitigating the Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Healthcare Workers: A Digital Learning Package","The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) will undoubtedly have psychological impacts for healthcare workers, which could be sustained; frontline workers will be particularly at risk. Actions are needed to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health by protecting and promoting the psychological wellbeing of healthcare workers during and after the outbreak. We developed and evaluated a digital learning package using Agile methodology within the first three weeks of UK outbreak. This e-package includes evidence-based guidance, support and signposting relating to psychological wellbeing for all UK healthcare employees. A three-step rapid development process included public involvement activities (PPIs) (STEP 1), content and technical development with iterative peer review (STEP 2), and delivery and evaluation (STEP 3). The package outlines the actions that team leaders can take to provide psychologically safe spaces for staff, together with guidance on communication and reducing social stigma, peer and family support, signposting others through psychological first aid (PFA), self-care strategies (e.g., rest, work breaks, sleep, shift work, fatigue, healthy lifestyle behaviours), and managing emotions (e.g., moral injury, coping, guilt, grief, fear, anxiety, depression, preventing burnout and psychological trauma). The e-package includes advice from experts in mental wellbeing as well as those with direct pandemic experiences from the frontline, as well as signposting to public mental health guidance. Rapid delivery in STEP 3 was achieved via direct emails through professional networks and social media. Evaluation included assessment of fidelity and implementation qualities. Essential content was identified through PPIs (n = 97) and peer review (n = 10) in STEPS 1 and 2. The most important messages to convey were deemed to be normalisation of psychological responses during a crisis, and encouragement of self-care and help-seeking behaviour. Within 7 days of completion, the package had been accessed 17,633 times, and healthcare providers had confirmed immediate adoption within their health and wellbeing provisions. Evaluation (STEP 3, n = 55) indicated high user satisfaction with content, usability and utility. Assessment of implementation qualities indicated that the package was perceived to be usable, practical, low cost and low burden. Our digital support package on &lsquo;psychological wellbeing for healthcare workers&rsquo; is free to use, has been positively evaluated and was highly accessed within one week of release. It is available here: Supplementary Materials. This package was deemed to be appropriate, meaningful and useful for the needs of UK healthcare workers. We recommend provision of this e-package to healthcare workers alongside wider strategies to support their psychological wellbeing during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Blake, Holly; Bermingham, Fiona; Johnson, Graham; Tabner, Andrew","https://doi.org/10.3390/IJERPH17092997","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",831,""
"ConsÃ©quences psychopathologiques du confinement","RÃ©sumÃ© Les effets psychologiques de lâ€™isolement ont dÃ©jÃ  Ã©tÃ© dÃ©crits dans la littÃ©rature (expÃ©ditions polaires, sous-marins, prison). NÃ©anmoins lâ€™Ã©chelle du confinement mis en Å“uvre Ã  lâ€™occasion de la pandÃ©mie Ã  COVID-19 est inÃ©dite. Il nous faut non seulement relire les Ã©tudes publiÃ©es, mais aussi anticiper les problÃ¨mes psychologiques qui pourraient survenir pendant ou Ã  distance du confinement. Nous avons fait le choix dâ€™aller au-delÃ  de la littÃ©rature COVID-19 pour examiner les implications des consÃ©quences connues du confinementÂ : lâ€™ennui, lâ€™isolement social, le stress, le manque de sommeil. Lâ€™anxiÃ©tÃ©, le trouble de stress post-traumatique, la dÃ©pression et les conduites suicidaires, les conduites addictives, les violences domestiques sont des effets dÃ©crits du confinement, mais les mÃ©canismes dâ€™Ã©mergence de ces troubles et leurs interrelations restent Ã  Ã©tudier. Par exemple, quels sont les mÃ©canismes dâ€™Ã©mergence du trouble de post-traumatique dans le cadre du confinementÂ ? Nous rappelons aussi les points de vigilance Ã  garder sur des consÃ©quences telles que les troubles des conduites alimentaires, les hallucinations, curieusement ignorÃ©es dans la littÃ©rature sur le confinement, alors quâ€™une vaste littÃ©rature fait le lien entre isolement social et hallucinations. Du fait de consÃ©quences psychopathologiques larges, il nous faut partir Ã  la recherche des diffÃ©rents symptÃ´mes pour permettre leur prise en charge. Nous rÃ©sumons rapidement les approches diagnostiques et thÃ©rapeutiques dÃ©jÃ  mises en place, comme la tÃ©lÃ©mÃ©decine, qui connaÃ®t un dÃ©veloppement rapide Ã  lâ€™occasion de la crise du COVID-19. The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison). Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. As with domestic violence, we need to look for these symptoms in order to enable management. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.","Mengin, Amaury; Alle, MÃ©lissa; Rolling, Julie; Ligier, Fabienne; Schroder, Carmen; Lalanne, Laurence; Berna, Fabrice; Jardri, Renaud; Vaiva, Guillaume; Geoffroy, Pierre A.; Brunault, Paul; Thibaut, Florence; Chevance, Astrid; Giersch, Anne","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",832,""

People experiencing disability due to Covid-19 express specific rehabilitation needs that deserve a systematic evidence-based approach. OBJECTIVES: To provide the rehabilitation community with updates on the latest scientific literature on rehabilitation needs due to Covid-19. The first rapid ""living"" review will present the results of a systematic search performed up to March 31st, 2020. METHODS: A systematic search on PubMed, Pedro and Google Scholar was performed using the search terms: ""Covid-19"", ""Coronavirus"", ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"", ""rehabilitation"", ""physical therapy modalities"", ""exercise"", ""occupational therapy"", and ""late complications"". Papers published up to March 31st, 2020, in English, were included. RESULTS: Out of the 2758 articles retrieved, 9 were included in the present review. Four of them are ""calls for action"", 3 provide recommendations about rehabilitation interventions in the acute phase, 2 address the needs of people quarantined at home or with restricted mobility due to the lockdown, and 1 provides a Core Outcome Set to be used in clinical trials to test the efficacy of health strategies in managing Covid-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: All selected papers were based on previous literature and not on the current Covid-19 pandemic. Main messages included: 1) early rehabilitation should be granted to inpatients with Covid-19; 2) people with restricted mobility due to quarantine or lockdown should receive exercise programs to reduce the risk of frailty, sarcopenia, cognitive decline and depression; 3) telerehabilitation may represent the first option for people at home.

We aimed to identify high-risk groups whose mental health conditions were vulnerable to the COVID-19 outbreak. Data were collected from 7,236 self-selected participants measured by anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. The overall prevalence of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and poor sleep quality were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. People aged < 35 years reported a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms than people aged = 35 years. Healthcare workers have the highest rate of poor sleep compared to other occupations. Healthcare workers/younger people who spent a high level of time (= 3 hours/day) had a particular higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms than in those who spent less time (< 1 hours/day and 1-2 hours/day) on the outbreak. During the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare workers and younger people were at an especially high-risk of displaying psychological impact when they spent too much time thinking about the outbreak.

"Phenotyping for drought resistance in bread wheat using physiological and biochemical traits","Abstract Drought is one of the most prominent limiting factors that negatively affect crop productivity by manipulating its physiological pathway. One hundred twenty diverse bread wheat genotypes were used in a pot experiment to explore the relationship among their fifteen physio-biochemical traits (PBT) by using multivariate analysis, heatmapping and stress tolerance index (STI) for grain yield as a marker trait to identify high yielding genotype with maximum stress tolerance capability. Increased proline and sugar accumulation were observed from control to moisture deficient environments by 159% and 122%, respectively. Moreover, leaf membrane stability index (LMSI), leaf relative water content (LRWC), relative dry weight (RDW), chlorophyll content, leaf surface area (LSA), Leaf succulence (LS), canopy temperature depression (CTD), relative excised leaf water loss (RELWL) and leaf osmotic potential (LOP) showed significantly decreasing trend in drought stress treatment as compared to well-watered plants by -21%, -21%, -34%, -22%, -38%, -37%, -46%, -18% and -35% respectively. Additionally, principal component analysis and genotype by trait biplot analysis showed that initial 7 principal components (PC1 to PC7) represented 77.27% and 79.02% of total cumulative variation under control and drought stress respectively. Genotypic-Phenotypic correlation revealed that most of the attributes were higher in case of genotypic correlation component (rg) as compared to the phenotypic correlation component (rp) indicating more genetic association between traits. The darker and lighter colour scale produced by heatmap exhibited contrasting nature of genotypes, as positive side with higher values represented drought resistance while values on the negative side with lower values showed susceptible performance of genotypes. Our results concluded that the studied PBT associated with STI for grain yield are the main factors which may contribute in improved productivity of wheat crop and if these traits show appropriate performance under stress condition the crop will show the more productive returns under changing climate.","Ahmed, Kashif; Shabbir, Ghulam; Ahmed, Mukhtar; Shah, Kausar Nawaz","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139082","20200429","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",915,""

"Reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: clinical perspectives from a case series","Abstract Introduction: The world is currently undergoing an extremely stressful scenario due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This unexpected and dramatic situation could increase the incidence of mental health problems, among them, psychotic disorders. The aim of this paper was to describe a case series of brief reactive psychosis due to the psychological distress from the current coronavirus pandemic. Materials and methods: We report on a case series including all the patients with reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 crisis who were admitted to the Virgen del RocÃ­o and Virgen Macarena University Hospitals (Seville, Spain) during the first two weeks of compulsory nationwide quarantine. Results: In that short period, four patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for a brief reactive psychotic disorder. All of the episodes were directly triggered by stress derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and half of the patients presented severe suicidal behavior at admission. Conclusions: We may now be witnessing an increasing number of brief reactive psychotic disorders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This type of psychosis has a high risk of suicidal behavior and, although short-lived, has a high rate of psychotic recurrence and low diagnostic stability over time. Therefore, we advocate close monitoring in both the acute phase and long-term follow-up of these patients.","ValdÃ©s-Florido, MarÃ­a JosÃ©; LÃ³pez-DÃ­az, Ãlvaro; Palermo-Zeballos, Fernanda Jazmin; MartÃ­nez-Molina, IvÃ¡n; MartÃ­n-Gil, Victoria Eugenia; Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto; Ruiz-Veguilla, Miguel","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.04.009","20200427","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-11","",918,""
