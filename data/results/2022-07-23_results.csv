"Mental health and everyday life of occupational therapy students facing Covid-19: possible impacts and repercussions; SaÃºde mental e cotidiano dos estudantes de terapia ocupacional frente Ã  Covid-19: possÃ­veis impactos e repercussÃµes","Resumo A presente pesquisa teve como objetivo identificar os impactos na saÃºde mental e no cotidiano dos estudantes do curso de graduaÃ§Ã£o em terapia ocupacional de uma universidade pÃºblica federal frente ao cenÃ¡rio de enfrentamento da COVID-19. Trata-se de um estudo exploratÃ³rio e descritivo, de abordagem quantiqualitativa. Para coleta de dados, utilizou-se um questionÃ¡rio semiestruturado organizado no Google FormulÃ¡riosÂ®. Participaram do estudo 53 graduandos do primeiro ao Ãºltimo ano do curso. Os resultados apontam que 94% dos participantes sÃ£o do gÃªnero feminino, com idade entre 20 e 25 anos (78%). Antes da pandemia, os estudantes realizavam uma vasta gama de atividades semanais, sendo que 68% nÃ£o apresentavam questÃµes prÃ©vias de saÃºde mental ou nÃ£o apresentavam dificuldades que impactavam a sua vida de forma significativa. Com o advento da pandemia e suas consequÃªncias, o estudo apontou que 94% dos participantes observaram sua saÃºde mental impactada e, desses, 92% sinalizaram a ansiedade como a manifestaÃ§Ã£o mais recorrente. Verificou-se ainda que praticamente todas as atividades que compunham o cotidiano dos estudantes antes da pandemia da COVID-19 foram alteradas de alguma maneira, sendo a categoria socializaÃ§Ã£o a segunda mais citada. Diante do cenÃ¡rio atual de permanÃªncia da pandemia hÃ¡ mais de um ano, importa investigar como e quais estratÃ©gias de enfrentamento os estudantes, mas tambÃ©m a populaÃ§Ã£o geral, tÃªm adotado para lidar com os persistentes e permanentes desafios. Assim, aponta-se para a necessidade e importÃ¢ncia de se investir em pesquisas que aprofundem a compreensÃ£o desses impactos e das possÃ­veis estratÃ©gias de enfrentamento adotadas.; Abstract This research aimed to identify the impacts on mental health and the daily lives of students of the undergraduate course in Occupational Therapy at a Federal Public University in the face of the COVID-19 coping scenario. This is an exploratory and descriptive study, with a quantitative and qualitative approach. For data collection, a semi-structured questionnaire organized in Google Forms was used. Fifty-three undergraduate students from the first to the last year of the course participated in the study. The results show that 94% of the participants are female, aged between 20 and 25 years (78%). Before the pandemic, students performed a wide range of weekly activities, 68% of whom had no previous mental health issues, or had no difficulties that significantly impacted their lives. With the advent of the pandemic and its consequences, the study found that 94% of participants observed their mental health impacted, and of these, 92% showed anxiety as the most recurrent manifestation. It was also found that practically all activities that made up students' daily lives before the COVID-19 pandemic were altered in some way, with the socialization category being the second most cited. Given the current scenario, in which the pandemic has been in existence for more than a year, it is important to investigate how and which coping strategies not only students but also the general population, have adopted to deal with the persistent and permanent challenges. Thus, it points to the need and importance of investing in research that deepens the understanding of these impacts and the possible coping strategies adopted.","Morato, Giovana Garcia; Fernandes, Amanda Dourado Souza Akahosi; Santos, Ana Paula Nascimento dos","http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S2526-89102022000100223","","Database: COVIDWHO; LILACS; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cad.

"HOW DO WE PROVIDE WOMEN-CENTRED CARE FOR THE ONE IN FIVE WOMEN WHO HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION? 1 SCREENING AND STIGMA","The Scottish Government released the Mental Health Strategy to improve mental health services. With one in five pregnant women being identified as having a mental health condition, it is a prevalent issue for midwives. There are obstacles in midwifery to being able to meet the expectations of the aims of the Mental Health Strategy. These include accessing services, mental health stigma, organisational challenges, training and the impact of COVID-19. Solutions such as The Best Start and continuity of care within midwifery, appropriate referral process, training and education, and increased awareness can help midwives achieve the Scottish Government's aims. This is the first in a two-part series exploring these issues.","Weir, Clare","https://doi.org/10.55975/AHDV9946","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Practising Midwife; 25(7):20-24, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34802,""

For this purpose, the effects of the use of distance education in higher religious education were examined from the perspective of the faculty members. 134 faculty members working in faculty of theology/Islamic sciences participated in the research. In the research, the descriptive survey model, one of the quantitative research methods, was used. The data of the study was collected with a survey form consisting of 40 items in the five-point Likert type as well as demographic information. The analysis were made with SPSS 26 program using frequency (f), percentage (%) and mean (xÂ¯) calculations from descriptive statistical methods. The findings in the dimensions of technology use and the role of the distance education support unit, preparation for lessons and motivation, teaching process and general evaluation of the method are presented in tables and interpreted. As a result, it was revealed that the anxiety and worry in the first stage decreased in the faculty members, they could adapt themselves to the distance education method sufficiently, but they were not satisfied with the efficiency of the courses, the attendance rates of the students, the assessment and evaluation methods used. The integration of distance education, which was found to be quite inadequate especially in achievements of applied courses, could not be fully achieved in the theology/Islamic sciences faculty programme. It can be said that the negative attitude towards distance education, which is evaluated as in the position of supporting traditional education, may change with the improvement works to be carried out.","Kurttek&Iacute;N, Fatma","https://doi.org/10.47424/tasavvur.1067252","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Tasavvur / Tekirdag Theology Journal; 8(1):31-60, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34804,""

"Coping Resources of Young People Experiencing COVID-19 Second Wave, in India: A Preliminary Study","The purpose of the student-led research study was to understand the experiences of COVID-19 in the second wave in terms of mental health and coping with loss and grief. To address the research questions, an exploratory survey tool was constructed, which documented the physiological and psychological experiences specific to anxiety, grief, panic, and distress through semi-structured schedules converted into google forms. The students were guided to construct the semi-structured questionnaire and the tool was translated and back-translated into regional languages of Gujarati, Marathi, Hindi, Malayalam, and Tamil. Given the lockdown, the data collection was carried out through telephonic and online interviews. Data collection was limited primarily to a youth population due to digital access being most available to youth (overall n = 203). Three key results are discussed. Firstly, data shows that the youth sample showed a clear preference for action readiness, even in the light of fear and distress due to the COVID-19 second wave. Females seemed to prefer a problem-solving coping pattern, but overall, the sample preferred to look at 'what they could do' in light of the fear and other distressing emotions. Second, given the age profile, the data showed that 50% of the sampled participants experienced moderate negative affect;26% experienced low negative affect. Around 24% reported high negative affect in the aftermath of the COVID-19 second wave in May-July 2021. Third, data showed that participants reported two emotion focused coping strategies-through sharing more with the families and finding courage together. The coping strategies varied slightly according to the level of negative affect experienced. Given that the Government of India, in 2022, has initiated a telemental health program, with NIMHANS as a nodal agency, implications for policy and future research for mental health interventions leveraging technology are discussed.","Pandit, Shilpa Ashok, Vaidya, Aatman, Shah, Aangi, Shah, Eshva, Iyer, Isha, Golani, Jhalak, Pishe, Kirti, Guliwala, Mantasha, Maheshwari, Shrishti, Dave, Tanishqua","https://doi.org/10.32381/JPR.2022.17.01.16","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Psychosocial Research; 17(1):189-199, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34807,""

"Risk Factors for Hyperglycemic and Hyperketotic Emergencies in COVID+ Youth with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)","Recent studies report increased frequency of hyperglycemic and hyperketotic emergencies in youth with T1D and coronavirus disease 20 (COVID-19) . Morbidity and mortality risk may be increased in individuals who develop diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) with concurrent COVID-infection. Using a Cerner RealWorld DataTM COVID-dataset with de-identified information from 490,373 individuals with COVID- (12/2019-9/2020) from 87 U.S. healthcare systems, we examined demographic and clinical characteristics of youth with established T1D and suspected or confirmed COVID-infection. We then used generalized mixed models to evaluate the association of body mass index (BMI) , race and ethnicity, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) to two outcomes: (1) DKA and (2) concurrent DKA and HHS (DKA+HHS) . We used a validated cohort selection algorithm to identify 383 youth (&lt;18 years old;50.7% female) with T1D. Of these, 35.8% were non-Hispanic White, 27.4% were Hispanic, and 14.9% were non-Hispanic Black/Other (NHB/O) . The most common comorbid conditions were fluid and electrolyte disorders, documented for 64.2% of the cohort. Other frequent comorbid conditions included cardiac arrhythmias (19.3%) , chronic pulmonary disease (17.2%) , and depression (16.2%) . Thirty-nine percent of youths in the cohort experienced DKA only, 1.0% experienced HHS only, and 4.2% experienced DKA+HHS. After adjustment, we found HbA1c to be the only factor associated with increased odds of DKA alone (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.22;95% CI (1.09,1.36) ;p&lt;0.001) . Odds of DKA+HHS were markedly increased in NHB/O individuals (AOR: 4.47;95% CI (1.07,18.72) ;p=0.04) . Demographic and clinical care factors that associate with increased risk of DKA or DKA+HHS differ among youth with T1D and COVID-infection. Whether risk factors associated with DKA, HHS or DKA+HHS differ among youth with T1D with or without COVID-infection requires further study.","Tsai, Sarah, Tallon, Erin M.; Ferro, Diana, Zarse, Erica, Williams, David D.; Shyu, Chi Ren, Clements, Mark A.","https://doi.org/10.2337/db22-1013-P","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Diabetes; 71, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34811,""

The 2021 survey was conducted in February and March, between the peaks in COVID cases observed in Minnesota. Results: Response rates for the three waves were 71%, 72% and 69%, respectively. Our analysis focuses on the 269/556 practices participating in all three waves. Overall prevalence of CMPs for this subset was not significantly different (p=0.069) than for practices that participated in only one or two waves. Among continuously participating practices, overall prevalence of CMPs increased significantly (p=0.005) in 2021. This increase was driven by CMPs focusing on chronic disease management (p=0.011) , patient self-management (p=0.013) , and development of care plans (p=0.004) . Diabetes-specific CMPs had the highest prevalence in all years relative to CMPs focused on cardiovascular disease, depression or asthma. Nearly 90% of respondent practices described moderate to extreme disruption in disease management practices during the pandemic peak. Prior to the pandemic in 2019, virtual visits (phone, video) comprised less than 20% of the total visits for almost all practices. During the 2020 peak, 29% of practices conducted 60% or more of their visits virtually, and an additional 50% of practices conducted 20%-59% of visits virtually. By early 2021, nearly all practices reported less than 40% of visits being conducted virtually. Conclusions: Despite significant practice disruption due to the pandemic, primary care practices in Minnesota reported continued increase in CMPs supporting care for patients with diabetes and other chronic conditions.","Peterson, Kevin A.; Solberg, Leif, Carlin, Caroline","https://doi.org/10.2337/db22-930-P","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Diabetes; 71, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34812,""
"Behavioral Health Needs of a Commercially Insured Adult Population with Type 2 Diabetes","Background: There is an increasing appreciation of the interconnection between chronic illnesses such as type-2 diabetes and behavioral health conditions such as depression and anxiety, as well as more serious behavioral health conditions. The separation of practice and payment for medical and behavioral conditions is ripe for disruption. This is of particular importance for risk-bearing entities. Methods: Level2 is a virtual accountable care organization taking total cost-of-care risk for a commercially insured population. Using a de-identified administrative claims research database, we estimated the behavioral health profile of our enrolled population by examining the prescribing of common behavioral health medications. Results: In our enrolled population of 7,361 members, the average age was 54.4 years, and the M:F ratio was 53:47. Prescriptions for behavioral health medications were demonstrated in 26.2% of the population. Medications for depression and anxiety were most common (20.0% and 8.0% respectively) , while antipsychotics were prescribed in 0.1% of attributed members. Twenty-four months of enrollment (November 2019- November 2021) showed stable prescribing patterns. Conclusion: The movement towards provider risk bearing, and a more sophisticated understanding of the relationship between physical and behavioral health, necessitate a more comprehensive and integrated approach to care for patients. While this intersection may be evident to providers in their daily activities, the analysis of a population of nearly 7,400 members gives a broader insight into this challenge and calls for clinical service redesign, the application of new methodologies and measurements, and over time, new payment models. Of note, the prescribing data spans the COVID and pre-COVID periods and was stable over time, so the high use of behavioral health medications is not COVID-attributable.","Cook, David J.; Defail, Anthony, Livesey, Cecilia, Pederson, Derek","https://doi.org/10.2337/db22-641-P","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Diabetes; 71, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34813,""
"Similar Rate of Positive Depression Screen in Youth with Diabetes Before and During the COVID-Pandemic: Still No Reason for Complacency","Adolescents with diabetes mellitus (DM) experience depression 2-3 times higher than the general population. Little is known about the impact of the COVID pandemic. We aimed to identify the prevalence of depression among youth with DM before and during the pandemic and associated factors in a large academic children's hospital. Patient health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) screens completed in fall 20 and 2020 (n=216 vs. 194 respectively) were reviewed. 187 subjects (81%) completed the screen at both periods (54% female, 97% white, 97% with type 1 DM (T1D) , mean (SD) age 15.1 (2.7) years, duration of DM 7.2 (4.2) years) . Among youth with T1D, 55% used insulin pumps and 64% continuous glucose monitor (CGM) . When comparing 20to 2020, median [IQR] PHQ-9 score (1 [0-3] vs. 0 [0-3], p=0.76) or rates of depression (17 vs. 15%, p=0.65) were not different. In 2011%, 4% and 2% had mild (PHQ-9 score 5-9) , moderate (score 10-14) , and severe (score &gt;14) depression respectively with similar rates in 2020 at 10%, 2% and 3% There was no difference in mean HbA1c between 20 and 2020 (8.2Â±1.7 vs. 8.2Â± 1.8% respectively, p=0.99) . Using 20data, PHQ-9 score was significantly positively correlated with HbA1c (rho=0.22, p=0.003) and BMI z-score (rho=0.22, p=0.003) , but not to age (rho-0.02, p=0.73) , or duration of diabetes (rho=0.04, p=0.55) . Depression was more prevalent in females (21% vs. 12%, p=0.09) and in youth with no CGM use (24 vs. 12%, p=0.047) . Suicidal ideation was reported in 4 (2%) of youth in 20 and 3 (1.5%) in 2020. Our results suggest that the prevalence/severity of depression during the first year of the pandemic did not change in youth with DM compared to the previous year, the reason perhaps being that ~ 90% of patients in our institution continued to being followed up, albeit virtually, during the pandemic. Still, almost 1/5 of adolescents with DM scored positive for depression highlighting the need to support the behavioral needs of youth with T1D.","Sriram, Swetha, Leikam, Lindsay M.; March, Christine, Schreiber, Justin, Muzumdar, Radhika, Libman, Ingrid","https://doi.org/10.2337/db22-593-P","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Diabetes; 71, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34814,""
"Health Disparities among People with and without Diabetes during COVID-19: An 18-Month Evaluation","This study describes the mental health of US adults with and without diabetes (ND) over an 18-month period of the COVID-pandemic. A 12-month web-based survey was administered in May 2020 (N = 2,176) to June 2021 and November 2021 (18MO;N = 1,192) including demographics, pandemic experiences, depression (PHQ-8) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptoms, perceived stress (PSS) , and resilience (BRS) . Mean age of 18MO Completers (55%) was 53 years (SD = 16.4) , primarily female (80%) , White (91%) , with an annual household income of = $60,000 (58%) . 165 had type 2 diabetes (T2D;14%) , 83 had prediabetes (7%) , and 56 had type 1 (T1D;5%) . Completers were more likely to be White, educated (45% post-master's degree) , and homeowners with fewer medical and emotional comorbidities at baseline than non-completers (all p&lt;.05) . At 18MO, mean PHQ-8 score was 5.2 (SD = 5.3;mild) , GAD-7 was 4.1 (SD = 4.8) , PSS was 13.2 (SD = 5.5) . All improved from baseline (p&lt;.001) .

"Household Food Insecurity, Stress, and Anxiety among Youth and Young Adults with Diabetes","Although household food insecurity (HFI) has been associated with depressive symptoms in youth and young adults (YYA) with youth-onset diabetes, little is known about the association of HFI with other mental health comorbidities. We examined the association of HFI with stress and anxiety symptoms among YYA with diabetes using cross-sectional data from the SEARCH Food Security Cohort study (assessments conducted 2018-2020;n = 1030, age =23.8Â± 0.3, female =58.8%, type 1 diabetes (T1D) = 881, type 2 diabetes (T2D) =149) . HFI was defined as 3+ affirmations on the USDA Household Food Security Survey Module. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) were used to assess outcomes of anxiety (score range 0-21) and stress (score range 0-56) , higher scores indicating greater anxiety or stress. Linear regression models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, site, diabetes duration, parental education, income, and whether assessment was completed pre/post the coronavirus pandemic. Analyses were stratified by diabetes type. HFI was present in 17.3% of T1D and 35.6 % of T2D. Moderate/severe anxiety symptom scores (range 10-21) were found in 27.5 % (mean=6.9, s.d. =5.5) of T1D and 40.9% (mean=8.4, s.d. =6.5) of T2D. Mean stress scores were 26.7 (s.d.=6.3) for T1D and 27.9 (s.d.=6.3) for T2D. In T1D, HFI was associated with higher anxiety (ÃŸ=4.8, p=&lt;0.0001) and stress (ÃŸ=4.9, p=&lt;0.0001) symptom scores compared to those with food security adjusted for covariates. Among T2D, HFI was associated with greater anxiety symptoms (ÃŸ=2.8, p=0.0247) but no association was observed with stress. These findings suggest that assessing and alleviating HFI may help improve stress and anxiety among YYA with diabetes, and further study is warranted to determine associations over time.","Brown, Andrea D.; Mendoza, Jason A.; Frongillo, Edward A.; Flory, Kate, Reboussin, Beth A.; Jensen, Elizabeth T.; Dolan, Lawrence M.; Bellatorre, Anna, Malik, Faisal, Marcovina, Santica M.; Pihoker, Catherine, Liese, Angela D.","https://doi.org/10.2337/db22-570-P","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Diabetes; 71, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34816,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Quality of Life in Youth with Type 1 Diabetes","Diabetes is a risk factor for COVID-19 infection-related complications, increasing fear in this population. The effect of the pandemic on quality of life for youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) has not been evaluated. Youth with T1D (n=108, mean age 11.6Â±4.0 yrs, mean T1D duration 5.3Â±3.9, 57.4% male) and a parent completed surveys at baseline (September to November 2020) and every 3 months for 12 months. Measures included the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey ([CEFIS], exposure (range 0-25) , family impact (range 0-4, scores &gt;2.5 indicate negative impact) , distress (range 1-10)) , the PedsQL Diabetes Module (higher score indicates higher quality of life) , and the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance and Sleep-Related Impairment surveys (higher score indicates more problems) . CEFIS impact score remained above 2.5 over 12 months. Parent Proxy PedsQL decreased from 3 to 6 months (p=0.019) and 3 to 12 months (p=0.017) . Parent Proxy PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment increased from 6 to 12 months (p=0.03) and 9 to 12 months (p=0.004) .

"Anxiety and Changes in Health Care Access and Health Behaviors during COVID-in Southwest Tribal Community Patients with Prediabetes and Diabetes","Objective: The impact of COVID-has been devastating to many, but particularly to rural populations of American Indians from Zuni Pueblo who suffer multiple vulnerabilities which places them at greater risk for infection and death. Very little is known about the change in health behaviors owing to the COVID pandemic among a chronically ill (diabetes) rural Zuni population. We evaluated the anxiety and stress about COVID-contributing to poorer mental health outcomes in Zuni Indians with PreDM and T2DM. Methods: We conducted a survey among individuals with hyperglycemia in Zuni Indians. There were 300 participants who responded to the survey, of which 193 participants also had baseline clinical health data. Results: Those with T2DM experienced higher pandemic-related anxiety than those with pre-DM (+3.9 vs. -0.6, p=0.0616, on a scale -30 to +30) . Those with T2DM were more likely to report decreased physical activity (54% vs. 44%) , decreased frequency in lab testing (21% vs. 10%) , and increased virtual contact with providers (61% vs. 48%) during the pandemic. We conducted regression analyses to describe correlations of anxiety and weight change with the changes in health behaviors. We found that participants with improved diet and exercise during the pandemic were less likely to experience weight gain (OR= 0.78, p=0.0017 and OR=0.75, p=0.0094, respectively) . We also found that those who reported worsening health care during the pandemic experienced increased anxiety (+4.9, p=0.0049) . Conclusion: Our study provides important insights into (unintended) consequential effect of COVID crisis in rural Zuni which will contribute to a better understanding of how to preserve mental health and maintain health behaviors in patients with diabetes during the pandemics.","Reno, Jessica, Zhu, Yiliang, Shah, Vallabh","https://doi.org/10.2337/db22-51-OR","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Diabetes; 71, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34818,""
"Re-Audit of Compliance With Standard Operating Procedure for Prescription of Depot Medication Within the Wolverhampton Older Adult Services","Aims1) To re-audit the current practice of depot prescribing within the Wolverhampton Older Adult Enhanced Community Mental Health Teams (ECMHT). 2) To assess whether the implementation of a memory aid for prescribers has improved compliance of current practice to the Black Country Healthcare Foundation Trust (BCHFT) standard operating procedures (SOP) protocol.MethodsAll depot cards were identified from the Wolverhampton Older Adult ECMHT in January 2022. The cards were assessed for their compliance with the 15 standards for depot prescription writing as set out by the BCHFT SOP protocol. If a standard was not met, reasons for non-compliance were documented. The compliance rate for each standard was then compared to the results from a previous audit performed in January 2021.ResultsA total of 13 depot cards were identified. Out of the 15 standards, 6 of them had a 100% compliance rate. The two standards with the lowest compliance rate were â€˜Standard 3â€™ and â€˜Standard 7â€™. Standard 3 states that â€œPrescriptions should be signed and dated appropriately, including full signature and name printedâ€. This standard only achieved 15% compliance. This was a 60% reduction from the previous 75% compliance. Standard 7 states that â€œThe interval expressed should be using the word â€˜everyâ€™â€. This standard achieved a compliance rate of 31%. This was a 12% improvement from the previous 19%.ConclusionThis re-audit has shown there is still significant room for improvement regarding depot prescribing. The reason for non-compliance to Standard 3 was largely due to prescribers not printing their names alongside their signatures. This is likely due to the lack of an assigned space for â€œPrescriber's nameâ€ to be printed on the form. Also, like the previous audit in 2021, prescribers are still not using the word â€˜everyâ€™ when filling in the frequency of depots (Standard 7). Despite this, there is a 12% improvement in compliance rate which shows that the memory aid did help some prescribers to comply to Standard 7.These results will be discussed at the trust's Clinical Audit and Effectiveness Committee meeting. We will then revise the community depot cards to include columns for both prescriber's signature and name. Finally, we will harmonise depot cards from all localities in BCHFT. We will continue to include the memory aid at the front of all depot card folders as it has proven effective. We aim to complete these by March 2022.","Clare Siew Boon Ling, Dr, Prasanna, Aparna Dr","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.462","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S164, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34819,""
"Trauma-Informed Care on CAMHS ID Unit Case Study of a Child with Neurodevelopmental Disorder and Self-Injurious Behaviour","AimsCrystal House is a specialist CAMHS ID inpatient 5-bedded unit based in the Kingswood Centre, North West London - for children aged between 13 and 18 years with primary diagnosis of Intellectual Disabilities with or without additional concerns that warrant admission to hospital for purpose of assessment and management. Reporting this case, we wanted to highlight complexities of management of children presenting with neurodevelopmental conditions and history of trauma.MethodsThis is a case of a fourteen-year-old girl with established diagnoses of Moderate Intellectual Disability, Childhood Autism, Foetal Alcohol Syndrome and childhood trauma. She was admitted to our CAMHS ID Assessment and Treatment Unit with a nine- year history of self-injurious behaviour, suicidal ideation and voice-hearing experiences â€“ after failed treatment in the community and in-patient treatment (including under restrictions of long-term segregation) on generic CAMHS unit. Her current treatment includes a person-centred Trauma- Informed Positive Behaviour Support Plan;individual and family therapy psychology sessions based on the principles of trauma-informed care and consultation with staff on trauma-informed care. She also undertook ADHD assessment, and we are in the process of optimising ADHD medication.ResultsTrauma-Informed Positive Behaviour Support Plan was a new concept for the team. Therefore, this was supported by training and consultations with staff. The latter was introduced to create a psychologically oriented environment using trauma-informed care principals and helping the team understand what trauma means and how it affects the individual.

"A Qualitative Study Exploring the Role of Hindsight Bias in the Process of Reviewing Clinical Practice Prior to Adverse Incidents","AimsTo explore the effect of hindsight bias on retrospective reviews of clinical decision making prior to adverse incidents to inform future approaches to incident investigations.MethodsWe have undertaken focus groups with doctors of varying grades across the North West of England and North Wales. A vignette based on a real-life case from the publicly available NHS England Homicide Independent Investigation report database was presented to each group in one of three versions which differed in terms of the ending of the vignettes (i.e. suicide, homicide, no adverse incident). Using a semi-structured interview approach, the group participants were encouraged by the facilitators to reflect on issues relating to risk and risk management. All groups were provided with the same vignette which initially made no reference to the outcome and asked to comment on matters of risk and risk management. Halfway through the discussion, one of the three outcomes was disclosed, and further group discussion was held. The recorded interviews were transcribed and thematic analysis was undertaken using an adapted Framework Method.ResultsPreliminary results (n = 10) indicate that participants identified the potential for significant harm, particularly to others, and identified evidence of key psychopathological and historical correlates to support assertive management of risk and admission to hospital.Whilst knowledge of the outcome did not lead to participants changing their favoured management plans, it did alter how they appraised the case and led to participants constructing â€œnarrativeâ€ explanations for the outcome given. The level of conviction participants held for their management plan reduced when their expectations about the outcome were confounded.Participants presented with the suicide outcome vignette described their difficulties appraising risk to others and their over-sensitivity to that risk. Participants faced with the â€˜no adverse outcomeâ€™ vignette perceived the original management plan far more favourably in hindsight. The groups that were presented with the homicide outcome vignette initially focused on both risks to self and others as well as the perceived need for further information. Following knowledge of the outcome, there was a tendency to highlight parts of the letter pertaining to risk to others which they previously had not given as much attention.ConclusionThe initial analysis of our data confirms the findings from previous studies that hindsight colours the appraisal of adverse events. However, this study is novel in that it describes the nature of the thought processes underpinning the influence of hindsight on appraisals of risk.","Hadjioannou, Irene Dr, Lewis, Emily Dr, Scott, Leo Dr, Thomas, Catrin Dr, Alberto Salmoiraghi, Professor, Rajan Nathan, Professor","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.254","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJPsych Open; 8(S1):S76, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34821,""

The recent COVID-19 quarantine measures have created additional stressors for pregnant women due to isolation and a surge in partner conflict.<b>Objective:</b> The purpose of this study was to assess how partner relationship conflict and social support may mediate mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 lockdown.<b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study with a sample of 152 pregnant women using psychological measures, (i.e. Prenatal Distress Questionnaire, Symptom Checklist-90-R, Duke-UNC-11 Functional Social Support Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale). Demographic characteristics, obstetrics history, and partner relationship conflict were assessed using questionnaires.<b>Results:</b> While there were few reports of physical violence in this sample, between 18% and 59% of women reported partner relationship conflict on the psychological subscale (e.g. afraid of one's partner or screamed at by one's partner). Further, the psychological subscale was significantly associated with symptoms of psychopathology. There was a significant negative association between social support and pregnancy-specific stress (p = .005), and perceived stress (p= .038).<b>Conclusions:</b> These findings suggest that partner relationship conflict and social support may act as important buffers for prenatal mental health in childbearing women during vulnerable situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Daugherty, Bueso-Izquierdo, Lara-Cinisomo, Lozano-Ruiz, Caparros-Gonzalez","https://doi.org/10.1080/0167482X.2022.2101446","20220722","COVID-19; mental health; partner relationship conflict; pregnancy; social support; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34824,""
"Covid and mental health in America","Using 44 sweeps of the US Census Household Pulse Survey data for the period April 2020 to April 22 we track the evolution of the mental health of just over three million Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find anxiety, depression and worry had two major peaks in 2020 but improved in 2021 and 2022. We show that a variable we construct based on daily inflows of COVID cases by county, aggregated up to state, is positively associated with worse mental health, having conditioned on state fixed effects and seasonality in mental health. However, the size of the effect declines in 2021 and 2022 as vaccination rates rise. For women and college educated men having a vaccine improved mental health. However, being vaccinated worsens mental health among less educated men.","Blanchflower, Bryson","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0269855","20220722","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34825,""
"Tailoring an evidence-based clinical intervention and training package for the treatment and prevention of comorbid heavy drinking and depression in middle-income country settings: the development of the SCALA toolkit in Latin America","Effective interventions exist for heavy drinking and depression but to date there has been limited translation into routine practice in global health systems. This evidence-to-practice gap is particularly evident in low- and middle-income countries. The international SCALA project (Scale-up of Prevention and Management of Alcohol Use Disorders and Comorbid Depression in Latin America) sought to test the impact of multilevel implementation strategies on rates of primary health care-based measurement of alcohol consumption and identification of depression in Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. To describe the process of development and cultural adaptation of the clinical intervention and training package. We drew on Barrero and Castro's four-stage cultural adaption model: 1) information gathering, 2) preliminary adaption, 3) preliminary adaption tests, and 4) adaption refinement. The Tailored Implementation in Chronic Diseases checklist helped us identify potential factors that could affect implementation, with local stakeholder groups established to support the tailoring process, as per the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Going to Scale Framework. In Stage 1, international best practice guidelines for preventing heavy drinking and depression, and intelligence on the local implementation context, were synthesised to provide an outline clinical intervention and training package. In Stage 2, feedback was gathered from local stakeholders and materials refined accordingly. These materials were piloted with local trainers in Stage 3, leading to further refinements including developing additional tools to support delivery in busy primary care settings. Stage 4 comprised further adaptions in response to real-world implementation, a period that coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, including translating the intervention and training package for online delivery, and higher priority for depression screening in the clinical pathway. Our experience highlights the importance of meaningful engagement with local communities, alongside the need for continuous tailoring and adaptation, and collaborative decision-making.","O'Donnell, Anderson, Schmidt, Braddick, Lopez-Pelayo, MejÃƒÂ­a-Trujillo, Natera, Arroyo, Bautista, Piazza, Bustamante, Kokole, Jackson, Jane-Llopis, Gual, Schulte","https://doi.org/10.1080/16549716.2022.2080344","20220722","Alcohol use; cultural adaption; depression; latin america; primary care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34826,""
"Remote vs in-person BRCA1/2 non-carriers test disclosure: patients' choice during Covid-19 pandemic restriction","During Covid-19 pandemic most hospitals have restricted in-person delivery of non-essential healthcare services, including genetic testing delivery, to slow the spread of the virus. Our Onco-Genetic Service also faced this challenging period and had to re-organize its clinical practice with the use of tele-health. Aim of the present paper is to understand whether and how Covid-19-related changes in medical practice influenced patients' satisfaction about the health service provided. 125 BRCA1/2 non carriers (109/125, 87.2% female and 16/125, 12.8% male) in Istituto Tumori ""Giovanni Paolo II"" of Bari were enrolled. All participants were asked to choose whether they prefer in-person or remote post-test counselling session. Basing on patients' choice, two groups of subjects were composed. One week after the post-test counselling session, participants were phone called and asked to complete: a socio-demographic form, a brief structured interview about their Covid-19 related worries and their satisfaction with the health service provided, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Fear of Covid-19 scale. Qualitative information about patients' choice were also collected. No significant difference about patients' satisfaction with the health service provided emerged between groups. Patients who preferred remote post-test counselling had higher anxiety, worries and fear-of Covid-19 than the others. All remote-counselling subjects preferred tele-genetics because of Covid-19 security, would choose it again and would recommend it to others. Cancer tele-genetics offers good guarantees of comfort and efficacy, but patients' choices are related to personal and psychological variables. The use of tele-genetics has to be a patient's choice.","Costanzo, De Summa, Maurmo, Digennaro, Patruno, Paradiso","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10689-022-00307-y","20220722","Anxiety; Cancer; Fear of Covid-19; Genetic counselling; Genetic testing; PatientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ satisfaction; Telegenetics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34827,""
"A Review of You Tube Content to Assess US Mental Health During the Covid-19 Pandemic","Mental health concerns have increased in prevalence since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many turn to online resources for relevant information. The purpose of this study is to describe the availability of mental health information on YouTube, and to assess the relevance of the videos' content in relation to the actual need of the population. The 100 most-watched YouTube videos in English resulting from a YouTube search of ""COVID-19"" and ""mental health"" were evaluated. Of mental health conditions, anxiety and depression were mentioned in over 50% of the videos. A positive correlation was found between videos that mentioned anxiety and those that mentioned depression (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The numbers of videos focused on anxiety and depression were correlated with themes such as life stressors and social distancing (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Videos that did not make recommendations for dealing with stressors had more positive ratings than videos that did make such recommendations (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002). The content of YouTube videos addressing mental health issues during COVID-19 reflects the actual prevalence of specific mental health conditions during this same time period. Viewer ratings may be indicative of the public need for information about mental health conditions and validation for difficult experiences on social media sites. YouTube must be better utilized to disseminate information about mental illness.","Sherman, Mohlman, Basch, Fera, Barry","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-022-01121-4","20220722","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coping; Depression; Mental health; Social media; YouTube","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34828,""
"Possible substance use disorders among first responders during the COVID-19 era: a quasi-experimental study of personal and residential vulnerability","<i>Background:</i> During the COVID-19 pandemic possible substance use disorders (SUD) were exacerbated from increased stress and isolation. Experiences of symptomology differ widely by occupations.<i>Objectives:</i> The objectives were to determine if there is a temporal relationship between COVID-19 vulnerability and possible SUDs among first responders, and to examine the association with neighborhood vulnerability.<i>Methods:</i> We conducted an analysis with two distinct cohorts dependent on time of entry: 1) First responders that began counseling prior to COVID-19 and 2) First responders that began counseling after the start of COVID-19. Data were collected at intake from first responders seeking mental health services between 2017 and 2021 at an organization in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas. The study sample included 195 mostly male (75%) first responders (51% law enforcement officers; 49% emergency medical technicians/firefighters). Bivariate models tested unadjusted relationships between covariates and possible SUD. Adjusted models consisted of a two-level multivariable logistic regression models.<i>Results:</i> Nearly 40% (<i>n</i> = 77) screened positive for a possible SUD. Those beginning counseling after COVID-19 did not have higher odds of SUDs. For every unit increase in neighborhood Severe COVID-19 Health Risk Index at a first responder's residential location there was an increase in the odds of a possible SUD (AOR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.47, 6.75).<i>Conclusions:</i> Our study highlights the degree to which personal and residential vulnerability to COVID-19 impacted first responders. The increased occupational stress of this population, and an established pattern of maladaptive coping, elucidates the need for preventative and clinical approaches to strengthen the resilience of this population.","Beauchamp, Weerakoon, Ponder, Jetelina","https://doi.org/10.1080/00952990.2022.2088376","20220722","COVID; Substance use; alcohol; first responder; neighborhood","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34829,""
"US Emergency Department Telepsychiatry Use in 2019","<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> <i>Although many emergency departments (EDs) receive telehealth services for psychiatry, or telepsychiatry, to manage acute psychiatric emergencies, national research on the usage of ED telepsychiatry is limited. To investigate ED telepsychiatry usage in the pre-COVID-19 era, we surveyed a sample of EDs receiving telepsychiatry in 2019, as a follow-up to a survey targeted to similar EDs in 2017.</i> <b><i>Methods:</i></b> <i>All U.S. EDs open in 2019 (</i>n<i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5,563) were surveyed to characterize emergency care. A more in-depth second survey on telepsychiatry use (2019 ED Telepsychiatry Survey) was then sent to 235 EDs.

"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND SEVERITY OF COVID-19 SYMPTOMS IN NON-HOSPITALISED INDIVIDUALS","The study explored the relationship between physical activity (PA) behaviour and severity of symptoms in people infected by coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19). Five hundred thirty-three people (16% males, mean age: 45Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°11 yrs., body mass index (BMI): 23.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°20) took part in the study. All participants were post-COVID-19 infection. An online questionnaire was used to gather data on; participants demographics, comorbidities and treatment, symptomatology of COVID-19, quality of life (QoL) and pre- and post-COVID-19 infection PA. Logistic regression revealed that only a high BMI (&gt; 25) increased the severity of (OR 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99-1.03) symptoms from none to mild-to-moderate. Weekly PA behaviour (mins/week) did not affect the primary outcome (symptom severity) as a predictor variable and neither differ (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) between symptomatology for both moderate (no symptoms: 181.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°202.1 vs. mild-to-moderate symptoms: 173Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°210.3), and vigorous (no symptoms: 89.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°147 vs. mild-to-moderate symptoms: 88.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°148.3) PA. QoL (i.e., mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, and perceived health) was significantly (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) worse post-COVID-19 infection. Our findings did not present an association between PA levels and mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms. However, all participants exceeded the lower limit of the WHO-recommended, adult PA dose. This might explain the lack of PA effect, on mild-to-moderate symptoms post-COVID-19 infection. Future studies should explore the effects of PA levels in more severe cases (e.g., hospitalisations) and assess the effectiveness of PA to reduce hospitalisations, and mortality rates as a result of COVID-19 infection.","Mitropoulos, Goodwill, Copeland, Klonizakis","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckac097","20220722","cardiorespiratory fitness; coronavirus symptoms; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34831,""

"[Mental health consequences of isolation of patients with COVID-19]","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on the mental health on the population. It is unknown if the different types of patient isolation affect them equally. The objective of the study was to determine if the effect on the psychological discomfort caused by the isolation of the population with COVID-19 in a hotel supervised by health professionals was different compared with those who were isolated at home. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the first pandemic wave in Barcelona, consecutively selected from the Primary Care lists. A telephone survey was carried out to collect information about mental health in patients who were isolated in a hotel compared to those isolated at their homes. Descriptive statistics were performed and the study variables were analyzed using mean and standard deviation, count (percentage), Chi-square test, and Student's t-test. Logistic regression models were carried out selecting frustration and anger/irritability as response variables. Of the 89 patients included, 45 (50.6%) were isolated at their homes and 44 (49.4%) at the hotel. Frustration was identified in 48.3% and irritability in 29.2% of the most patients. Most of those who presented frustration were between 45 and 65 years old, while 50% of those who felt irritability were younger. Multivariate models confirmed that patients isolated at home showed a higher risk of frustration (Odds ratio 4,12; 95% Confidence interval 1,60-11,49) and irritability (Odds ratio 3,81; 95% Confidence interval 1,32-12,10), respectively.

The results show that: (1) When gender, age, and educational background are controlled, risk familiarity has a significant positive predictive effect on public mental health; (2) Risk familiarity predicts mental health through the mediating effect of mental toughness; (3) The mediating effect of mental toughness is moderated by the public's familiarity with SARS. Specifically, for members of the public with low SARS familiarity, the indirect effect of risk familiarity on mental health through mental toughness is smaller than that for those with high SARS familiarity.

"Adapting to Adversity: Effects of COVID-19 on Parenting in Chile","The pandemic outbreak in March 2020 and its associated sanitary regulations and restrictions triggered an abrupt and significant change for society in general and for families' organization in particular. In Chile, the Santiago Metropolitan District was under a strict lockdown that involved the closure of the entire educational system. From a systemic-family stress perspective, the impact of these changes might have consequences not only for each individual family member, but for the parental dynamic and, consequently, for children's well-being. This paper presents the results of a follow-up study showing changes in self-reported parental depression and the perceived home organization of mothers and fathers assessed at three different moments: before the pandemic, at the initial outbreak, and after 1 month of strict lockdown. Relevant moderators were explored using linear mixed models to understand the within-subject changes in mothers' and fathers' self-reports across the different assessment times. Financial strain, personality traits of self-criticism and dependency, previous parent-child quality interaction, recent major stressful events, and number of children are highlighted as relevant factors that moderate changes in home chaos and parental mental health perception. Significant risks and protective factors are described for fathers and mothers.

"Biobehavioral Implications of Covid-19 for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Recipients","A growing body of literature has emphasized the importance of biobehavioralÃ‚Â processes - defined as the interaction of behavior, psychology, socioenvironmental factors, and biological processes - for clinical outcomes among transplantation and cellular therapy (TCT) patients. TCT recipients are especially vulnerable to distress associated with pandemic conditions and represent a notably immunocompromised group at greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection with substantially worse outcomes. The summation of both the immunologic and psychologic vulnerability of TCT patients renders them particularly susceptible to adverse biobehavioral sequelae associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. Stress and adverse psychosocial factors alter neural and endocrine pathways through sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis signaling that ultimately affect gene regulation in immune cells. Reciprocally, global inflammation and immune dysregulation related to TCT contribute to dysregulation of neuroendocrine and central nervous system function, resulting in the symptom profile of depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive dysfunction. In this article, we draw upon literature on immunology, psychology, neuroscience, hematology and oncology, Covid-19 pathophysiology, and TCT processes to discuss how they may intersect to influence TCT outcomes, with the goal of providing an overview of the significance of biobehavioral factors in understanding the relationship between Covid-19 and TCT, now and for the future. We discuss the roles of depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep, social isolation and loneliness, and neurocognitive impairment, as well as specific implications for sub-populations of interest, including pediatrics, caregivers, and TCT donors. Finally, we address protective psychological processes that may optimize biobehavioral outcomes affected by Covid-19.","Knight, Taylor, Rentscher, Henley, Uttley, Nelson, Turcotte, McAndrew, Amonoo, Mohanraj, Kelly, Costanzo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.877558","20220722","Covid-19; biobehavioral; outcomes; stress; transplantation and cellular therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34838,""
"Purpose in Life and Character Strengths as Predictors of Health Sciences Students' Psychopathology During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Health sciences students experience high levels of psychopathology conditioned by psychosocial, financial, and academic factors. However, COVID-19 pandemic might even have worsened their mental health. Thus, this article aims to evaluate how the exposure to COVID-19 pandemic has affected these students' mental health and to determine the effect of purpose in life and character strengths on this psychopathology. A cross-sectional study of unpaired samples was carried out in Spain during the first and third waves of the pandemic in 70 medical and 52 nursing students. The risk factor that most determined the appearance of anxiety was the exposure of family and friends to COVID-19 (OR = 4.01; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), while the most protective factors were honesty (OR = -1.14; <i>p</i> = 0.025) and purpose in life (OR = -0.18; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Purpose in life also protected against the onset of depression and total psychopathology. In addition, we observed studying medicine was a protective factor against total psychopathology while being a nursing student was associated with high levels of acute stress. Exposure of the students' family and friends to SARS-CoV-2 favored the appearance of symptoms of anxiety. Honesty had a preventing role in the onset of anxiety and a high purpose in life was protective against the appearance of anxiety, depression, and total psychopathology.","Echeverria, Peraire, PenadÃƒÂ©s, Quintero, Benito, AlmodÃƒÂ³var, Haro","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.932249","20220722","COVID-19; character strengths; medical students; mental health; moral courage; nursing students; psychopathology; purpose in life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34839,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic: The Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health and Life Habits in the Canadian Population","The study aims to investigate the rate of clinical depression in the adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the changes in anxiety, distress, suicidal ideation, and their relations with several personal and interpersonal/social variables. This is an epidemiological, non-interventional study. It is part of an international multi-center study, with the main site at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, in Greece (COMET-G Study). We are presenting aspects of the research involving the Canadian site, based on 508 Canadian responders to the online survey (QAIRE). Of the 508 responders, 72.2% were females aged 42.57 Ã‚Â± 14.00 years; 27.2% were males aged 42.24 Ã‚Â± 15.49 years; and 0.6% were others aged 46.33 Ã‚Â± 17.79 years. Increased anxiety during the lockdown was reported by 69.3% of those surveyed. The rate of suicidal thoughts increased in 19.5% of participants during the lockdown. Depression was reported by 22% of responders, while distress was present in 18.4%. We found a greater prevalence of depression, but not distress, in individuals with a history of any mental disorder. Based on the multiple regression analysis, we found four CORE factors equally influencing the changes in mental health during the lockdown (gender, quality of sleep, family conflicts, and changes in daily routine). In the Canadian population, two major changes acted as protective factors, significantly expressed when compared with the worldwide tendencies: fewer financial difficulties; and an increase in religious beliefs. The rate of major depression, distress, and suicidal ideation was higher in Canadians than in the worldwide population (per COMET-G), but the relative risk to develop depression in the presence of a history of mental disorders was lower. Almost 90% of Canadians believed in the real story of COVID source of provenience.","Iftene, Milev, Farcas, Squires, Smirnova, N Fountoulakis","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.871119","20220722","COVID-19; Canada; conspiracy theories; depression; lockdown; mental health; suicidality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34840,""
"Determinants of Stress Levels and Behavioral Reactions in Individuals With Affective or Anxiety Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Russia","Individuals with affective and anxiety disorders are among those most vulnerable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to analyze the determinants of stress levels and protective behavioral strategies associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Russian-speaking people with affective or anxiety disorders (AADs). In this cross-sectional online survey, the psychological distress and behavioral patterns of respondents with self-reported AAD (<i>n</i> = 1,375) and without disorders (<i>n</i> = 4,278) were evaluated during three periods of restrictive measures in Russia (March-May 2020). Distress levels were verified using the Psychological Stress Measure (PSM-25). Stress levels among respondents with AAD were higher at all study periods than for those with no mental disorder (Cohen's <i>d</i> 0.8-1.6). The stress level increased (Cohen's <i>d</i> = 0.4) in adolescents (16-18 years) with AAD and remained the same in those without disorders; in youths (19-24 years) with and without disorders, an increase (Cohen's <i>d</i> = 0.3) and a decrease (Cohen's <i>d</i> = 0.3) in the stress were observed, correspondingly; the stress in adults (25-44 years) with disorders did not change and decreased in those without disorders (Cohen's <i>d</i> = 0.4). Individuals with bipolar disorders demonstrated lower stress than individuals with depressive (Cohen's <i>d</i> = 0.15) and anxiety disorders (Cohen's <i>d</i> = 0.27). Respondents with depressive and bipolar disorders employed fewer protective measures simultaneously and were less likely to search for information about COVID-19. The presence of affective or anxiety disorders is associated with a more acute response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Apparently, the type of mental disorder influenced stress levels and protective behavior patterns.","Sorokin, Kasyanov, Rukavishnikov, Khobeysh, Makarevich, Neznanov, Maximova, Verzilin, Lutova, Mazo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2022.870421","20220722","SARS-CoV-2; anxiety disorders; bipolar disorder; depressive disorder; health risk behavior; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34841,""
"A nationwide questionnaire study of post-acute symptoms and health problems after SARS-CoV-2 infection in Denmark","A considerable number of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 continue to experience symptoms after the acute phase. Here, we report findings from a nationwide questionnaire study in Denmark including 61,002 RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and 91,878 test-negative controls aged 15-years or older. Six to twelve months after the test, the risks of 18 out of 21 symptoms were elevated among test-positives. The largest adjusted risk differences (RD) were observed for dysosmia (RDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.92%, 95% CI 10.68-11.21%), dysgeusia (RDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.68%, 95% CI 8.43-8.93%), fatigue/exhaustion (RDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.43%, 95%CI 8.14-8.74%), dyspnea (RDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.87%, 95% CI 4.65-5.09%) and reduced strength in arms/legs (RDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.68%, 95% CI 4.45-4.89%). During the period from the test and until completion of the questionnaire, new diagnoses of anxiety (RDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.15%, 95% CI 0.95-1.34%) or depression (RDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.00%, 95% CI 0.81-1.19%) were also more common among test-positives. Even in a population where the majority of test-positives were not hospitalized, a considerable proportion experiences symptoms up to 12 months after infection. Being female or middle-aged increases risks.","SÃƒÂ¸rensen, Spiliopoulos, Bager, Nielsen, Hansen, Koch, Meder, Ethelberg, Hviid","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31897-x","20220721","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-23","",34842,""
