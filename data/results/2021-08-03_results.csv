"Psychiatric and neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 - a systematic review","It has become evident that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a multi-organ pathology that includes the brain and nervous system. Several studies have also reported acute psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 patients. An increasing number of studies are suggesting that psychiatric deficits may persist after recovery from the primary infection. In the current systematic review, we provide an overview of the available evidence and supply information on potential risk factors and underlying biological mechanisms behind such psychiatric sequelae. We performed a systematic search for psychiatric sequelae in COVID-19 patients using the databases PubMed and Embase. Included primary studies all contained information on the follow-up period and provided quantitative measures of mental health. The search was performed on June 4<sup>th</sup> 2021. 1725 unique studies were identified. Of these, 66 met the inclusion criteria and were included. Time to follow-up ranged from immediately after hospital discharge up to 7 months after discharge, and the number of participants spanned 3 to 266586 participants. Forty studies reported anxiety and/or depression, 20 studies reported symptoms- or diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 27 studies reported cognitive deficits, 32 articles found fatigue at follow-up, and sleep disturbances were found in 23 studies. Highlighted risk factors were disease severity, duration of symptoms, and female sex. One study showed brain abnormalities correlating with cognitive deficits, and several studies report inflammatory markers to correlate with symptoms. Overall, the results from this review suggest that survivors of COVID-19 are at risk of psychiatric sequelae but that symptoms generally improve over time.","Mertz Schou, Joca, Wegener, Bay-Richter","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2021.07.018","20210802","COVID-19; PTSD; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; cognition; depression; fatigue; inflammation; long-COVID; psychiatric sequelae; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16728,""
"Latent Patterns of Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms, Depression, and Posttraumatic Growth Among Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Researchhas shown that posttraumatic reactions can co-occur in trauma-exposed individuals. Many studies have assessed the co-occurring patterns of two types of reactions, but few have assessed the patterns of multiple reactions. To build on existing knowledge, the present study examined co-occurring patterns of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depressive symptoms, and posttraumatic growth (PTG) among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 683) were adolescents selected from an area in China severely affected by COVID-19 who completed the PTSD Checklist, a measure of depression, a PTG inventory, and a cognitive emotional regulation questionnaire. Latent profile analysis and multinomial logistic regression were used for the data analyses. The results showed three heterogeneous patterns characterized by growth (n = 248, 36.3%), distress (n = 101, 14.8%), and struggle (n = 334, 48.9%). Positive refocusing and reappraisal were associated with membership in the growth group compared with distress group, OR = 0.83, 95% CI [0.75, 0.93] and OR = 0.78, 95% CI [0.68, 0.90], whereas rumination, catastrophizing, and ""putting into perspective"" were associated with membership in the distress group compared with growth group, ORs = 1.15-1.44. These findings suggest that posttraumatic reactions show heterogeneous characteristics: struggle, rather than growth or distress, is common among adolescents during COVID-19; and distinct cognitive emotional regulation strategies have distinguishing roles in the three patterns of posttraumatic reactions.","Zhen, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22720","20210802","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16729,""

"Religion in the US duringÃ‚Â the timeÃ‚Â of a Pandemic: A Medical Perspective","Approximately 80% of Americans identify as religious. As physicians caring for patients with COVID-19, we have seen both positive and negative effects of religious activity during the pandemic. Religious worship generally supports close social interaction, which provides many benefits, especially in mental health, but it can also contradict infection control measures. These forces do not necessarily have to be in opposition to each other. Herein, we present three case vignettes of religious patients who were infected with and recovered from COVID-19. We review the potential benefits and risks of religious activity in the current pandemic, as supported by the medical literature. Finally, we offer some thoughts on how to engage with patients so that the benefits of both religious activity and public health measures are optimized.","Knight, Dudenkov, Cheshire","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-021-01366-8","20210802","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Faith; Public health; Religion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16731,""
"Investigating the effect of quarantine caused by COVID-19 on mental health and social trust","This study was conducted to examine the effect of quarantine caused by COVID-19 on people's mental health and social trust. In this study, the sample size covers 2919 people in the southwest of Iran that was selected cluster sample method and was evaluated online using tools of social trust and a checklist of mental disorder syndrome. Due to the results, COVID-19 affected all people's mental health negatively, but there was a significant difference between the rates of COVID-19 caused anxiety and the dimensions of the psychological problems and social trust different between men and women and married and single people, and also the education level. There was no significant relationship between any of the demographic variables and social trust variables, corona anxiety, and dimensions of psychological problems. And there was a negative and significant relationship between the dimensions of social trust and the dimensions of psychological problems. Moreover, the social trust rate in the subjects was desirable. Based on the results and the cutoff point of 2.5 as a border of healthy and unhealthy psychological dimensions, 4.5% had pathological anxiety, 7.3% had pathological depression, 5% had aggression, and 5.9 % had pathological obsessive-compulsive disorder. Depression had the highest scores, and aggression had the lowest scores. Due to this study's results, policymakers should consider measures that should be taken in crisis to support all people, especially vulnerable people in psychological, economic, social, spiritual, and psychological fields. On the other hand, the government must train the public through the mass media to cope with COVID-19.","Hasanpour Dehkordi, Gholamzad, Myrfendereski, Hasanpour Dehkordi, Ghaderi","https://doi.org/10.32394/pe.75.05","20210802","COVID-19; mental health; quarantine; social trust","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16732,""
"Management of COVID-19 Outbreak in Argentina: Stage 2","With the intention to try to contain the spread of the viral disease, several measures were taken in Argentina for long periods of time. The lack of labor activity, social constraints and a strong sense of helplessness, overimposed to a complex economic scenario with recesion, inflation and devaluation, led to the emergence of a dense climate of discontent. After a second wave hit the country, several measures were reinstalled. The Argentine society, polarized in many aspects, was further divided between those who supported the re-establishment of strict measures to help prevent further infections and those who desperately claimed for the urgent need to return to work to sustain their livings.The preexisting problems to which developing countries are usually exposed have been sharpened over the last year, determining a very complex scenario where every decision is important for the country's future. An updated report of the current situation and its management in different countries is of vital importance regarding global health issues and may serve for feedback and decision-making.","Cereghini, Gemelli","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.246","20210802","COVID-19; pandemics; public Health; public Health Surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16733,""
"The relationship of nurses' psychological well-being with their coronaphobia and work-life balance during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","This study aimed to determine the relationship of nurses' psychological well-being with their coronaphobia and work-life balance during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is a global life-threatening disease. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects nurses' mental health. No studies have been conducted to determine the factors that affect nurses' psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. If nurses' psychological well-being is impaired during the COVID-19 pandemic, the quality of nursing care and the nurses' performance may be negatively affected. This is a descriptive, correlational and cross-sectional study. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline checklist for cross-sectional studies was used for reporting in this study. The study population consisted of the nurses working in a Health Application and Research Center in Turkey. Data were collected using Google forms between June-August 2020. The study sample consisted of 295 nurses who voluntarily agreed to participate in the study and used social media tools. The data were collected using a Sociodemographic Characteristics Form, the COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S), the Work-Life Balance (WLB) Scale and the Psychological Well-Being (PWB) Scale. The factors that affect psychological well-being were determined using the stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. The nurses' work-life balance and psychological well-being were negatively affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their COVID-19 phobia was mild-to-moderate level. The nurses' psychological well-being was significantly affected by the variable of neglecting life the most, followed by coronaphobia and work-life balance, which explain 75% of the variance. This study shows that coronaphobia experienced by nurses and work-life balance was related to their psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Managers should take measures (regulating the working hours) to decrease nurses' COVID-19 phobia (education, counselling or psychotherapy) and work-life imbalance. Nurses' peers, managers and organisations need to take into account nurses' negative emotions and behaviours and organise training programmes to help them overcome their fears, communicate clearly and provide for their basic needs. Organisations, including managers and nurses, must recognise the distress being experienced by their nurses and create safe environments in which to have significant conversations. Nurses' mental health can be screened regularly by multidisciplinary teams, psychological support can be provided when required, and working hours can be regulated through appropriate shifts and breaks that will ensure work-life balance during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses receiving emotional support from their families and friends (via chatting and sharing troubles) can also contribute positively. These measures and regulations will positively affect nurses' psychological well-being and contribute to an increase in the quality of care and nurses' performance.","Yayla, Eskici Ã„Â°lgin","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15783","20210802","COVID-19; coronaphobia; nurse; psychological well-being; work-life balance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16734,""
"""My brain feels like a browser with 100 tabs open"": A longitudinal study of teachers' mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic","Teaching and caring for pupils during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge for many teachers, and its impact on teachers' mental health and well-being (MHWB) should be of great national and international concern. This study examines 24 primary and secondary school teachers' MHWB experiences across three time points (April, July, and November 2020) using longitudinal qualitative trajectory analysis. We used a mixture of inductive and deductive coding, based on the Job Demands-Resources Model, to identify the job demands (aspects of the job that can be physically or psychologically costly) and job resources (aspects of the job that can buffer the effects of job demands and promote achievement and growth) teachers reported experiencing across the three time points. Generally, teachers' MHWB seemed to have declined throughout the pandemic, especially for primary school leaders. Six job demands contributed negatively to teachers' MHWB (i.e., uncertainty, workload, negative perception of the profession, concern for others' well-being, health struggles, and multiple roles) and three job resources contributed positively to their MHWB (i.e., social support, work autonomy, and coping strategies). Policymakers and practitioners can support teachers' MHWB by engaging in more collaborative communication and ensuring greater accessibility to sources of social support. These discussions and provisions will be crucial in supporting teachers, and thereby the educational system, both during and after the pandemic.","Kim, Oxley, Asbury","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjep.12450","20210802","COVID-19; longitudinal trajectory analysis; mental health and well-being; teachers; thematic analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16735,""
"Gambling and self-reported changes in gambling during COVID-19 in web survey respondents in Denmark","Problem gambling is among the public health hazards which may increase due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences on society. Results from a few countries have hitherto been diverse with respect to gambling during the pandemic. The present study aimed to study gambling behaviors during COVID-19 in Denmark, with the same methodology as previously used in Sweden, and also to provide a comparison to previously published Swedish data. A web survey was answered by 2,012 individuals, from December 2, to December 10, 2020. Four percent reported increased gambling habits, and three percent reported decreased gambling, during COVID-19. Self-reported increase in gambling was associated with spending more time at home, mental distress, and higher gambling severity. Prevalence of self-reported, increased gaming during COVID-19 was significantly lower in Denmark than in Sweden. Although the overall changes in gambling patterns during COVID-19 may be limited, people who increase their gambling during the pandemic may be at particular risk. Stakeholders should pay attention to individuals who report altered gambling habits during the pandemic.","HÃƒÂ¥kansson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07506","20210802","Behavioral addiction; Covid-19; Gambling disorder; Mental health; Pandemic; Problem gambling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16736,""
"Is RAS the Link Between COVID-19 and Increased Stress in Head and Neck Cancer Patients?","The COVID-19 pandemic emerged as a largely unexplained outbreak of pneumonia cases, in Wuhan City, China and rapidly spread across the world. By 11th March 2020, WHO declared it as a global pandemic. The resulting restrictions, to contain its spread, demanded a momentous change in the lifestyle of the general population as well as cancer patients. This augmented negative effects on the mental health of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC), who already battle with the stress of cancer diagnosis and treatment. The causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV2, gains entry through the Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is a component of the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS). RAS has been shown to influence cancer and stress such that it can have progressive and suppressive effects on both. This review provides an overview of SARS-CoV2, looks at how the RAS provides a mechanistic link between stress, cancer and COVID-19 and the probable activation of the RAS axis that increase stress (anxiogenic) and tumor progression (tumorigenic), when ACE2 is hijacked by SARS-CoV2. The mental health crises brought about by this pandemic have been highlighted in many studies. The emerging links between cancer and stress make it more important than ever before to assess the stress burden of cancer patients and expand the strategies for its management.","Iftikhar, Islam, Shepherd, Jones, Ellis","https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.714999","20210802","ACE2; COVID-19; cancer; head and neak cancer; oral cancer; renin angiotensin system; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16737,""
"Family Cohesion and Stress Consequences Among Chinese College Students During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Moderated Mediation Model","Family plays a pivotal role in individuals' mental health. During the COVID-19 epidemic, people were being quarantined at home to prevent the further spread of the virus. Therefore, the influence of family on individuals is more significant than usual. It is reasonable to assume that family cohesion can effectively alleviate the stress consequences during the COVID-19 epidemic. In the present study, a moderated mediation model was constructed to examine the mechanisms underlying the association between family cohesion and stress consequences among Chinese college students. A large sample of Chinese college students (<i>N</i> = 1,254, <i>M</i> <sub>age</sub> = 19.85, <i>SD</i> <sub>age</sub> = 1.29) participated in the study. Results indicated that family cohesion was negatively related to stress consequences. Fear of COVID-19 partially mediated the link between family cohesion and stress consequences.

"National Health Systems and COVID-19 Death Toll Doubling Time","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed stress on all National Health Systems (NHSs) worldwide. Recent studies on the disease have evaluated different variables, namely, quarantine models, mitigation efforts, damage to mental health, mortality of the population with chronic diseases, diagnosis, use of masks and social distancing, and mortality based on age. This study focused on the four NHSs recognized by the WHO. These systems are as follows: (1) The Beveridge model, (2) the Bismarck model, (3) the National Health Insurance (NHI) model, and (4) the ""Out-of-Pocket"" model. The study analyzes the response of the health systems to the pandemic by comparing the time in days required to double the number of disease-related deaths. The statistical analysis was limited to 56 countries representing 70% of the global population. Each country was grouped into the health system defined by the WHO. The study compared the median death toll DT, between health systems using Mood's median test method. The results show high variability of the temporal trends in each group; none of the health systems for the three analyzed periods maintain stable interquartile ranges (IQRs). Nevertheless, the results obtained show similar medians between the study groups.

"Assessing the effects of disasters and their aftermath on pregnancy and infant outcomes: A conceptual model","Although many studies have examined broad patterns of effects on pregnancy and infant outcomes after disasters, the causes of adverse outcomes are not always clear. Disasters cause interrelated exposure to environmental pollutants, psychological stressors, and lack of health care, and interacts with other social determinants of health. This topical review examines the short- and long-term effects of disasters on pregnancy and how they are mediated by social, behavioral, and environmental effects. In the short term, disasters are associated with physical trauma, adverse environmental exposures, and unstable housing. In the longer term, disasters may lead to relocation, changes in family functioning, and negative economic effects. These aspects of disaster exposure, in turn, lead to lack of access to health care, increased stress and negative mental health outcomes, and negative behavioral changes, including smoking and substance use, poor nutrition, physical overexertion and limited activity, and reduction in breastfeeding. All of these factors interact with social determinants of health to worsen effects on the most vulnerable women, infants, and communities. Few interventions after disasters have been tested. With the increase in disasters due to climate change and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the models of effects of disasters and their human health consequences need increasing refinement, and, more importantly, should be applied to interventions that improve disaster prevention, mitigation, and response.","Harville, Beitsch, Uejio, Sherchan, Lichtveld","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102415","20210802","birthweight; disaster; environment; pregnancy; tropical cyclones","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16740,""
"Evaluation and Management of Alcohol use Disorder among Older Adults","The prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) among older adults in the United States is rising, but remains underdiagnosed, underreported, and inadequately managed. This review highlights the medical, social, and cultural factors of AUD in older adults and provides guidelines for its screening, evaluation, and management. The COVID-19 pandemic has created additional challenges and barriers to care, as older adults may have disproportionate worsening of anxiety, depression, and substance use resulting from increased isolation related to physical distancing and shelter-in-place guidelines. All older adults should be routinely screened for AUD with standardized screening tools. If a patient's screening results are positive, a clinician should conduct a brief assessment, which may be supplemented by laboratory tests. Most older adults at risk for alcohol misuse do not need specialized SUD treatment, but most can benefit from Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) to prevent substance misuse before it occurs. Medications for the treatment of AUD in older adults include naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram, gabapentin and topiramate. Psychosocial treatments, including mutual help groups, are equally important.","Joshi, Duong, Trevisan, Wilkins","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13670-021-00359-5","20210802","Alcohol use disorder; Geriatrics; Older adults; Substance use disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16741,""
"Comprehensive Deep Mutational Scanning Reveals the Immune-Escaping Hotspots of SARS-CoV-2 Receptor-Binding Domain Targeting Neutralizing Antibodies","The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has caused the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the collapse of medical care systems and economic depression worldwide. To combat COVID-19, neutralizing antibodies have been investigated and developed. However, the evolutions (mutations) of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 enable escape from neutralization by these antibodies, further impairing recognition by the human immune system. Thus, it is critical to investigate and predict the putative mutations of RBD that escape neutralizing immune responses. Here, we employed computational analyses to comprehensively investigate the mutational effects of RBD on binding to neutralizing antibodies and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and demonstrated that the RBD residues K417, L452, L455, F456, E484, G485, F486, F490, Q493, and S494 were consistent with clinically emerging variants or experimental observations of attenuated neutralizations. We also revealed common hotspots, Y449, L455, and Y489, that exerted comparable destabilizing effects on binding to both ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies. Our results provide valuable information on the putative effects of RBD variants on interactions with neutralizing antibodies. These findings provide insights into possible evolutionary hotspots that can escape recognition by these antibodies. In addition, our study results will benefit the development and design of vaccines and antibodies to combat the newly emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2.","Tsai, Lee, Tseng","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.698365","20210802","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; antibody; binding stability; hotspots; immunity; neutralization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16742,""

"Relationships Between Anxiety, Perceived Vulnerability to Disease, and Smartphone Use During Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in a Sample of Italian College Students","<b>Introduction:</b> As of March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a ""pandemic"" by the WHO. This has led to the need for governments around the world to implement restrictive containment and isolation measures to stem the spread of the virus; these measures have included social distancing, isolation, and quarantine. The fear of contagion has been indicated as one of the causes of stress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia in the general population. With respect to the response of young people to the pandemic, the category of University students deserves further attention. The sudden change in ""University"" habits (i.e., poor interaction with teachers and colleagues, disturbing learning environment, and difficulty in adapting to online learning), the consequent loss of a social network, and the economic problems in their families have seriously affected the psychophysical well-being of University students. The aim of this study was to explore, in a sample of Italian University students, the relationships among anxiety, perceived vulnerability to disease, and smartphone use during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> A sample of 194 volunteer college students (i.e., 86 males and 108 females) aged between 18 and 30 years (<i>M</i> = 21.74; <i>SD</i> = 2.39) were recruited to participate in this study. Participants were recruited through an online questionnaire sent to students of the University of Catania, Italy, and distributed from September 2020 to January 2021. The volunteer participants were given an online protocol that included the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) for the evaluation of fear, the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease (PVD) for the evaluation of perceived vulnerability to disease, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for the evaluation of trait and state anxiety, and the Smartphone Addiction Scale Short Version for Adolescents and Young Adults (SAS-SV) for the evaluation of use, abuse, or addiction of smartphone use. <b>Results:</b> The fear of COVID-19 did not reach an intensity such as to be defined as serious (i.e., fear score: 15.53) in the whole sample. Both men and women showed a high risk of smartphone addiction (i.e., score of males: 28.33 and score of females: 26.88) in SAS-SV. University students showed moderate trait and state anxiety [i.e., a score of 51.60 in Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI) and a score of 47.21 in State Anxiety Inventory (SAI)] in STAI. In addition, students showed moderate perceived vulnerability to disease (i.e., a score of 51.51) in PVD. The results showed that fear of COVID-19 and trait anxiety appear to be the predictors of SAI and PVD but not the predictors of risk of smartphone addiction (SAS-SV). <b>Conclusions:</b> The data highlighted the presence of a perception of vulnerability to infections in subjects in which there was also a moderate anxiety, both state and trait, associated with the fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is hoped that a large part of the population will soon be vaccinated, including University students, and therefore, it would be desirable to carry out further assessments in the post-vaccine phase to highlight any differences in the state of anxiety and the perception of vulnerability to infections. The possible positive role of the use of smartphones in maintaining social contacts should also be emphasized.","De Pasquale, Pistorio, Sciacca, Hichy","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.692503","20210802","anxiety; college students; fear COVID-19; perceived vulnerability; smartphone addiction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16744,""
"The Effect of Computerized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy on People's Anxiety and Depression During the 6 Months of Wuhan's Lockdown of COVID-19 Epidemic: A Pilot Study","<b>Background:</b> The effectiveness of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT) has been proven for mild and moderate anxiety and depression. In 2016, the first official Chinese CCBT system was launched by Chinese Cognitive Behavior Therapy Professional Organizations and included four items: getting out of depression, overcoming anxiety, staying away from insomnia and facing Obsessive-compulsive disorder. During the COVID-19 epidemic, Chinese CCBT system served the public for free. This study explored the effects of CCBT on anxiety and depression by comparing the use of the platform during the epidemic and during the same period in 2019. <b>Methods:</b> Users were divided into a depression group or an anxiety group according to their own discretion. The subjects used the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) before each training. Each training group completed the corresponding CCBT training project, which had 5-6 training sessions, an average of once every 5 days. The training content in 2019 and 2020 was identical. This study compared the demographic characteristics, depression, and anxiety levels of CCBT platform users during the lockdown period in Wuhan (LP2020), where the outbreak was concentrated in China, from January 23 to July 23, 2020 and the same period in 2019 (SP2019). <b>Result:</b> (1) There were significant differences in gender (Ãâ€¡<i>2</i> = 7.215, <i>P</i> = 0.007), region (Ãâ€¡<i>2</i> = 4.225, <i>P</i> = 0.040) and duration of illness (Ãâ€¡<i>2</i> = 7.867, <i>P</i> = 0.049) between the two periods. (2) There was a positive Pearson correlation between the number of users of CCBT platform during LP2020 and number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in each province (<i>r</i> = 0.9429, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). (3) In LP2020, the SAS (<i>t</i> = 2.579, <i>P</i> = 0.011) and SDS (<i>t</i> = 2.894, <i>P</i> = 0.004) scores at T0 in Hubei were significantly higher than those in other regions. (4) The CCBT platform has an obvious effect on anxiety (<i>F</i> = 4.74, <i>P</i> = 0.009) and depression on users (<i>F</i> = 4.44, <i>P</i> = 0.009). <b>Conclusion:</b> This study showed women, students and people who are more seriously affected by the epidemic were more likely to accept the CCBT training. The CCBT platform made a significant contribution toward alleviating the anxiety and depression symptoms of users during the epidemic. When face-to-face psychotherapy is not available during the epidemic, CCBT can be used as an effective alternative.","Lv, Li, Zhang, Zhang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.687165","20210802","COVID-19; anxiety; computerized cognitive behavioral therapy; depression; lockdown of Wuhan","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16745,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of College Students: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has been spreading and brought unprecedented psychological pressure on people across the entire globe since December 2019. To synthesize the existing evidence of the prevalence of mental health status during the epidemic and provide the basis for mental health education. The literature search was conducted in nine databases from December 2019 to October 2020. The risk of bias for each study was assessed, and the random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO with the registration number CRD42020208619. About 27 studies were included in the analysis with a total of 706,415 participants combined, and 14 mental health problems were gathered. Meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression was 39% (95% CI: 27-51%) and that of anxiety was 36% (95% CI: 26-46%). Subgroup analysis indicated that the prevalence of depression and anxiety varied among nations and due to the survey date. The prevalence of depression (60%, 95% CI: 46-74%) and anxiety (60%, 95% CI: 46-74%) in non-Chinese college students was higher than those in Chinese college students (26%, 95% CI: 21-30% and 20%, 95% CI: 14-26%). The proportion of depression (54%, 95% CI: 40-67%) and anxiety (37%, 95% CI: 26-48%) was higher after March 1 than before it (21%, 95% CI: 16-25% and 19%, 95% CI: 13-25%). The meta-analysis results presented that the prevalence of depression (39%) or anxiety (36%) among college students greatly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The Association of Mental Health Problems With Preventive Behavior and Caregivers' Anxiety About COVID-19 in Children With Neurodevelopmental Disorders","We examined the association of mental health problems with preventive behavior and caregivers' anxiety in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) and their caregivers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Data were obtained from 227 pairs of children with NDD and their caregivers in a clinic in Fukui Prefecture, Japan, from October 1 to December 31, 2020. During this period, the activities of children and caregivers were not strongly restricted by the public system. Caregivers' anxiety about children's activities was positively associated with caregivers' and children's fears of COVID-19 and children's depressive symptoms. Children's preventive behavior was negatively associated with children's depressive symptoms. These findings suggested that caregivers' fear of COVID-19 stemmed from worry about the relationship between children's activity and COVID-19 infection, and children might have reflected caregivers' expressions of concern. In schools and clinics, practitioners educate children on how to engage in preventive behavior against COVID-19. Our results support the effectiveness of such practices in mitigating mental health problems in children with NDD.","Suzuki, Hiratani","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.713834","20210802","caregivers' anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; fears of COVID-19; neurodevelopmental disorder; preventive behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16747,""
"Maintenance Electroconvulsive Therapy Is an Essential Medical Treatment for Patients With Catatonia: A COVID-19 Related Experience","<b>Aim:</b> Describe naturalistic clinical course over 14 weeks in a mixed adolescent and a young-adult patient group diagnosed with developmental delays and catatonia, when the frequency of maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (M-ECT) was reduced secondary to 2020 COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. <b>Methods:</b> Participants were diagnosed with catatonia, and were receiving care in a specialized clinic. They (<i>n</i> = 9), <i>F</i> = 5, and <i>M</i> = 4, ranged in age from 16 to 21 years; ECT frequency was reduced at end of March 2020 due to institutional restrictions. Two parents/caregivers elected to discontinue ECT due to concern for COVID-19 transmission. Majority (<i>n</i> = 8) were developmentally delayed with some degree of intellectual disability (ID). Observable symptoms were rated on a three point scale during virtual visits. <b>Results:</b> All cases experienced clinically significant decline. Worsening of motor symptoms (agitation, aggression, slowness, repetitive self-injury, stereotypies, speech deficits) emerged within the first 3 weeks, persisted over the 14 week observation period and were more frequent than neurovegetative symptoms (appetite, incontinence, sleep). Four participants deteriorated requiring rehospitalization, and 2 among these 4 needed a gastrostomy feeding tube. <b>Conclusion:</b> Moderate and severe symptoms became apparent in all 9 cases during the observation period; medication adjustments were ineffective; resuming M-ECT at each participant's baseline schedule, usually by week 7, resulted in progressive improvement in some cases but the improvement was insufficient to prevent re-hospitalization in 4 cases. In summary, rapid deterioration was noted when M-ECT was acutely reduced in the setting of COVID-19 related restrictions.","Ghaziuddin, Yaqub, Shamseddeen, Reddy, Reynard, Maixner","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.670476","20210802","catatonia; developmental delay; electroconvulsive therapy; maintenance ECT; maintenance electroconvulsive therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16748,""
"Differences Between the Psychiatric Symptoms of Healthcare Workers Quarantined at Home and in the Hospital After Contact With a Patient With Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","<b>Objective:</b> Although quarantine is an effective measure for the prevention of the spread of infectious diseases, it may have negative effects on the mental health of the isolated individual. During the 2015 outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Korea, healthcare workers came in contact with patients with MERS were quarantined either at home or in a hospital ward. In this study, we aimed to compare the psychiatric symptoms of these employees according to the method of quarantine. <b>Methods:</b> All 146 quarantined staff completed self-report questionnaires. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, anxiety symptoms were assessed using Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and acute stress disorder (ASD) symptoms were evaluated using the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire. <b>Results:</b> The in-hospital quarantine group had a higher rate of symptoms of depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and ASD (<i>p</i> = 0.014) than the group quarantined at home. Logistic regression analysis showed that respondents quarantined in the hospital (OR = 6.342; 95% CI 1.853-21.708) and those quarantined for longer periods (OR = 1.153, 95% CI = 1.036-1.285) had a higher risk of depressive symptoms. <b>Conclusions:</b> In-hospital quarantine and quarantine for longer periods increase the risk of depressive symptoms. When quarantine measures are taken, certain measures are needed to minimize the risk of psychiatric problems. Appropriate interventions should be implemented if psychiatric problems occur.","Seong, Kim, Yim, Park, Son, Jeon, Hwang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.659202","20210802","MERS-CoV; acute stress disorder; anxiety; depression; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16749,""
"Magnitude and Predictors of Health Care Workers Depression During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Health Facility-Based Study in Eastern Ethiopia","<b>Background:</b> Depression of health care workers was related to work absences, resignations, and poor work performance, affecting the quality of patient care and the health care system. The Coronavirus disease pandemic has had an effect on the mental health of health care workers. Health care workers are facing challenges that can be stressful, overwhelming, and cause strong emotions, may put them at higher risk to develop depression. There is limited evidence that assesses health care workers' depression and its associated factors in the study area during the Coronavirus disease pandemic. Therefore this study aimed to assess depression and associated factors among health care workers in eastern Ethiopia. <b>Method:</b> The cross-sectional study design was conducted from October 26th to November 15, 2020. A total of 265 health care workers from 10 health facilities participated. Patient Health Questionnaire was used for the collection of depressive symptoms. The data were analyzed by using STATA version 14 software. To assess the association between depression and the predictors Adjusted Odds Ratio along with a 95% confidence interval was estimated by using logistic regression analysis. A statistical significance was declared at <i>p</i>-value Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.05. <b>Results:</b> Of the total 265 study participant, 176 (66.4%) and 95% CI: 60.4%, 71.8% of them reported depressive symptoms. Of 176 reported symptoms of depression 27.9, 24.1, 9.4, 3.7, and 1.1% were had minimal, mild, moderate, moderate-severe, and severe depressive symptoms respectively. The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed the odds of depression were 2.34 times higher among female participants compared to male participants (AOR: 2.34, 95%CI: 1.09-5.02). In addition, the odds of depression for participants who perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 was 4.05 times higher among their counterpart (AOR: 4.05, 95%CI: 1.12-14.53). <b>Conclusions:</b> Health care workers who experienced depression in the study was high.

The goal of the present study was to validate the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in French (official language in 29 countries), and investigate its relationship with indicators of affective disturbances. The sample comprised 316 participants (271 females) recruited online during the French lockdown. They were from several regions of France. The FCV-19S underwent a forward-backward translation procedure. Its psychometric properties were evaluated with the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The French FCV-19S demonstrated a stable unidimensional structure with robust psychometric properties (strong internal consistency, good convergent and divergent validity, and good test-retest validity). With its robust psychometric properties in assessing the unidimensional construct of the fear of COVID-19, this scale will help to provide a better understanding of the relationship between emotions and psychological or psychiatric disorders during the pandemics in French-speaking countries.","Mailliez, Griffiths, Carre","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00499-x","20210802","COVID-19; Fear; Fear of COVID-19 Scale; French validation; Mental health; Scale development","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16753,""

"Not a matter of quantity: quality of relationships and personal interests predict university students' resilience to anxiety during CoViD-19","During the CoViD-19 pandemic, University students may have suffered from increased anxiety due to interferences in their relationships and in academic requirements, as didactic activities have moved to distance learning systems. However, being surrounded by supportive relationships and being motivated to cultivate personal interests might have decreased anxiety. In this pilot study, we collected the responses of 174 students from Italian University merit colleges to an online questionnaire, investigating their perceived anxiety, the quality of surrounding relationships, whether they were cultivating any personal interests and whether they had spent the period of lockdown in college or at home. Regression analyses indicated that both quality of relationships and personal interests predicted low levels of anxiety (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). However, simple slope analyses showed that personal interests were negatively related to anxiety only at medium and high quality of relationships (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), while no association was found at low quality of relationships. No differences were found between students who stayed in college or at home.

"Policing in a Pandemic: a Commentary on Officer Well-being During COVID-19","The role of police officers during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is challenging, faced with the difficult task of keeping communities safe and preventing the spread of COVID-19 while putting their physical and mental health at risk. Emerging evidence points to the stress experiences of officers during the COVID-19 pandemic. With cases now surpassing 174 million and close to four million deaths worldwide, as well as stringent lockdown measures, police officers are faced with unprecedented challenges resulting from the pandemic. This commentary suggests police departments strengthen resources by putting in place appropriate emergency planning for future public health incidents, in addition to preparing for temporary or permanent loss of human resources. It is important to implement robust training plans post-pandemic to allow officers to offer better care for communities when faced with future public health emergencies. Finally, police officers should be provided with the resources and support to cope with the stresses associated with COVID-19.","Edwards, Kotera","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11896-021-09469-4","20210802","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Pandemic; Police leadership; Police mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16757,""
"Assessment of depression, anxiety and stress in COVID-19 infected individuals and their families","Pandemics have been associated with widespread psychological distress in the normal population due to quarantine and lockdown, however there are only few studies on psychiatric symptoms in COVID infected patients and their families. This study was planned to assess the depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms in individuals and their families infected with COVID19, during current pandemic. A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted on hospitalised, COVID infected patients and their immediate family members. Ninety-three, COVID patients and fifty-four family members were studied through Google forms which contained socio-demographic proforma and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS21). Collected data was tabulated to assess depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in the given population and study their relation with various sociodemographic variables. Almost one-third of the sample showed increased score on depression and anxiety subscales and one-fifth on stress subscales. 30-45% of the family members studied had higher score on either of the subset. There was also a high correlation between the scores of depression, anxiety and stress subset in the study sample.

"Evaluating the Interactive Effect of COVID-19 Worry and Loneliness on Mental Health Among Young Adults","Young adults are overrepresented in terms of adverse mental health problems related to COVID-19. Emerging work has identified worry about the consequences and trajectory of COVID-19 and loneliness as important factors in mental health during the pandemic. However, the main and interactive effects of worry about COVID-19 and loneliness have not been explored in one overarching model in relation to mental health problems among young adults. The present study therefore evaluated loneliness and COVID-19 related worry in terms of anxiety, stress, and depression among young adults (209 college students, 76.1% female<i>, M</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°22.99Ã‚Â years, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.25) recruited to participate in an online survey study. Results indicated a significant interaction between COVID-19 worry and loneliness for each criterion variable (depression: <i>b</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01, <i>SE</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.003, <i>t</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.86, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01; anxiety: <i>b</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01, <i>SE</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.002, <i>t</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.36, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.02; stress: <i>b</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01, <i>SE</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.003, <i>t</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.54, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01), such that worry was more strongly related to each mental health outcome among those that endorsed higher levels of loneliness. The current findings suggest loneliness is related to negative mental health symptoms among young adults experiencing COVID-19 related worry. The current findings provide initial empirical evidence for the impact of COVID-19 worry on mental health among young adults experiencing loneliness. Future research may benefit from exploring how COVID-19 worry and loneliness interplay over time.","Mayorga, Smit, Garey, Gold, Otto, Zvolensky","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10608-021-10252-2","20210802","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Loneliness; Mental Health; Pandemic; Stress; Worry; Young Adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16759,""
"How About the Psychological Pandemic? Perceptions of COVID-19 and Work-Life of Private Sector Employees-A Qualitative Study","COVID-19 had a devastating and profound impact worldwide. The business world has been turbulent, and countries' economic landscape has shown dismal performance. There have been massive downsizing of employees and deductions of pay in most organisations as the pandemic outbreak negatively impacted the business environment. The study aimed to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on the psychology of employees working in private organisations. A qualitative analysis was conducted with 22 middle-level Indian employees employed in private sector organisations. Content analysis was performed from the transcripts and themes; coding categories were developed. Participation in the study was voluntary and was carried out through informed consent. The results demonstrated that the participants experienced psychological stress, social disconnectedness, and a sense of loneliness over the lockdown period. Furthermore, the semi-structured interviews also revealed the perceptions of the job, career prospects, and the fear of the imminent looming future ahead. The pandemic has raised serious questions on the employee's mental health and engagement issues. Managerial implications have been discussed with suggestions to alleviate the current professional and psychological challenges.","Varshney","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12646-021-00605-y","20210802","COVID-19; Home; India; Loneliness; Organisation; Social disconnectedness; Social distancing; Work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16760,""
"The Role of the Sense of Belonging During the Alarm Situation and Return to the New Normality of the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) in Spain","In this study we intend to understand the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the subsequent stay-at-home orders, on the Spanish population's sense of belonging at three moments in time: at the beginning of the lockdown, after one month of lockdown and with the return to the ""new normality"". A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey (N<sub>0</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3480; N<sub>1</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1041; N<sub>2</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°569). The sense of belonging was evaluated by means of four Likert-type items. These questions included membership in different groups: work/studies, friends, family and neighborhood or community. Sociodemographic and COVID-19-related data were collected. Additionally, mental health, spiritual well-being, loneliness, social support and discrimination were assessed. Descriptive analyses were carried out and linear regression models compiled. The sense of belonging increased significantly during confinement, dropping dramatically with the start of the return to the ""new normality"" process. The only variable that showed interaction with time and sense of belonging was discrimination. Work condition (not working providing the lowest sense of belonging scores), social support from friends and loneliness were the main predictors of the sense of belonging. The impact caused by the pandemic and the actions adopted during the first weeks regarding the sense of belonging is evident. It has been a key variable in dealing with COVID-19. Actions are now needed to increase our sense of belonging to face the post-epidemic crisis and avoid a greater impact in other areas.","Saiz, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Sanguino, AusÃƒÂ­n, Castellanos, Abad, Salazar, MuÃƒÂ±oz","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12646-021-00612-z","20210802","COVID-19; Mental health; Quarantine; Sense of belonging; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16761,""
"Symptoms of Common Mental Disorders in Brazilian Parents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associated Factors","COVID-19 pandemic has become a significant international public health problem. In addition to dealing with the pandemic's impact on mental health, parents need to cope with specific changes in their routines caused by social distance measures. This study aimed to investigate common mental disorders (CMD) symptoms in Brazilian parents during the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors. A total of 232 Brazilian parents ranging from 20 to 48Ã‚Â years old (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°33.85; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.83) with children aged 1-36Ã‚Â months (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°17.00; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9,87) participated in an online survey. Parents answered a sociodemographic questionnaire, Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), and Parenting Sense of Competence Scale. Chi-square tests, correlations, and multiple linear regression were performed. Results showed that parents' symptoms of CMD were negatively associated to perceived parental competence (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.130; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.011) and family income (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.190; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.024). Furthermore, perceived stress was the most related variable to parents' symptoms of CMD (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.618; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), showing a positive association. The model explained 49.5% of the variation. Results suggest that lower family income may increase symptoms of CMD in Brazilian parents, which is a concern in a country of high social inequality. Parental sense of competence may be a relevant protective factor. Interventions targeting parental competence and stress reduction should be considered to address the mental health impacts of the pandemic.","Riter, Almeida, Vescovi, Marques, Pedrotti, Mallmann, Pieta, Frizzo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12646-021-00609-8","20210802","COVID-19; Common mental disorders; Mental health; Pandemic; Parental competence; Parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16762,""
"The Psychological Consequences of COVID-19 Outbreak Among the German Population","The world is currently facing an unprecedented pandemic crisis. The highly contagious coronavirus, or COVID-19, first occurred in Wuhan (China) in December 2019. The outbreak of the virus quickly spread all over the world, reaching Europe in January 2020. The first case in Germany was reported to be diagnosed on January 27. This study focuses on assessing the mental health consequences of the German public during COVID-19 outbreak. Psychological discomfort, generalized anxiety disorder, sleep disturbances, depressive symptoms and threat perception are especially investigated with respect to demographics, security importance and negative affectivity. The psychological vulnerabilities that go along with the pandemic are evaluated in detail. The cross-sectional online survey conducted in Germany reveals a prevalence of depressive symptoms, psychological discomfort, threat perception, generalized anxiety disorder and sleep disturbances associated with the pandemic crisis. The results also indicate a relationship between mental health issues and negative affectivity as well as the perception of threat. This paper gives an outlook on long-term consequences and what could be theÃ‚Â strategies to mitigate the negative mental health outcomes of the crisis.","Putinas-Neugebauer, Roland-LÃƒÂ©vy","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12646-021-00614-x","20210802","COVID-19; Generalized anxiety disorder; Mental health issues; Psychological discomfort; Sleep disturbances; Threat","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16763,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Long-Term Recovery from Traumatic Injury","Determine the proportion and characteristics of traumatic injury survivors who perceive a negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their recovery and to define post-injury outcomes for this cohort. The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated physical, psychological, and social stressors that may create a uniquely difficult recovery and reintegration environment for injured patients. Adult (Ã¢â€°Â¥18Ã¢â‚¬Å years) survivors of moderate-to-severe injury completed a survey 6-14Ã¢â‚¬Å months post-injury during the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey queried individuals about the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on injury recovery and assessed post-injury functional and mental health outcomes. Regression models were built to identify factors associated with a perceived negative impact of the pandemic on injury recovery, and to define the relationship between these perceptions and long-term outcomes. Of 597 eligible trauma survivors who were contacted, 403 (67.5%) completed the survey. Twenty-nine percent reported that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted their recovery and 24% reported difficulty accessing needed healthcare. Younger age, lower perceived-socioeconomic status (SES), extremity injury, and prior psychiatric illness were independently associated with negative perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on injury recovery. In adjusted analyses, patients who reported a negative impact of the pandemic on their recovery were more likely to have new functional limitations, daily pain, lower physical and mental component scores of the SF-12 and to screen positive for PTSD and depression. The COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting the recovery of trauma survivors. It is essential that we recognize the impact of the pandemic on injured patients while focusing on directed efforts to improve the long-term outcomes of this already at-risk population.","Herrera-Escobar, Wang, Lamarre, Patel, Orlas, Moheb, Levy-Carrick, Sanchez, Velmahos, Kaafarani, Salim, Nehra","https://doi.org/10.1097/SLA.0000000000005111","20210802","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16764,""

"Self-Care and Storytelling for Radiologists: A Feasibility Study","Physician wellness and burnout mitigation strategies have become priority practices in recent years. Despite these efforts, however, physicians living with the psychological effects of the current COVID-19 global pandemic, political stressors, and social injustices, face ever increasing threats to their personal and professional well-being. This manuscript investigates the process of storytelling as a self-care practice for radiologists. The AUR Well Being Ad-Hoc Committee introduced and approved Storytelling Geek Week, a virtual workshop held by The Moth, a Peabody award-winning storytelling nonprofit group. Nineteen AUR members applied and were selected for participation in the workshop which occurred over 5 days in November 2020. Anonymous electronic surveys were sent to participants before and after the workshop to gather feedback on their experience. Of the 19 AUR member participants, 12 (63%) completed the pre-workshop survey and 8 (42%) completed the post-workshop survey. Participant current state of well-being was found to be increased between the pre- and post-course surveys, with a statistically significant adjusted P-value of 0.017. All 8 post-workshop respondents reported that they would recommend the workshop to others. With regard to how participation in the workshop impacted their wellbeing, representative free text responses include, ""helped with processing emotions,"" and ""felt more connected to strangers."" Regarding shifts in perspective as a result of workshop participation, representative free text responses include, ""more empathetic"" and ""started focusing on hope and gratitude rather than sadness and anxiety."" Participants in a storytelling workshop reported a positive impact on their perceived sense of well-being. Respondents also reports shifts in their sense of empathy and connectedness to others. This type of intervention may help to mitigate burnout and build community during challenging times.","Belfi, Jordan, Chetlen, Deitte, Frigini, Methratta, Robbins, Woods, Benefield, Jay","https://doi.org/10.1067/j.cpradiol.2021.06.010","20210802","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16766,""
"Video-consulting to address mental health needs after traumatic brain injury: evaluation of a training workshop to build capacity among psychologists","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to significant psychological distress, but few psychologists in Australia are trained in working with this complex clinical group. Despite government funding to provide video-consulting (VC) services in Australia, uptake before COVID-19 was limited. This mixed methods study evaluated whether training in eHealth and evidence based TBI psychological therapies increased provider uptake of VC in clinical practice, and delivery of mental health services to individuals with TBI. Mental health professionals completed a range of self-report measures before (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 50), after (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 48), and four months following (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 30) a one-day workshop. Participants' TBI knowledge, client-base and levels of access, confidence, motivation and attitudes toward VC were assessed. Knowledge did not increase after training but participants had significant increases in their confidence and motivation to using VC at follow up. Significant reductions in pragmatic barriers to using VC were reported post training and at follow up, all barrier categories indicated significant reductions. There was no significant change in clinical practice of the participants. Training to increase TBI knowledge requires specific assessment tools and although training appears to reduce barriers to using VC, uptake in clinical practice may require additional supervision and warrants further research.","Whiting, Chuah, Simpson, Deane, Reynolds","https://doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2021.1953594","20210802","Clinician training; cognitive behavioral therapy; implementation; misconceptions; telehealth; traumatic brain injury","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16767,""
"Assessing mental health status among Iranian healthcare workers in times of the COVID-19 pandemic: A web-based cross-sectional study","The present study was conducted to assess 3(HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total number of 7626 HCWs were included in this web-based cross-sectional study, via the convenience sampling technique. To collect the required data, the sociodemographic characteristics information form, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) were also employed. In addition, data analysis was performed using the SPSS Statistics software (ver. 24), as well as descriptive statistics, Chi-square test (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> ), and univariate/multivariate logistic regression models. The CDAS results revealed that 47.9% and 70.5% of the HCWs had experienced moderate levels of physical and psychological anxiety, respectively. Based on the DASS results, 44.8%, 43%, and 34.8% of the HCWs had been subjected to depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. The logistic regression models correspondingly showed that depression among the HCWs was significantly correlated with risk factors, such as the age groups of 20-30 years (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .001), 31-40 years (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .006), female HCWs (p&gt;Ã‚Â .001), history of physical illnesses (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .004), and history of psychiatric disorders (p&gt;Ã‚Â .001). Moreover, factors including the age groups of 20-30 years (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001), 31-40 years (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001), 41-50 years (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001), female HCWs (p&gt;Ã‚Â .001), history of physical illnesses (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001), and history of psychiatric disorders (p&gt;.001) were assumed as significant predictors of anxiety in these individuals. Besides, factors such as the age groups of 20-30 years (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .002), 31-40 years (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .004), female HCWs (p&gt;.001), occupation (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .016), history of physical illnesses (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001), and history of psychiatric disorders (p&gt;Ã‚Â .001) could significantly predict the prevalence rate of stress in the HCWs in times of this crisis. Given the importance of mental health status among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic, health administrators and policymakers of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education in Iran are suggested to provide psychological screening and supportive care programs for HCWs with the aim of enhancing their mental health and successful coping with critical circumstances.","Azizi, Kamali, Moosazadeh, Aarabi, Ghasemian, Hasannezhad Reskati, Elyasi","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2304","20210801","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; healthcare workers; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-03","",16768,""

Icelandic universities offering nursing education. Graduate and undergraduate nursing students in Iceland (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1044) were asked to participate in the study, with a response rate of 32.7%. An online survey was used to evaluate the students' stress and burnout in spring 2020. The main findings show that 51% of the variability in the students' personal burnout was explained by their perceived stress, mental health, and perceived support. Furthermore, the students' perceived stress, support, and educational levels predicted 42% of the variability in their academic burnout. Burnout related to collaborating with fellow-students was explained by the nursing students' physical health and by their educational level, explaining 6% of the variability in fellow-students burnout.

"Hospital presentations for self-poisoning during COVID-19 in Sri Lanka: an interrupted time-series analysis","There is widespread concern over the impact of public health measures, such as lockdowns, associated with COVID-19 on mental health, including suicide. High-quality evidence from low-income and middle-income countries, where the burden of suicide and self-harm is greatest, is scarce. We aimed to determine the effect of the pandemic on hospital presentations for self-poisoning. In this interrupted time-series analysis, we established a new self-poisoning register at the tertiary care Teaching Hospital Peradeniya in Sri Lanka, a lower-middle-income country. Using a standard extraction sheet, data were gathered for all patients admitted to the Toxicology Unit with self-poisoning between Jan 1, 2019, and Aug 31, 2020. Only patients classified by the treating clinician as having intentionally self-poisoned were included. Data on date of admission, age or date of birth, sex, and poisoning method were collected. No data on ethnicity were available. We used interrupted time-series analysis to calculate weekly hospital admissions for self-poisoning before (Jan 1, 2019-March 19, 2020) and during (March 20-Aug 31, 2020) the pandemic, overall and by age (age &lt;25 years vs Ã¢â€°Â¥25 years) and sex. Individuals with missing date of admission were excluded from the main analysis. Between Jan 1, 2019, and Aug 31, 2020, 1401 individuals (584 [41Ã‚Â·7%] males, 761 [54Ã‚Â·3%] females, and 56 [4Ã‚Â·0%] of unknown sex) presented to the hospital with self-poisoning and had date of admission data. A 32% (95% CI 12-48) reduction in hospital presentations for self-poisoning in the pandemic period compared with pre-pandemic trends was observed (rate ratio 0Ã‚Â·68, 95% CI 0Ã‚Â·52-0Ã‚Â·88; p=0Ã‚Â·0032). We found no evidence that the impact of the pandemic differed by sex (rate ratio 0Ã‚Â·64, 95% CI 0Ã‚Â·44-0Ã‚Â·94, for females vs 0Ã‚Â·85, 0Ã‚Â·57-1Ã‚Â·26, for males; p<sub>interaction</sub>=0Ã‚Â·43) or age (0Ã‚Â·64, 0Ã‚Â·44-0Ã‚Â·93, for patients aged &lt;25 years vs 0Ã‚Â·81, 0Ã‚Â·57-1Ã‚Â·16, for patients aged Ã¢â€°Â¥25 years; p<sub>interaction</sub>=0Ã‚Â·077). This is the first study from a lower-middle-income country to estimate the impact of the pandemic on self-harm (non-fatal) accounting for underlying trends. If the fall in hospital presentations during the pandemic reflects a reduction in the medical treatment of people who have self-poisoned, rather than a true fall in incidence, then public health messages should emphasise the importance of seeking help early.
