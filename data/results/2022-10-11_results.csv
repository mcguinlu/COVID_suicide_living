"Rehabilitation in Survivors of COVID-19 (RE2SCUE): a non-randomized, controlled and open study","The sequelae of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) are another socio-economic problem of the pandemic. Fatigue and dyspnea are the most prevalent symptoms. It is not known whether exercise can be used to treat long COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the effects of an 8-week face-to-face rehabilitation program on COVID-19 compared to a remote monitoring group. A total of 37 participants (24.3% hospitalized) were assessed before and after rehabilitation (n=22; 40.8 sd 10.0 years) or remote monitoring (n=15; 45.4 sd 10.5 years). The participants were allocated according to their preferences. Both groups showed improved fatigue and exercise capacity (Incremental Shuttle Walk Test). Participants in the face-to-face rehabilitation group showed improved dyspnea (Pulmonary Functional Status and Dyspnea Questionnaire), anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), attention, and short-term memory (d2-R and Rey's Auditory-Verbal Learning Test). Of the main sequelae, fatigue improves naturally, whereas dyspnea requires rehabilitation. Our results demonstrated the benefits of exercise for COVID-19 sequelae.","Maria Cristine Campos; Tatyana Nery; Ana Elisa Speck; Maiqueli Arpini; Moises Moraes Antunes; Ana Cristina de Bem Alves; Naiara de Souza Santos; Maria Paula Pereira Matos; Nelson Schmidt Junior; Leticia Roehe Bicca; Camila Mascarelo Panisson; Mariana Alves Freitas; Fernando Diefenthaeler; Heloyse Uliam Kuriki; Vanessa Damin; Rodrigo Oliveira da Rosa; Josiane Bueno Gress; Ione Jayce Ceola Schneider; Danielle Soares Rocha Vieira; Livia Arcencio; Aderbal Aguiar","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.10.10.22280907","20221010","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38860,""
"Time trends of mental health indicators in Germany's adult population before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to compromise mental health. Despite a large number of studies, evidence on the development of mental health in general populations during the pandemic is inconclusive. One reason may be that representative data spanning the whole pandemic and allowing for comparisons to pre-pandemic data are scarce. Methods We analyzed representative data from telephone surveys of Germanys adults: German Health Update (GEDA) and COVID-19 vaccination rate monitoring in Germany (COVIMO). Three indicators of mental health were observed in approximately 1,000 and later 3,000 randomly sampled participants monthly until June 2022: symptoms of depression (observed since April 2019 using the PHQ-2), symptoms of anxiety (observed since March 2021 using the GAD-2) and self-rated mental health (observed since March 2021 using a single item). We produced time series graphs including estimated three-month moving means and proportions of individuals with a positive screen (PHQ/GAD-2 score [&ge;] 3) and of those reporting very good/excellent mental health, as well as smoothing curves. We also compared time periods between years. Analyses were stratified by sex, age, and level of education. Results While mean depressive symptom scores declined from the first wave of the pandemic to summer 2020, they increased from October 2020 and remained consistently elevated throughout 2021 with another increase between 2021 and 2022. Correspondingly, the proportion of positive screens first decreased from 11.1 % in spring/summer 2019 to 9.3 % in the same period in 2020 and then rose to 13.1 % in 2021 and to 16.9 % in 2022. While depressive symptoms increased in all subgroups at different times, developments among women, the youngest and eldest adults, and the high level of education group stand out. Furthermore, symptoms of anxiety increased while self-rated mental health decreased between 2021 and 2022. Conclusion Elevated symptom levels and reduced self-rated mental health at the end of our observation period in June 2022 call for further continuous mental health surveillance. Mental healthcare needs of the population should be monitored closely. Findings should serve to inform policymakers and clinicians of ongoing dynamics to guide health promotion, prevention, and care.","Elvira Mauz; Lena Walther; Stephan Junker; Christina Kersjes; Stefan Damerow; Sophie Eicher; Heike HÃ¶lling; Stephan MÃ¼ters; Diana Peitz; Susanne Schnitzer; Julia Thom","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.10.09.22280826","20221010","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38861,""
"Ego-strength mediates the relationship between religious health behaviors and mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran","The present study aimed to examine the mediating role of ego-strength in the relationship between religious health behaviors and mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. A total of 346 university students (301 women, 45 men) completed the Ego-Strength Scale, Religious Health Promoting Behaviors Inventory, and Mental Health Inventory from May 2021 to August 2021. The structural equation modeling and the Pearson correlation method were used. The results revealed that religious health behaviors have a positive and significant relationship with, psychological wellbeing, and ego-strength, as well as a negative significant relationship with psychological distress. The results also showed ego-strength has a negative relationship with psychological distress. Ego-strength mediated the relationship between religious health behaviors and symptoms of mental health. Ego-strength can be considered as a very important variable in religious health psychology;reinforcing ego-strength may have some implications for mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Hosseini, S.

"Analysis of COVID-19-related psychiatric disorders - clinical manifestations and therapeutic considerations","During the COVID-19 pandemic, neuropsychiatric disorders have been diagnosed both in the acute phase, and in the aftermath of this disease. Inpatients, as well as outpatients recently diagnosed with mild, moderate or severe forms of Coronavirus infection have reported neuropsychiatric manifestations with variable duration, symptoms that could be directly or indirectly related to the viral pathogenic agent. Patients who are recovering from the acute phase of COVID- 19 also may exhibit various psychopathological manifestations, during the so-called ""post-COVID-19 syndrome"" or ""long COVID-19 syndrome"". Explanations regarding the onset of this type of clinical manifestations and the SARS-CoV-2 infection are extremely diverse, ranging from biological factors (e.g., direct central nervous system viral activity, cerebral hypooxygenation, high level of inflammatory response) to psycho-social stressors (e.g., isolation, fear of death, anxiety related to possible somatic complications or sequelae). Objectives: The primary objective of this article was to analyze psychiatric manifestations in patients with acute COVID-19 disease and in patients during post-COVID-19 phase. The secondary objective was to propose a conceptual framework for the evaluation and treatment of these patients. Methods: Patients included in this analysis were screened positive for COVID-19 infection in the last 6 months before their first psychiatric examination. These patients were further evaluated to detect any personal history of psychiatric disorders, somatic comorbidities, or significant concomitant pharmacological treatments. Specific scales for the measurement of symptoms severity and functional impairment were administered in all patients. Results: Five patients were included in this analysis, one during the acute phase of COVID-19 infection, and four patients were evaluated after the complete remission of this disease. Hyperactive delirium, mild neurocognitive disorder, major depressive episode, panic disorder with agoraphobia, or acute psychotic disorder were the main diagnoses in these patients. All patients received adequate treatment and they were monitored using psychological scales until symptoms remission or stabilisation. Conclusions: Psychosocial stressors, neurobiological changes, systemic inflammatory reaction, and individual vulnerability factors may contribute to a diathesisstress model for psychiatric disorders onset within the acute phase or after the remission of acute manifestations in COVID-19-diagnosed patients.","Vasiliu, O.; Mangalagiu, A.

"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on the mental health status of Indian undergraduate health professional students","Introduction and Aim: The psychological effects of the COVID-19 outbreak and related lockdown measures among the Indian population are less known. Undergraduate students are prone to mental health problems making them more vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic and its lockdown. This study sought to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on the mental health status of undergraduate health professional students of a tertiary care setup. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried on undergraduate health professional students of a private Deemed-to-be University. 246 participants took part in this study. A questionnaire was provided as a Google form containing 26 questions. It captured the main dimensions of mental health-related issues in undergraduate students. Paired â€˜tâ€™ test was employed to compare the mental health status of the participants before and during the lockdown. Results: A significant majority of our participants experienced stress during the lockdown. There was no significant effect of gender, the number of household members, or prior mental health challenges on the mental status of the students. COVID-19 updates on central government introduced mobile application significantly decreased stress but reports from television/radio and social media significantly contributed to stress. Students engaged in online academic activities of more than four hours per day were significantly stressed. Conclusion: Undergraduate health professional students in our study were significantly more stressed during the lockdown as compared to the pre-lockdown period. Academic online activity also significantly contributed to stress with more than four hours of online engagement precipitating severe stress.","Thalanjeri, P.; Balakrishnan, G.; Bangera, S.; Biju, N.; Balasubramaniyam, K.","https://doi.org/10.51248/.v42i4.1670","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Biomedicine (India); 42(4):778-783, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38864,""
"Research article A study on immediate and training effect of Bhramari pranayama on heart rate variability in healthy adolescents","Introduction and Aim: Bhramari pranayama (Humming bee breath) is the most common slow pranayama practice involving inhalation through both nostrils followed by exhalation which produces sound of humming bee. Practicing pranayama reduces the effects of stress on different systems by increasing the vagal tone. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there are heightened feelings of stress, anxiety and depression and pranayama can be an effective way to improve our mental and emotional well-being. This study has been chosen to assess the effect of Bhramari pranayama on autonomic functions and to compare the immediate and training effects of Bhramari pranayama in the study group. Materials and Methods: An observational study was conducted in a medical college among 110 students aged between 18-22 years for a period of 2 months. The participants were instructed to do 9 rounds of Bhramari pranayama every day for 3 weeks. The immediate and training effect of pranayama practice on HRV (Heart Rate Variability) was assessed. The parameters of HRV (time and frequency domains) were assessed by PHYSIOPAC-PP4 (MEDICAID SYSTEMS, Chandigarh). Results: After training of Bhramari pranayama for 3 weeks, there was a decrease in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) and PNN50 and a decrease in frequency domain parameters, LFnu and LF/HF ratio were observed significantly. Conclusion: The study shows the possibility that Bhramari pranayama has a beneficial effect on HRV in medical students, as the autonomic balance produces the improvement of parasympathetic tone.","Latha, R.; Sarveghna Lakshmi, S.","https://doi.org/10.51248/.v42i4.1501","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Biomedicine (India); 42(4):784-788, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38865,""
"Factors underlying denial of and disbelief in COVID-19","Objective:: To investigate factors that influence or promote disbelief and negative attitudes toward COVID-19. Methods:: This was cross-sectional study involving 544 males and females = 18 years of age in Greece between December of 2020 and January of 2021. All participants were informed about the purpose of the study, protection of anonymity, and volunteer participation. Participants completed an online anonymous 40-item questionnaire. Analysis of data included the identification of correlations and use of t-tests and ANOVA. Results:: The level of knowledge regarding COVID-19 transmission routes, manifestations, and prevention was high in our sample. Women appeared to have a more positive attitude toward COVID-19 prevention and management than did men (p = 0.032 and p = 0.018, respectively). Younger people (18-30 years of age) seemed to deny the validity of scientific data and mass media reports about ways to deal with the pandemic more commonly than did those &gt; 30 years of age (p = 0.003 and p = 0.001, respectively). People who resided in cities more commonly believed in scientific announcements than did those living in villages (p = 0.029). Conclusions:: In order to minimize cases of denial of and disbelief in COVID-19 and to promote vaccination, a series of actions are required. Governments should implement a series of measures to contain the disease, taking into consideration the psychological and social aspects of those policies.","Vasilopoulos, Aristidis, Alexandra Pantelidaki, Nikoleta, Tzoura, Aggeliki, Papadopoulou, Dimitra, Stilliani, Kotrotsiou, Paralikas, Theodosios, Kortianou, Eleni, Mastrogiannis, Dimos","https://doi.org/10.36416/1806-3756/e20220228","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Jornal Brasileiro de Pneumologia; 48(5), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38866,""
"The coronavirus conundrum - Countries better prepared to face the pandemic - The Omicron variant and mutations New vaccines? - The pregnant woman, the placenta, the fetus and the neonate","Several western countries have initiated the return to pre-pandemic life with the reduction in the number of severe infections and deaths despite of the high infectivity of the Omicron B2 variant. This is occurring amid complaints from the population tired of the restrictions due to COVID-19, the consequent economic and labor problems and with an antivaccine sector with an important presence. SARS-CoV-2 will not disappear, new variants will emerge, and it will be necessary to be alert to its threats and design new vaccines. However, human beings are learning the measures to prevent infection, the importance of self-protection and of the family, and the surveillance of the virus. Imperfect vaccines have been developed that require boosters at relatively short intervals. However, many countries are not yet prepared to face the pandemic - now endemic - due to overconfidence in the eventual disappearance of the virus, lack of human and economic resources for better health care, and corruption. Women are more sensitive to viral infection and is getting vaccinated to avoid serious infection and death. Evidence finds that pregnant women with COVID-19 suffer more miscarriages, preterm deliveries, and intrauterine and perinatal death. The placenta is the unit most compromised in its defense of the fetus. The resulting placentitis causes placental insufficiency and fetal hypoxic-ischemic injury. Newborns are protected by the passage of maternal antibodies, with a longer duration of those originated by vaccines. Much remains to be known about the future of SARS-CoV-2 infection. But a complex and shocking problem resulting from the infection is already a reality - the prolongation of multi-organ damage, even with mild disease, mainly in the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and cerebral systems, as well as the alteration of mental health and shortening of life.","Pacheco-Romero, J.","https://doi.org/10.31403/rpgo.v68i2388","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Revista Peruana De Ginecologia Y Obstetricia; 68(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38867,""
"Evolution of Anxiety and Depression in Men during the First Six Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Factors Associated with Worsening of Mental Health: Retrospective Longitudinal Study","Background: The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a huge impact on the psychological wellbeing of the population, however, few studies have analysed the psychological consequences for the most vulnerable groups, particularly those suffering from depression and anxiety, and specifically in men. The objective of this study is to analyse the changes in a population of men undergoing active treatment for depression or anxiety and factors associated with these changes. Methods: Retrospective, longitudinal and observational study of a population of 28,294 men in northern Spain. The study variables were sociodemographic variables, chronic comorbidities, COVID-19 infection, anxiolytic and antidepressant drug consumption, and use of healthcare resources. These variables were collected from the Primary Health Care electronic records for the two distinct periods (6 months before and 6 months following the end of the lockdown). To compare drug patterns and the use of healthcare resources a paired Student's T-test was used. To analyse associated factors related to a deterioration of mental disorders, a multivariate logistic regression was performed. Results: In relation to changes in drug patterns, 40% of men saw an increase in at least one Defined Daily Dose (DDD) of their prescribed drugs during the 6 months following lockdown and the number of appointments at health centres and home visits significantly decreased. Factors associated with a deterioration of mental disorders are being under 60 years old, having an income of less than 18,000 euros/year and suffering from more than one comorbidity. Conclusions: The pandemic had a significant impact on men with a previous diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety.","ClaverÃ­a-FontÃ¡n, Ana, Couso-Viana, Sabela, OlivÃ¡n-BlÃ¡zquez, BÃ¡rbara, Aguilar-Latorre, Alejandra, Lear-Claveras, Ana","https://doi.org/10.31083/j.jomh1809182","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Men's Health; 18(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38868,""
"The Stress, Mental Health Issues, and Mental Well-Being of COVID-19 Survivors: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis Study of Male University Students","Background: This study investigates the sources of stress and mental well-being based on the experiences and sense-making process of a group of COVID-19 survivors in South Korea. Currently, only a few studies have focused on the stress and mental and psychological well-being of COVID-19 survivors, particularly in undergraduate male university students in the East Asian region. Based on social stigma theory, this study was guided by the following research question: How would undergraduate male university students express and describe their sources of stress that may impact the mental and psychological well-being of COVID-19 survivors, particularly in the case of South Korea? Methods: Interpretative phenomenological analysis was employed. Two in-depth interview sessions, one focus group activity, and one member-checking interview session via the Zoom app were employed to collect lived experiences from eight COVID-19 survivors who are traditional-age (i.e., 18-25 years old) university students at South Korean universities. Results: Three themes were categorised: (1) Religious Practices and Churchgoers, (2) University Matters and Personnel, and (3) Challenges from Relatives, Neighbours, and Friends. All participants argued that their gender roles, behaviours, the individuals around them and their environment offer different sources of stress, which influence their mental health and well-being as COVID-19 survivors. Although they had already been discharged from hospital and were categorised as healthy people, the government and general public continued to offer pressure. Conclusions: The results of this study illustrated the issues of sources of stress and mental and psychological well-being of COVID-19 survivors, particularly in South Korea. Although the participants had recovered from the illness caused by COVID-19, they continued to face stress, challenges, and problems from the individuals around them and their environment. The results of this study may fill the gaps about the experiences between male university undergraduate students as COVID-19 survivors in South Korea.","Dos Santos, Luis Miguel","https://doi.org/10.31083/j.jomh1809180","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Men's Health; 18(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38869,""

By reviewing scientific papers, we found a considerable number of studies showing change of lifestyle habits and deterioration of mental health during the pandemic around the world. In addition, it has been shown that psychological characteristics may affect deterioration of mental health during the pandemic. Especially, cognitive social capital as well as internal locus of control have been indicated, with some extent of consistency, play an important role in sustaining and improving mental health in the context of the pandemic, although other parts of personal characteristics could not be unheeded. Accordingly, prevention of mental health problems could be implemented by focusing on cognitive social capital and internal locus of control in the population at this moment.","Mori, M.; Seko, T.; Ogawa, S.","https://doi.org/10.15114/smj.90.37","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sapporo Medical journal; 90:37-41, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38870,""
"[COVID-19, Home Health Care Nurse, Risk Communication, Literature Review]","The field of home health care nursing is also at the forefront of COVID-19. A characteristic of home health care nursing is that services are provided to patients through the collaboration of multiple organizations in several fields. There were no manuals for home health care nursing facilities in the early stages of the outbreak and spread of an unknown infectious disease, such as COVID-19, and information about infectious disease countermeasures and information to be communicated to patients may have differed among organizations. To understand the actual situation, we reviewed 53 articles on risk communication among home health care nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we could understand the significance of information management in home nursing, the difficulties in the management system due to the small scale of the office, the mental health of the staff, and the increase in cases and care that are difficult to judge. In the future, issues that need to be addressed include efficient as well as correct information sharing and communication, the development of a system to continue home nursing care when risks arise, mental health measures for the staff, and the organization of content to ensure the quality of care.

"Legislative framework and policies for mental health in india: A study of emerging trends","Mental health issues impose an enormous disease burden on societies across the world. Despite its enormous social burden, mental disorders continue to be driven into the shadows by stigma, prejudice and fear. The issue is becoming ever more urgent in light of the forced migration and sustained conflict in many countries of the world. The status of mental health care varies widely from country to country. Many countries already have policies to deliver services for mental health conditions in primary care settings but require system strengthening to achieve integration. Many countries deliver care mainly in institutional settings and need dedicated advocacy and support in phasing out long-stay institutions and developing community-based alternatives. Some countries may require support for policy development or to implement mental health reform efforts. Concerns about potential increases in mental health conditions had already prompted 90% of countries surveyed to include mental health and psychosocial support in their COVID-19 response plans, but major gaps and concerns remain.For much of the pandemic, services for mental, neurological and substance use conditions were the most disrupted among all essential health services reported by WHO Member States. Many countries also reported major disruptions in life-saving services for mental health, including for suicide prevention. Various legislative provisions and Policies have been formulated. Post pandemic, the government of India paid more attention to the concern of mental health and introduced initiatives hitting the target areas. World Health Organizationâ€™s most recent Mental Health Atlas showed that in 2020, governments worldwide spent on average just over 2% of their health budgets on mental health and many low-income countries reported having fewer than one mental health worker per 100000 people. The addition of National Tele Mental Health Programme will bridge the critical gap and make the whole digital health ecosystem holistic. Respecting the rights of persons with mental health problems will reduce stigmatizing and discriminatory behaviours.","Mishra, S.; Sharma, B.; Kuriyal, S.; Ray, S.; Pant, P.; Ray, S.","https://doi.org/10.14704/nq.2022.20.10.NQ55047","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: NeuroQuantology; 20(10):676-685, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38872,""
"Psychological Effects of COVID-19 Process on Oncology Patients","The COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the world as an important health problem for the past 2 years, has brought about high morbidity and mortality rates for cancer patients, and therefore, cancer patients have been defined as a vulnerable group in terms of the pandemic. With the rapid spread of COVID-19, many cancer patients had difficulty in accessing health services, were faced with the postponement or delay of their treatment and controls, or postponed their applications to health institutions for fear of COVID-19. As a result of the research, during this period, it was observed that the incidence of anxiety and depression increased in cancer patients and they experienced high levels of fear and distress associated with COVID-19. Among the main sources of these psychological problems are concerns about not being able to access health services, information needs, and problems related to caring, as well as fear of coronavirus sensitivity, difficulty tolerating uncertainty, and feeling lonely in relation to living socially isolated come to the fore. Understanding the psychological effect of COVID-19 on cancer patients can assist in planning care and meeting the psychological support needs of cancer patients during future crises.","anuk, dilek","https://doi.org/10.5505/tjo.2022.3779","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Turkish Journal of Oncology;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38873,""
"The Relationship between Healthcare Experience and Perinatal Depression during COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The prevalence of peripartum depression (PPD) has increased substantially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. To reduce the probability of contagion, hospitals had to adapt their care protocols, including the care of women in the perinatal period. Method: A cross-sectional study was used in a total sample of 3,356 women, 1,402 in the prenatal period and 1,954 in the postnatal period. They completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale to assess depressive symptoms and the Spanish version of the Coronavirus Perinatal Experiences to assess health experience. Results: The results showed that feeling very well supported by a health professional was associated with a lower risk of PPD. On the other hand, believing it very important to have access to a mental health professional and being concerned about changes in infant care due to COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of PPD. Conclusion: The results showed the relationship between health experience and the risk of depressive symptoms, highlighting the importance of considering the psychological aspects in the development of measures and protocols for perinatal care.","Kovacheva, Katina, RodrÃ­guez-MuÃ±oz, MarÃ­a de la Fe, Baya, Diego GÃ³mez, Salas, Sara DomÃ­nguez, MartÃ­nez, Emma Motrico","https://doi.org/10.5093/clysa2022a13","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: ClÃ­nica y Salud;: 000-000, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38874,""
"Impact of tele rehabilitation on clinical outcomes in patients recovering from COVID-19: a preliminary investigation","Pulmonary rehabilitation has proven to be an effective therapeutic intervention for people with chronic respiratory disease. Considering the highly contagious nature of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it becomes imperative to develop a method which can effectively improve clinical disease outcomes of these patients without any physical contact. The purpose of the study was to investigate the impact of tele rehabilitation on dyspnoea, endurance and quality-of-life in patients recovering from COVID 19. Thirty-two participants (age: 42.5 +/- 13.94, height: 165.8 +/- 10.06, weight: 68.5 +/- 9.63, body mass index: 25.0 +/- 3.61) who are recovering from COVID-19 were recruited as per the eligibility criteria. They were randomly allocated into two groups, Tele rehabilitation (n=16) and Control (n=16) by lottery method. All the selected participants were assessed at baseline for perceived dyspnoea, endurance and quality-of-life. Patients in the Tele rehabilitation group received 14 sessions of rehabilitation on alternate days online via google meet over a period of 28 days. Control group received usual care during the study period. Standard statistical tests were employed to test the study hypothesis. Results suggested a significant improvement in both dyspnoea (P=0.001) and endurance (P&lt;0.001) in response to tele rehabilitation. Domains of quality-of-life such as physical role (P=0.02), vitality (P=0.04), emotional role (P=0.03), mental health (P=0.02) and physical components score (P=0.007) also showed significant improvement with tele rehabilitation in patients recovering from COVID-19. Findings of this preliminary study concludes that tele rehabilitation may be considered a treatment of choice in patients recovering from COVID-19 for improving outcomes of dyspnoea, endurance and quality-of-life.","Arora, K.; Chauhan, D.; Gupta, M.; Bhati, P.; Anand, P.; Hussain, M.

"Qurâ€™anic Bibliotherapy Intervention in Pregnant Women Experiencing Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia: A Qualitative Exploratory Study","BACKGROUND: The disease caused by coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) has been stated as a global epidemic by the WHO. The COVID-19 pandemic adds many risk factors to maternal mental health during the perinatal period. The impact of anxiety during pregnancy is adverse obstetric consequences such as premature birth, inadequate antenatal care, requests for elective cesarean delivery, low APGAR scores of infants, and postpartum depression. Nursing interventions to overcome anxiety can be done through spiritual and religious intervention approaches. One of the spiritual interventions for the Muslim population to improve religious coping is Qurâ€™anic Bibliotherapy (QB) as Islamic bibliotherapy. AIM: This study aimed to explore the use of QB interventions for pregnant women experiencing anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted to explore the experience of the intervention given to the informant. The qualitative samples were ten respondents with moderate-to-severe anxiety levels. The anxiety instrument used was the Zung Anxiety Scale. RESULTS: The themes obtained from in-depth interviews with semi-structured interviews were recognizing COVID-19 and its perceived impact, the impetus for changing resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic, parentsâ€™ role, and the benefits of QB for pregnant women in the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: QB encourages informantsâ€™ positive thinking, feeling, spiritual, and attitude patterns. QB can be used as a complementary Islamic intervention for health workers, especially nurses, in providing nursing care to Muslim patients.","Dewi, I. P.; Fatmawati, A.; Aisyah, P. S.; Linawati, S.

"Assessment of Attitudes and Intentions towards COVID-19 Vaccines and Associated Factors among General Populations of Pakistan: A Cross-Sectional Study","Objective: The goal of public health in combatting COVID-19 is to increase herd immunity. However, vaccine reluctance makes attaining herd immunity a worldwide challenge. This investigation aimed to identify negative and positive attitudes and intentions about COVID-19 vaccinations. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted once free COVID-19 vaccines became available in Pakistan in 2021. 4392 Pakistanis aged 18 and older were surveyed from seven administrative units between 1 July and 30 August 2021. Online structured questionnaires were utilized to collect data using a simple sampling procedure. The questionnaires were divided into three major sections: sociodemographic, health factors, and attitudes toward COVID-19. Results: The survey link was shared with approximately 4500 participants. 97.6%(4392) completed the survey once begun. Frequency, percentage and Chi-square tests were used to analyze statistical data. Most of the participants in the research were men (2703 (61.54%)), 3277 (74.61%) were aged 18&ndash;29 years, and 1824 (41.53%) were residents of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. (18.69%) Respondents expressed COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, whereas 36.66% of participants liked getting the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines and (35.84%) of participants preferred the Pfizer vaccine. A significant number of participants (38.05%) were concerned about the vaccine's unexpected side effects Thus, it is essential to realize that many participants were concerned about the vaccine's unexpected side effects. Conclusions: The overall high level of concern about the unforeseen side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as widespread vaccine hesitancy among Pakistani populations and its predictors, should be taken into account if public health intervention campaigns in Pakistan are changing negative attitudes and improving compliance with regard to COVID-19 vaccines.","Khattak, Saadullah, Idrees, Muhammad, Iqbal, Hafiza Iqra, Khan, Maqbool, Assad, Nasir, Khan, Muhammad Naeem, Yousaf, Muhammad Tufail, Farooq, Muhammad, Yang, Chang-Yong, Wu, Dong-Dong, Ji, Xin-Ying","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10101583","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Vaccines; 10(10):1583, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38877,""

"The Association between Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Psychological Distress among Primary School and Middle School Teachers during the COVID-19 Epidemic: A Moderated Mediation Analysis","Background: The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its rapid spread may have led to individuals developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and psychological distress. Under this context, teachers merit more attention as a group with high levels of work stress. The purpose of this study was to verify the relationship between PTSD and psychological distress and to explore sleep problems as a possible mediator in the relationship between PTSD and psychological distress, as well as the moderator of internet gaming disorders (IGD) in the relationship between sleep problems and psychological distress. Methods: A total of 11,014 Chinese primary and middle school teachers participated in this study. The survey was conducted online between 25 May and 30 June 2020. Results: PTSD was shown to have both a direct and indirect effect on teachers' psychological distress. The indirect effect was mediated by sleep problems. IGD played a moderating role between sleep problems and psychological distress. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, PTSD has been shown to have had a serious impact on the psychological stress of teachers, which was mediated by sleep problems. In addition, IGD raised the harm brought from sleep problems on teachers' mental health.","Liang, Jia-Xin, Gao, Ying, Chen, I-Hua, Chen, Xiu-Mei, Zheng, Yuan-Yuan","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141912128","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(19):12128, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38879,""
"The Impact of Workload on Workers' Traumatic Stress and Mental Health Mediated by Career Adaptability during COVID-19","Building on career construction theory and the conservation of resources theory, this study investigated the impact of workload on healthcare workers' mental health and secondary traumatic stress mediated by career adaptability during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collected from 549 healthcare workers working in Lebanese private hospitals in a two-wave survey were utilized to evaluate the proposed conceptual model, using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Contrary to our propositions, the workload had a significant positive effect on career adaptability and mental health and a negative effect on secondary traumatic stress. Similarly, career adaptability had a significant positive impact on mental health whereas it had a negative significant impact on secondary traumatic stress. Moreover, the results indicated that career adaptability links workload to secondary traumatic stress;however, the sign of the mediating effect is contrary to the hypotheses of this study. Our unexpected results indicate that workload might be considered a challenging demand that enhances healthcare workers' career adaptability and mental health and reduces secondary traumatic stress. Healthcare management and human resource managers should develop employees' abilities to face subsequent large-scale pandemics and should create a positive working atmosphere by providing support and training to healthcare workers.","Hassanie, Souad, Olugbade, Olusegun A.; Karadas, Georgiana, Altun, Ã–zlem","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141912010","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(19):12010, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38880,""
"A Study of Consumers' Perceptions of Take-Out Food before and after the COVID-19 Outbreak: Applying Big Data Analysis","This study explored changes in consumers' perceptions of take-out food before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic using big data collected from social media. Using 'take-out food';as a keyword, 18,544 search results were found in 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak, compared to 20,718 search results in 2021. These keywords were analyzed using text mining, semantic network analysis, CONCOR analysis, and sentiment analysis, respectively, to understand consumers' perception of take-out food. Using text mining, in 2019, 'dining-out';was the most frequent search term associated with take-out food, followed by packing, famous restaurant, family, delicious, menu, and available. In 2021, 'dining-out';was again the most popular keyword, followed by packing, famous restaurant, delivery, family, delicious, available, and Corona. A semantic network analysis showed that, in 2019, four categories emerged: delicious, meat, satisfaction, and lunchbox. The same analysis showed that, in 2021, the categories were delicious, meat, good, and home meal. These findings suggest that, after COVID-19, take-out food began to be recognized as a daily meal that can replace home-cooked meals. According to the sentiment analysis, the number of positive keywords decreased by 4.03% after COVID-19, while the number of negative keywords increased at the same rate;regarding the increase in negative keywords, such as sadness, disgust, and fear, since the emergence of COVID-19, consumers' anxiety about eating out due to the virus was observed. This study can be useful by providing core data and an analysis method necessary for food service companies' business activities and decision making related to take-out amid consumers' rapidly changing needs for the dining-out environment caused by COVID-19.","Jang, Jina, Lee, Eunjung, Jung, Hyosun","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141911889","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(19):11889, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38881,""
"Positive Psychology Applied to Education in Practicing Teachers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Personal Resources, Well-Being, and Teacher Training","Teaching has often been linked to psychosocial problems, and is an occupation in which the implementation of strategies for the improvement, updating and promotion of the mental health of those involved is essential. Accordingly, this study assessed the effectiveness of a program aimed at improving psychological well-being, optimism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem as well as at reducing psychological distress in teachers. The study was quasi-experimental and comprised 24 teachers from technical, secondary, and elementary schools in Uruguay. The constructs were measured before and after the program, which was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic and comprised 12 modules in a multicomponent intervention format. The results indicate a significantly low magnitude increase in well-being (F = 5.36, p = 0.033, Cohen's d = 0.47) and a moderate increase in self-efficacy (F = 9.14, p = 0.008, Cohen's d = 0.62). Similarly, a significant decrease was observed in psychological distress of mild effect (F = 5.80, p = 0.028, Cohen's d = 0.49). To conclude, interventions based on positive psychology improve teachers' well-being, enhance other psychological resources, and reduce psychosocial risks such as discomfort. Thus, these interventions can be devices for career development and teacher updating.","GarcÃ­a-Ãlvarez, Diego, Soler, MarÃ­a JosÃ©, Cobo-RendÃ³n, Rubia, HernÃ¡ndez-Lalinde, Juan","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141811728","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(18):11728, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38882,""
"A Need for Benzodiazepine Deprescribing in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cohort Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on patients' mental health. The aim of this study was to explore whether the pandemic influenced the use and prescription of benzodiazepines and increased the need for community pharmacist involvement in counselling on deprescribing. Electronic prescription-related data from one pharmacy in Croatia were retrospectively collected for the COVID-19 period (April 2020 to March 2021) and compared with pre-COVID-19 (April 2019 to March 2020) data. Data were collected for patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders who filled out more than one prescription for benzodiazepines, and included age, sex, number of medicines, benzodiazepines, and comorbidities. A total of 1290 benzodiazepine users were identified;of these, 32.87% started using benzodiazepines during the COVID-19 period, while 35.2% continued with benzodiazepine use. More than half of all benzodiazepine users were identified as potential deprescribing candidates (dispensed more than three prescriptions). Women, older patients, multimorbid individuals, and patients with polypharmacy were more likely to use benzodiazepines for a prolonged period. The results show a negative trend of benzodiazepine usage among community-dwelling patients during the pandemic. Community pharmacists can identify potential candidates for deprescribing and initiate a process that ensures more rational use of benzodiazepines and increases the safety of treatment.","BuÅ¾ancic, Iva, Pejakovic, Tajana Iva, HadÅ¾iabdic, Maja Ortner","https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy10050120","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pharmacy; 10(5):120, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38883,""
"Relationship between Mental Health and Emotional Eating during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review","Obesity is one of the most dangerous epidemics of the 21st century. In 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic began and caused many deaths among patients with obesity with and without complications. Simultaneously, the lockdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic caused a host of emotional problems including anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. Many people began to cope with their emotions by increasing food (emotional eating) and alcohol consumption and in combination with decreased physical activity, promoted the development of overweight and obesity. Emotional eating, also known as stress eating, is defined as the propensity to eat in response to positive and negative emotions and not physical need. It should be noted that emotional eating may be the first step in the development of binge eating disorder and its extreme subtypes such as food addiction. Interestingly in some post-bariatric surgery patients, an increased frequency of addictive disorders has been observed, for example food addiction replaced by alcohol addiction called: 'cross addiction';or 'addiction transfer';. This data indicates that obesity should be treated as a psychosomatic disease, in the development of which external factors causing the formation of negative emotions may play a significant role. Currently, one of these factors is the COVID-19 pandemic. This manuscript discusses the relationships between the COVID-19 pandemic and development of emotional eating as well as potential implications of the viral pandemic on the obesity pandemic, and the need to change the approach to the treatment of obesity in the future.","Burnatowska, Ewelina, Surma, Stanislaw, Olszanecka-Glinianowicz, Magdalena","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14193989","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Nutrients; 14(19):3989, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38884,""
"Sleep Disorders and Their Associated Factors during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Data from Peruvian Medical Students","Background and objectives: Sleep disorders are a common public health problem among college students. The objective of this study was to evaluate sleep quality and its associated factors in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The Potential of Cardiac Telerehabilitation as Delivery Rehabilitation Care Model in Heart Failure during COVID-19 and Transmissible Disease Outbreak: A Systematic Scoping Review of the Latest RCTs","Background and objective: Patients with heart failure are a high-risk group who may have a higher mortality rate if infected during the COVID-19 pandemic. The problem of a patient's non-adherence to cardiac rehabilitation programs is still a challenge, resulting in disappointing long-term benefits of cardiac rehabilitation. Telehealth, including telerehabilitation, has grown in popularity to improve access to quality healthcare. It is more valuable and safer compared to usual rehabilitation care, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic, to cut down unnecessary hospital visits and reduce the risk of cluster infections. This study aims to identify the efficacy of relevant randomized control trials (RCTs) using telerehabilitation in managing heart failure. The model, delivery care, safety, and efficacy were assessed. Material and Methods: This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The authors included relevant records published in the last ten years from three databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, ProQuest, and EBSCO. Each included study was further assessed using Cochrane's Risk of Bias (Rob 2) tool. Results: The telerehabilitation models consisted of cellphones, instant messaging, or online videoconferencing software. Some also included tool sets to monitor patients' vital signs regularly or during exercise. Most patients adhered to and completed all provided programs. Cardiac telerehabilitation successfully improved patients' physical fitness, quality of life, and mental health. No major adverse outcomes or significant complications were associated with the program. Conclusion: Cardiac telerehabilitation has the potential to deliver rehabilitation for heart failure patients, evidenced by its feasibility, efficacy, and safety. As a future perspective, this delivery care type can be applied throughout transmissible disease outbreaks or even globally.","Maulana, Sidik, Trisyani, Yanny, Mirwanti, Ristina, Amirah, Shakira, Kohar, Kelvin, Priyatmoko Putri, Aprilia Inggritika, Novianti, Evi","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58101321","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medicina; 58(10):1321, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38886,""
"Post-COVID Pain Is Not Associated with Inflammatory Polymorphisms in People Who Had Been Hospitalized by COVID-19","Our aim was to assess the association between four inflammatory polymorphisms with the development of post-COVID pain and to associate these polymorphisms with the clinical pain phenotype in individuals who had been hospitalized by COVID-19. Three potential genotypes of IL-6 (rs1800796), IL-10 (rs1800896), TNF-&alpha;(rs1800629), and IFITM3 (rs12252) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained from no-stimulated saliva samples from 293 (49.5% female, mean age: 55.6 &plusmn;12.9 years) previously hospitalized COVID-19 survivors by polymerase chain reactions. Pain phenotyping consisted of the evaluation of pain features, sensitization-associated symptoms, anxiety levels, depressive levels, sleep quality, catastrophizing, and kinesiophobia levels in patients with post-COVID pain. Analyses were conducted to associate clinical features with genotypes. One hundred and seventeen (39.9%) patients experienced post-COVID pain 17.8 &plusmn;5.2 months after hospital discharge. No significant differences in the distribution of the genotype variants of any SNPs were identified between COVID-19 survivors with and without post-COVID pain (all, p &gt; 0.47). Similarly, the clinical pain phenotype was not significantly different between patients with and without post-COVID pain since no differences in any variable were observed for any SNPs. In conclusion, four SNPs associated with inflammatory and immune responses did not appear to be associated with post-COVID pain in previously hospitalized COVID-19 survivors. Further, neither of the SNPs were involved in the phenotyping features of post-COVID pain.","FernÃ¡ndez-de-las-PeÃ±as, CÃ©sar, Giordano, Rocco, DÃ­az-Gil, Gema, GÃ³mez-Esquer, Francisco, Ambite-Quesada, Silvia, Palomar-Gallego, Maria A.; Arendt-Nielsen, Lars","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11195645","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(19):5645, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38887,""
"Factors Associated with Increased Analgesic Use in German Women with Endometriosis during the COVID-19 Pandemic","(1) Background: Endometriosis is a frequent chronic pain condition in women of fertile age. Pain management with analgesics is frequently used by women with endometriosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to health services was temporarily restricted in various countries for persons without serious conditions, resulting in increased physical and mental health issues. The present study was conducted in order to assess the risk factors predicting increased analgesic intake by women with endometriosis during the COVID-19 pandemic. (2) Methods: The increased intake of over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription-only (PO) analgesics was assessed with an anonymous online questionnaire, along with demographic, pandemic-specific, disease-specific, and mental health characteristics. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-2) and the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression (PHQ-2), respectively. Pain-induced disability was assessed with the pain-induced disability index (PDI). (3) Results: A high educational level (OR 2.719;95% CI 1.137&ndash;6.501;p = 0.025) and being at higher risk for depressive disorders, as measured by PHQ-2 &ge;3 (OR 2.398;95% CI 1.055&ndash;5.450;p = 0.037), were independent risk factors for an increased intake of OTC analgesics. Current global pain-induced disability (OR 1.030;95% CI 1.007&ndash;1.054;p = 0.010) was identified as a risk factor for an increased intake of PO pain medication. The degree of reduction in social support and in social networks were independent predictors of an increased intake of PO analgesics in a univariate logistic regression analysis, but lost significance when adjusted for additional possible influencing factors. (4) Conclusions: In this population, an increased intake of OTC analgesics was related to a higher educational level and having a depressive disorder, while a higher pain-induced disability was an independent risk factor for an increased intake of PO analgesics. Pandemic-specific factors did not significantly and independently influence an increased intake of analgesics in women with endometriosis during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Healthcare providers should be aware of the possible factors related to increased analgesic use in women with endometriosis in order to identify persons at risk for the misuse of pain medication and to prevent potential adverse effects.","Schwab, Roxana, Stewen, Kathrin, Kottmann, Tanja, Schmidt, Mona W.; Anic, Katharina, Theis, Susanne, Hamoud, Bashar Haj, Elger, Tania, Brenner, Walburgis, Hasenburg, Annette","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11195520","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(19):5520, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38888,""
"Postpartum Depression after Maternal Isolation during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The MUMI-19 Study (Mothers Undergoing Mental Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic)","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world by imposing unprecedented health measures, including in the postpartum period. Objectives: We aim to assess the impact of maternal isolation in the immediate postpartum period on the rate of postpartum depression (PPD) in a tertiary center. Study Design: We conducted a prospective cohort study, between 22 April and 29 October 2020, using anonymous questionnaires on 265 participants (129 during lockdown and 135 outside). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used as screening for PPD. We used a univariate logistic regression model to analyze the association between risk factors and PPD. Results: There was no difference between the two groups for PPD assessed by an EPDS score &gt;10.5 on day 30 and/or day 60 (23.1% vs. 29.3%, p = 0.661) but on day 3 it was higher (31% vs. 17.8%, p = 0.015) during the lockdown period and partners were more impacted psychologically (48.3% vs. 10.5%, p &lt; 0.001). Parity &ge;1 was a protective factor for PPD (OR = 0.2, 95% CI [0.1&ndash;0.6], p = 0.003). Risk factors of PPD were: history of psychological abuses (OR = 6.4, CI 95% [1.1&ndash;37.6], p = 0.04), stressful life event (OR = 4.5, CI 95% [1.6&ndash;12.6], p = 0.004), and bad birth experience (OR = 5.1, CI 95% [1.4&ndash;17.8], p = 0.012). Conclusion: Maternal isolation in the immediate postpartum period is associated with an increased rate of moderate to severe symptoms of postpartum blues. The well-known long-term consequences of PPD must be balanced against the expected benefits of partner's restrictive access to maternity ward.","Boudiaf, Lina, Dupont, FranÃ§oise, Gras-Le Guen, ChristÃ¨le, Sauvaget, Anne, Leroy, Maxime, Thubert, Thibault, Winer, Norbert, Dochez, Vincent","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11195504","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(19):5504, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38889,""
"Role of Demyelination in the Persistence of Neurological and Mental Impairments after COVID-19","Long-term neurological and mental complications of COVID-19, the so-called post-COVID syndrome or long COVID, affect the quality of life. The most persistent manifestations of long COVID include fatigue, anosmia/hyposmia, insomnia, depression/anxiety, and memory/attention deficits. The physiological basis of neurological and psychiatric disorders is still poorly understood. This review summarizes the current knowledge of neurological sequelae in post-COVID patients and discusses brain demyelination as a possible mechanism of these complications with a focus on neuroimaging findings. Numerous reviews, experimental and theoretical studies consider brain demyelination as one of the mechanisms of the central neural system impairment. Several factors might cause demyelination, such as inflammation, direct effect of the virus on oligodendrocytes, and cerebrovascular disorders, inducing myelin damage. There is a contradiction between the solid fundamental basis underlying demyelination as the mechanism of the neurological injuries and relatively little published clinical evidence related to demyelination in COVID-19 patients. The reason for this probably lies in the fact that most clinical studies used conventional MRI techniques, which can detect only large, clearly visible demyelinating lesions. A very limited number of studies use specific methods for myelin quantification detected changes in the white matter tracts 3 and 10 months after the acute phase of COVID-19. Future research applying quantitative MRI assessment of myelin in combination with neurological and psychological studies will help in understanding the mechanisms of post-COVID complications associated with demyelination.","Khodanovich, Marina Y.; Kamaeva, Daria A.; Naumova, Anna V.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms231911291","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Molecular Sciences; 23(19):11291, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38890,""
"A Dyadic Pain Management Program for Community-Dwelling Older Adults with Chronic Pain: Study Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial","Community-dwelling older adults suffer from chronic pain. Pain negatively affects their physical and psychosocial wellbeing. The majority of pain management education and programs focus only on older adults. Their informal caregivers should be involved in pain management. A dyadic pain management program for reducing pain and psychological health symptoms, and improving pain self-efficacy, quality of life, and physical function in older adults is proposed for evaluation of its effectiveness. This will be a cluster randomized controlled trial. Community-dwelling older adults aged 60 or above and their informal caregivers will be recruited. The dyadic pain management program will be an eight-week group-based program. The participants in the experimental group will receive four weeks of center-based, face-to-face activities and four weeks of digital-based activities via a WhatsApp group. The control group will receive the usual care and a pain management pamphlet. Data will be collected at baseline, and at the eighth-week and sixteenth-week follow-up session. The outcome measurements will include pain intensity, pain self-efficacy, perceived quality of life, depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Data on the caregiver burden will be collected from the informal caregivers. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, all social activities have been suspended. In the near future, as the pandemic subsides, the dyadic pain management program will be launched to benefit community-dwelling older adults and informal caregivers and to reduce their pain and the care burden, respectively.","Tse, Mimi M.

"Multi-Impacts of Spatial Self-Policing during COVID-19: Evidence from a Chinese University","Current research has focused on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on university students' physical and mental health conditions but has rarely examined the secondary effects caused by school management and prevention policies. Chinese universities generally took a self-policing strategy to address the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine how the self-policing effect fluctuated during the pandemic, assessed from the perspective of university students. We collected monthly data from January 2020 to August 2022 from Zhejiang University's online forum CC98 and analyzed the monthly frequency of keywords in the online posts' titles. The dataset covered five topics: pandemic situations, epidemic prevention policies, campus access control, campus space use, and emotional conditions. The results showed that university students have expressed concern about the pandemic over the past thirty-two months, which still has an unignorable influence on their lives and studies. They paid more attention to the epidemic prevention policies, which directly affected their social connections, spatial use, and psychological well-being. University students gradually questioned their duty to obey and showed impatience and resistance toward school self-policing management, especially during the second Omicron wave. Additionally, the findings investigated an introverted trend for university students living in a gated campus environment. In conclusion, we call for reflections on the current Chinese campus self-policing strategy to cope with future long-term and normalized pandemic situations. The concerns of university students should be taken into account as we move toward a post-COVID-19 world.","Sun, Yuan, Wang, Zhu, Qiu, Zhi, Zhou, Congyue","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912172","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):12172, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38892,""
"Impact of Social Isolation during the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health, Substance Use, and Homelessness: Qualitative Interviews with Behavioral Health Providers","The United States is experiencing a syndemic of homelessness, substance use disorder, and mental health conditions, which has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although it is expected that mitigation strategies will curb community transmission of COVID-19, the unintended consequences of social isolation on mental health and substance use are a growing public health concern. Awareness of changing mental health and substance use treatment needs due to the pandemic is critical to understanding what additional services and support are needed during and post-pandemic, particularly among people experiencing homelessness who have pre-existing serious mental illness or substance use disorder. To evaluate these effects and support our understanding of mental health and substance use outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a qualitative study where behavioral health providers serving people experiencing homelessness described the impact of COVID-19 among their clients throughout the United States. Behavioral health providers shared that experiencing social isolation worsened mental health conditions and caused some people to return to substance use and fatally overdose. However, some changes initiated during the pandemic resulted in positive outcomes, such as increased client willingness to discuss mental health topics. Our findings provide additional evidence that the social isolation experienced during the pandemic has been detrimental to mental health and substance use outcomes, especially for people experiencing homelessness.","Jeffers, Alexiss, Meehan, Ashley A.; Barker, Jordan, Asher, Alice, Montgomery, Martha P.; Bautista, Greg, Ray, Colleen M.; Laws, Rebecca L.; Fields, Victoria L.; Radhakrishnan, Lakshmi, Cha, Susan, Christensen, Aleta, Dupervil, Brandi, Verlenden, Jorge V.; Cassell, Cynthia H.; Boyer, Alaina, DiPietro, Barbara, Cary, Margaret, Yang, Maria, Mosites, Emily, Marcus, Ruthanne","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912120","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):12120, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38893,""

"Effect of Yoga and Mindfulness Intervention on Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression in Young Adolescents Attending Middle School: A Pragmatic Community-Based Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial in a Racially Diverse Urban Setting","Mental health conditions in childhood and adolescence are increasing in the U.S. population and require early intervention, as highlighted by a recent Surgeon General's Advisory on Protecting Youth Mental Health. These health issues, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, impair functioning, and may lead to longer term reductions in quality of life. Young adolescents are likely to experience stressors including academic pressure, feelings of loneliness and isolation, and excessive exposure to social media, all of which have been made worse by the pandemic and associated disruptions. Universal preventive programs at school serve as an important strategy for equipping youth with coping skills to address current and future social and emotional challenges. Yoga and mindfulness programs have emerged as a promising preventive approach for schools and have proven feasible and acceptable. The current study evaluated a universal, school-based mindfulness and yoga program among youth aged 11&ndash;14 in a racially diverse, urban setting in the United States. Outcomes of interest included symptoms of anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression symptoms decreased in the intervention group, although these differences were not statistically significant. In the control group, anxiety symptoms decreased but depression symptoms increased. The resulting time effect indicated a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms, while the time by group effect revealed a strong trend in depression symptoms. Future research should investigate the utility of yoga and mindfulness interventions for early adolescents in a larger population, and the differences in intervention effect among subgroups, with attention to longer term outcomes.","Bazzano, Alessandra N.; Sun, Yaoyao, Chavez-Gray, Vaughne, Akintimehin, Temitope, Gustat, Jeanette, Barrera, Denise, Roi, Cody","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912076","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):12076, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38895,""
"Determinants of COVID-19 Outcome as Predictors of Delayed Healthcare Services among Adults &ge;50 Years during the Pandemic: 2006&ndash;2020 Health and Retirement Study","Background: The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. To date, a limited number of studies have examined the impact of this pandemic on healthcare-seeking behaviors of older populations. This longitudinal study examined personal characteristics linked to COVID-19 outcomes as predictors of self-reported delayed healthcare services attributed to this pandemic, among U.S. adults, &ge;50 years of age. Methods: Secondary analyses were performed using cross-sectional data (1413 participants) and longitudinal data (2881 participants) from Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (2006&ndash;2018) linked to the 2020 HRS COVID-19 Project (57% female, mean age: 68 years). Demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle and health characteristics were evaluated in relation to delayed overall, surgical and non-surgical healthcare services ('Since March 2020, was there any time when you needed medical or dental care, but delayed getting it, or did not get it at all?';and 'What type of care did you delay';) using logistic regression and Ensemble machine learning for cross-sectional data as well as mixed-effects logistic modeling for longitudinal data. Results: Nearly 32.7% delayed healthcare services, 5.8% delayed surgical services and 31.4% delayed non-surgical services. Being female, having a college degree or higher and 1-unit increase in depression score were key predictors of delayed healthcare services. In fully adjusted logistic models, a history of 1 or 2 cardiovascular and/or metabolic conditions (vs. none) was associated with 60&ndash;70% greater odds of delays in non-surgical services, with distinct findings for histories of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and stroke. Ensemble machine learning predicted surgical better than overall and non-surgical healthcare delays. Conclusion: Among older adults, sex, education and depressive symptoms are key predictors of delayed healthcare services attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Delays in surgical and non-surgical healthcare services may have distinct predictors, with non-surgical delays more frequently observed among individuals with a history of 1 or 2 cardiovascular and/or metabolic conditions.","Beydoun, Hind A.; Beydoun, May A.; Alemu, Brook T.; Weiss, Jordan, Hossain, Sharmin, Gautam, Rana S.; Zonderman, Alan B.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912059","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):12059, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38896,""
"Making It Work: The Experiences of Delivering a Community Mental Health Service during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic forced rapid innovative change to healthcare delivery. Understanding the unique challenges faced by staff may contribute to different approaches when managing future pandemics. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 21 staff from a Community Mental Health Team in the North West of England, UK, three months after the first wave of the pandemic. Thematic analysis was used to examine data reporting the challenges arising when working to deliver a service during the pandemic. Data is discussed under four headings;'senior trust managers trying to make it work';, 'individuals making it work';, 'making it work as a team';, and 'making it work through working at home';. Clear communication was essential to ensure adherence to guidelines while providing safe care delivery. The initial response to the pandemic involved the imposition of boundaries on staff by senior leadership to ensure that vulnerable service users received a service while maintaining staff safety. The data raises questions about how boundaries were determined, the communication methods employed, and whether the same outcome could have been achieved through involving staff more in decision-making processes. Findings could be used to design interventions to support mental health staff working to deliver community services during future crises.","Burton, Leanne, Wall, Abbie, Perkins, Elizabeth","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912056","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):12056, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38897,""
"The Impact of Time Spent in Natural Outdoor Spaces on Children's Language, Communication and Social Skills: A Systematic Review Protocol","There has been increasing interest over the past decade with regard to the health and wellbeing implications of time spent outdoors in nature for children. Universal systematic reviews of evidence report benefits to physical health, social-emotional mental health and wellbeing, cognition and academic learning. Internationally, there is indicative evidence to suggest outdoor engagement with nature may also impact children's language and communication skills, skills that are critical to development, education, social relationships and life opportunities. Yet, at present such evidence has not been synthesised. Despite evidence for the benefits of the outdoors, the amount of time children are spending outdoors is in rapid decline, and has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Alongside this are increasing numbers of children starting primary education with significant speech, language and communication needs (SLCN) which remain persistent over time. With established wide-reaching benefits of nature to children's physical and mental health and psychological development, there is a need to further explore the more specific impacts of the natural environment on children's language, communication and social skills, which could provide a unique opportunity to consider nature as a universal public health intervention for SLCN. The current review will aim to synthesise existing qualitative and quantitative evidence of the impact of time spent in natural outdoor spaces on the language, communication and social skills of 2&ndash;11-year-old children. Literature will be searched across seven databases and considered for inclusion against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Potential implications of the review include informing public health practice and policy for child development and education, informing priorities for speech, language, and communication interventions, and providing directions for future international research.","Scott, Steph, Gray, Tonia, Charlton, Jenna, Millard, Sharon","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912038","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):12038, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38898,""

A total of 606 respondents participated in this study, with the majority being women (81.0%), aged 21&ndash;27 years (44.3%), and unmarried (98.5%) respondents. We observed 24.4% (n = 148) moderate depression, 18.3% (n = 111) very severe anxiety, and 21.1% (n = 128) moderate stress status. The QoL measurement determined that a moderate QoL in the physical and environmental health domains (&gt;70%) and poor QoL in the psychological health domain (58.3%) were found. Gender, age, family support, history of COVID-19 diagnosis, family with COVID-19 diagnosis, vaccination status, and physical symptoms are significantly associated with MH status and QoL (p-value &lt; 0.05).

"Healthcare Workers' Emotions, Perceived Stressors, and Coping Strategies at Workplace during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Palestine","Evidence about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Palestinian healthcare professionals is lacking and has been disregarded during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to describe Palestinian healthcare workers (HCWs) emotions and factors causing stress, and factors used to reduce the stress experienced at the workplace and to examine the relationships between HCWs level of stress and their coping strategies and motivational factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. A self-reported online survey was completed by 506 doctors and nurses working in healthcare facilities that provide COVID-19 care. Descriptive statistics, bivariate, and multivariate regression models were developed to adjust for the association between HCWs coping and motivation factors with HCWs' perceived stressors. The findings showed that 24.1% of the participants had a high-stress level, and 25.7% had a low level of stress. The participant's main coping strategy was avoidance and the key emotional factor was the ethical and professional obligation to continue working. Additionally, a major cause of their stress was their personal safety and having the COVID-19 infection. Findings showed a positive association between stress and the younger age of participants, with physicians being less stressed than nurses. In addition, receiving no training on the treatment of COVID-19 was strongly associated with stress levels. Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between stress scoring and coping strategies scoring but not with motivation score. In conclusion, this study shows that Palestinian healthcare workers experienced emotional turmoil during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results indicate the necessity of providing supervision, psychological counseling and intervention to professional healthcare workers who work directly with COVID-19 patients in health settings during the current pandemic or in the event of future outbreaks.

By comparing the same month (January&ndash;April) during 2017&ndash;2020, positive sentiment experienced a plunge, while negative sentiment showed an upsurge in April 2020. The volume of reviews was impacted by five quantitative variables (i.e., confirmed COVID-19 case number, food delivery option, takeout option, delivery fee, and delivery time) and seven qualitative variables (i.e., anticipation, fear, trust, anger, disgust, joy, and sadness). This study provides new insight into understanding information content on review websites during the crisis (e.g., pandemic) from the perspective of health risk communication.","Wang, Xi, Tang, Liang, Zhang, Linan, Zheng, Jie","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191911961","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):11961, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38903,""
"Anxiety, Depression, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Symptomatology According to Gender in Health-Care Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Peru Shortened Title: 'Psychological Impact of the Pandemic on Women'","Objective: The current study will evaluate the association that the COVID-19 pandemic has had with health-care workers and identify the factors that influenced the female gender being more affected. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in two hospitals in Arequipa (a Peruvian city). The participants were health-care workers. We applied a questionnaire with sociodemographic information and three scales: the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Primary Care Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Screen for DSM-5. The main outcomes were anxiety, depression, and PTSD scores. The exposure of interest was gender. The scores of the scales were estimated by medians and percentiles 25&ndash;75 (p25&ndash;p75), and we used linear regression to estimate the crude and adjusted coefficients and their respective confidence intervals at 95% (CI 95%). Results: There were 109 participants, and 43.1% were women. The anxiety, depression, and PTSD median (p25&ndash;p75) scores in the study population were 6 (2&ndash;11), 6 (2&ndash;10), and 1 (0&ndash;3), respectively. The adjusted analysis showed that the female sex had 4.48 (CI 95% 2.95&ndash;6.00), 4.50 (CI 95% 2.39&ndash;6.62), and 1.13 (CI 95% 0.50&ndash;1.76) higher points on average for the scales of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms in comparison to males, respectively.

"Psychosocial Determinants of Loneliness in the Era of the COVID-19 Pandemic-Cross-Sectional Study","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic affected the mental health and social behavior of people around the world. Due to epidemiological restrictions, the period of forced isolation contributed to the feeling of loneliness. The aim of the research is to identify factors and conditions associated to the feeling of loneliness in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The survey was conducted among 262 people from the north-eastern Polish area, using an online survey. The diagnostic survey method was used, using the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Measurement Scale, the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the WHOQoL-Bref questionnaire. Results: A statistically significant relationship was observed between the feeling of loneliness and areas of quality of life, especially psychological and social, generalized self-efficacy and marital status and way of living (p &lt; 0.05). Higher levels of stress, social distancing, restrictions at work, health status were significantly correlated with an increase in loneliness. Remote work was associated with a lower assessment of the quality of life in the psychological field (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Higher levels of loneliness were significantly more likely to affect people living alone and not in a relationship. Higher levels of loneliness were significantly associated with lower quality of life in the social and psychological domains, lower levels of self-efficacy, and remote work.","Sierakowska, Matylda, Doroszkiewicz, Halina","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191911935","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):11935, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38905,""
"Climate Changes, Natural Resources Depletion, COVID-19 Pandemic, and Russian-Ukrainian War: What Is the Impact on Habits Change and Mental Health?","Climate Change, Natural Resources Depletion, COVID-19, and Wars are some of the great challenges of our time. The consequences will affect psychological well-being and could have a harmful impact on mental health. This study aimed to assess the level of preoccupation and fears surrounding issues of the 21st-century and the implication for psychological well-being of the general population from Central/Southern Italy among different age groups. A questionnaire that included sociodemographic characteristics, topics formulated ad-hoc about preoccupation, fears, habits, and willingness to change habits in the future related to the 21st-century challenges, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 (DASS-21) was administered online. A sample of 1831 participants (61% F;mean age 47.71 &plusmn;17.30) was obtained. Results showed that young adults and older adults, respectively, reported greater and less psychological well-being. Young adults reported higher scores for preoccupation, changing habits, and willingness to change habits in the future, while older adults reported the lowest scores except for changing habits, also controlling for gender. Results for this variable, as well as correlations between the many variables described, rely on the specificity of age, and 21st-century challenges. Moreover, the main fears related to the 21st-century concerns were different based on both age and gender. In conclusion, the various stresses of the 21st-century discussed in this study have a relationship with personal well-being, and it is important to consider potential global mental health issues resulting from these stressors.","Barchielli, Benedetta, Cricenti, Clarissa, GallÃ¨, Francesca, Sabella, Elita Anna, Liguori, Fabrizio, Da Molin, Giovanna, Liguori, Giorgio, Orsi, Giovanni Battista, Giannini, Anna Maria, Ferracuti, Stefano, Napoli, Christian","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191911929","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):11929, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38906,""
"The Association between COVID-19 Pandemic and the Quality of Life of Medical Students in Silesian Voivodeship, Poland","(1) Background: Since the COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly in 2020, medical universities have been affected by a particular crisis. Due to the increased risk of SARS CoV-2 transmission, the authorities of medical faculties all over the world, including Poland, started to minimize direct contact between students. The objective of the paper is to identify and assess determinants of the quality of life among medical students in Poland before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. (2) Methods: We analyzed data obtained in a cross-sectional study performed among three groups of students tested in three consecutive research periods: period before the COVID-19 pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period and the COVID-19 pandemic period following lockdown. (3) Results: The total number of participants was 1098. We identified that the research period before the COVID-19 pandemic was the risk factor for lower quality of life in terms of the somatic and environmental domains. It was also confirmed that determinants such as poor financial situation, low frequency of physical activity and bad self-declared health status harmed the QoL scores in all domains. (4) Conclusions: The obtained results confirmed that better financial situation, higher physical activity and better self-declared health status were statistically significant factors improving the quality of life of first-year medical students in Poland. The findings of our study also showed that the declared somatic and environmental domains of QoL among medical students were better during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Our observations confirmed that the immediate implementation of e-learning could protect against the deterioration of mental health and quality of life in first-year medical students during possible future epidemic crises.","Szemik, Szymon, Gajda, Maksymilian, Gladys, Aleksandra, Kowalska, Malgorzata","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191911888","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):11888, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38907,""
"The Structure of the Relationship between Physical Activity and Psychosocial Functioning of Women and Men during the COVID-19 Epidemic in Poland","Since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a serious crisis in many countries around the world, it is important to conduct empirical research aimed at identifying risks and factors protecting the functioning of people affected by it. For this reason, the goals of the present research were to determine the level of physical activity and the severity of symptoms characteristic of mental disorders, cognitive disorders and the quality of social functioning, as well as the structure of the relationship between physical activity and psychosocial functioning of 226 women and 226 men during the COVID-19 epidemic in Eastern Poland. The research was conducted using the IPAQ-SF Questionnaire, GHQ-28 Questionnaires, TUS Test-6/9 version, the original SFS Scale and a self-developed sociodemographic survey. The collected data indicate that women as compared to men show lower levels of weekly physical activity, walking, moderate activity, vigorous activity and quality of functioning in family relationships, but higher severity of mental health disorders, somatic symptoms, functional disorders, depressive symptoms, cognitive disorders, perceptual work disorders, attention deficits and higher quality of functioning in work relationships. On the other hand, the structural model indicates that physical activity, interacting with mental health disorders and cognitive disorders, is positively associated with the social functioning of the respondents, and gender is the moderator of the occurring dependencies. This suggests that physical activity adapted to the condition of health may be an important component of gender-individualized psychopreventive interventions.","Mazur, Anna, Barton, Elzbieta","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191911860","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):11860, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38908,""
"Changes in Mental Health during Three Waves of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Slovakia: Neurotypical Children versus Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Their Parents","The main goal of our research was to monitor changes in the mental health of Slovak families with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to families with neurotypical children during three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. We focused on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress and different stressors of parents. In children, we explored maladaptive behavior and the availability of interventions for children with ASD. The data were collected using an extensive questionnaire including the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-42 questionnaire (DASS-42) and two subscales of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS-3). The research sample consisted of a total of 506 parents, 236 of whom have a child with ASD. Parents of children with ASD reported elevated anxiety during the first wave, while changes were found in parents of neurotypical children. During the second wave, the prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress experienced by parents in both groups increased, but significantly more in parents with ASD children. The internalizing maladaptive behavior of children with ASD also increased. During the third wave, no significant differences between the groups of parents were found in stress and anxiety, but parents of ASD children scored higher in depression. Externalized maladaptive behavior of neurotypical children increased, with minimal changes in children with ASD, which can be explained by the improved therapy availability for children with ASD, also observed in our study.","PolÃ³nyiovÃ¡, KatarÃ­na, RaÅ¡kovÃ¡, Barbara, OstatnÃ­kovÃ¡, Daniela","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191911849","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(19):11849, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38909,""
"Changes in Daily Life, Physical Activity, GAD, Depression, and Personal Hygiene of Adolescents in South Korea Due to the COVID-19","This study used raw data obtained from the Adolescents' Health Behavior Survey by government-affiliated agency open data. A total of 109,796 students were sampled. A comparative analysis was performed based on the year 2020 and when the COVID-19 pandemic occurred, in which we analyzed changes in adolescents' depression and panic anxiety perception and dietary habits, physical factors, physical activity, and handwashing habits. There was no weight control in the second year compared to the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, and obesity also increased. The continuation of the non-contact situation caused by COVID-19 led to a worsening of subjective health awareness, and the experience of generalized anxiety disorder, depression, sadness and hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts and attempts increased. The frequency of washing hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet at school or at home was reduced. As a result of this analysis, we believe that there needs to be a system of support in place to address the academic gaps and deficiencies in learning caused by COVID-19, and that psychological and emotional support needs to be strengthened at this time, as well as the issues to be supported after the end of the non-contact situation.","Kim, Eun-Yeob, Oh, Chilhwan, Sung, Hwa-Jung, Kim, Jaeyoung","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10101881","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(10):1881, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38910,""

"Mental Health Benefits of a Traditional Vegetative Biofeedback Therapy Online Program during the COVID-19 Lockdown: A Controlled Trial","Mandatory lockdown resulting from a pandemic may be effective against the physical impact of the virus;however, the resulting mental strains can lead to the development of several mental disturbances. Taijiquan and Qigong are considered traditional vegetative biofeedback therapies that allow the practitioner to control the functions and processes of the body through specific movements or stances, breathing techniques, and meditative exercises. This study aims to understand if these techniques can be applied as an online distance therapeutic option to reduce the psychological impact of home confinement and social distancing. Sixty-four participants were recruited and allocated to three groups. The experienced and novice Taijiquan and Qigong participants' groups received the intervention for 8 weeks while the control group did not receive any intervention. The outcomes were psychological well-being and psychological distress levels and were assessed by the Mental Health Inventory and a written interview. The experienced Taijiquan and Qigong participants achieved significant improvements in psychological well-being and psychological distress. Novice Taijiquan and Qigong participants achieved a significant improvement in anxiety levels. Additionally, the control group showed a significant decrease in psychological well-being. This study suggests that this distance online program of Taijiquan and Qigong is feasible and may benefit the mental health of participants during a lockdown.","Rodrigues, Jorge MagalhÃ£es, Santos, Catarina, Ventura, Cristina, Machado, Jorge","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10101843","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(10):1843, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38912,""
"Herbal Medicines for Post-Acute Sequelae (Fatigue or Cognitive Dysfunction) of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Phase 2 Pilot Clinical Study Protocol","Long-term sequelae refer to persistent symptoms or signs for &gt;6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most common symptoms of sequelae are fatigue and neuropsychiatric symptoms (concentration difficulty, amnesia, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, and depression). However, approved treatments have not been fully established. Herbal medicines are administered for 12 weeks to patients who continuously complain of fatigue or cognitive dysfunction for &gt;4 weeks that only occurred after COVID-19 diagnoses. Based on the Korean Medicine syndrome differentiation diagnosis, patients with fatigue will be administered Bojungikgi-tang or Kyungok-go, whereas those with cognitive dysfunction will be administered Cheonwangbosim-dan. Results could support evidence that herbal medicines may mitigate fatigue and cognitive dysfunction caused by COVID-19. Furthermore, by investigating the effects of herbal medicines on changes in metabolite and immune response due to COVID-19, which may be responsible for sequelae, the potential of herbal medicines as one of the therapeutic interventions for post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be evaluated. Therefore, the effects of herbal medicine on fatigue and cognitive dysfunction sequelae due to COVID-19 will be elucidated in this study to provide an insight into the preparation of medical management for the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jegal, Kyung Hwan, Yoon, Jiwon, Kim, Sanghyun, Jang, Soobin, Jin, Young-Hee, Lee, Jun-Hwan, Choi, Sun-Mi, Kim, Tae Hun, Kwon, Sunoh","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10101839","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(10):1839, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38913,""
"Predictors of the Public's Aversion to Patients Infected with COVID-19 in China: The Mediating Role of Negative Physiology","COVID-19 has had a lasting impact on the public's mental health. Understanding the mechanism of the formation of the public's aversion to COVID-19-infected people can not only help eliminate the irrational stigma, rejection, and aversion of the public but also promote the creation of a harmonious and healthy social atmosphere. Based on stimulus&ndash;organism&ndash;response theory, this study explored the relationships between environmental stimuli, public negative physiology, and aversion responses. A cross-sectional, online-based survey study was conducted in April 2022. A total of 1863 effective questionnaires from respondents of various ages, genders, incomes, and education levels were acquired. Structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed model. The environmental stimuli including the use of social media and the perception of risk communication aggravated the negative physiology of the public, while the public's perception of prevention measures reduced the public's negative physiology during the epidemic. The negative physiology of the public increases the public's aversion responses, including disgust, stigma, and avoidance, toward patients infected with COVID-19. The negative physiology of the public plays a mediating role in the relationship between the environmental stimuli and the public's aversion to patients infected with COVID-19. The emergence of excessive information in social media and strict prevention measures in daily life, as well as the dissemination of a large amount of risk information in pseudo-environments and realistic environments, have all exerted an impact on public sentiment and cognition. In the case of the prolonged spread of the epidemic, the accumulation of negative physiology, such as anxiety, panic, and depression, is more likely to lead to the public's aversion to people with COVID-19.","Zhang, Ke, Han, Boya, Meng, Ran, Hou, Jiayi, Chen, Long","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10101813","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(10):1813, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38914,""
"Readmission of Patients to Acute Psychiatric Hospitals: Influential Factors and Interventions to Reduce Psychiatric Readmission Rates","Background: Appropriate and adequate treatment of psychiatric conditions in the community or at first presentation to the hospital may prevent rehospitalization. Information about hospital readmission factors may help to reduce readmission rates. This scoping review sought to examine the readmission of patients to acute psychiatric hospitals to determine predictors and interventions to reduce psychiatric readmission rates. Method: A scoping review was conducted in eleven bibliographic databases to identify the relevant peer-reviewed studies. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles, and a screening process was undertaken to identify studies for inclusion in the review. PRISMA checklist was adopted, and with the Covidence software, 75 articles were eligible for review. Data extraction was conducted, collated, summarized, and findings reported. Result: 75 articles were analyzed. The review shows that learning disabilities, developmental delays, alcohol, drug, and substance abuse, were crucial factors that increased the risk of readmission. Greater access to mental health services in residential treatment and improved crisis intervention in congregate care settings were indicated as factors that reduce the risk of readmission. Conclusion: High rates of readmission may adversely impact healthcare spending. This study suggests a need for focused health policies to address readmission factors and improve community-based care.","Owusu, E.; Oluwasina, F.; Nkire, N.; Lawal, M. A.; Agyapong, V. I.

"Psychosocial Determinants of Recreational Activity within Urban Green Spaces during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Poland","Recreational activity undertaken within urban green spaces (UGS) is an action that could be self-governed and self-regulated by a given person under the pressure of COVID-19. We aimed to identify the factors that induce or reduce the frequency of recreational activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors were explored among two distinct fields: (1) demographic variables and (2) stress-coping strategies. The former is associated with a body of literature on socioeconomic determinants of physical activity. The latter is derived from psychological studies on coping responses to problems. In this paper, we present an interdisciplinary perspective on human recreational activity during the pandemic. We collected information on stress-coping strategies and the patterns of urban green recreation among 376 prime-age Polish adults with different places of residence. We observed that people who use forests daily had higher scores of acceptance as a coping strategy than people using green spaces only on weekends. As choosing acceptance as a coping strategy is typical for those who consider their situation to be irreversible, green recreation may help to acclimate individuals to stressful situations that cannot be easily changed or controlled, which is the case for the pandemic. Moreover, we found that active coping, as well as avoidant coping, were predictors of increased use of green spaces during the pandemic. This conclusion affirms that green recreation as a form of reducing COVID-19-induced stress is associated with the dual nature of coping (active and avoidant). Further research is necessary to better understand of motivation to use urban green recreation, especially when practiced as a method of strengthening mental health.","Wajchman-Switalska, Sandra, Grabowska-Chenczke, Olga, Wozniak, Marcin, Balaj, Bibianna","https://doi.org/10.3390/f13101569","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Forests; 13(10):1569, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38916,""

We used acquired (COVID-19 infection) and non-modifiable (presence of APOE rs429358 and rs7412 polymorphisms) factors to study the progression of subjective cognitive impairment while observing patients for one year. Cognitive training was used as a protective factor. (2) Methods: Two groups of subjects over the age of 65 participated in the study: group with subjective cognitive decline receiving cognitive training and individuals who did not complain of cognitive decline without receiving cognitive training (comparison group). On the first visit, the concentration of antibodies to COVID-19 and APOE genotype was measured. At the first and last point (1 year later) the Mini-Mental State Examination scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were performed. (3) Results: COVID-19 infection did not affect cognitive function. A significant role of cognitive training in improving cognitive functions was revealed. Older adults with APOE-&epsilon;4 genotype showed no positive effect of cognitive training.

Data collection was carried out via a face-to-face interview method by experienced nurses working in pediatric clinics using a sociodemographic data form, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Fear of COVID-19 Inventory, and the Coronavirus Anxiety Inventory. Results: The median age of the participants was 33 (min: 21, max: 50). The Beck Anxiety score was affected by the child's diagnosis, location, and history of COVID-19 (* P = 0.011, ** P = 0.018, and *** P = 0.002, respectively). Similarly, the Beck Depression score was affected by the child's diagnosis and history of COVID-19 in a relative (* P = 0.034 and ** P = 0.037, respectively). The Coronavirus Anxiety score was affected by a history of COVID-19 in a relative and work status (* P = 0.040 and ** P = 0.005, respectively), while the Fear of COVID-19 score was not significantly affected by any variable. In a logistic regression model, previous COVID-19 experience was independently associated with anxiety;a history of COVID-19 increased the risk of developing anxiety by approximately 15 times (odds ratio: 14.915, 95% CI: 2.075&ndash;107.192). Conclusion: When children of mothers with a history of COVID-19 are hospitalized, special attention should be given to their mothers concerning psychological support and assistance.","Yildiz, Eren, Koc Apaydin, Zuhal, Alay, Berna, Dincer, ZÃ¼beyde, Cigri, Emrah","https://doi.org/10.3390/children9101448","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Children; 9(10):1448, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38918,""
"A Comparative Study on Technical Standards for the Design of Emergency Medical Facilities in China in the Context of COVID-19","The technical standards for the design and construction of emergency medical facilities play an important role in guiding the conversion of Fangcang shelter hospitals and the construction of emergency infectious disease hospitals and temporary facilities for medical quarantine and observation. However, due to the imperfections and superficialness of the current version of the existing technical standards, further improvement and optimization on the maturity and systematism are necessary. This paper presents an in-depth analysis and comparison on the detailed regulations and terms between the existing 11 sets of technical standards issued by the National Health Commission (NHC) and the provincial competent authorities of Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hebei, Shandong and Beijing. The similarities, disparities and deficiencies of these technical standards are summarized. Then, the primary contents, including the site selection and architectural design, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), structural design, electricity intelligence, water supply and drainage, operation and maintenance, environmental health and safety, and fire protection, are analyzed in-depth from the view of infectious disease control and health safety. Furthermore, some critical principles related to the detailed terms of the architectural design, HVAC, electricity and water supply are concluded. Finally, some essential suggestions are proposed for the improvement and revision of these technical standards for better applications.","Ji, Hui, Huang, Lewen, Li, Haoming, Zhang, Jiangtao, Jing, Qinlong, Deng, Ji-Yu","https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings12101502","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Buildings; 12(10):1502, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38919,""
"Relationships between Individual and Social Resources, Anxiety and Depression in the Early Lockdown Stage by the COVID-19 in Chile","The coronavirus disease has exposed the population to psychosocial threats that could increase mental health problems. This research analyzed the relationships between emotional states (negative [&minus;EWB] and positive [+EWB] experienced well-being), personal resources (resilient coping [RC]), dispositional resources (control beliefs about stress [BAS]), and social resources (social support [SS]), and anxiety and depressive symptoms in a sample of the Chilean population (n = 592), who answered an online questionnaire. Multiple and moderated multiple regression analyses were carried out. Depressive symptoms showed a positive relationship with &minus;EWB (&beta;= 0.805;p &lt; 0.001) and negative relationship with +EWB (&beta;= &minus;0.312;p &lt; 0.001), RC (&beta;= &minus;0.089;p &lt; 0.01), BAS (&beta;= &minus;0.183;p &lt; 0.001) and SS (&beta;= &minus;0.082;p &lt; 0.001).

BAS moderated the relationship between experienced well-being and depression symptoms, and RC moderated the relationship between experienced well-being with both depression and anxiety symptoms. Findings confirm the buffering effect of personal and dispositional resources when facing a sanitary and social crisis. Moreover, they help to understand the role of internal psychological processes during a crisis and how to cope with life-threatening events.","Salgado, Sergio, GonzÃ¡lez-Suhr, Carolina, Nazar, Gabriela, Alcover, Carlos-MarÃ­a, RamÃ­rez-Vielma, RaÃºl, Bustos, Claudio","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12100357","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 12(10):357, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38920,""

"Prescribing behavior of antidepressants for depressive disorders: A systematic review","Objective: Guidelines for the prescription of antidepressants for Depressive Disorders (DD) have been in place for a long time. However, there is a lack of systematic information on the prescribing behavior of antidepressants in evidence-based clinical practice in psychopharmacotherapy of depressive disorders. This may suggest a lack of implementation of clinical guidelines by clinicians. Existing literature mainly focuses on specific issues or medications. To provide general information on the prescribing behavior of antidepressants for depressive disorders, a systematic review of available studies since 2013 was conducted. Methods and materials: To ensure a structured and systematic approach for the literature search and subsequent review process, the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were followed. Major medical and health and psychological databases were used for the literature search. These included Ebsco Host, OVID, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science. The online application â€œCovidenceâ€ was employed to manage the titles collected and the full articles retrieved from the initial literature search. Upon finalizing the list of selected studies, data extraction was then conducted using a build-in function of the Covidence platform with the required information pre-set on a template for data extraction. The extracted information was tabulated and summarized in a table. Results: Forty-one studies were identified after an extensive search of the literature following the PRISMA guidelines. Of these, 37 quantitative studies providing useful information were systematically reviewed and information extracted. There was a high level of heterogeneity among these studies with different foci or characteristics. Most studies were conducted in or utilized data obtained from hospital and primary healthcare settings. SSRIs were the most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant in the past decade, particularly among younger patients. Among these studies, antidepressants were mainly prescribed by psychiatrists with some by other physicians and general practitioners. This might reflect differences in legislation regarding professional requirements for prescribers or clinical practices. Conclusions: A few themes that would be considered important in terms of the effect of prescription behavior on depression, specifically children/adolescents, special target populations, and off-label prescription. The results highlighted the need for more studies on a community-based approach and the role of GPs in the treatment of DD.","Lam, M. K.; Lam, L.

"Predictors of psychological and physiological measures of graduate student health during COVID-19","IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic brought on higher-than-normal levels of anxiety and depression, especially among graduate students whose academic trajectory was disrupted. However, not all graduate students were affected and therefore, it is important to identify potential protective factors. MethodWe recruited 61 graduate students whose research was directly impacted by the pandemic and examined their change in academic stressors since the onset of the pandemic. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to evaluate how perceived academic stressors brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic impacted anxiety, depression, and heart rate variability (HRV), and whether physical activity and trait resiliency independently buffered against the effects of stress. ResultsGraduate students who reported greater changes in academic stressors since the onset for the pandemic were more anxious and depressed. Moderate-intensity physical activity explained significant variance in anxiety whereas resiliency explained significant variance in both anxiety and depression. HRV was higher in males than females, aligning with sex differences in vulnerability to stress and mental illness. ConclusionOverall, the results suggest that resiliency and physical activity may offer unique protection against symptoms of anxiety and depression in graduate students experiencing increased academic stress during COVID-19. Institutions of higher education should consider investing in programs that encourage physical activity and promote resiliency by teaching mindfulness, stress management, and cognitive behavioral approaches.","Marashi, M.; Heisz, J.

"Provision of Medical-psychological and Psychiatric Care to Patients with Post-covid Syndrome in Telemedicine Conditions","Objective. The need for scientific understanding of the revolutionary changes that have occurred associated with the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, both in the organization of psychological and psychiatric care, and in the direction of developing effective treatment and prevention measures, determines the relevance of this study, the purpose of which is to study the clinical manifestations of psychopathological symptoms in patients, survivors of the COVID-19 disease, and develop a conceptual model for providing them with medical care in telemedicine. Materials and methods. We studied the psychopathological manifestations of post-covid syndrome in 129 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and who applied to us for remote medical counseling psychological and psychiatric help for 10 months, from March to December 2020, using clinical psychopathological and psychodiagnostic test research methods. Results and Discussion. The high level of stress, anxiety and depression identified in the studied patients is primarily associated with the negative situation of the pandemic and the COVID-19 disease. A follow-up study proved the effectiveness of a treatment carried out in a telemedicine setting and combining cognitive-behavioral therapy with antidepressants and non-benzodiazepine tranquilizers. In patients who underwent a severe form of COVID-19, in the presence of premorbid chronic bronchopulmonary pathology, in addition to long-lasting psychopathological symptoms, somatic post-covid complications were also observed, and the stressfulness of the situation was perceived at a deeper personal level. For such patients, the course of treatment in telemedicine conditions should be extended and medical and psychological support provided during the entire period of convalescence. Conclusion. Chronic premorbid diseases of the bronchopulmonary and immune systems are predictors of long-term psychopathological symptomatology and the occurrence of post-covid somatic complications. The treatment tactics of patients with post-covid mental health disorders in telemedicine should be based on the protocols of cognitive-behavioral therapy for hypochondriacal and generalized anxiety disorder, in combination with antidepressants and tranquilizers of the non-benzodiazepine series, which ensures the stability of the positive results of therapeutic interventions, confirmed by our studies. The conceptual patientcentered model developed by us for the provision of psychological and psychiatric care for post-covid syndrome in telemedicine can be recommended as a universal algorithm for psycho-psychiatric interventions when providing remote assistance to patients with post-covid mental disorders.","Koliadenko, N.

"Quality of Life of Myasthenia Gravis Patients During COVID-19 Pandemic - One Year Follow Up","Purpose: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the largest pandemic of our times. Pandemics are severe stressors to vulnerable groups (such as patients with chronic diseases) and this highly contagious disease exerts considerable impacts on mental health. We wanted to investigate the possible impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life (QoL) of myasthenia gravis (MG) patients and potential changes during the period of one year. Methods: Data on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of MG was collected. We used a selfdesigned questionnaire (consisting of 12 questions), a revised 15-item Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life Questionnaire (MGQOL15r), a 36-item health survey of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF36), Hamilton scales for the assessment of anxiety (HAM-A) and depression (HAMD) were used. The actual severity of the clinical manifestation was estimated using MG activities of daily life (MGADL). We reassessed patients in April and May 2021, who were tested during April 2020 using the same questionnaires. Results: The study included 57 adult MG patients. We noticed a statistically significant difference between the results obtained at these two time points regarding scores on MGQOL15r (p&lt;0.05). The obtained scores were significantly better in 2021. Some scores on SF-36 subscales were also better in 2021 than in 2020 (such as social functioning, emotional well-being, role limitation due to emotional problems) (p&lt;0.05). MGQOL15r and SF36 scores correlate with severe clinical manifestation, high scores on HAM-A and HAM-D (p&lt;0.01). Higher scores on HAM-D and fear that MG symptoms will be worse if the patient gets an upper respiratory infection were independent predictors of the lower SF36 scores. Regarding MGQOL15r independent predictors of the higher score were higher scores on HAM-D. Conclusions: QoL of myasthenia gravis patients improved during the pandemic. It is important for healthcare workers to provide professional therapeutic advice and psychosocial support for this population of patients during the pandemic. eP01.04.07 COVID Spike Antibodies in Neuromuscular Conditions: A KU Experience Pasnoor M1, Tajuddin A1, Jawdat O1, Farmakidis C1, Jabari D1, Heim A1, Higgs K1, Dimachkie M1 1The University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, United States Background: Little is known about the immune response to COVID vaccination in immune suppressed neuromusuclar patients. Multiple studies showed variable data regarding the effect of immunosuppression on the immune response to the vaccination. Objective: To evaluate the COVID spike antibody levels in patients with various neuromuscular conditions who received vaccination and assess the effect of immunosuppressive therapies on antibody levels. Method: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients in neuromuscular clinic who had COVID antibody testing. We collected demographic, clinical, diagnostic and treatment information. Descriptive statistics was performed on the data obtained. Results: The total number of patients enrolled in the study were129, 64 male and 65 female . The mean age of the patients enrolled was 64.82 Â±14.50 and the mean duration of antibody acquisition since date of last vaccination dose was 172 days. The number of patients on immunosuppressive therapies was 88(68.2%), 47(53.41%) had high antibody titer (&gt;250), 31(35.23%) had low antibody titer (0.4- 250), 9(10.23%) had undetected antibody titer (&lt;0.4) and 1 (1.1%) had detected unmeasured titer. Immunosuppressive therapies included steroids, methotrexate, azathioprine, myophenolate mofetil, eculizumab, efgartigimod, intravenous immunoglobulin and rituximab. The other group of patients who were not on immunosuppressive medication were 41 (31.8%) , 28 (68.29%) showed high antibody titer (&gt;250), 9(21.95%) showed low antibody titer (0.4-250) , 1(2.44%) showed undetected titer (&gt;0.4) and 3(7.32%) had detected unmeasured titer. 50% of patient who were on rituximab showed undetected antibody titer and 60% of patients who received eculizumab had low antibody titer. 4 % of patients on immunosuppressive drugs did not develop adequate spike antibodies levels to vaccination, compared to 24% on no immunosuppressive therapies. Conclusions: Our study reveals modest impact of immunosuppression on COVID spike antibody titer. While this finding is limited by small number of patients and heterogeneity in therapies, age and interval between vaccination and antibody testing, our finding supports the importance of booster vaccine in this patient population.","Stojanov, A.; Djordjevic, G.; Stojanov, J.; Petrovic, S.","https://doi.org/10.3233/JND-229001","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Neuromuscular Diseases; 9:S161, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38925,""
"Why do ambulance employees (not) seek organisational help for mental health support? A mixed-methods systematic review protocol of organisational support available and barriers/facilitators to uptake","The COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating a wide range of symptoms of poor mental health among emergency medical service (EMS) ambulance populations. Evidence suggests that using organisational support can improve employee outcomes and in turn, patient outcomes. Understanding why EMS staff do and do not use support services is therefore critical to improving uptake, ensuring equitable access, and potentially influencing workforce well-being, organisational sustainability and patient care delivery. This systematic review aims to identify what support is available and any perceived barriers and facilitators to accessing and utilising organisational support. Searches performed between 18 February 2022 and 23 February 2022 will be used to identify studies that report barriers and facilitators to EMS employee support among all government/state commissioned EMS ambulance systems. Electronic databases, AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, EMCARE, HMIC, Medline and PsycINFO will be searched. All relevant English-language studies of adult employees of government/state commissioned EMS ambulance organisations published since December 2004 will be screened and relevant data extracted by two independent reviewers. A third reviewer will resolve any disagreements.The primary outcome is the identification of perceived barriers or facilitators to EMS staff using organisational support for mental health. The secondary outcome is the identification of supportive interventions offered through or by ambulance trusts. Study selection will follow Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, and the methodological quality of included studies will be appraised by administering rating checklists. A narrative synthesis will be conducted to report qualitative and quantitative data and will include population characteristics, methodological approach and information about barriers and facilitators. Ethical approval is not required because only available published data will be analysed. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication and conference presentation.

"Food insecurity and level of depression among patients with chronic diseases, and associated factors during the COVID-19 lockdown: a cross-sectional study in rural Rwanda","We aimed to describe access to food and symptoms of depression among patients with chronic diseases or their caregivers, and assess associated factors during the COVID-19 lockdown in rural Rwanda. A cross-sectional study. A stratified random sampling technique was used to recruit 220 patients enrolled in the HIV, non-communicable diseases, mental health, paediatric development clinic and oncology programmes in three rural districts of Rwanda. Telephone-based interviews were conducted to collect data on the number of daily meals before and during the COVID-19, and depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. We used logistic regression analysis to investigate factors associated with households reporting a reduction in daily meals and with the survey respondent reporting symptoms of depression. Of the participants, 19.1% reported a reduction in daily number of meals for either adults or children in their households during lockdown and 24.6% had depression. Reporting a reduction in daily meals was associated with the district of residence and estimated household's monthly income. Self-reported depression was significantly associated with negative experiences during lockdown, including reporting feeling depressed or fear (AOR 4.82; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 2.08 to 11.21), loneliness (AOR 4.33; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.32 to 14.13), reduction in daily meals (AOR 4.15; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.56 to 11.00) and lack of access to healthcare (OR 3.29; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.32 to 8.23). Our findings suggest that significant reduction in access to food affected rural Rwandans with chronic diseases during COVID-19 lockdown, and the lockdown effect varied by household's pre-pandemic level of vulnerability to food insecurity. Reduction in household meals, as well as other self-reported effects of the lockdown, were associated with worse psychological status of survey respondents. Economic and food support should be considered by governments and non-governmental organisations to protect those most vulnerable including patients with chronic diseases against the effects of pandemics and their associated containment measures.","Umutoniwase, Nshimyiryo, Barnhart, Dusabeyezu, Mpanumusingo, Nahimana, Mubiligi, Cubaka","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054137","20221010","COVID-19; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38927,""
"A concept mapping study of service user design of safer supply as an alternative to the illicit drug market","Within North America and worldwide, drug-related overdoses have increased dramatically over the past decade. COVID-19 escalated the need for a safer supply of illicit substances to reduce overdoses with hopes of replacing substances obtained from the illicit drug market. Drug users <sup>1</sup> should be at the centre of program and policy decisions related to the development and implementation of safer supply. Yet, there is little empirical research that conceptualizes effective safer supply from their perspectives. Within a community based participatory approach to research, we conducted a concept mapping study to foreground the perspectives of drug users and develop a conceptual model of effective safer supply. Our team was composed of researchers from a local drug user organization, a local harm reduction organization, and academic researchers. The focused prompt developed by the team was: ""Safe supply would work well ifÃ¢â‚¬Â¦"" Sixty-three drug users participated in three rounds of focus groups as part of the concept mapping process, involving brainstorming, sorting, rating and naming of themes. The concept mapping process resulted in six clusters of statements: 1) Right dose and right drugs for me; 2) Safe, positive and welcoming spaces; 4) I am treated with respect; 5) I can easily get my safer supply; and 6) Helps me function and improves my quality of life (as defined by me). The statements within each cluster describe key components central to an effective model of safer supply as defined by drug users. The results of this study provide insights into key components of effective safer supply to inform planning and evaluation of future safer supply programs informed by drug user perspectives.","Pauly, McCall, Cameron, Stuart, Hobbs, Sullivan, Ranger, Urbanoski","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103849","20221010","COVID-19; Concept mapping; Harm reduction; Overdose deaths; Overdose prevention; Participatory research; People who use drugs; Safe supply","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38928,""
"Information seeking, mental health and loneliness: Longitudinal analyses of adults in the UK COVID-19 mental health and wellbeing study","Information seeking has generally been seen as an adaptive response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it may also result in negative outcomes on mental health. The present study tests whether reporting COVID-related information seeking throughout the pandemic is associated with subsequently poorer mental health outcomes. A quota-based, non-probability-sampling methodology was used to recruit a nationally representative sample. COVID-related information seeking was assessed at six waves along with symptoms of depression, anxiety, mental wellbeing and loneliness (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1945). Hierarchical linear modelling was used to assess the relationship between COVID-related information seeking and mental health outcomes. Information seeking was found to reduce over time. Overall, women, older and higher socioeconomic group individuals reported higher levels of information seeking. At waves 1-4 (March-June 2020) the majority of participants reported that they sought information on Covid 1-5 times per day, this decreased to less than once per day in waves 5 and 6 (July-November 2020). Higher levels of information seeking were associated with poorer mental health outcomes, particularly clinically significant levels of anxiety. Use of a non-probability sampling method may have been a study limitation, nevertheless, reducing or managing information seeking behaviour may be one method to reduce anxiety during pandemics and other public health crises.","Wilding, O'Connor, Ferguson, Wetherall, Cleare, O'Carroll, Robb, O'Connor","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114876","20221010","Anxiety; Coronavirus; Depression; Isolation; Public health; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38929,""
"Healthy Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19 Two Years after the Infection: A Prospective Cohort Study","The long-term effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been rarely known. This study aimed to investigate healthy outcomes of COVID-19 survivors up to 2 years after the infection. A total of 155 COVID-19 patients, who were discharged from Shenzhen Third People's Hospital from February 2020 to April 2020, were enrolled and followed up until March 4, 2022. COVID-19 survivors received questionnaires of long COVID symptoms and psychological symptoms, pulmonary function tests, chest computed tomography (CT) scans, routine laboratory tests. Two years after infection, 36.6% of patients had at least one symptom of long COVID. Vision impairment and fatigue were the most common symptom. 35.0% of participants still had at least one psychological symptom of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and sleep difficulties. Radiographic abnormalities were presented in 50.7% of patients, with the most common features of fibrosis-like lesions and residual ground-glass opacity. Diffuse dysfunction (24.0%) was the main abnormalities of pulmonary function tests. Most laboratory parameters returned to normal range, while persistent abnormalities in kidney and liver function test were observed in a subset of participants after discharge. Two years after COVID-19 infection, persistent symptoms of long COVID and psychological symptoms, as well as abnormalities in pulmonary function test and CT, were still common in a subset of recovering individuals.

Most of the climate change impacts on mental health are disaster related, although recent literature on ""eco-anxiety,"" often described as anxiety about the long-term effects of climate change, is emerging. There is strong evidence that the use of telepsychiatry and digital approaches to mental health care can reduce carbon emissions by reducing travel for patients and providers as well as provide effective distance care in disasters. Hybrid care, asynchronous consultations, and care at home are all innovations that will further reduce carbon emissions. The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly accelerated the digitization of psychiatry, and climate change will continue to drive these changes in the future. Much more research on these overlapping issues is required.","Yellowlees","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-022-01377-6","20221010","Asynchronous care; Carbon emissions; Climate change; Eco-anxiety; Hybrid care; Telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38931,""
"Unmet Needs for Food, Medicine, and Mental Health Services among Vulnerable Older Adults during the Covid-19 Pandemic","To examine sociodemographic factors associated with having unmet needs in medications, mental health, and food security among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary data and secondary data from the Electronic Health Records (EHR) in an Age-Friendly academic health system in 2020 were used. Observational study examining factors associated with having unmet needs in medications, food, and mental health. Data from a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview and EHR on community-dwelling older patients were analyzed. Among 3,400 eligible patients, 1,921 (53.3%) (average age 76, SD 11) responded, with 857 (45%) of respondents had at least one unmet need. Unmet needs for medications were present in 595 (31.0%), for food in 196 (10.2%), and for mental health services in 292 (15.2%). Racial minorities had significantly higher probabilities of having unmet needs for medicine, food, and of being referred for services related to medications, food, and mental health. Patients living in more resource-limited neighborhoods had higher probability of being referred for mental health services. Age-friendly health systems (AFHS) and their recognition should include assessing and addressing social risk factors among older adults. Proactive efforts to address unmet needs should be integral to AFHS.","Tai-Seale, Cheung, Kwak, Harris, Madonis, Russell, Haley, Agnihotri","https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.14084","20221010","Aging; healthy place index; neighborhood resources; social determinants of health; unmet needs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38932,""
"COVID vaccine recommendations in dermatologic patients on immunosuppressive agents: Lessons learned from pandemic","Since SARS-CoV2 vaccines were approved without enough long-term monitoring due to emergent situations, some issues have been raised about timing and protocol of receiving them by patients treated by different immunosuppressive agents. Here, we present different aspects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in such patients in the field of dermatology. In brief, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is recommended in all dermatologic patients, regardless of their disorders and therapeutic regimens. Nevertheless, special considerations should be given to the immunosuppressive therapy and its association with vaccination timing due to the decreased immunogenicity of vaccines in this setting. Novel biologic immunotherapies are advantageous over conventional systemic therapies not only in their safety and selective functions but also in this aspect that many of them do not affect vaccines immunogenicity.","Aryanian, Balighi, Afshar, Zamanian, Razavi, Hatami","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.15448","20221010","COVID-19 vaccine; SARS-CoV-2; biologic therapies; dermatologic conditions; immunosuppressive therapies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38933,""
"The efficacy of online mindfulness-based interventions in a university student sample: Videoconference- or podcast-delivered intervention","The increasing mental health issues among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges of delivering face-to-face interventions during lockdowns have increased the demand for online interventions. The report presents results from a randomized controlled trial investigating the benefits of online mindfulness interventions delivered by videoconference or podcast during the early phase of the pandemic in Germany. Fifty university students were randomized to a mindfulness intervention conducted by videoconference (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°25) or to an unguided training provided by podcasts (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°25). All students participated in a 7-week mindfulness intervention. Outcome measures included mindfulness, depression, anxiety, and life satisfaction preintervention and postintervention. The study showed a larger reduction in depression in the videoconferencing group than in the podcast group across per protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. There was a significant increase in mindfulness (PP and ITT samples) and life satisfaction (ITT sample) in both groups. The frequency of home practice was related to positive changes in outcomes but only for the videoconferencing group. The results suggest that mindfulness training delivered via videoconferencing can be a viable option to address depressive symptoms among students. However, both interventions were effective in increasing mindfulness and life satisfaction.","Karing","https://doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12408","20221010","RCT; delivery method; guidance; mental health; online mindfulness intervention; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38934,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and previous pandemics, epidemics and economic crises on mental health: systematic review","A rise in mental illness is expected to follow the COVID-19 pandemic, which has also been projected to lead to a deep global economic recession, further adding to risk factors. The aim of this review was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and previous pandemics, epidemics and economic crises on mental health. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Sociological Abstracts. We included studies of all populations exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other similar pandemics/epidemics and economic crises, compared with non-exposed time periods or regions. The outcome was mental health. The 174 included studies assessed mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (87 studies), 2008 economic crisis (84 studies) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic (three studies). Outcomes were divided into affective disorders, suicides, mental healthcare utilisation and other mental health. COVID-19 pandemic studies were of lesser quality than those for the economic crisis or SARS epidemic. Most studies for all exposures showed increases in affective disorders and other mental health problems. For economic crisis exposure, increases in mental healthcare utilisation and suicides were also found, but these findings were mixed for COVID-19 pandemic exposure. This is probably because of quarantine measures affecting help-seeking and shorter follow-ups of studies of COVID-19 pandemic exposure. Our findings highlight the importance of available, accessible and sustainable mental health services. Also, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations should be particular targets of policy interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Asper, Osika, Dalman, PÃƒÂ¶llÃƒÂ¤nen, Simonsson, Flodin, Sidorchuk, Marchetti, Awil, Castro, Niemi","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.587","20221010","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; depressive disorders; epidemiology; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38935,""
"Mental distress, quality of life and physical symptoms in Chinese women with ovarian cancer receiving olaparib treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic","Women with ovarian cancer (OC) have experienced unprecedented challenges since the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China. We aim to evaluate the experience of psychological status, physical symptoms and quality of life (QoL) and investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on OC patients receiving olaparib. The survey was conducted online from April 22 to May 12 in 2020. Demographic and clinical questions were listed to collect general information. The degree of insomnia, depression, anxiety, stress symptoms and QoL were assessed by the Chinese versions of the Insomnia Severity Index, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and the General Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to analyze the risk factors for mental distress and QoL. A total of 56 respondents coming from 15 various provinces in China participated in the survey. The prevalence of insomnia, depressive, anxiety, stress symptoms and reduced QoL were 37.5, 51.8, 37.5, 30.4, and 51.8%, respectively. Unfavorable disease status, shorter period of olaparib administration, adverse events of olaparib and delay in cancer care were correlated with mental health problems. Reduced QoL was also significantly associated with psychological distress. This study emphasized that mental health problems and reduced QoL should gain more attention in women with OC who are receiving oral olaparib at home. Appropriate psychological healthcare strategies are necessary for OC patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mao, Li, Li, Li, Zhang, Ou, Liu, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.915225","20221010","COVID-19; mental health; olaparib; ovarian cancer; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38936,""
"YESS: A feasibility study of a supported employment program for youths with mental health disorders","In Canada, employment/education support is rarely embedded as a component of mental health service delivery. This study describes a supported education/employment program (SEP) that integrates both clinical and community mental health services. The main objectives were to estimate the feasibility of a 5-week SEP among youths aged 17-24 with mental illness and to estimate the extent to which participation in this program improved employment and mental health outcomes. This was a single cohort study. Feasibility outcomes assessed were demand, acceptability, practicality, integration, adaptation, and effectiveness. These were assessed through recruitment and retention rates, recording patterns of missing data, and examining differences between completers and non-completers. Appropriateness of the outcome measures was assessed through the strength of the association between the outcome measures at baseline. Effectiveness of the program was assessed through employment and as measured using MyLifetracker (MLT), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the Canadian Personal Recovery Outcome Measure (CPROM). A total of 110 youths with a mean age of 20.6 (SD: 2.2) were recruited. At 5 weeks, 82 (74.5%) of participants remained in the program. Of the people who completed the program, 56.1% were women, 76.6% were in stable housing and 64.1% had depression. Approximately 60% of non-completers used two or more services and were in at-risk housing. More than 25% of participants improved on the patient-reported outcomes. Scores on these measures were moderately to highly correlated with each other. Employment rates varied and corresponded to the waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. Results showed that this program was feasible and there was high demand for SEP during the COVID-19 pandemic but gaining employment remained difficult. Educational or employment outcomes, measured over a short period, may not be adequate. Instead, individualized and patient-reported outcome measures may be more appropriate for SEP programs.","Ow, Marchand, Glowacki, Alqutub, Mathias, Barbic","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.856905","20221010","health services; individual placement and support; psychiatric rehabilitation; supported employment program; youth mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38937,""
"Online guided meditation training (Isha Kriya) improves self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression within 2 weeks of practice-An observational study","Anxiety and depression have increased dramatically 2-3-fold with the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need for safe, cost-effective, and scalable approaches to alleviate this parallel mental health pandemic. Meditation has previously been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Furthermore, online delivery of mind-body interventions will be impactful in addressing disparities in access to mental healthcare. In this observational pilot study, we investigate the impact of a digitally delivered guided meditation followed by daily practice on symptoms of anxiety and depression. Initially, 57 male and 202 female subjects enrolled in this study. Participants attended a webinar where they learned the Isha Kriya meditation practice. They were subsequently requested to perform the intervention daily for 6 weeks. Subjects were given scales to assess anxiety and depression at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks following the training. The changes in the self-reported anxiety and depression scores were examined by the linear mixed effect models. Participants completed survey responses for the following time points: baseline (<i>n</i> = 82), week 2 (<i>n</i> = 58), week 4 (<i>n</i> = 37), and week 6 (<i>n</i> = 28). During the 6 weeks of the study over 68% of subjects were compliant with their daily practice. When comparing baseline with week 2, the mean anxiety scores decreased from 25.4 to 16.8 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, <i>d</i> = 1.31). Similarly, mean depression scores decreased from 15 to 8.81 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, <i>d</i> = 0.9). The reduced scores for both anxiety and depression were maintained at weeks 4 and 6. This preliminary study assesses the effectiveness of online meditation training on self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression. After 2 weeks of practice, those with baseline anxiety and depression showed significant improvement with a large effect size. The results from weeks 4 and 6 show sustained reduced anxiety and depression symptoms. These findings suggest that daily Isha Kriya practice could alleviate symptoms of these conditions. Future studies utilizing randomized control trials should be conducted to rigorously evaluate the benefits of this meditation practice on anxiety and depression.

"Assessment of Canadian perinatal mental health services from the provider perspective: Where can we improve?","Perinatal mental health disorders are common, and rates have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear where providers may improve perinatal mental health care, particularly in countries lacking national guidelines, such as Canada. A cross-sectional survey of perinatal health providers was conducted to describe the landscape of perinatal mental health knowledge, screening, and treatment practices across Canada. Providers were recruited through listservs, social media, and snowball sampling. Participants completed an online survey that assessed their perinatal mental health training, service provision types, their patient wait times, and treatment barriers, and COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts. A total of 435 providers completed the survey, including physicians, midwives, psychologists, social workers, nurses, and allied non-mental health professionals. Most (87.0%) did not have workplace mandated screening for perinatal mental illness but a third (66%) use a validated screening tool. Many (42%) providers stated their patients needed to wait more than 2 months for services. More than half (57.3%) reported they did not receive or were unsure if they received specialized training in perinatal mental health. Most (87.0%) indicated there were cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers to accessing services. Over two-thirds (69.0%) reported the COVID-19 pandemic reduced access to services. Survey findings reveal significant gaps in training, screening tool use, and timely and culturally safe treatment of perinatal mental health concerns.

"Prevalence and correlates of cannabis abuse among residents in the community of Fort McMurray, a city in Northern Alberta which had endured multiple natural disasters","Cannabis is one of the widely used drugs for relaxation and may be abuse among users. Researchers have given attention to cannabis use among the general population while vulnerable populations who have experience multiple traumas may be at risk of cannabis abuse. Other factors may influence cannabis abuse among people exposed to traumas. The study aims to determine the prevalence and correlates of self-reported cannabis abuse among residents of Fort McMurray, a city in Northern Alberta, Canada. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using an online questionnaire. Sociodemographic data, trauma exposure, and clinical characteristics were collected to identify the possible risk factor of cannabis abuse. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 25 using a chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis. Correlation analysis was also performed to ascertain likely cannabis abuse and the association with other mental health conditions. Overall, participants who completed the survey were one hundred and eighty-sixed out of the two hundred and forty-nine residents who accessed the online survey, giving a response rate of 74.7%. The prevalence of self-reported cannabis abuse among participants was 14%. Most of the participants were females (159, 85.5%), more than 40 years of age (98, 52.7%), employed (175, 94.1%), owned their house (145, 78.0%), and 103 (60.6%) reported being exposed to at least a trauma (COVID-19, flooding, or wildfire). Regarding regression analysis results, participants living in a rented accommodation were nearly four times more likely to abuse cannabis (OR = 3.86; 95% CI: 1.34-11.14) than those owning their houses. Similarly, male participants were more than 6-folds more likely to abuse cannabis than the female gender (OR= 6.25; 95% CI: 1.89-20), and participants in a relationship were six times more likely to abuse cannabis than participants not in a relationship (OR = 6.33; 95% CI: 1.67-24.39). The study also found significant association of depressive symptoms (<i>X</i> <sup>2</sup> = 4.561; <i>p</i> = 0.033) and anxiety symptoms (<i>X</i> <sup>2</sup> = 4.700; <i>p</i> = 0.030) with likely cannabis abuse.

"COVID-19 masks: A barrier to facial and vocal information","With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have become used to wearing masks and have experienced how masks seem to impair emotion and speech recognition. While several studies have focused on facial emotion recognition by adding images of masks on photographs of emotional faces, we have created a video database with actors really wearing masks to test its effect in more ecological conditions. After validating the emotions displayed by the actors, we found that surgical mask impaired happiness and sadness recognition but not neutrality. Moreover, for happiness, this effect was specific to the mask and not to covering the lower part of the face, possibly due to a cognitive bias associated with the surgical mask. We also created videos with speech and tested the effect of mask on emotion and speech recognition when displayed in auditory, visual, or audiovisual modalities. In visual and audiovisual modalities, mask impaired happiness and sadness but improved neutrality recognition. Mask impaired the recognition of bilabial syllables regardless of modality. In addition, it altered speech recognition only in the audiovisual modality for participants above 70 years old. Overall, COVID-19 masks mainly impair emotion recognition, except for older participants for whom it also impacts speech recognition, probably because they rely more on visual information to compensate age-related hearing loss.","Aguillon-Hernandez, Jusiak, Latinus, Wardak","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2022.982899","20221010","age; emotion; face; occlusion; speech; voice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38941,""
"A nationwide survey on the management of the COVID-19 pandemic and respiratory disease in South Korea","This study aimed to explore individual prevalence of respiratory symptoms and to describe the Korean population's treatment approaches, preventive health behaviors, and mental health conditions during the pandemic. We analyzed responses from an online nationwide survey, conducted between February 2021 to May 2021, about people's experiences during the pandemic. Statistical analysis was also performed to see if there were any significant differences in treatment and prevention strategies between different groups of respondents (between those had respiratory symptoms, compared with those who did not, and between those tested positive for COVID-19, compared with those who did not). A total of 2,177 survey respondents completed the survey and, of these, only 142 had experienced symptoms. The most frequently reported respiratory infections related symptoms were runny or blocked nose (47.6%), cough (45.5%), fever (44.1%), sore throat (42.0%), and fatigue (30.1%). More than half of the respondents (53.1%) used complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches as means of preventive measures. In terms of preventive behaviors, the more emphasized behaviors were mask-wearing (58.9%) and hand-washing after coming home (42.7%). The majority of the respondents (64.9%) did not show signs of mental health issues. In South Korea, conventional medicine was mainly used for COVID-19 treatment whereas CAM was commonly used as preventive measures.

"Too many lemons to make lemonade? Disentangling mental health during the third wave of COVID-19 infections in Spain","The study aimed to analyze the longitudinal change in mental health during the third wave of COVID-19 infections in Spain. Negative (e.g., emotional distress) and positive (e.g., positive functioning variables) outcomes were analyzed. Protective factors (e.g., resilience) as predictors of psychological adjustment (i.e., positive mental health, openness to the future, and low burden due to COVID-19) after ten months of the pandemic were also examined. The sample consisted of 164 participants, and self-reported questionnaires were administered at the beginning of the lockdown (March 2020), at the end of the lockdown (June 2020), and during the third wave (January 2021). Linear mixed models showed that individuals' emotional distress increased, and positive functioning variables (i.e., meaning in life, gratitude, resilience, and life satisfaction) decreased over time, but an increase was observed in some dimensions of posttraumatic growth. Regression analyses showed that resilience scores at all three data collection time points were significant predictors of positive mental health, openness to the future, and burden during the third wave. Mediation analyses showed that positive mental health and openness to the future were mediators of the effect of resilience on burden. The prolonged situation of the COVID-19 crisis had an important impact on positive and negative mental health. However, resilience may help to build up resources that can act as a buffer against adverse psychological effects.","Miragall, EscrivÃƒÂ¡-MartÃƒÂ­nez, Wrzesien, Vara, Herrero, Desdentado, BaÃƒÂ±os","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03638-2","20221010","COVID-19; Emotional distress; Openness to the future; Positive mental health; Psychological burden; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38943,""
"REAC Noninvasive Neurobiological Stimulation in Autism Spectrum Disorder for Alleviating Stress Impact","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms can become more evident because of different factors. Among these, depression, anxiety, and stress play an important role. Additionally, several studies have revealed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on participants with ASD. In previous studies, two noninvasive neurobiological stimulation treatments with radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) technology, called neuropostural optimization (NPO) and neuropsychophysical optimization (NPPO), were shown to be effective in improving the subjective response to environmental stressors in the general population and in ASD population. Based on the proven efficacy of REAC NPO and NPPOs treatments in alleviating anxiety, stress, and depression, the purpose of this study is to verify how these treatments can reduce the severity of ASD symptoms expression, which is aggravated by depression, anxiety, and stress. The treatments' effects were perceived by caregivers and assessed by the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC). This study involved 46 children with a previous diagnosis of ASD made using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. The participants received one session of NPO treatment and one NPPOs treatment cycle of 18 sessions, administered within approximately 3Ã‚Â weeks. The Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) was used to evaluate the efficacy of the REAC treatments. ATEC allows to evaluate four clusters (speech or language communication; sociability; sensory or cognitive awareness; and health/physical/behavior) through a numerical scale that measures increasing levels of ASD severity. The comparison between the scores of the ATEC administered pre- and post-REAC treatments highlighted an improvement of ASD symptoms in each of the four clusters of ATEC. The results confirm the usefulness of REAC treatments to optimize the individual response to environmental stressors and reduce the symptomatic expression and deficits present in ASD.","Rinaldi, Martins, Maioli, Rinaldi, Fontani","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41252-022-00293-3","20221010","Allostatic overload; Anxiety; Autism; Depression; Neurobiological stimulation; REAC","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38944,""

Interviews were conducted with volunteer firefighters between September and November 2021. Interviews were analyzed using deductive dominant thematic analysis. Thirty-three firefighters were interviewed who had an average of 22 years of service and a mean age of 52 years. Interviewees described pandemic-related challenges including the fear of COVID exposure and frustrations with work and personal relationships. They also identified unexpected work-related benefits including a deepened commitment to serve and improvements to training and safety.

"The Burden of Hate: How Nonwork Discrimination Experienced During the COVID-19 Pandemic Impacts Asian American Employees","The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a sharp increase in prejudice and discrimination targeting Asian Americans in the USA. Thus, in addition to the public health risks associated with the virus, exposure to discrimination poses a unique threat to the health and well-being of Asian Americans. Indeed, empirical evidence has documented the linkage between experiencing anti-Asian discrimination during the pandemic and health decrements among Asian Americans. The goal of this study was to expand that research to also consider the ways experiencing discrimination in a nonwork context may spill over to affect the general and job-related well-being of Asian American employees as well as the potential mitigating role of coworker compassion. Results from a sample of 311 Asian American employees demonstrated that experiencing nonwork discrimination was associated with decrements in physical health and increased depression and job-related exhaustion. Further, there were significant interactions between nonwork discrimination and coworker compassion for engagement, emotional exhaustion, and depressive symptoms such that nonwork discrimination was more strongly related to each outcome when coworker compassion was low. The findings from the current study suggest that experiences of racial derogation, even those that occur outside the workplace environment, are detrimental to the well-being of employees and that coworker compassion is a positive resource that may foster healthier and more inclusive work environments.

"Parent Coaching Fidelity Trajectories of In-Person and Telehealth Sessions during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges to delivery of preventive and mental health services, and providers have rapidly transitioned to telehealth service provision. Factors such as sudden isolation, financial strain, and physical and mental health stress presented unique challenges for providers and families and highlight the need for accessible and effective services. Thus, providers' fidelity of implementation during the pandemic is an important area for research. The current observational study compared providers' fidelity across in-person and telehealth-delivered sessions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC), a preventive parent coaching intervention for infants and toddlers. Participants included 24 providers (95% female, 42% White, <i>M</i> age = 37) who participated in ABC training and consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Providers' fidelity data (<i>N</i> = 593 sessions) were modeled longitudinally using hierarchical linear modeling, and separate intercepts and slopes were estimated for in-person and telehealth-delivered sessions. When data were modeled across all available sessions, results indicated that providers demonstrated improving fidelity over the course of training. When in-person and telehealth-delivered sessions were compared, providers' fidelity in telehealth-delivered ABC sessions was not significantly different from their fidelity in in-person sessions. Providers demonstrated improving fidelity over time in telehealth-delivered sessions. Thus, providers were able to maintain and improve ABC fidelity during the COVID-19 pandemic when provided with implementation support. Rapid transition to telehealth delivery can be successful when ongoing support such as consultation is provided.","Caron, Kipp, Costello, Bernard, Schein, Roben, Dozier","https://doi.org/10.1080/23794925.2021.1996300","20221010","COVID-19; Dissemination &amp; Implementation Science; Parenting; Prevention Science; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38947,""

"Evolution of Mood Symptomatology Through the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings From the CovidSense Longitudinal Study","Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic, with its associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness, has led to significant mental, physical, social, and economic hardships. Physical distancing, isolation, and fear of illness have significantly affected the mental health of people worldwide. Several studies have documented the cross-sectional elevated prevalence of mental anguish, but due to the sudden nature of the pandemic, very few longitudinal studies have been reported, especially covering the first phase of the pandemic. CovidSense, a longitudinal adaptive study, was initiated to answer some key questions: how did the pandemic and related social and economic conditions affect depression, which groups showed more vulnerability, and what protective factors emerged as the pandemic unfolded? Methodology CovidSense was deployed from April to December 2020. The adaptive design enabled adaption to fluctuating demographics/health status. Participants were regularly queried via SMS messages about their mental health, physical health, and life circumstances. The study included 1,190 participants who answered a total of 18,783 survey panels. This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study following adult participants in the general population through the COVID-19 pandemic. The participant cohort reported self-assessed measures ranging from subjective mood ratings and substance use to validated questionnaires, such as the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) and Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R). Results Participants with pre-existing physical (especially pulmonary) or mental conditions had overall higher levels of depression, as measured by the QIDS and self-reported mood. Participants with pre-existing conditions also showed increased vulnerability to the stress caused by watching the news and the increase in COVID-19 cases. Younger participants (aged 18-25 years) were more affected than older groups. People with severe levels of depression had the most variation in QIDS scores, whereas individuals with none to low depressive scores had the most variability in self-reported mood fluctuations. Conclusions The effects of pandemic-related chronic stress were predominant in young adults and individuals with pre-existing mental and medical conditions regardless of whether they had acquired COVID-19 or not. These results pointÃ‚Â to the possibility of allocating preventive as well as treatment resources based on vulnerability.","Moukaddam, Saragadam, Abbasi, Barnett, Kumar Vadathya, Veeraraghavan, Sabharwal","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.29876","20221010","anxiety; covid-19; depression; longitudinal; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38949,""
"The impact of eating behaviors during COVID-19 in health-care workers: A conditional process analysis of eating, affective disorders, and PTSD","The incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increased among healthcare workers (HCWs) during the outbreak of COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between eating behavior and PTSD, considering the mediation effect of anxiety, depression and sleep. A total of 101 HCWs completed a survey. The Food-Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ) were used to evaluate the diet. A special survey was conducted on the eating time of each shift mode. The PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Morning-Evening Questionnaire (MEQ) were utilized to assess clinical symptoms. There was a statistically significant correlation between the night shift eat midpoint (NEMP) and PTSD symptoms, anxiety and depression as significant mediators. The last meal jet lag between night shift and day shift (NDLM) was related to PTSD symptoms significantly, and sleep and anxiety were significant mediators. The relationship between animal-based protein pattern and PTSD symptoms was statistically significant, and anxiety was the significant mediator. The earlier the HCWs eat in the night shift, the lighter the symptoms of PTSD. This is mediated by improving anxiety, depression and sleep disorder. Furthermore, the consumption of animal protein could reduce symptoms of PTSD by improving anxiety.","Yao, Xie, Bai, Li, Zhang, Li, Ma, Hui, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10892","20221010","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Eating behavior; Mediation analysis; PTSD; Sleep disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38950,""
"Effects of immunophilin inhibitors and non-immunosuppressive analogs on coronavirus replication in human infection models","Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) seriously affect human health by causing respiratory diseases ranging from common colds to severe acute respiratory diseases. Immunophilins, including peptidyl-prolyl isomerases of the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) and the cyclophilin family, are promising targets for pharmaceutical inhibition of coronavirus replication, but cell-type specific effects have not been elucidated. FKBPs and cyclophilins bind the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and cyclosporine A (CsA), respectively. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (phBECs) were treated with CsA, Alisporivir (ALV), FK506, and FK506-derived non-immunosuppressive analogs and infected with HCoV-229E. RNA and protein were assessed by RT-qPCR and immunoblot analysis. Treatment with the same compounds was performed in hepatoma cells (Huh-7.5) infected with HCoV-229E expressing <i>Renilla</i> luciferase (HCoV-229E-RLuc) and the kidney cell line HEK293 transfected with a SARS-CoV-1 replicon expressing <i>Renilla</i> luciferase (SARS-CoV-1-RLuc), followed by quantification of luminescence as a measure of viral replication. Both CsA and ALV robustly inhibited viral replication in all models; both compounds decreased HCoV-229E RNA in phBECs and reduced luminescence in HCoV-229E-RLuc-infected Huh7.5 and SARS-CoV-1-RLuc replicon-transfected HEK293. In contrast, FK506 showed inconsistent and less pronounced effects in phBECs while strongly affecting coronavirus replication in Huh-7.5 and HEK293. Two non-immunosuppressive FK506 analogs had no antiviral effect in any infection model. The immunophilin inhibitors CsA and ALV display robust anti-coronaviral properties in multiple infection models, including phBECs, reflecting a primary site of HCoV infection. In contrast, FK506 displayed cell-type specific effects, strongly affecting CoV replication in Huh7.5 and HEK293, but inconsistently and less pronounced in phBECs.","Berthold, Ma-Lauer, Chakraborty, von Brunn, Hilgendorff, Hatz, Behr, Hausch, Staab-Weijnitz, von Brunn","https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2022.958634","20221010","Cyclosporin A; FK506; HCoV-229E; non-immunosuppressive analogs; pHBECs; tacrolimus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38951,""
"Association between fear of COVID-19 and hoarding behavior during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic: The mediating role of mental health status","Hoarding behavior can effectively improve people's ability to resist risks, so as to reduce the negative effects of risks. However, excessive hoarding behavior will seriously reduce people's quality of life. The COVID-19 pandemic can cause excessive hoarding in a large number of people in a short period of time, and also cause a series of economic problems such as social material shortage. It is unclear how hoarding levels are linked to fear and negative emotions caused by COVID-19 among people of different educational backgrounds and social status. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and hoarding behavior in different populations in school and social contexts, as well as the mediating role of negative emotions and the moderating role of subjective/objective social status and education level in this process. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in various provinces in China in January 2022. Demographic information, the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, the Fear of COVID-19 scale, the Depression Anxiety Stress-21, and the Saving Inventory-Revised were used to evaluate the severity of individual hoarding symptoms, the frequency of hoarding, the degree of fear, and the negative emotions (depression, anxiety, stress) caused by COVID-19. Research data showed that fear of COVID-19 was significantly correlated with hoarding behavior (<i>pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Fear of COVID-19 was significantly lower in the student sample than in the nonstudent sample (<i>pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Negative emotions played a mediating role in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and hoarding behavior (<i>pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Educational and economic levels moderated this process, but social status did not. Compared with the student sample, educational background and income had less of a moderating effect on the depression, anxiety, and stress caused by fear of COVID-19 in the nonstudent sample. However, these factors had a more regulative effect on the clutter and excessive acquisition behavior caused by depression, anxiety, and stress, although not on difficulty discarding. These findings suggest that reduce negative emotions in the population, improve cognitive levels, and provide financial support from governments may be effective ways to reduce hoarding symptoms.","Zhao, Yu, Zhao, Cai, Gao, Liu, Wang, Zhang, Chen, Li, Shi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.996486","20221010","COVID-19; economic level; educational background; hoarding behavior; mental health; obsessive-compulsive disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38952,""
"Burnout status of healthcare workers in the world during the peak period of the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers have a high workload and have been exposed to various psychosocial stressors. This study aimed to evaluate health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in the world. The method used in this research is qualitative with a literature review approach. The data sources in this study were taken from the Scopus database using the keywords ""health workers,"" ""burnout,"" AND ""coronavirus"" from the time range of 2020 to April 25, 2022. From the determination of the time range, 150 documents emerged. This study revealed that the Pearson correlation between total burnout scale scores on healthcare workers, professionals, exhaustion, mental, stress, personal, depression, symptoms, emergency, system, job, and impact indicated that overall burnout scores were associated with depression and anxiety. Stress symptoms had correlation values ranging from 0.84 to 0.73. Job burnout had a significant relationship with exhaustion at 0.89; depression r = 0.73), impacting a score of 0.66. At the same time, the fulfillment of professional and interpersonal disengagement showed a Pearson correlation between the total burnout scale scores on health workers, professionals, exhaustion, mental, stress, personal, depression, symptoms, emergency, system, job, and impact. Overall, the participants in health care workers worldwide experienced high levels of psychological distress. We also found that health workers dealing with COVID-19 pandemic patients were more likely to experience depression, stress, and burnout than health staff who were not personally involved in medical work.

"Effectiveness of a stepped-care programme of internet-based psychological interventions for healthcare workers with psychological distress: Study protocol for the RESPOND healthcare workers randomised controlled trial","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has challenged health services worldwide, with a worsening of healthcare workers' mental health within initial pandemic hotspots. In early 2022, the Omicron variant is spreading rapidly around the world. This study explores the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a stepped-care programme of scalable, internet-based psychological interventions for distressed health workers on self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms. We present the study protocol for a multicentre (two sites), parallel-group (1:1 allocation ratio), analyst-blinded, superiority, randomised controlled trial. Healthcare workers with psychological distress will be allocated either to care as usual only or to care as usual plus a stepped-care programme that includes two scalable psychological interventions developed by the World Health Organization: A guided self-help stress management guide (Doing What Matters in Times of Stress) and a five-session cognitive behavioural intervention (Problem Management Plus). All participants will receive a single-session emotional support intervention, namely psychological first aid. We will include 212 participants. An intention-to-treat analysis using linear mixed models will be conducted to explore the programme's effect on anxiety and depression symptoms, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire - Anxiety and Depression Scale summary score at 21 weeks from baseline. Secondary outcomes include post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, resilience, quality of life, cost impact and cost-effectiveness. This study is the first randomised trial that combines two World Health Organization psychological interventions tailored for health workers into one stepped-care programme.

"Physiological and mental health changes in cancer patients during the COVID-19 state of emergency","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic that we are currently facing, many governments across the world have declared a state of emergency and even confinements. This stressful situation, in addition to prolonged stays at home, may imply a radical change in lifestyle behavior and physical activity (PA). The aim of this study is to evaluate the physiological and psychological effects in cancer patients who changed their PA habits during the COVID-19 state of emergency in Spain. Thirty-three participants were evaluated pre- and post-state of emergency. A series of questionnaires was used to assess cancer-specific quality of life. The most relevant results revealed significantly lower walking time (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and sitting time (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.014).

"Exploring Retention, Usage, and Efficacy of Web-Based Delivery of Positive Emotion Regulation Skills During the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 prompted distress and increased reliance on digital mental health interventions, which previously demonstrated low rates of retention and adherence. This single-arm trial evaluated whether self-guided, web-based, positive affect regulation skills (PARK) were engaging and associated with changes in well-being during the pandemic. Over 6 weeks, PARK delivers brief lessons and practices in skills designed to increase positive emotions: noticing positive events, savoring, gratitude, mindfulness, positive reappraisal, personal strengths, and self-compassion. Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive tests of anxiety, depression, social isolation, positive affect, and meaning and purpose were administered at baseline, post-intervention, and 6 months after baseline. Retention and usage of PARK were measured by the web-based assessment and intervention platforms. The sample (<i>n</i> = 616) was predominantly female, non-Hispanic, white, and well-educated. Of those who completed baseline, only 42% completed a follow-up assessment; 30% never logged into PARK. Among those who did, 86% used at least one skill, but only 14% completed PARK. Across retention and usage metrics, older age predicted more engagement. In multivariable models, people of color and people with greater baseline anxiety were more likely to complete PARK. All well-being indicators improved over time, with greater improvements in anxiety and social isolation among participants who accessed at least one PARK skill compared to those who did not. Retention and usage rates mirrored pre-pandemic trends, but within this select sample, predictors of engagement differed from prior research. Findings underscore the need for additional efforts to ensure equitable access to digital mental health interventions and research.

"The emotional state of young people in northern Spain after one year and a half of the COVID-19 pandemic",": Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the young population has been suffering from an accumulation of psychological symptoms in northern Spain. The main objectives of this study were (1) to assess whether psychological symptoms persisted after one year and a half of the COVID-19 pandemic in northern Spain sample of young people, and (2) to analyze whether pandemic-specific variables (having a chronic illness, living with a person who has a chronic illness, having been infected with COVID-19, having a close person who has died or believing that people are respecting the measures imposed) are related to psychological symptomatology. : Symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression were measured using the Depression and Stress Anxiety Scale-21 (DASS-21). An <i>ad hoc</i> online questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographical information related to chronic illnesses of the participants, living with a chronically ill person, contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19, having people close to them who have died of COVID-19, and their perception of whether or not people respect the health measures. : Young people have suffered higher stress, anxiety, and depression levels than at the beginning of the pandemic. : The present study highlights the importance of addressing young people's mental health, and ensure that future adults emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic in a psychologically strong state.","Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Dosil-Santamaria, Mondragon, Gorrotxategi, Olaya, SantabÃƒÂ¡rbara","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpsy.2022.09.007","20221010","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; stress; young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38959,""
"Predicting South Korean adolescents vulnerable to obesity after the COVID-19 pandemic using categorical boosting and shapley additive explanation values: A population-based cross-sectional survey","This study identified factors related to adolescent obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic by using machine learning techniques and developed a model for predicting high-risk obesity groups among South Korean adolescents based on the result. This study analyzed 50,858 subjects (male: 26,535 subjects, and female: 24,323 subjects) between 12 and 18 years old. Outcome variables were classified into two classes (normal or obesity) based on body mass index (BMI). The explanatory variables included demographic factors, mental health factors, life habit factors, exercise factors, and academic factors. This study developed a model for predicting adolescent obesity by using multiple logistic regressions that corrected all confounding factors to understand the relationship between predictors for South Korean adolescent obesity by inputting the seven variables with the highest Shapley values found in categorical boosting (CatBoost). In this study, the top seven variables with a high impact on model output (based on SHAP values in CatBoost) were gender, mean sitting hours per day, the number of days of conducting strength training in the past seven days, academic performance, the number of days of drinking soda in the past seven days, the number of days of conducting the moderate-intensity physical activity for 60 min or more per day in the past seven days, and subjective stress perception level. To prevent obesity in adolescents, it is required to detect adolescents vulnerable to obesity early and conduct monitoring continuously to manage their physical health.","Byeon","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2022.955339","20221010","COVID-19 pandemic; CatBoost; adolescent; machine learning; obesity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38960,""
"Assessment of anxiety and depression, and coping mechanisms during COVID-19 lockdown among pregnant women","COVID-19 lockdown was associated with disruption of daily life, economy, essential health services including maternal health service, and psychological reflexes such as panic, sleep disorders, fear, anxiety, and depression. To assess the perception of pregnant women on the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and the prevalence of common mental health disorders (CMHD) among pregnant women. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 380 pregnant women at the University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan; participants were enrolled using a simple random sampling technique. Data was collected using pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire. Information obtained - sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics, perception and reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, effect on ANC, coping mechanisms, and presence of CMHD (anxiety and depression) were measured using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Data were analysed using STATA 16.0 Software. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were performed. The level of significance was p-value &lt; 0.05. The mean age was 32 Ã‚Â± 4.78 years, most respondents were &lt;35 years (75%), married (97.1%), had a higher education (89%) and multiparous (70%). About 43.9% were worried that COVID-19 would affect pregnancy care, 42.9% reported it affected care and 81.6% were not worried it would affect the delivery care. Among respondents, 96.6% were able to cope with the effects of the pandemic and 96.8% enjoyed good social support. Respondents did not have CMHD (88.16%), 7.9% had CMHD (4.74% had depression and 3.16% had anxiety) and 3.95% had co-morbid depression and anxiety. On multinomial regression analysis, relative to anxiety or depression only, respondents with combined depression and anxiety had higher odds of having no delivery plan and thought COVID-19 may affect their delivery. Only a few women reported anxiety and depression symptoms during the lockdown and those with anxiety or combined symptoms of anxiety and depression had no birth plan and believed that COVID-19 would affect their delivery.","Abdus-Salam, Balogun, Lawal, Lawal, Lawal, Abdulmalik, Morhason-Bello","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10902","20221010","COVID-19; COVID-19 mental health; Common mental disorders; Coronavirus; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38961,""
"The development of coronaphobia scale and psychometric effect among UAE people","The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health are likely to worsen as the epidemic progresses and will last long even after the pandemic has passed. The present study developed a coronaphobia scale during the pandemic to measure its psychological effects such as fear, anxiety, and depression in the majority of the cases in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It is a 35-item scale that measures anxiety symptoms connected with COVID-19 and may be used to identify people who require mental health treatment. Based on 618 adults, the reliability and validity of these items were appropriate. The scales were distributed via social media using a Google form. Internal consistency, reliability analysis, and structural equation models, particularly confirmatory factor analysis, were carried out. The elevated scores on the coronaphobia scale were associated with social phobia, anxiety, stress, and depression. The coronaphobia score distinguishes well between those with and without dysfunctional anxiety (85% specificity and 90% sensitivity). These results support the coronaphobia scale as a valid and effective tool for clinical practice and research.","Abdelrahman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10875","20221010","COVID-19; Coronaphobia scale; Development; Psychometric; UAE","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38962,""
"The impact of deprivation on patients awaiting planned care","Deprivation underpins many societal and health inequalities. COVID-19 has exacerbated these disparities, with access to planned care falling greatest in the most deprived areas of the UK during 2020. This study aimed to identify the impact of deprivation on patients on growing waiting lists for planned care. Questionnaires were sent to orthopaedic waiting list patients at the start of the UK's first COVID-19 lockdown to capture key quantitative and qualitative aspects of patients' health. A total of 888 respondents were divided into quintiles, with sampling stratified based on the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD); level 1 represented the 'most deprived' cohort and level 5 the 'least deprived'. The least deprived cohort were older (mean 65.95 years (SD 13.33)) than the most deprived (mean 59.48 years (SD 13.85)). Mean symptom duration was lower in the least deprived areas (68.59 months (SD 112.26)) compared to the most deprived (85.85 months (SD 122.50)). Mean pain visual analogue scores (VAS) were poorer in the most compared to the least deprived cohort (7.11 (SD 2.01) vs 5.99 (SD 2.57)), with mean mood scores also poorer (6.06 (SD 2.65) vs 4.71 (SD 2.78)). The most deprived areas exhibited lower mean quality of life (QoL) scores than the least (0.37 (SD 0.30) vs 0.53 (SD 0.31)). QoL findings correlated with health VAS and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD2) scores, with the most deprived areas experiencing poorer health (health VAS 50.82 (SD 26.42) vs 57.29 (SD 24.19); GAD2: 2.94 (SD 2.35) vs 1.88 (SD 2.07)). Least-deprived patients had the highest self-reported activity levels and lowest sedentary cohort, with the converse true for patients from the most deprived areas. The most deprived patients experience poorer physical and mental health, with this most adversely impacted by lengthy waiting list delays. Interventions to address inequalities should focus on prioritizing the most deprived.Cite this article: <i>Bone Jt Open</i>Ã‚Â 2022;3(10):777-785.","Kulkarni, Shah, Mangwani, Dias","https://doi.org/10.1302/2633-1462.310.BJO-2022-0037.R1","20221010","COVID-19; COVID-19 pandemic; Deprivation; Planned care; Quality-of-life; Waiting list; anxiety; cancer; clinicians; elective orthopaedic surgery; pain management; physical therapy; standard deviation; visual analogue scale (VAS); visual analogue scores","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38963,""
"COVID-19-Related worries mediate the association between attachment orientation and elevated depression levels at 21-month postpartum","The study's aims were to examine whether the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increases in depression levels of 21 months postpartum women who were initially sampled before the pandemic and whether COVID-19-related worries mediated the association between women's attachment orientations and this hypothesized increase. Participants comprised 185 postpartum women sampled in the maternity ward of a tertiary healthcare center in Israel followed from childbirth to 21 months postpartum in four-time points. . We analyzed demographic and obstetric information and the Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR) scale at T1; changes in the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) levels at all timepoints (T1-4); and COVID-19-related worries at T4. Results showed a significant increase in depression levels at T4 compared to T2 and T3, and an increase in the prevalence of women at the lower clinical EPDS threshold. COVID-19-related worries mediated the association between anxious attachment and depression (indirect effect: <i>B</i> = .21, p &lt; .05, <i>95%</i> CI = (.015, .47), R<sup>2</sup>=0.12). The evident effect of COVID-19 on postpartum depression is associated with variability between people. Thus, early assessment of women's attachment orientations might provide a strategy for identifying and treating women at risk.","Orkaby, Kalfon-Hakhmigari, Levy, Krissi, Peled, Handelzalts","https://doi.org/10.1080/02646838.2022.2132382","20221010","COVID-19; anxiety; attachment orientation; avoidance; depression; postpartum","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38964,""
"An explanatory model of depressive symptoms from anxiety, post-traumatic stress, somatic symptoms, and symptom perception: the potential role of inflammatory markers in hospitalized COVID-19 patients","The context of the COVID-19 pandemic has harmed the mental health of the population, increasing the incidence of mental health problems such as depression, especially in those who have had COVID-19. Our study puts forward an explanatory model of depressive symptoms based on subjective psychological factors in those hospitalized for COVID-19 with and without biological markers (i.e., inflammatory markers). Therefore, we aim to evaluate the hypotheses proposed in the model to predict the presence of depressive symptoms. We conducted a cross-sectional study, using a simple random sampling. Data from 277 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Lima-Peru, were collected to assess mental health variables (i.e., depressive, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and somatic symptoms), self-perception of COVID-19 related symptoms, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) such as inflammatory marker. We performed a structural equation modeling analysis to evaluate a predictive model of depressive symptoms. The results showed a prevalence of depressive symptoms (11.2%), anxiety symptoms (7.9%), somatic symptoms (2.2%), and symptoms of post-traumatic stress (6.1%) in the overall sample. No association was found between the prevalence of these mental health problems among individuals with and without severe inflammatory response. The mental health indicators with the highest prevalence were sleep problems (48%), low energy (47.7%), nervousness (48.77%), worry (47.7%), irritability (43.7%) and back pain (52%) in the overall sample. The model proposed to explain depressive symptoms was able to explain more than 83.7% of the variance and presented good goodness-of-fit indices. Also, a different performance between the proposed model was found between those with and without severe inflammatory response. This difference was mainly found in the relationship between anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms, and between the perception of COVID-19 related symptoms and somatic symptoms. Results demonstrated that our model of mental health variables may explain depressive symptoms in hospitalized patients of COVID-19 from a third-level hospital in Peru. In the model, perception of symptoms influences somatic symptoms, which impact both anxiety symptoms and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Thus, anxiety symptoms could directly influence depressive symptoms or through symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Our findings could be useful to decision-makers for the prevention of depression, used to inform the creation of screening tools (i.e., perception of symptoms, somatic and anxiety symptoms) to identify vulnerable patients to depression.","Villarreal-Zegarra, Paredes-Angeles, Mayo-Puchoc, Vilela-Estada, Copez-Lonzoy, Huarcaya-Victoria","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04277-4","20221009","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Inflammation; Peru; Post-traumatic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38965,""
"The effect of cognitive behavior therapy on anxiety and depression during COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis","The global spread of coronavirus has caused many physical and mental health problems throughout the world. Depression and anxiety are among the issues that people are experiencing abundantly, along with other mental health disorders, during this period. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is one of the approaches that is effective on improving most of the psychological issues including depression and anxiety. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effects of CBT on depression and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic period. English databases such as Cochrane, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science and Persian databases such as SID, MagIran and IranDoc were searched with a time limit of 2019 to 2022. Two researchers independently evaluated the quality of the entered studies based on Cochrane handbook. Subgroup analysis was conducted separately on the basis of being infected with coronavirus, not being infected with coronavirus, and having a history of depression or anxiety before the intervention and internet-based CBT for depression and anxiety. Meta-analysis results were reported using standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Heterogeneity of studies was analyzed by means of I<sup>2</sup> index; and in the case of heterogeneity presence, random effects model was used instead of fixed effects model. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used for evaluating the quality of evidence. Totally, 2015 articles were analyzed of which 11 articles entered meta-analysis. The overall results of meta-analysis showed that mean score of anxiety in the group receiving CBT was significantly lower than the control group (SMD: -Ã‚Â 0.95, 95% CI -Ã‚Â 1.29 to -Ã‚Â 0.62; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00001, I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°94%). In addition, mean score of depression in the intervention group was significantly lower than the control group (SMD: -Ã‚Â 0.58; 95% CI -Ã‚Â 1.00 to -Ã‚Â 0.16, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00001, I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°94%). In addition, the results of subgroup meta-analysis showed that internet-based CBT was effective in reducing of depression (SMD -Ã‚Â 0.35; 95% CI -Ã‚Â 0.50 to -Ã‚Â 0.20; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00001; I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0%) and anxiety (SMD -Ã‚Â 0.90; 95%CI -Ã‚Â 1.47 to -Ã‚Â 0.33; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002; I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°94%). The evidence about the effectiveness of CBT on depression and anxiety compared with control group on the basis of GRADE approach had low quality. Meta-analysis results showed that CBT reduced the mean scores of anxiety and depression significantly during COVID-19 pandemic period. Due to the low quality of evidence, conducting more randomized controlled trials with rigorous design is suggested.

"Psychological distress among the nursing workforce in the United Arab Emirates: Comparing levels before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Nurses make up the majority of the healthcare workforce. They contribute to the development of healthcare systems and the provision of high-quality, effective, and patient-centered healthcare services. However, nurses need good mental and emotional well-being to provide adequate care and the necessary physical and mental health support for their clients. This study aimed to determine the level of generalized psychological distress among nurses in the United Arab Emirates. As this study was initiated before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we were able to compare data gathered before and during the pandemic. This study used a cross-sectional correlational design. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) was used to measure generalized psychological distress. Nurses' distress levels were measured and compared before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 988 participants completed the questionnaire. The majority (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°629, 63.7%) were employed in hospitals and the remainder worked in primary healthcare settings (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°359, 36.3%). The mean distress score was 27.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.7; 42.1% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°416) of participants had a severe level of distress, and only 36.4% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°360) reported no distress. More participants had severe stress levels before COVID-19 (59.5%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°386) compared with during COVID-19 (10.9%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30). Participants' K10 scores suggest that nurses experience significant distress, which may compromise their ability to care for their clients. This study emphasizes the importance of supporting nurses as a preliminary step to improving patient care. Despite the pressure of working during the COVID-19 pandemic, participants' general distress scores were lower during than before the pandemic. Organizational, governmental, and global support and appreciation may have contributed to relieving the distress nurses experienced. This may be a useful ongoing approach for enhancing healthcare systems.","Al-Yateem, Ahmed, Alameddine, Dias, Saifan, Subu, Hijazi, AbuRuz","https://doi.org/10.1111/nuf.12808","20221009","healthcare professional; mental health; nurses; pediatric care; psychological distress; work environment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38967,""
"Posttraumatic growth levels of healthcare workers in two periods with different intensities of COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic threatens health-care workers' (HCW) mental health and well-being. Although traumatic life events may result in psychiatric disorders, occasionally they give rise to positive changes, such as post-traumatic growth. Accordingly, the present study evaluated the traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression levels of HCWs and their post-traumatic growth levels during the pandemic. In addition, the study aimed to assess the changes in psychological outcomes during the pandemic. For this aim, the data were collected in two different periods. The first data-collection period was between May and July 2020, and the second period started in November 2020 and ended in January 2021. The sociodemographic data form, Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Post-traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) were used to collect data. Sixty-six HCWs participated in the study. No significant differences appeared between the baseline scores and 6-month follow-up in the depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress levels of HCWs. Furthermore, the PTGI scores decreased significantly over time. Although the change in the psychological distress scores was not statistically significant, the depression and post-traumatic stress scores increased over time. Previous research specified an inverse-parabolic relationship between traumatic stress and PTGI. Our results support previous research; as the exposure to the stressors continues, individual traumatic stress levels increase, psychiatric disorders become frequent, and affirmative changes (like post-traumatic growth) decline.","YÃ„Â±lmaz-Karaman, YastÃ„Â±baÃ…Å¸-KaÃƒÂ§ar, Ece Ã„Â°nce","https://doi.org/10.1002/pchj.599","20221009","COVID-19; depression; health-care worker; post-traumatic growth; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38968,""
"Job satisfaction and symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and burnout: A survey of Australian and New Zealand intensive care research coordinators","Intensive care unit clinical research is often implemented by specialised research coordinators (RCs). Clinical research activity within Australian and New Zealand intensive care units has escalated, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Growth of the intensive care RC workforce to match research demandÃ‚Â is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to repeat an Intensive Care Research Coordinator Interest Group workforce survey conducted in 2004 and 2009 to describe the current workforce and role satisfaction and also to determine reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and burnout in Australian and New Zealand intensive care RCs. In April 2021, an online anonymised survey was distributed to intensive care RCs to complete demographic and workforce questions, the McCloskey/Mueller Satisfaction Scale, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel. Of 128 Intensive Care Research Coordinator Interest Group eligible members, 98 (77%) completed the survey. Respondents were mainly women (91%), the median age was 47 years, 37% have a postgraduate qualification, and a third have over 10 years of RCC experience (31%). Half do not have permanent employment (52%). The mean Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 scores were within the normal range, and respondents reported symptoms of depression (21 [21%]), anxiety (23 [23%]), and stress (26 [27%]). Nearly half of the respondents (44%)Ã‚Â exhibited an early symptom of burnout by reporting problematic experiences of work. The overall role satisfaction score was 3.5/5 (neutral; neither satisfied nor dissatisfied). Intensive care RCs are an experienced group of professionals with limited satisfaction in the role. One-fifth of the ICU RCs experienced depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms, with close to half reporting signs of burnout. These results highlight the need to address areas of concern to ensure retention of this specialised intensive care workforce.","Yarad, Bates, Butler, Byrne, Eastwood, Grattan, Miller, Morrison, Murray, Palermo, Sherring, Soar, Tian, Towns, Hammond","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2022.08.009","20221009","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Clinical Trials Nurse; Depression; Intensive care workforce; Research coordinator; Stress; Symptoms of burnout; Work satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-11","",38969,""
