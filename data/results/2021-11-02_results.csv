"Difference in stress-related indicators between employees experiencing partial and complete lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan","The present study aimed to compare the stress experience of employees facing to differentiated types of lockdown situations: total vs. partial. It also aimed to identify the cognitive appraisal, coping, stress, and fear of contracting COVID-19 associated with lock down situations among employees. A cross-sectional research design was employed. The sample comprises two groups (n = 490 in each group), complete lockdown (people working from home) and partial lockdown (people going to workplace), and was drawn from Pakistan using purposive sampling technique. Stress Appraisal Measure, Brief COPE Inventory, Perceived Stress Scale, and Fear of Contracting COVID-19 Questionnaire were used to measure cognitive appraisal, coping, stress, and fear, respectively. Independent sample t-test showed that the threat and uncontrollable appraisal was high in people going to workplace as compared to people working from home. Results of binary logistic regression showed that people going to workplace were more likely to cope with COVID-19 situation through seeking instrumental support, behavior disengagement, acceptance, and religion as compared to people working from home. Moreover, people working from home were 0.84 times more likely to cope through emotional support than people going to workplace. Fear was found to be 1.1 times more likely associated with people going to workplace than people working from home. This study would help administrative authorities and government institutions in designing mental health services for working population. It would help the emergency departments in devising first aid management plan to deal with the psychological needs of the workers under pandemic/lockdown situations.","Ali, Abbas, Khan, Khan, Abbas","https://doi.org/10.5055/jem.0621","20211101","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19758,""
"Challenges for the disaster workforce during a compound hurricane-pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has created new workforce considerations for emergency management community in addressing cumulative and cascading disasters. This research identifies how emergency management planning for both the changing dynamics of COVID-19 and the upcoming hurricane season may change under a compound threat. Many jurisdictions have faced challenges in providing adequate staffing of shelters before the pandemic. Now, fatigue among staff further exacerbates these challenges as resources are stretched thin. Six workshops, involving 265 national, state, and local leaders, staff, experts, and advocates from 22 states, and a range of disciplines (disaster planning, public health, social services, academia, and healthcare), were convened to identify concerns and potential strategies to address staffing, training, logistics, and support. Strategies proposed to increase the number and skill set of staff available involve increased reliance upon volunteers and nonprofit organizations. Mental health resources, personal protective equipment, sanitation supplies, and defining roles within emergency shelters were recommended to reduce fatigue and redistribute responsibilities. Findings illuminate additional research avenues regarding assessing the underlying stressors contributing to the planning process and effective means of implementing these interventions to bolster emergency management shelter operations during a prolonged pandemic and in the future.","Marshall, Yusuf, Dunn, Merlo, Behr, Shekari, Scott, Cruz, Whytlaw, Hutton","https://doi.org/10.5055/jem.0591","20211101","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19759,""
"Psychiatric and post-traumatic stress disorders among COVID-19 survivors","Evidences related to neuropsychological impact of COVID-19 and its long-term side effects are beginning to emerge that may take years to catalogue the number of diseases and their treatments. Nonetheless, as neuropsychologists are evaluating COVID-19 survivors, a debate related to the psychiatric and neurocognitive sequels of past outbreaks, along with the recurrent co-occurrence of PTSD and acquired brain injuries, may be enlightening. This paper is highlighting the emergence of mental health issues that can be addressed and treatments can be provided according to the need of time. Technology has also been increasing day by day according to the current needs of public. COVID-19 crisis has now shifted the focus towards the role of digital health care. For ensuring the best and right use of tele-health and app tools in such crises, it is suggested that there is a need for training of mental health professionals to ensure proper protocols for improved efficacy.","Ahmed, Chughtai","https://doi.org/10.5055/jem.0538","20211101","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19760,""

"EMOCOV: Machine learning for emotion detection, analysis and visualization using COVID-19 tweets","The adversarial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has created a health crisis globally all over the world. This unprecedented crisis forced people to lockdown and changed almost every aspect of the regular activities of the people. Thus, the pandemic is also impacting everyone physically, mentally, and economically, and it, therefore, is paramount to analyze and understand emotional responses during the crisis affecting mental health. Negative emotional responses at fine-grained labels like anger and fear during the crisis might also lead to irreversible socio-economic damages. In this work, we develop a neural network model and train it using manually labeled data to detect various emotions at fine-grained labels in the Covid-19 tweets automatically. We present a manually labeled tweets dataset on COVID-19 emotional responses along with regular tweets data. We created a custom Q&amp;A roBERTa model to extract phrases from the tweets that are primarily responsible for the corresponding emotions. None of the existing datasets and work currently provide the selected words or phrases denoting the reason for the corresponding emotions. Our classification model outperforms other systems and achieves a Jaccard score of 0.6475 with an accuracy of 0.8951. The custom RoBERTa Q&amp;A model outperforms other models by achieving a Jaccard score of 0.7865.

"Effect of Anxiety About COVID-19 Infection in the Workplace on the Association Between Job Demands and Psychological Distress","<b>Purpose:</b> There is limited information about the association between workplace psychosocial factors and general worker mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the present study, we examined how anxiety about being infected by COVID-19 in the workplace affected the association between job demands and psychological distress (PD). <b>Method:</b> A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in December 2020. The final analyzed sample was 27,036. The dependent variable of PD was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6). Job demands were assessed using the Job Content Questionnaire. Feelings of anxiety were assessed by participants' responses to the following question: ""Do you feel anxiety about being infected by COVID-19 in the workplace?"" We used a two-level regression adjusting for prefectural level: each individual-level variable at level 1 was nested into each prefecture at level 2, stratified by presence of anxiety. <b>Results:</b> A total of 50.5% of participants felt anxious about being infected by COVID-19 in the workplace. The interaction between anxiety and job demands was significant. Job demands were positively associated with PD. In the stratified analysis, the associations were stronger among employees who experienced anxiety about COVID-19 infection in the workplace than among those who did not. <b>Conclusion:</b> The association between job demands and PD may be strengthened by anxiety about COVID-19 infection in the workplace.","Eguchi, Hino, Inoue, Tsuji, Tateishi, Ando, Nagata, Matsuda, Fujino","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.722071","20211101","COVID-19; Japan; anxiety; psychological distress; psychosocial factors; workplace","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19764,""
"The Psychological Consequences of COVID-19 Pandemic in Tourism Sector: A Systematic Review","The COVID-19 pandemic-induced changes have threatened the psychological wellbeing of travelling. This review aims to appraise a range of perceived psychological variables used to realize how the pandemic has influenced tourist behavior. A systematic review was conducted to identify the mechanisms behind tourists' behavioral change during the pandemic. The papers were extracted from four databases: PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and EMBASE, published since 2020 to 2021. The results are summarized narratively due to the heterogeneity of the studies. A total of 369 citations were identified through an electronic search of databases, of which nine publications met the inclusion criteria. The extracted information determines the significant factors contributing to the psychological changes of travelling behavior during the pandemic. The tourists' perception of COVID-19 has influenced the intentions and motivation in the tourism sector and has changed travel behavior. The mental health outcome of travelling has been replaced by globally recognized fear and anxiety. Yet, there are several motivators to travel during the pandemic.

"Contribution of Nanotechnologies to Vaccine Development and Drug Delivery against Respiratory Viruses","According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the coronavirus disease 2019, a respiratory viral illness linked to significant morbidity, mortality, production loss, and severe economic depression, was the third-largest cause of death in 2020. Respiratory viruses such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2, and adenovirus, are among the most common causes of respiratory illness in humans, spreading as pandemics or epidemics throughout all continents. Nanotechnologies are particles in the nanometer range made from various compositions. They can be lipid-based, polymer-based, protein-based, or inorganic in nature, but they are all bioinspired and virus-like. In this review, we aimed to present a short review of the different nanoparticles currently studied, in particular those which led to publications in the field of respiratory viruses. We evaluated those which could be beneficial for respiratory disease-based viruses; those which already have contributed, such as lipid nanoparticles in the context of COVID-19; and those which will contribute in the future either as vaccines or antiviral drug delivery systems. We present a short assessment based on a critical selection of evidence indicating nanotechnology's promise in the prevention and treatment of respiratory infections.","Ftouh, Kalboussi, Abid, Sfar, Mignet, Bahloul","https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6741290","20211101","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19766,""
"Prevalence of Dementia and Associated Factors among Older Adults in Latin America during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a great impact on cognitive health in Latin American older adults, increasing the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. Our objective was to analyze the prevalence of dementia and the associated factors in Latin American older adults during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A multicentric first phase cross-sectional observational study was conducted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Five thousand two hundred and forty-five Latin American adults over 60 years of age were studied in 10 countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela. We used the telephone version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the ""Alzheimer Disease 8"" scale for functional and cognitive changes, and the abbreviated version of the Yesavage depression scale. We also asked for sociodemographic and lockdown data. All the evaluation was made by telephone. Cross-tabulations and Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> tests were used to determine the variability of the prevalence of impairment by sociodemographic characteristics and binary logistic regression to assess the association between dementia and sociodemographic factors. We observed that the prevalence of dementia in Latin America is 15.6%, varying depending on the country (Argentine = 7.83 and Bolivia = 28.5%). The variables most associated with dementia were race and age. It does not seem to be associated with the pandemic but with social and socio-health factors.

"<i>COPEWithME</i>: The Role of Parental Ability to Support and Promote Child Resilient Behaviors During the COVID-19 Emergency","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to lockdown in many countries and Italy was the first one interested in Europe. The lockdown strategy is an essential step to curb the exponential rise of COVID-19 cases, but it is very demanding for the population involved and especially for children and their families. The aims of the present study are: (a) to explore the psychometric properties of the <i>COPEWithME</i> questionnaire, a new tool to evaluate parents' ability to support and promote child resilient behaviors, (b) to investigate the relation between parents' resilience and their ability to support and promote child resilient behaviors with child resilience and child stress-related behaviors assessed during the COVID-19 outbreak. Participants (<i>N</i> = 158 mothers, with 6- to 11-years-old children, 53% female), who were volunteers and anonymous, filled out an online questionnaire composed by CD-RISC 25, PMK-CYRM-R, and <i>COPEWithME</i>. With regard to the <i>COPEWithME</i>, validation exploratory factor analyses revealed a one-factor solution of 18 items. The <i>COPEWithME</i> positively correlates both with mothers' resilience and with children's resilience. Mediation analysis showed that the association between mothers' resilience and children's stress-related behaviors was mediated by the mothers' ability to support and promote child resilient behaviors. The <i>COPEWithME</i>, to our knowledge, is the first measure of parents' ability to support and promote resilient behaviors in school-age children, a key parenting skill that may help children in dealing with stressful situations such as the COVID-19 outbreak. These findings represent useful insights to advance mental health interventions in the post-pandemic phases suggesting focusing on a family's resources and resilience processes.","Mariani Wigley, Mascheroni, Bulletti, Bonichini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.732745","20211101","COVID-19; child resilience; family well-being; parental resilience; stress-related behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19772,""

Based on a cross-sectional design, caregivers of 6,017 children from 12 primary schools in Shanghai and Taizhou, China, were invited to complete an online survey from June 26 to July 6, 2020. EBPs of the children were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), while the emotional problems of caregivers were assessed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21). Structural equation modeling was employed to estimate the direct and indirect associations (explained by the emotional problems of caregivers) between COVID-19-related knowledge and precautions and the EBPs among children. The overall prevalence of EBPs in the sample was 12.5%, and 5.3% of them had a high or very high SDQ total difficulties score during the COVID-19 post-pandemic. After adjustment for covariates, higher COVID-19-related knowledge (ÃŽÂ² = -0.83; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and precautions (ÃŽÂ² = -0.80; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with lower SDQ total difficulties score among children. There was an explanatory effect of emotional problems of caregivers on the aforementioned associations, which explained 31% and 41% of the total effect, respectively. Higher levels of knowledge and precautions of COVID-19 were associated with lower EBPs among children, and the relationship was partially explained by the emotional problems in caregivers. It may be beneficial to improve pandemic-related prevention education and adopt psychological interventions toward the emotional status of caregivers for the psychological health of children.","Wang, Chen, Guo, Lin, Richards, Wang, Chen, Fu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.712529","20211101","COVID-19; caregivers; children; emotional and behavioral problems; knowledge; precaution","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19774,""
"Remote Relaxation and Acceptance Training for the Management of Stress in Cancer Patients: A Study Protocol","<b>Background:</b> Cancer patients are now facing a double distinctive challenge of survival against both the disease and fear of contracting COVID-19. This challenge has resulted in the forced adoption of social distancing measures and reorganization of the delivery of medical and psychological treatments. The perceived loneliness and uncertainty increased distress and symptoms burden. In the current period, eHealth interventions might provide valuable benefits in the field of cancer care. <b>Objective:</b> The overall goal of the study protocol will be to provide an innovative intervention for cancer patients based on an online platform, to help them manage and prevent psychological problems related to social isolation. Specifically, the efficacy of two web-based interventions aimed at lowering stress in cancer patients will be tested and compared. <b>Methods:</b> One hundred and fifty participants (75 per group) will be enrolled in a two-group randomized trial. The two interventions will be composed either by exercises on relaxation and meditation practices, presented in both automated online content and interactive group sessions or by fixed psychoeducational online content. Stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, distress, resilience, and perceived social isolation will be measured before the start of the interventions (T0), 2 weeks (T1), 4 weeks (T2), and 2 months (T3) after the beginning of the interventions in both groups. A repeated measures ANOVA will be performed to test differences in the questionnaires' scores between groups across the four-time points. <b>Expected Results:</b> We hypothesized greater improvement in the specific domain of stress symptoms (IES-R) assessed in the group receiving the interactive intervention, compared to the group which will receive only fully automated psychoeducational content. Secondarily, we expect the same trend of improvement across all the psychological variables in the blended intervention group. <b>Conclusions:</b> Implementing these practices on people who are forced into mandatory social isolation may help them become more aware of their mind-body condition and reduce negative effects. Moreover, relaxation techniques help individuals in achieving a greater state of well-being, increasing the ability to cope with stressful situations (resilience), and strengthening the immune system.","Marzorati, Pizzoli, Grasso, Pravettoni","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.710861","20211101","acceptance therapy; cancer; relaxation; remote training; social isolation; stress management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19775,""
"A Longitudinal Study of Gambling Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Sweden","This study aimed to investigate changes in gambling behaviors during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. Participants who had gambled within the past year were recruited from social media and the Swedish National Helpline (<i>n</i> = 325, mean age 39.8 years, 64.8% males, 31.3% with problem gambling) and completed an online survey measuring gambling behaviors, consequences of the pandemic in general and worries related to the pandemic. A sub-sample (<i>n</i> = 139) completed a follow-up survey, during the second wave.

"A 6-Month Follow-Up Study on Worry and Its Impact on Well-Being During the First Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic in an Italian Sample","The Italian state adopted serious safety measures to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in the year 2020. The lockdown was associated with negative psychological consequences in healthy populations, mostly in terms of anxiety, distress, depression, and even traumatic symptoms. This longitudinal study aimed at briefly documenting the psychological impact among an Italian sample, in terms of worry and its impact on psychological well-being levels, of the first wave of COVID-19, taking into account the changes in the lockdown scenario. A three-time follow-up survey was administered to 177 subjects (<i>Female</i>: 78%, <i>M</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> = 36.33), during (T0), at the end (T1), and 3 months after the end of the first lockdown (T2). Since the first wave of COVID-19, results showed a decrease in worry and the perception of virus diffusion's controllability over time while psychological well-being increased. Furthermore, factors such as personality traits (neuroticism and agreeableness) and dysfunctional coping strategies predicted increases in worry levels at the end of the lockdown and 3 months after in the Italian context. However, worry levels during and at the end of the lockdown did not predict well-being levels 3 months after the end of the lockdown. Based on these findings, mental health policymakers should design tailored interventions able to improve the perception of virus diffusion management, as well as address the psychological needs of Italian citizens and support it, including a plan for the follow-up evaluation.","Ongaro, Cincidda, Sebri, Savioni, Triberti, Ferrucci, Poletti, Dell'Osso, Pravettoni","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.703214","20211101","COVID-19; longitudinal study; personality traits; psychological well-being; worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19777,""
"Identification Performance During Quarantine by COVID-19 Pandemic: Influence of Emotional Variables and Sleep Quality","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions in people's lives around the globe. Sleep habits and emotional balance have been disturbed in a way that could be comparable to the havoc caused by a deep personal crisis or a traumatic experience. This unfortunate situation provides a unique context in which to study the impact of these imbalances on cognitive processes. In particular, the field of eyewitness science could benefit from these conditions, since they are also often present in crime victims, but can only be generated in the laboratory up to a certain ethical and practical limit. For several decades, eyewitness studies have tried to discover what variables affect people's ability to properly recognize faces. However, the disparity of experimental designs and the limitations of laboratory work could be contributing to the lack of consensus around several factors, such as sleep, anxiety, and depression. Therefore, the possibility of observing the influence of these agents in natural contexts could shed light on this discussion. Here, we perform simple and repeated lineups with witnesses of mock-crime, considering the conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which to some extent allow emulating the deterioration in general well-being that often afflicts crime victims. For this, 72 participants completed symptomatology scales, and watched a video portraying a staged violent episode. Subsequently, they gave testimony and participated in two lineups, in which we manipulated the presence/absence of the perpetrator, to recreate critical scenarios for the appearance of false recognitions. We found an increase in recognition errors in those individuals who did not have access to the perpetrator during the Initial lineup. Additionally, the conditions of the pandemic appear to have adversely affected the ability to witness and accurately perform lineups. These results reaffirm the need to move toward the standardization of research practices and methods for assessing testimonial evidence, especially in relation to the results of the lineups. Considering the degree of fallibility of these processes can lead to a reduction of wrongful convictions.","Urreta BenÃƒÂ­tez, Leon, Bonilla, Flores-Kanter, Forcato","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.691583","20211101","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; episodic memory; lineup; recognition; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19778,""
"Psychological Adjustment, Quality of Life and Well-Being in a German and Portuguese Adult Population During COVID-19 Pandemics Crisis","<b>Introduction:</b> The pandemics crisis had consequences in psychological adjustment of persons all over the world. The current study analyzes comparatively the topics of quality of life, and well-being, considering as predictors trait anxiety, feeling of threat, difficulty to relax, empathy and pro-social attitude, health care, sleep quality and optimism, in a population of German and Portuguese adults during the pandemics, in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the psychological reactions to crisis across countries and cultures. <b>Methods:</b> A sample of 470 adults divided in three age groups - -young adults (18-34 years), middle-age adults (34-54 years) and old adults (55 years and older)- completed a self-report questionnaire assessing socio-demographic data, quality of life, well-being, quality of sleep, trait anxiety, Coronavirus threat, optimism regarding the pandemics, difficulty to relax, empathy, and pro-social attitude during the pandemics period. <b>Results:</b> Portuguese participants expresses higher empathy and pro-social attitude and health care but in Germany people have higher quality of sleep. Young adults (a) rated their quality of life lower than middle-age adults and old adults, (b) showed also lower optimism than middle-age and old adults, and (c) showed lower well-being than middle-age,. <b>Conclusions:</b> Young adults rated their quality of life, optimism and well-being during pandemics lower than middle-age and old adults, and experienced higher levels of trait anxiety and difficulty to relax. It seems that young adults show a lower psychological adjustment than other age groups during COVID-19 crisis. It is concluded that quality of life, optimism, and well-being during the pandemics are affected differently according to country and group of age, suggesting individual differences across cultures and ages, and consequently the need of specific interventions to cope with the psychological reactions to pandemics crisis.","Candeias, Galindo, Stueck, Portelada, Knietzsch","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.674660","20211101","COVID-19; Mental health; individual differences COVID-19; mental health; optimism; quality of life; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19779,""
"Which Social, Economic, and Health Sector Strategies Will Deliver the Greatest Impacts for Youth Mental Health and Suicide Prevention? Protocol for an Advanced, Systems Modelling Approach","<b>Background:</b> Current global challenges are generating extensive social disruption and uncertainty that have the potential to undermine the mental health, wellbeing, and futures of young people. The scale and complexity of challenges call for engagement with systems science-based decision analytic tools that can capture the dynamics and interrelationships between physical, social, economic, and health systems, and support effective national and regional responses. At the outset of the pandemic mental health-related systems models were developed for the Australian context, however, the extent to which findings are generalisable across diverse regions remains unknown. This study aims to explore the context dependency of systems modelling insights. <b>Methods:</b> This study will employ a comparative case study design, applying participatory system dynamics modelling across eight diverse regions of Australia to answer three primary research questions: (i) Will current regional differences in key youth mental health outcomes be exacerbated in forward projections due to the social and economic impacts of COVID-19?; (ii) What combination of social policies and health system strengthening initiatives will deliver the greatest impacts within each region?; (iii) To what extent are optimal strategic responses consistent across the diverse regions? We provide a detailed technical blueprint as a potential springboard for more timely construction and deployment of systems models in international contexts to facilitate a broader examination of the question of generalisability and inform investments in the mental health and wellbeing of young people in the post COVID-19 recovery. <b>Discussion:</b> Computer simulation is known as the third pillar of science (after theory and experiment). Simulation allows researchers and decision makers to move beyond what can be manipulated within the scale, time, and ethical limits of the experimental approach. Such learning when achieved collectively, has the potential to enhance regional self-determination, help move beyond incremental adjustments to the status quo, and catalyze transformational change. This research seeks to advance efforts to establish regional decision support infrastructure and empower communities to effectively respond. In addition, this research seeks to move towards an understanding of the extent to which systems modelling insights may be relevant to the global mental health response by encouraging researchers to use, challenge, and advance the existing work for scientific and societal progress.","Occhipinti, Skinner, Freebairn, Song, Ho, Lawson, Lee, Hickie","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.759343","20211101","decision analysis; mental health; simulation; strategic planning; suicide prevention; systems modelling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19780,""
"Prevalence of and Factors Associated With Depressive Symptoms Among College Students in Wuhan, China During the Normalization Stage of COVID-19 Prevention and Control","<b>Objectives:</b> The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic has led to persistent negative psychological effects on the general public, especially on college students, who are highly susceptible to psychological difficulties, such as fear, anxiety, and depression. Little information is known about depressive symptoms among college students during the normalization stage of COVID-19 prevention and control in China. This study aimed to understand the prevalence of and factors associated with depressive symptoms after a long quarantine time and online learning at home among college students in Wuhan, China. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> A web-based survey was conducted from July to August 2020 during the Chinese summer holiday to collect data on sociodemographic variables, depressive symptoms, and their potential associated factors using an electronic questionnaire among college students in Wuhan, China. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to measure depressive symptoms. Binary logistic regression was used to explore the factors associated with depressive symptoms. <b>Results:</b> A total of 9,383 college students were included in the analysis. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 15.8% (1,486/9,383) among college students. The binary logistic regression showed that the experience of being quarantined for observation or treatment, family members or friends dying of COVID-19, rarely or never seeking help from others, fewer supportive relatives or friends, less support from family in the past month, a worse relationship with parents at home, a longer time spent daily on electronic devices except for online learning, and feeling anxious in the face of returning to school were independently associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms. Academic stress and concern about the epidemic were the main reasons for their anxiety. <b>Conclusions:</b> Targeted psychological intervention measures are recommended for college students to improve their mental health during the normalization stage of COVID-19 prevention and control.","Yu, Yang, Wu, Ge, Tang, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.742950","20211101","COVID-19; associated factor; college students; depressive symptoms; normalization stage; prevention and control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19781,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown in Malaysia: An Examination of the Psychological Well-Being of Parent-Child Dyads and Child Behavior in Families With Children on the Autism Spectrum","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns have adversely impacted children on the autism spectrum and their families, especially in Malaysia where this population is often marginalized. The current quantitative research aimed to investigate the impact of the Malaysian COVID-19 lockdown on the behavior and psychological distress of children formally diagnosed with an autism spectrum condition (ASC) as well as the psychological distress and well-being of their parents, in comparison with a typically developing (TD) control group. <b>Methods:</b> The children's ages ranged between 5 and 17 years. The sample included 72 ASC parent-child dyads and 62 TD parent-child dyads. The primary caregiver completed an online survey including the following: demographic and diagnostic information; ASC symptoms; children's inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, perceived stress, depression, and anxiety; parents' perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and well-being based on their experience pre- and mid-lockdown (March 18th to June 9th 2020) in Malaysia. <b>Results:</b> Among the ASC group, no significant pre- and mid-lockdown change was found in ASC symptoms (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). There were no significant gender differences (boys/girls) in all the child scales. The 2 [diagnosis (ASC, TD)] Ãƒâ€” 2 [lockdown (pre-lockdown, mid-lockdown)] mixed-model ANOVAs revealed main effects of lockdown on children's attention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, anxiety, and parents' perceived stress, depression, and psychological well-being (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.005). There was a main effect of diagnosis in all child and parent variables, except parents' perceived stress (<i>p</i> &gt;0.005). However, there was no significant interaction effect between diagnosis and lockdown (<i>p</i> &gt;0.005). All child behavior (inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity) and child psychological distress (anxiety, depression, and perceived stress) were significantly correlated in both the ASC and TD groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.005). On the other hand, only some of the parent variables were significantly correlated with child variables (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0045) in the ASC group while none of the parent variables were significantly correlated with the child variables (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.005) in the TD group. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results provide preliminary evidence indicating negative effects of the Malaysian lockdown on both children on the autism spectrum and TD children, as well as their parents.

"Psychological Status of High School Students 1 Year After the COVID-19 Emergency","<b>Background:</b> With the control of the epidemic, adolescents' mental outlook might have improved. However, little evidence existed with regard to the psychological status of adolescents in post-COVID-19 era. This present study aimed to explore the psychological status of high school students after the epidemic getting eased. <b>Methods:</b> A web-based cross-sectional survey was used to obtain data from three high schools, including the demographic information, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), the Self-Rating Scale of Sleep (SRSS), and self-designed general recent-status questionnaire. Correlation analysis was performed to explore potential associations between the depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and sleep status. The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 differences between nowadays data and the data enrolled 12 months before were also compared. <b>Result:</b> A total of 1,108 qualified questionnaires were obtained. The prevalence of depressive and anxious symptoms was 27.5 and 21.3%, respectively, from mild to severe in all students, while 11.8% of these high students got sleep disturbances. Both the rate and the severity of depression, anxiety and sleep problems of female students were higher than male students. Grade three students suffered higher prevalence and severer mental disturbances than the other two grades. There were significant correlations between the depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and sleep status. The psychological status has been improved in nowadays high school students compared with the sample enrolled 12 months before. <b>Conclusion:</b> As a supplement to our former study, this present research provided a perspective on the psychological status of high school students 1 year after the COVID-19 pandemic being well controlled. We should pay attention to the psychological status of high school students, and should also notice the progresses made by this special group after the epidemic.","Zhou, Li, Yang, Duan, Yang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.729930","20211101","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; high school students; mental health; psychological status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19783,""
"COVID-19 pandemic in India: through psycho-social lens","COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented crisis that simultaneously affected different countries and communities across the globe. The large-scale psychosocial impact of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, is an experiential reality for many, in India. Despite this impact, a closer look at India's response to the pandemic shows that the two strands of health and relief measures, continue to occupy centre-stage. The psycho-social aspects of the pandemic unfortunately largely remain undocumented and unaddressed. Using experiences of iCALL, National national level psycho-socialÃ‚Â counseling counselling service and a field action project of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, the paper throws light on the much-neglected experiential psycho-social dimensions of COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown in India. It describes the stressors experienced by users who approached iCALL and the consequent impact;Ã‚Â especially among those who belonged to the vulnerable sections of the society. The nature of stressors as well as the impact reported by iCALL users, clearly points out to a complex interplay among several factors at individual, interpersonal, community and structural levels. The paper then, critically looks at the merits and limitations of the mental health framework that predominated the mental health response during the pandemic with its bio-medical and individualistic undertones; and suggests an alternative framing using a 'psycho-social' paradigm that views distress as an interaction between the psychological and social worlds. The paper asserts reciprocal linkages between development and psycho-social distress;Ã‚Â highlighting the need to consciously integrate mental health issues into the development response. In the end, it makes an appeal for an inter sectoralÃ‚Â dialogue, integrated response and advocacy for investing in mental health and psycho-social infrastructure to effectively respond to the pandemic.","Joshi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40847-020-00136-8","20211101","COVID-19; India; Pandemic; Psychosocial","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19784,""
"Resiliency of on-demand multimodal transit systems during a pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the collapse of the public transit ridership led to significant budget deficits due to dramatic decreases in fare revenues. Additionally, public transit agencies are facing challenges of reduced vehicle capacity due to social distancing requirements, additional costs of cleaning and protective equipment, and increased downtime for vehicle cleaning. Due to these constraints on resources and budgets, many transit agencies have adopted essential service plans with reduced service hours, number of routes, or frequencies. This paper studies the resiliency during a pandemic of On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems (ODMTS), a new generation of transit systems that combine a network of high-frequency trains and buses with on-demand shuttles to serve the first and last miles and act as feeders to the fixed network. It presents a case study for the city of Atlanta and evaluates ODMTS for multiple scenarios of depressed demand and social distancing representing various stages of the pandemic. The case study relies on an optimization pipeline that provides an end-to-end ODMTS solution by bringing together methods for demand estimation, network design, fleet sizing, and real-time dispatching. These methods are adapted to work in a multimodal setting and to satisfy practical constraints. In particular, a limit is imposed on the number of passenger transfers, and a new network design model is introduced to avoid the computational burden stemming from this constraint. Real data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) is used to conduct the case study, and the results are evaluated with a high-fidelity simulation. The case study demonstrates how ODMTS provide a resilient solution in terms of cost, convenience, and accessibility for this wide range of scenarios.","Auad, Dalmeijer, Riley, Santanam, Trasatti, Van Hentenryck, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2021.103418","20211101","COVID-19; Multimodal transit systems; On-demand shuttles; Public transit","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19785,""
"The Influence of Covid-19 on Perceived Health Effects of Wetland Parks in China","Wetland parks are designed to support urban ecological protection, flood control and human well-being. Existing research mainly focuses on their influence on ecology and economy. However, their influence on human well-being and health is rarely studied. In China, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (Peak), people were very concerned about health, while at the same time wetland parks which are generally considered beneficial to health were closed. Thus, this study explores the public's perception of the health effects of visiting wetland parks and the impact of the pandemic on the perception. From March 5th to 8th, 2020, before the Peak in China was over, 1,400 respondents participated in a nationwide online survey. It was found that the perceived benefits from visiting wetland parks were higher in terms of mental health than in physical health. Also, the perceived health benefits of wetland parks after the Peak were slightly higher than before the pandemic. The results highlight that wildlife habitat services were considered to be the most important ecosystem services that promote the perceived health benefits. Interestingly, the perceived health benefits of wetland parks by health experts appear to be lower than in other groups, indicating that the health benefits of visiting wetland parks may be overestimated by lay-people or underestimated by health experts. The results provide empirical evidence for managing ecosystem services as delivered by these urban wetlands, in the context of COVID-19 or potential future pandemics, for promoting public health.","Zhai, Lange","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13157-021-01505-7","20211101","COVID-19; Ecosystem services; Health; Perception; Wetland park","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19786,""

"The effects of rumination on internalising symptoms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic among mothers and their offspring: a brief report","As a result of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, anxiety and depressive symptoms have risen among children and adults. However, it remains unclear why the effects of the pandemic are so salient for certain individuals. This study examined rumination, a well-established risk factor for internalising disorders, as a predictor of prospective increases in anxiety and depression symptoms in mothers and their offspring. Change in rumination during the pandemic was also examined as a predictor of symptom transmission at the dyadic level. Fifty-three biological mother-child dyads were recruited from two longitudinal studies that had completed their respective baselines prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mothers and youth (ages 9-15 years, 77.4% female) completed measures of depression and anxiety symptoms and rumination before and during the pandemic. Results revealed baseline rumination was positively associated with internalising symptom changes for mothers, but not youth. Moreover, pre-to-peri pandemic changes in rumination were associated with prospective increases in mother and youth internalising symptoms. Finally, results revealed a significant correlation for pre-to-peri pandemic depressive symptom change among mothers and youth; however, rumination did not mediate this association. Findings highlight changes in rumination as a potential mechanism for internalising symptom risk during the COVID-19 pandemic across development.","Duttweiler, Sheena, Burkhouse, Feurer","https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2021.1995330","20211101","COVID-19; Rumination; anxiety; depression; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19788,""
"Stay home and stay active? The impact of stay-at-home restrictions on physical activity routines in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic","We investigated which population groups were impacted most in terms of physical activity levels during the restrictions applied during the COVID-19 pandemic. We surveyed UK residents, sampled through users of a rewards-for-exercise app (Sweatcoin; n =Ã‚Â 749) and an online panel (Prolific; n =Ã‚Â 907). Of the app users, n =Ã‚Â 487 further provided daily step-count data collected by the app, prior to, and during the periods of restrictions in the UK between March-June 2020. Regression models were used to investigate factors associated with self-reported change in physical activity and change in daily step-count during the periods of restrictions. Significant factors associated with self-reported change in physical activity included rural residents (positive, b =Ã‚Â 0.87, p &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), relative to urban dwellers, people classed as obese (negative, b =Ã‚Â -0.51, p =Ã‚Â 0.008, relative to healthy weight) and gym users (negative, b =Ã‚Â -1.10, p &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001, relative to walkers). All groups had reduced step counts during restrictions, with Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups showing greater reductions compared to White British ethnicity (negative, b =Ã‚Â -0.18, p =Ã‚Â 0.008). Targeted interventions are required to ensure that physical and mental health impacts of sedentary behaviour are not exacerbated over the long-term by significant reductions in physical activity identified in these groups particularly those who are also more vulnerable to COVID-19.","Eshelby, Sogut, Jolly, Vlaev, Elliott","https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2021.1992885","20211101","COVID-19; exercise habits; physical activity; restrictions; step-count","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19789,""
"Mental health risk among children during COVID-19 lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic has created a hugely detrimental impact on the psychological health of people around the world. Children are extremely vulnerable; therefore, it is of utmost importance to discuss the prevalence of the symptoms, their associated risk factors, and the strategies to identify and understand their deteriorating mental health (MH) before it leads to disastrous outcomes. Hence, parents and schools should come together in devising modes to create an environment in which children can easily tackle the lockdown periods which have become the new reality.

"Longitudinal change in depressive symptoms among healthcare professionals with and without COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy from October 2020 to June 2021 in Japan","This study aimed to compare the longitudinal change in depressive symptoms among healthcare professionals in Japan who are willing to receive novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination and those who are unwilling to receive COVID-19 vaccination. The baseline survey was conducted in October 2020 (Survey time 1: T1); respondents in T1 were invited to participate in May 2021 (Survey time 2: T2). Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Group comparisons of the estimated mean of PHQ-9 score at T1 and T2 were estimated by the analysis of covariance. In T1, 597 participants (response rate: 4.4%) completed all questions. In T2, 211 participants (follow up rate: 35.3%) completed all questions. The group and time interaction effect was significant (F(1, 207)=3.9, p=0.049); depressive symptoms were worse among healthcare professionals who were unwilling to receive vaccination than among those who were willing to receive vaccination. This study showed that depressive symptoms were worse among healthcare professionals who were unwilling to receive COVID-19 vaccination than those who are willing to receive COVID-19 vaccination. This suggests that it is important to take care of healthcare professionals who are unwilling to receive vaccination to prevent mental health deterioration.","Asaoka, Koido, Kawashima, Ikeda, Miyamoto, Nishi","https://doi.org/10.2486/indhealth.2021-0164","20211101","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Healthcare professionals; Vaccination; Vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19791,""
"[Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on pharmacology education in the universities and colleges in Japan: nationwide emergency survey jointly conducted by the Physiological Society of Japan and the Japanese Pharmacological Society]","With the spread of new coronavirus infections (COVID-19), universities/colleges have transformed their educational format from conventional group education to distance learning. In order to share information on the new educational format among the members of the society, the Physiological Society of Japan and the Japanese Pharmacological Society (JPS) jointly conducted the ""Emergency Joint Survey on Responses of Universities to COVID-19 and Its Impact on Physiology and Pharmacology Education"". The JPS surveyed pharmacology departments/divisions at schools of pharmacy, medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine in 202 universities (response rate 89%) from August to September 2020. 85% of the universities changed the lecture method, and 70% changed the practical training. 30%, 30%, and 40% of the lectures were live, on-demand, and mixed (combination of live and on-demand) lectures, respectively. 25% of the practical training was live or a combination of live and on-demand lectures, and 45% was on-demand delivery. There are many problems to do online methods such as stable network environment, lack of the reality for students and difficulty of the check of their understanding. On the other hand, there are unexpected benefits in online methods such as anytime learning, an increase in questions from students and repeatable learning. More than 60% considered employing the newly introduced educational styles even after the pandemic. Students' mental health problems and disruption of daily rhythms, quality assurance of online education, and copyright issues were also concerned.

"Impact of COVID-19 online classes on morningness-eveningness personality among adult college students: A survey study","COVID-19 emerged as a serious pandemic in 2019 and billions of people were infected. Various precautionary methods were taken to contain the spread of virus such as social distancing, public lockdown, sanitation, and closure of schools and colleges. Many colleges started online classes to resume their syllabus and to complete the course curriculum. These evening online sessions resulted in late night sleep, long term mobile/computer exposure, and disturbed sleep pattern. The present study aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 online classes on morningness- eveningness personality and to compare it with different age groups, gender, and body mass index. The cluster sampling method was used to collect the subjects from the total of 1153 adult college students, 897 subjects were selected based on the selection criteria and instructed to submit an online survey consists of the Morningness-eveningness Questionnaire and demographic and anthropometric data through mail, social media, or through a researcher by direct interview. The mean score for the 897 participants is 56.7, indicating Intermediate morningness-eveningness personality type. On comparing the different groups, the youngest group (18-20 years) scored 4.23%(meanÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 46.7), female subjects scored 6.13%(meanÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 58.1), the underweight 2.67%(meanÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 59.2) and overweight groups scored 2.89%(meanÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 59.7) indicating definite eveningness. Among the 897 collected samples of the population 8.13%of the subjects experienced definite eveningness, 14.93%has moderate eveningness, 17.38%are under intermediate category, 22.4%have moderate morningness, and 37.11%have definite morningness. Subjects with eveningness personality have high risk of developing mental illness, thus it's important to determine the eveningness personality among student population to avoid serious complications in later age.","Srinivasan, Vishnuram, Suganthirababu, Kumaresan, Divyalaxmi, Saranya Devi, Alagesan","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-210528","20211101","Pandemic; circardian rhythm; mental health; sleep-wake transition disorders; student health services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19793,""
"Dependence of emotional burnout on personality typology in the COVID-19 pandemic","Under the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, the problem of emotional burnout syndrome among nurses working under extremely stressful conditions has become particularly acute. It is therefore necessary to examine the characteristics of emotional burnout syndrome in nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic to develop effective measures to prevent and enhance their mental health. The study aimed to establish the features of emotional burnout syndrome and its connection with typological characteristics of the personality in nurses working with COVID-19 patients. A total of 120 female nurses who worked with COVID-19 patients were surveyed, of whom 60 (50.0%) worked in outpatient settings along with general practitioners and 60 (50.0%) worked in the intensive care unit. The average age of the participants was 40.86Ã‚Â±3.20 years, and the average length of medical service was 13.64Ã‚Â±1.73 years. A burnout syndrome of varying severity was present in 50.0%of outpatient nurses and 73.3%of intensive care nurses (ORÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 2.44, 95%CI [1.16-5.16]; pÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt; Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.05).

"A comparison of coupled microeconomic and mental health devastating alterations between low-income and affluent countries afflicted with COVID-19","The exponential increase in the rate of individuals' affliction by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has put extreme strains on health care systems worldwide and has sparked fears of an impending economic recession and mental turmoil. The review discusses the impact of COVID-19 on medical crises in two sections, focusing on the evidence presented from both neuropathological and epidemiological perspectives. First, this paper outlines how countries have implemented containment and appraises its effect on the microeconomy. Second, it highlights how government support for the economic crisis caused by COVID-19 depends on the size of a country's economy. Third, it attempts to explain how COVID-19 has affected business by explicitly evaluating each industry divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors. Finally, we assert an extended discussion on the challenges and post-pandemic outlook. Peer-reviewed studies from inception until 2021 were searched in the Google scholar, PubMed, and Scopus databases. Through the imposition of restrictions and lockdown measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic spread, besides arising a broad array of mental health concerns, a drastic drop in liquidity and significant spillover effect across almost all the global economic system has ensued. The COVID-19 implication on socioeconomic issues and mental wellbeing, as the most devastating sequelae of the current pandemic, is of great importance to curb the infection and deprive post-pandemic sequelae, demanding prompt actions.","Chu","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-210191","20211101","COVID-19; coronavirus; economic crisis; economic sectors; mental health; psychosocial distress; socioeconomic impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19795,""
"Employee well-being in the COVID-19 pandemic: The moderating role of teleworking during the first lockdown in the province of Quebec, Canada","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on all aspects of society, including mental health. Many employees have had to pivot suddenly to teleworking to prevent the virus from spreading. While teleworking may have some negative consequences, it may also represent a human resources practice that may improve employee well-being. The study main objective was to determine if teleworking played a moderating role in the relation between potential stressors and employee well-being during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic when working from home. This was based on the theory of conservation of resources. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted with Stata 13 software to determine the contribution of potential stressors on employee well-being, as well as the moderating role of teleworking on a sample of 480 Canadian employees. Data were collected once for white and blue collar from both public (67.08%) and private (32.92%) business sectors. Results indicated that work-life imbalances, workload, and marital tension were associated with lower levels of well-being. On the other hand, teleworking and household income were associated with higher levels of well-being. Teleworking also moderated the differences in well-being between the public and private sectors. Teleworking in the public sector seems to increase employee well-being. Conversely, working on-site in the public sector seems to decrease well-being. Employers need to proactively address work-life imbalances, workloads, and teleworking to maintain employee well-being. Specific recommendations are offered to ensure that teleworking remains positive for employee well-being both during a pandemic and afterward.","Parent-Lamarche, Boulet","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-205311","20211101","COVID-19; business sector; conservation of resources theory; teleworkers; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19796,""
"Perinatal Mental Health Support and Early Childhood Home Visitation During COVID-19","COVID-19 has disrupted many of the preventive service sectors designed to serve mothers at-risk for developing postpartum depression, forcing a rapid transition to telehealth-based modes of delivery. The purpose of this study was to explore differences in early childhood home visitation service provision (enrollment and depression screening) among mothers receiving home visitation services prior to and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional factors related to receipt of virtual home visitation services, family risk factors, and the maternal depressive symptoms were examined. Linear and logistic regression were utilized to examine whether there were differences in family risk factors, the percentage of mothers being screened for depression and maternal depressive symptoms, and associations between risk factors and positive depression screenings, while accounting for clustering by site. Samples compared outcomes for families enrolled during the pre-pandemic period (defined as March 16th to July 27th, 2019, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4,743) and the post-pandemic period (defined as March 16th to July 27th, 2020, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2,049). Families enrolled after the onset of the pandemic were significantly less likely to be impacted by housing instability, have a child with a disability, or be involved with the military, but more likely to have a history of child abuse or neglect. Fewer mothers were screened for depression during the pandemic and maternal report of depressive symptoms decreased. Virtual home visitation is currently attracting some groups of mothers who are experiencing fewer stressors, which may place them at decreased risk for exhibiting depressive symptoms. There may be aspects of the virtual depression screening experience that make detection more difficult. As a result, many mothers at risk for maternal depression may not receive adequate prevention services.","Traube, Molina, YingWangKay, Kemner","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11121-021-01313-9","20211031","Home visitation; Postpartum depression; Screening; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19797,""

"COVID-19 Pandemic: Mental Health in Girls With and Without Fragile X Syndrome","Children and adolescents, who have less developed coping skills, are affected by natural disasters and other traumatic events differently than adults. Emotional and behavioral effects are particularly pronounced during a pandemic-related disaster, when support networks that typically promote healthy coping, such as friends, teachers, and family members, may be less available. Children and adolescents with fragile X syndrome (FXS), who are at increased risk for developing anxiety and depression, may be particularly vulnerable to behavioral or emotional difficulties during a pandemic. This study examined the mental health outcomes of school-aged girls with FXS during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated stay-at-home orders. Participants included 47 school-aged girls with FXS and 33 age- and developmentally matched comparison girls. Associations between COVID-19 behavioral and emotional outcomes and prior academic, adaptive, behavioral, and emotional functioning as well as prior maternal mental health and characteristics of the mother-child relationship were examined. Qualitative data from the parental report of emotional and behavioral responses to the pandemic were also obtained. Results indicate that school-aged girls with FXS demonstrate a distinct profile of COVID-19 related associations compared to the comparison group, such that pandemic-related worries and emotional impact of pandemic restrictions were predicted by prior mental health factors for the comparison group but by prior social, behavioral, and relational factors for the FXS group.

"Shame and COVID-19 Pandemic","Optimal psychic response during the COVID-19 pandemic is the result of many different factors. One of the main factors is the psychodynamic understanding of essential emotions such as shame. Despite the immense effort by health workers to address stress- and trauma-related disorders in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large proportion of the people affected by the disorder do not have information regarding the emotion of shame. Lack of mentalizing capacity implies disturbed shame dynamics. The therapeutic relationship and optimal alliance offer the frame for acceptance of shame as useful for psychological growth. Empathy should be a cure for dysfunctional shame, at the individual or social level.

It is not yet fully known which symptoms of the disease are most commonly presented in patients referred for pulmonary rehabilitation. Our aim was to investigate the profile of patients referred for pulmonary rehabilitation; what symptoms they had during the acute phase of the disease and what symptoms were still present at the start of pulmonary rehabilitation. Study included ongoing symptomatic and post-COVID patients who attended standard, in person pulmonary rehabilitation program. Patients had COVID-19 disease at least four weeks before attending pulmonary rehabilitation. Patients completed questionnaires of self-reported somatic deficits during acute and post-COVID-19 stage as well as questionnaires regarding their psychological symptoms. Pulmonary function test, expiratory and inspiratory muscle strenght, hand grip strenght and six-minute walk test was performed prior and after pulmonary rehabilitation. Study included 63 patients (32 male, 31 female), with mean age of 52.9 years. During acute COVID-19, majority of patients complained of fatigue, cough, dyspnea, myalgia and headache. More than 85% of patients reported pulmonary deficits during ongoing symptomatic and post-COVID-19 stage. Emotional distress and anxiety levels were significantly elevated in acute stage, while depression, anger and the need for help was not significantly elevated. All reported symptoms were significantly reduced in post-COVID-19 stage. There was statistically significant difference in six-minute walk distance, inspiratory and expiratory muscle strenght and hand grip strenght between first and final testing. Results of our study are similar with previous studies, the most common symptoms during acute phase were fatigue, cough and dyspnea and fatigue and respiratory problems during ongoing symptomatic and post-COVID stage. Emotional distress diminishes signifiacantly in post-COVID stage.

"Metabolic Syndrome, Morbidity and Mortlity - in the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic","The prevalence of obesity, diabetes, arterial hypertension and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases is increasing worldwide. Nowdays we are witnessing a pandemic of metabolic syndrome and obesity and an epidemic of these diseases in Croatia as well. Moreover, every second Croatian citizen dies because of cardiovascular diseases. Visceral obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia and arterial hypertension tend to cluster forming a syndrome that we call metabolic syndrome. The concept of metabolic syndrome was defined several decades ago as visceral type of obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-cholesterol, arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus (insulin resistance). Most widely used definition is the one by National Education Cholesterol Program, NCEP - Adult treatment Panel III - ATP III . Therefore, visceral obesity is considered as one of the greatest risks for mortality worldwide. COVID pandemia increased the risk od deaths especially among patients with metabolic syndrome. Pandemia perpetuated several other socio-economical risk factors (stress, depression, physical inactivity, deviant behaviour...) which also strongly influence cardiovascular health. Unfortunately, SARS-COV-2 virus enters the host (human) cell using signaling pathways (ANG II Rc) known very well from the metabolic syndrome research and connecting those two entities predesponing these patients for a much worse prognosis when infected with SARS-COV-2 virus.

"Reviewing the availability, efficacy and clinical utility of Telepsychology in dialectical behavior therapy (Tele-DBT)","Telepsychology is increasingly being implemented in mental health care. We conducted a scoping review on the best available research evidence regarding availability, efficacy and clinical utility of telepsychology in DBT. The review was performed using PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Our aim was to help DBT-therapists make empirically supported decisions about the use of telepsychology during and after the current pandemic and to anticipate the changing digital needs of patients and clinicians. A search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, PsycARTICLES and Web of Science. Search terms for telepsychology were included and combined with search terms that relate to DBT. Our search and selection procedures resulted in 41 articles containing information on phone consultation, smartphone applications, internet delivered skills training, videoconferencing, virtual reality and computer- or video-assisted interventions in DBT. The majority of research about telepsychology in DBT has focused on the treatment mode of between-session contact. However, more trials using sophisticated empirical methodologies are needed. Quantitative data on the efficacy and utility of online and blended alternatives to standard (i.e. face-to-face) individual therapy, skills training and therapist consultation team were scarce. The studies that we found were designed to evaluate feasibility and usability. A permanent shift to videoconferencing or online training is therefore not warranted as long as face-to-face is an option. In all, there is an urgent need to compare standard DBT to online or blended DBT. Smartphone apps and virtual reality (VR) are experienced as an acceptable facilitator in access and implantation of DBT skills. In addition, we have to move forward on telepsychology applications by consulting our patients, younger peers and experts in adjacent fields if we want DBT to remain effective and relevant in the digital age.","van Leeuwen, Sinnaeve, Witteveen, Van Daele, Ossewaarde, Egger, van den Bosch","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40479-021-00165-7","20211031","COVID-19; Dialectical behavior therapy; Phone consultation; Telehealth; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19804,""
"Strategies to evaluate outcomes in long-COVID-19 and post-COVID survivors","SARS-CoV-2 infection can impact the physical, cognitive, mental health of patients, especially in those recovered in intensive care units. Moreover, it was proved that the effects of the virus may persist for weeks or months. The term long-COVID or post-COVID syndrome is commonly used for indicating a variety of physical and psychological symptoms that continue after the resolution of the acute phase. This narrative review is aimed at providing an updated overview of the impact of physical, cognitive, and psychological health disorders in COVID-19 survivors, by summarizing the data already published in literature in the last year. Studies cited were found through PubMed searches. We also presented an overview of the post-COVID-19 health consequences on three important aspects: nutritional status, neurological disorders, and physical health. Moreover, to activate a correct health planning policy, a multidisciplinary approach for addressing the post- COVID-19 issue, has been proposed. Finally, the involvement of health professionals is necessary even after the pandemic, to reduce expected post-pandemic psychosocial responses and mental health disorders.","Crispo, Bimonte, Porciello, Forte, Cuomo, Montagnese, Prete, Grimaldi, Celentano, Amore, de Blasio, Pentimalli, Giordano, Botti, Baglio, Sileri, Cascella, Cuomo","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13027-021-00401-3","20211031","COVID-19 pandemic; Intensive care units; Neurocognitive disorders; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19805,""
"Challenges of students and residents of human medicine in the first four months of the fight against the Covid-19 pandemicÃ‚Â - Implications for future waves and scenarios","In the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, medical students and residents are expected to adapt and contribute in a healthcare environment characterized by ever-changing measures and policies. The aim of this narrative review is to provide a summary of the literature that addresses the challenges of students and residents of human medicine in the first 4 months of the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic in order to identify gaps and find implications for improvement within the current situation and for potential future scenarios. We performed a systematic literature search and content analysis (CA) of articles available in English language that address the challenges of students and residents of human medicine in the first 4 months of the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. We retrieved 82 articles from a wide range of journals, professional backgrounds and countries. CA identified five recurring subgroup topics: ""faculty preparation"", Ã‚Â«uncertainties and mental healthÃ‚Â», Ã‚Â«clinical knowledgeÃ‚Â», Ã‚Â«rights and obligationsÃ‚Â» and Ã‚Â«(self-) support and supplyÃ‚Â». Within these subgroups the main concerns of (re-)deployment, interruption of training and career, safety issues, transmission of disease, and restricted social interaction were identified as potential stressors that hold a risk for fatigue, loss of morale and burnout. Students and residents are willing and able to participate in the fight against Covid-19 when provided with appropriate deployment, legal guidance, safety measures, clinical knowledge, thorough supervision, social integration and mental health support. Preceding interviews to decide on reasonable voluntary deployment, the use of new technology and frequent feedback communication with faculties, educators and policymakers can further help with a successful and sustainable integration of students and residents in the fight against the pandemic. It is critical that faculties, educators and policymakers have a thorough understanding of the needs and concerns of medical trainees during pandemic times. Leaders should facilitate close communication with students and residents, value their intrinsic creativeness and regularly evaluate their needs in regards to deployment, knowledge aspects, safety measures, legal concerns and overall well-being.","Wohlfarth, Gloor, Hautz","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02962-8","20211031","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-02","",19806,""
