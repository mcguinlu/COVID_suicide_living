"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the developing nations: emerging mental health challenges and interventions","The world is facing an unprecedented challenge of the 21st century in the form of COVID-19 outbreak. People across the culture, race, ethnicity, socio-economic background are being affected by the rippling effects of this pandemic. The aim of this narrative review is to briefly describe the impact of the pandemic on mental health, the vicious cycle of social issues and psychological health caused and aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic. We also aim to highlight certain interventions to overcome the mental health challenges posed by the pandemic. For this purpose, a thorough search of all databases was done to gather articles relevant to the objective of this narrative review. Keywords were used in combination and separately to identify the articles on the various psychosocial issues caused by the pandemic. Published articles in various databases like Scopus, Web of Science, Pubmed etc., related to psychosocial effects due to COVID-19 were searched and summarized to justify and support the objective of this paper. The coming months will reveal the extent of damage this pandemic has caused to the socio-economic and health sectors across the globe. It is crucial to recognize the psychosocial impact of this pandemic and necessitate the measures to overcome them by mobilizing the resources we have at hand.","Noronha, F.

"PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPLAINTS, TREATMENT COMPLIANCE, AND ONLINE CONSULTATION EXPECTATIONS OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS IN COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A CROSS-SECTIONAL EVALUATION","Background: This study aimed to determine how the psychological complaints of geriatric patients with mental disorders were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and how they continued their treatment during this period. In addition, this work sought to determine the social support resources of these patients and their expectations regarding online consultations. Methods: Telephone interviews were carried out with 776 patients over the age of 65 who had a mental disorder. A sociodemographic data form, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 were employed to evaluate their psychological complaints. Results: A total of 733 patients (94.5%) were unable to go to outpatient visits, although 607 (78.2%) patients used their medications regularly. The most important factor contributing to continue drug treatment was the extension of drug reports by the government. There was an increase in psychiatric complaints in 318 (41.0%) patients. Anxiety (23.7%), insomnia (17.0%), and depression (13.3%) were the most common complaints. 72.7% of the patients wanted to have an online consultation with their psychiatrist. Predictors for depression were increased age and female gender. Predictors for anxiety were disease duration of five years or more and irregular medication intake during the pandemic. Conclusion: The high-risk groups in terms of increasing psychiatric complaints must be identified for psychosocial interventions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, government policies on the health system played an important role in ensuring continued treatment for geriatric psychiatric patients. It is also important to be able to conduct online psychiatric consultations during extraordinary situations.","Kaya, H.; Civan Kahve, A.; Eltemiz, M.; Cellat, E.; Goka, E.","https://doi.org/10.31086/tjgeri.2021.247","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Turkish Journal of Geriatrics-Turk Geriatri Dergisi; 24(4):499-509, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25605,""
"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and its threats to humans and animals","SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in November 2019. COVID-19 has caused more than 4 million deaths worldwide. In addition to death, SARS-CoV-2 can cause many negative health consequences in humans. Physical as well as mental health is at stake. The SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are a tool in the fight against the pandemic. Moreover, experimental studies indicate that various species of animals can become infected with the virus. Breeding minks can become infected symptomatically and spread the virus to the environment, thus constituting a virus reservoir. Mink farms positive for SARS-CoV-2 are hazardous and ought to be euthanized.","Kania, B.

"Participation, trust, and risks associated with peer-to-peer accommodation platforms: How did the COVID-19 crisis affect Airbnb Budapest in 2020?","Our research was aimed at exploring the different layers of trust with regard to Airbnb services, as well as the practices of discrimination on the platform. The fieldwork was carried out in the first half of 2020, partly before and partly after the COVID-19 related interventions, which significantly affected life in Budapest from mid-March 2020 onwards. A total of 21 semi-structured interviews were carried out, supplemented with online discourse analysis. Our empirical analysis revealed that most of our interviewees displayed positive attitudes towards Airbnb, but our online discourse analysis showed that there are rather mixed attitudes towards the company. Considering the platform from an employment perspective, certain elements of precarious working conditions were identified. When it comes to different layers of trust, we point out that interper- sonal trust between guests and hosts is crucial, resulting in positive experiences for hosts in many ways. We found social trust in Airbnb to be more ambiguous, as some interviewees claimed to have concerns with regard to its effect on the hous- ing market. Finally, distributed trust on the platform seemed significant, as ratings often serve as a means of predicting guests' trustworthiness. Most of the hosts we interviewed were aware of the fact that discrimination is not tolerated at all by the platform, so it is not surprising that we could hardly iden- tify any cases of overt discrimination;however, latent forms of discrimination and negative attitudes as well as stereotypes that were formed by the hosts in relation to numerous nationalities and minorities were explored in our empirical research.","Simonovits, B.; Zach, B.; Kondorosy, C.","https://doi.org/10.17356/ieejsp.v7i3.790","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Intersections-East European Journal of Society and Politics; 7(3):178-200, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25607,""
"Gaining trust and remaining mentally sane while working from home: The importance of employee wellbeing","The COVID-19 pandemic has hit us hard. It is not only difficult in terms of psychological and medical issues, but it has turned into an economic crisis as well. One of the most significant 'side effects' of the first wave was widespread remote work, which was not regular - many people had to work from home while also taking care of their loved ones (be they children or other family members, or friends). Our research - part of an EU-funded project on sustainable mobility - was carried out in the city of Szeged (Hungary) among seven companies/employers. As the project was strongly affected by the crisis, the research focused on the impact of COVID19 and the lockdown on remote work. How did remote work affect employees' mental, physical, and social wellbeing? How did employers and employees deal with the new situation? What can we learn from this crisis regarding the relationship between remote work and mental health? To find answers to our questions, we used mixed methods, i.e., combined qualitative with quantitative methodology. This case study analyses the related difficulties and challenges from the employee point of view and sheds light on some of the good practices and measures which can be applied by other companies.","Suranyi, R.","https://doi.org/10.17356/ieejsp.v7i3.786","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Intersections-East European Journal of Society and Politics; 7(3):223-240, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25608,""

"Fear of COVID-19 mediates the relation between mental distress and at-risk health behaviours in Italian adults","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global crisis, necessitating an investigation of its effects from a mental health and wellbeing perspective. In Italy within a few weeks of detecting the first case of coronavirus (February 20, 2020), the country imposed a nationwide quarantine to reduce transmission of the virus disrupting people's daily lives, and creating a significant impact on their physical and mental health. Methods: We sought to test the mediating role of the fear of COVID-19 in the association between mental distress and risky health behaviours in a population of 592 Italian adults, including 467 females and 124 males (M= 39.7;SD= 16.4;range 18-79). First, we hypothesized a direct positive effect of mental distress, measured through the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) on risky health behaviours, recorded throughout an adaptation of the Ebola risk behaviour scale, second, a direct and negative association between mental distress and fear of COVID-19 and the mediation role of Fear of COVID (FCV) between mental distress and risky health behaviours. Results: Mental distress and risky behaviours showed to be tied thanks to the mediation of fear of the COVID-19. This relationship is an essential indicator of the role of decreased mental health in alleviating fear and exposing people to risky behaviours. Conclusions: Good mental health could protect from risk-taking behaviours when fear is not intervening as a mediator, while psychologically distressed people could perceive less fear of getting infected and be exposed to harmful and dangerous behaviours that could increase the risk of contracting the COVID-19. Our findings might help in promoting healthy behaviours during the pandemic outbreak.","Veronese, G.; Cavazzoni, F.; Fiore, F.; Pancake, R.","https://doi.org/10.13129/2282-1619/mjcp-3145","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Mediterranean Journal of Clinical Psychology; 9(3):19, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25611,""
"Factors Effecting COVID-19 Vaccine Refusal and Hesitation After Initiation of National Vaccination Program in Turkey","Introduction: Safe and effective prophylactic vaccines are needed to control rapidly advancing COVID-19, which has devastating medical, economic, and social consequences. It is believed that one of the most critical obstacles to vaccination activities is negative attitudes towards vaccines. This study aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine rejection and hesitation after initiation of the national vaccination program. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted using an online questionnaire. Participants' socio-demographic and clinical data and COVID-19 outbreak experiences, attitudes towards the vaccine of COVID-19 were collected through a specially designed structured questionnaire. The participants were also asked to complete Death Anxiety Scale (DAS) and Health Anxiety Scale (HAS). Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to reveal the factors predicting vaccine hesitancy and rejection. Results: A total of 1,546 completed responses were received. Vaccine hesitation and refusal rates were 8.9% and 9%, respectively. Older age, high education level and lower concern on the vaccine was observed in participants that accepted vaccination compared to patients who refused and hesitated vaccination. High education levels and healthcare workers had decreased risk of vaccine hesitancy. High Death Anxiety Score and being a healthcare worker had decreased risk for vaccine refusal. Concern about the vaccines was the most important risk factor for vaccine hesitancy and refusal. Conclusion: Our study suggested that vaccine hesitancy was related to lower education level, and negative concern about the vaccine. Vaccine refusal was related to history of COVID-19 infection, negative concern on the vaccine, non-healthcare occupation, and higher level of death anxiety scale.","Unal, O.; Ozdamar Unal, G.; Ozyurek, S.

"Post-COVID-19 fibromyalgia syndrome: A report of two cases","COVID-19 is a viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 that primarily targets the respiratory system. COVID-19 may be followed in some patients by post-COV-ID-19 syndrome, fatigue, anxiety, and musculoskeletal pain. These symptoms may be associated with other symptoms, resulting in a constellation of symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Two patients were evaluated at the rheumatology outpatient clinic for diffuse persistent musculoskeletal pain after COVID-19 infection. Patients presented with generalized musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, headache, hand paresthesia, and non-restorative sleep. General examination and various laboratory investigations, including autoimmune profile and radiological investigation, were normal. After examining eighteen tender points, both patients fulfilled the 1990 ACR classification criteria for FMS. Post-COVID-19 FMS should be considered during the management of post-COVID-19 syndrome to alleviate pain and prevent worsening of symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mathkhor, A.

"The mental health of intensive care unit healthcare workers who care for critical patients in pandemics","Aim: In addition to examining the pathophysiology and treatment of the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), it is very important to investigate the psycho-logical effects of the pandemic on healthcare workers. Material and Methods: Our study was conducted in a group of nurses (85 people) who worked for at least 2 weeks in the COVID-19 intensive care unit of the Kastamonu Education and Research Hospital. Participants answered the questionnaire applied via the internet and sent the answers in the same way. For each participant, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (phq-9, range 0-27), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (gad-7, range 0-21), Insomnia Severity Index (isi, range 0-28) criteria are respectively depression, anxiety, and it was used to assess the severity of insomnia symptoms. Results: It was observed that 24.7% of the nurses participating in our study had depression symptoms, 38.8% had anxiety symptoms, and 45.4% had insomnia symptoms. In the female nurse group, we found that depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms were more pronounced. There was no statistically significant difference in 3 scales according to the years of intensive care work. Discussion: Nurses treating COVID-19 patients are probably exposed to the highest risk of infection due to their close, frequent contact with patients and working longer hours than normal. The spread of the virus, the health of the family and others, changes in work, and concerns about isolation can affect the mental state of healthcare workers during this pandemic process. In this study conducted on nurses working in the COVID intensive care unit, high rates of depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms were observed among the respondents.","Soylu, V.

"Drug Use in Night Owls May Increase the Risk for Mental Health Problems","Drugs of abuse are widely known to worsen mental health problems, but this relationship may not be a simple causational one. Whether or not a person is susceptible to the negative effects of drugs of abuse may not only be determined by their addictive properties, but also the usersâ€™ chronotype, which determines their daily activity patterns. The present study investigates the relationship between chronotype, drug use and mental health problems in a cross-sectional community sample. Participants (n=209) completed a selection of questionnaires online, including the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, the Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test and the FagerstrÃ¶m Test for Nicotine Dependence. We conducted multiple regression models to determine relationships between participantsâ€™ chronotype and their reported mental health symptoms and then estimated mediation models to investigate the extent to which their drug consumption accounted for the identified associations. Chronotype was significantly associated with participantsâ€™ overall mental health (ÃŸ=0.16, p=0.022) and their anxiety levels (ÃŸ=0.18, p=0.009) but not with levels of depression or stress. However, both relationships were fully mediated by participantsâ€™ overall drug consumption. Thus, late chronotypes, so-called â€˜night owlsâ€™, not only use more drugs but consequently have an increased risk for developing anxiety and deteriorating mental health status. This group may be particularly vulnerable to the negative psychological effects of drugs. Our results point towards the importance of considering chronotype in designing preventative and therapeutic innovations, specifically for anxiety, which at present has been largely neglected.","Fernando, Jeevan, Stochl, Jan, Ersche, Karen D.","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2021.819566","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Frontiers in Neuroscience;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25615,""

"Let's talk about our feelings: Emotional labour of community practice in times of pandemic","From the earliest days of the Covid-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected marginalised communities around the world, community practice had assumed a critical role on the front lines of the social services' response to the pandemic. While scholars have devoted growing attention to community practice in normal and crisis times, little is known about the emotions of community practitioners and how they deal with them in order to do their job well. Drawing on Hochschild's concept of 'emotional labour,' this study examines how community social workers confronted the emotions they felt during the Covid-19 pandemic so as to meet the requirements of their job. We address this question by drawing on in-depth interviews with 30 community social workers in the public social services in Israel. Our research shows that community social workers experienced a wide range of interrelated negative emotions, including helplessness, frustration, disappointment, and anger. In response, workers developed four distinct coping mechanisms: emotional distancing;sharing of emotions;self-soothing;and politization. Building on Foucault's notion of 'technologies of the self,' our analysis reveals that Covid-19 produced what we call 'pandemic subjectivity' among human service professionals.","Feldman, G.; Itzhaki-Braun, Y.; Frankenburg, R.; Friedman-Hauser, G.","https://doi.org/10.1111/spol.12788","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Social Policy & Administration;: 12, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25617,""
"A Survey of AI-Based Facial Emotion Recognition: Features, ML & DL Techniques, Age-Wise Datasets and Future Directions","Facial expressions are mirrors of human thoughts and feelings. It provides a wealth of social cues to the viewer, including the focus of attention, intention, motivation, and emotion. It is regarded as a potent tool of silent communication. Analysis of these expressions gives a significantly more profound insight into human behavior. AI-based Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has become one of the crucial research topics in recent years, with applications in dynamic analysis, pattern recognition, interpersonal interaction, mental health monitoring, and many more. However, with the global push towards online platforms due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a pressing need to innovate and offer a new FER analysis framework with the increasing visual data generated by videos and photographs.Furthermore, the emotion-wise facial expressions of kids, adults, and senior citizens vary, which must also be considered in the FER research. Lots of research work has been done in this area. However, it lacks a comprehensive overview of the literature that showcases the past work done and provides the aligned future directions. In this paper, the authors have provided a comprehensive evaluation of AI-based FER methodologies, including datasets, feature extraction techniques, algorithms, and the recent breakthroughs with their applications in facial expression identification. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the only review paper stating all aspects of FER for various age brackets and would significantly impact the research community in the coming years.","Dalvi, C.; Rathod, M.; Patil, S.; Gite, S.; Kotecha, K.","https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2021.3131733","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Ieee Access; 9:165806-165840, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25618,""
"Can HRM predict mental health crises? Using HR analytics to unpack the link between employment and suicidal thoughts and behaviors","Purpose The aim of this research is to determine the extent to which the human resource (HR) function can screen and potentially predict suicidal employees and offer preventative mental health assistance. Design/methodology/approach Drawing from the 2019 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (N = 56,136), this paper employs multivariate binary logistic regression to model the work-related predictors of suicidal ideation, planning and attempts. Findings The results indicate that known periods of joblessness, the total number of sick days and absenteeism over the last 12 months are significantly associated with various suicidal outcomes while controlling for key psychosocial correlates. The results also indicate that employee assistance programs are associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of suicidal ideation. These findings are consistent with conservation of resources theory. Research limitations/implications This research demonstrates preliminarily that the HR function can unobtrusively detect employee mental health crises by collecting data on key predictors. Originality/value In the era of COVID-19, employers have a duty of care to safeguard employee mental health. To this end, the authors offer an innovative way through which the HR function can employ predictive analytics to address mental health crises before they result in tragedy.","Hastuti, R.; Timming, A.

"Rhythms of learning - a model of practice supporting youth mental health in the era of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant increase in demand for mental health services for young people. This demand comes on top of a preexisting surge in mental health presentations for our youth, and it places extraordinary demand on support services and the professionals who deliver them. Concurrently, it is recognised that engaging and working with young people and their mental health has its own unique challenges, and that many young people find direct 'talk-based' therapies confronting. This article examines the use of a model of group work practice combining the benefits of rhythmic music with reflective discussions as a response to the dual challenges of workplace burnout and client engagement.

"EvoluciÃ³n y calidad de vida a los tres meses tras hospitalizaciÃ³n por neumonÃ­a COVID","Resumen Objetivo Conocer la evoluciÃ³n y calidad de vida relacionada con la salud a los tres meses del alta, en pacientes que fueron hospitalizados en el hospital de Fuenlabrada con diagnÃ³stico de neumonÃ­a por COVID-19, valorados por el Servicio de RehabilitaciÃ³n y que realizaron fisioterapia. MÃ©todos Se recogen datos de 59 pacientes, diferenciando los que fueron valorados en UCI (41 pacientes), de los valorados en planta de hospitalizaciÃ³n (18). Los datos se toman de su historia clÃ­nica electrÃ³nica, y se realiza una entrevista telefÃ³nica tres meses despuÃ©s del alta hospitalaria. Se analizan datos de su evoluciÃ³n durante hospitalizaciÃ³n, tras el alta y durante los meses siguientes, y de su situaciÃ³n en el momento de la entrevista. Se pide a los pacientes una valoraciÃ³n de la fisioterapia recibida y que contesten el cuestionario de calidad de vida relacionado con la salud SF-36. Resultados Estos pacientes han tenido la peor evoluciÃ³n de su neumonÃ­a COVID de entre los ingresados en nuestro hospital, pero tuvieron una buena recuperaciÃ³n funcional con la fisioterapia intrahospitalaria recibida, la cual fue valorada muy positivamente por los pacientes. DespuÃ©s de tres meses, el 84% tienen sÃ­ntomas persistentes, siendo los mÃ¡s frecuentes disnea, cansancio y depresiÃ³n/ansiedad, y tienen peores puntuaciones en SF-36 que la poblaciÃ³n de referencia. Conclusiones La mayorÃ­a de los pacientes que requieren rehabilitaciÃ³n durante su hospitalizaciÃ³n por neumonÃ­a COVID-19, tienen sÃ­ntomas persistentes y perciben un deterioro de su calidad de vida relacionada con la salud, tras tres meses del alta hospitalaria. Objective Assess clinical evolution and health-related quality of life at three months after discharge in patients who were admitted and diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, evaluated by the Rehabilitation Service and received physiotherapy in Fuenlabrada Hospital. Methods Data were collected from 59 patients, separating those who were assessed in ICU (41 patients) from those assessed in the hospital ward (18). Data were obtained from their Electronic Medical Record, and a telephone interview was performed three months after their discharge. Data about their clinical progress during their hospitalization, after discharge, over the next months and their condition at the time of the interview is analyzed. Patients were asked to assess the quality of the physiotherapy received and to answer the SF-36 health-related quality of life questionnaire. Results These patients had the worst progress of the COVID pneumonia among all patients hospitalized in our hospital, but they had a good functional recovery with the inpatient physiotherapy received, which was positively rated. After three months, 84% have persistent symptoms, with the most common being dyspnoea, fatigue and anxiety/depression, and score worse in the SF-36 questionnaire than the reference population. Conclusions Most patients who require rehabilitation during their COVID pneumonia admission have persistent symptoms and perceive a deterioration in their health-related quality of life after three months of discharge.","Valverde Mateos, M.

"Calidad De Vida Relacionada Con La Salud En Pacientes Recuperados De Covid-19","Resumen IntroducciÃ³n: la presencia de sÃ­ntomas tras la infecciÃ³n aguda por SARS-CoV-2 es frecuente y tiene impacto en la calidad de vida de los pacientes. El objetivo del estudio fue evaluar su calidad de vida despuÃ©s de la COVID-19 y determinar factores de riesgo para una peor percepciÃ³n de esta. MÃ©todos: estudio observacional de corte transversal mediante encuesta telefÃ³nica efectuada a todos los pacientes con infecciÃ³n por el SARS-CoV2 durante la primera onda epidÃ©mica tras 10 meses de seguimiento. Se excluyeron pacientes con deterioro cognitivo e institucionalizados. La principal variable evaluada fue la calidad de vida relacionada con la salud mediante la escala EQ-5D y sus Ã­ndices, el EQ-EVA y el EQ-Health Index. Resultados: se obtuvieron un total de 443 respuestas. La media de edad de los pacientes incluidos fue 54 Â± 16 aÃ±os y 38,4% fueron varones. El Ã¡rea mÃ¡s afectada fue la ansiedad/depresiÃ³n (23,9%) y la movilidad (16,5%). La escala EQ-EVA global fue de 75,8 Â± 18,7 y el EQ-Health Index global fue 0,884 Â± 0,174. La puntuaciÃ³n EVA y el EQ-Health Index fueron significativamente menores en mujeres, mayores de 65 aÃ±os, pacientes con comorbilidad y los que necesitaron ingreso hospitalario;estos grupos ademÃ¡s tenÃ­an mÃ¡s esferas de la salud afectadas. La puntuaciÃ³n EVA fue mÃ¡s baja en la muestra que la media nacional, pero similar a la de la misma comunidad autÃ³noma antes de la pandemia. Fueron factores de riesgo independientes para una puntuaciÃ³n EQ-Health Index menor, el sexo femenino, haber estado ingresado y el nivel de estudios (estudios bÃ¡sicos). ConclusiÃ³n: aunque la percepciÃ³n de la salud tras la COVID-19 estÃ© afectada, puede que no estÃ© directamente relacionada con la pandemia. Existen perfiles de pacientes mÃ¡s susceptibles a tener una peor calidad de vida sobre los que podrÃ­an plantearse intervenciones. Introduction: the presence of symptoms after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is frequent and has an impact on patientsâ€™ quality of life. The aim of this study is to assess the Health-related Quality of Life of COVID-19 survivors and to ascertain which factors are related to worse results. Methods: An observational, cross-sectional study has been performed, using, a telephone survey that was administered to all patients with COVID-19 from the first pandemic wave in our healthcare area ten months after the acute infection. Patients with dementia and nursing home residents were excluded. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the EQ-5D instrument and its indices EQ-VAS and EQ-Health Index. Results: 443 answers were collected. Mean age was 54Â±16 and 38.4% of patients were male. The most affected domain was anxiety/depression (23.9% of patients) and mobility (16.5%). Mean global EQ-VAS score was 75.8Â±18.7, and mean EQ-Health Index was 0.884Â±0.174. Both VAS and Health Index scores were lower in females, patients older than 65 years, patients with comorbidities, and those who needed hospital admission during the acute infection. VAS scores in our sample were lower than in the general Spanish population, but similar to the scores in our region prior to the pandemic. Female sex, hospital admission, and a lower educational status were independently associated to lower EQ-Health Index scoring. Conclusion: while health self-perception is affected after COVID-19, this might not be directly related to the infection. There exist profiles of patients more prone to a worse quality of life in which interventions may be considered.","GarcÃ­a, Blanca Ayuso, LÃ³pez, AntÃ­a PÃ©rez, Balado, Yoana Besteiro, Lema, Eva Romay, PaÃ­s, MarÃ­a JosÃ© GarcÃ­a, MarchÃ¡n-LÃ³pez, Ãlvaro, Ãlvarez, Ana RodrÃ­guez, SÃ¡nchez, Juan Corredoira, Rey, RamÃ³n RabuÃ±al","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhqr.2022.01.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Healthcare Quality Research;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25623,""
"Self-reported anxiety level and related factors in senior high school students in China during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019","Background The outbreak of COVID-19 has been a big challenge for senior high school students in China who are facing tremendous pressure of the highly competitive College Entrance Examination. Methods To evaluate the psychological impact of the event in the population, we conducted an anonymous online survey among senior high school students in China between 26 Feb and 4 March, 2020. Information collected included demographic characteristics, attitude toward medical study, infection of COVID-19 in acquaintances, anxiety symptoms evaluated using the GAD-7, and health literacy level measured using the IDSHL. Results Of 21,085 participants, 3,575 (17.0%), 943 (4.5%) and 448 (2.1%) reported with mild, moderate, and severe anxiety. Female, higher academic year, worse self-evaluated academic performance, negative attitude toward medical study, living in Hubei province and having acquaintance infected with COVID-19 were significantly associated with anxiety level, while higher education level of mother and higher IDSHL score were associated with a lower risk. The score of IDSHL, particularly of the domain â€œinfectious disease preventionâ€, was associated with the GAD-7 score in a linear pattern (ÃŸ=-0.0371, p&lt;0.01). Limitations Limitations included the cross-sectional study design unable to infer the casual relationship, anonymous survey, selection bias and self-reported anxiety disorder levels. Conclusions The results suggested that COVID-19 outbreak may increase anxiety level in senior high school students in China. The anxiety related factors observed in this study may help to identify vulnerable individuals and develop interventions.","Wang, Lei, Yeerjiang, Yeerzhati, Gao, Hai Feng, Pei, Jian Feng, Zhang, Ruo Xin, Xu, Wang Hong","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.01.056","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25624,""

"An integrative review of primary health care nursesâ€™ mental health knowledge gaps and learning needs","Background The global COVID-19 pandemic has escalated the prevalence of mental illness in the community. While specialist mental health nurses have advanced training and skills in mental health care, supporting mental health is a key role for all nurses. As front-line health care professionals, primary health care (PHC) nurses need to be prepared and confident in managing mental health issues. Aim To critically analyse and synthesise international literature about the knowledge gaps and learning needs of PHC nurses in providing mental health care. Design and methods An integrative review. The quality of papers was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Data were extracted into a summary table and analysed using narrative analysis. Data sources CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science and EBSCO electronic databases were searched between 1999 and 2019. Papers were included if they reported original research which explored mental health education/training of nurses working in PHC. Findings Of the 652 papers identified, 13 met the inclusion criteria. Four themes were identified: preparedness;addressing knowledge gaps, education programs, and facilitators and barriers. Discussion Despite increasing integration of physical and mental health management in PHC, there is limited evidence relating to knowledge gaps and skills development of PHC nurses or their preparedness to provide mental health care. Conclusion Findings from this review, together with the global increase in mental illness in communities arising from COVID-19, highlight the need for PHC nurses to identify their mental health learning needs and engage in education to prepare them to meet rising service demands.","McInnes, Susan, Halcomb, Elizabeth, Ashley, Christine, Kean, Ashley, Moxham, Lorna, Patterson, Chris","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colegn.2021.12.005","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Collegian;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25626,""
"The Digital Divide Impacts on mental health during the COVID-19 Pandemic","One of the most daunting unintended consequences of the digital revolution is the digital divide (DD), a pervasive social and information inequality. It negatively affects all sectors of society, and exerts compounding influences on other social inequities. To further complicate the situation, the COVID-19 pandemic has been intensifying the scale of DD and deepening the scope of DD barriers with the increasing but imbalanced applications of digital technologies. For instance, while digital technologies can provide support to fulfill peopleâ€™s mental health needs, recurring evidence shows that DD-prone people are more likely to be excluded from critical services, activities, and resources to support their health concerns and challenges. So far, studies about the mental health consequences of DD amid COVID-19 are limited. Available evidence suggests that the general mental health impacts of COVID-19 include anxiety, depression, and suicidal behaviors, while the mental health consequences of DD due to COVID-19 are mainly stress, distress, and anxiety. To shed light on the research gap, based on the social inequality roots of DD and the nexus between DD barriers and factors of social inequalities, this study highlights the alarming overlap between DD-prone communities and vulnerable populations. Furthermore, we underscore the future research directions that could help society better serve both underserved communities.","Cheshmehzangi, Ali, Zou, Tong, Su, Zhaohui","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2022.01.009","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Brain, Behavior, and Immunity;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25627,""
"Mental health and drinking to cope in the early COVID period: Data from the 2019-2020 US National Alcohol Survey","Background Studies show drinking to cope and mental health problems have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, their samples have been limited by convenience sampling or lack of a pre-pandemic measure. We examined the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, drinking to cope and their association using a probability-based sample of the US adult population. Methods Data was drawn from the probability samples of the 2019-2020 National Alcohol Survey (N=7,233) to examine changes in drinking to cope and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Analyses compared participants who responded to the survey just prior to the widespread onset of the pandemic to those who responded after March 2020, in the total sample and by sex. Results Respondents in the early- vs. pre-COVID-19 period had a 1.48 higher odds (p=0.03) of higher agreement with drinking to forget oneâ€™s worries and problems, with a significant association observed among women only. Respondents with symptoms of depression and anxiety had a 2.94 and 1.56 higher odds, respectively, of higher agreement with drinking to forget oneâ€™s worries. We observed significant associations between early- vs. pre-COVID-19 period, depression and anxiety symptoms, and drinking to forget oneâ€™s worries among women only;however, moderation by sex in the total sample was not statistically significant. Conclusions We observed higher prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms and greater drinking to forget worries in the early months of COVID restrictions relative to the period just prior, with some effects more prominent among women. These observations call for sustained monitoring of and support for the mental health of the general population, and of women in particular during the course of the pandemic.","Martinez, Priscilla, Karriker-Jaffe, Katherine J.; Ye, Yu, Patterson, Deidre, Greenfield, Thomas K.; Mulia, Nina, Kerr, William C.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2022.107247","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Addictive Behaviors;: 107247, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25628,""

"GLP1 analogues among patients with overweight or obesity during lockdown","Background and objectives One of the potential negative effects of a lockdown are changes in dietary and lifestyle patterns, which can lead to weight gain. Our objective was to assess the changes on dietary habits and eating patterns in a lockdown situation and their impact on weight. We aimed to determine whether the treatment with GLP1 analogues (aGLP1) could impact on these parameters. Material and methods 100 overweight/obese patients were consecutively recruited for a review at the end of the lockdown. A structured interview was designed to see changes in dietary habits, routines and exercise. Results 52% patients gained weight during lockdown. The percentage of subjects with an active history of depression or anxiety was higher among the group of patients who gained weight. The percentage of patients who worsened their hyperphagia was higher in those who gained weight (71.2% vs 10.6%;PÂ &lt;Â .0001);similar results were observed with binge eating (92% vs 10.6%;PÂ &lt;Â .0001) and cravings, both sweet and salty (69.2% vs 21.3% and 69.2% vs 14.9%;PÂ &lt;Â .0001 and PÂ &lt;Â .0001 respectively). Of the 48 patients who did not gain weight, 30 were under aGLP1 treatment (61.7%). The worsening of abnormal eating patterns was lower among patients treated with aGLP-1. Conclusions A lockdown is a vulnerable period to gain weight, especially in those patients with a psychopathological history. aGLP1 manage to control emotional eating, making them a valuable therapeutic option. Resumen Antecedentes y objetivos Uno de los potenciales efectos negativos de un confinamiento son los cambios en los patrones dietÃ©ticos y de estilo de vida, que pueden conllevar a una ganancia de peso. El objetivo fue ver los cambios sobre los hÃ¡bitos higiÃ©nico-dietÃ©ticos y de patrones de ingesta en una situaciÃ³n de confinamiento y el impacto sobre el peso. Asimismo, ver si el estar bajo tratamiento con anÃ¡logos de GLP1 (aGLP1) modificÃ³ estos parÃ¡metros. Material y mÃ©todos Se reclutaron de forma consecutiva 100 pacientes con sobrepeso/obesidad que acudieron a revisiÃ³n al finalizar el confinamiento. Se diseÃ±Ã³ una entrevista estructurada para ver los cambios en los hÃ¡bitos dietÃ©ticos, rutinas y ejercicio. Resultados El 52% pacientes ganaron peso durante el confinamiento. El porcentaje de sujetos con historia activa de depresiÃ³n o ansiedad fue superior entre el grupo de pacientes que ganÃ³ peso. El porcentaje de pacientes que empeoraron su hiperfagia ansiosa fue superior en aquellos que ganaron peso (71,2% vs 10,6%;PÂ &lt;Â ,0001);lo mismo ocurriÃ³ con los atracones (92% vs 10,6%;PÂ &lt;Â ,0001) y los cravings, dulces y salados (69,2% vs 21,3% y 69,2% vs 14,9%;PÂ &lt;Â ,0001 y PÂ &lt;Â ,0001 respectivamente). De los 48 pacientes que no ganaron peso, 30 estaban bajo tratamiento con aGLP1 (61,7%).

experiences of people with disabilities in the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on an analysis of focused interviews with people who live with disabilities and experience limited mobility, the authors identify the dynamics of perception and assessment of the pandemic impact on everyday life. The effects of the pandemic in its successive waves have led to crucial changes, hindered access to specialized services, social and medical support for people with disabilities. The informants related experiences of a rapid reorganization of life caused by the need to master new rules, norms and meanings that limit life chances, complicate the implementation of mobility and communicatio , lower the level of subjective well-being, increase inequality and social exclusion. The dynamics of perception of the consequences of the pandemic and ways of coping with new challenges are presented in relation to time characteristics. The authors present the trials faced by children and adults with disabilities and their families, who were forced to rebuild their household structure, family budget, housing space and social environment, in the temporal context of the new pandemic reality. In the narratives, a combination of linearity and cyclicity, multiple temporalities of collected life stories are revealed. Strategies of reorganizing life to maintain living standards and health, such as receiving social services and payments, mastering digital services and inclusion in new solidarity, are highlighted. The issues of social status, physical and mental health of people with disabilities, new forms of inequality and consequences of disability of people due to COVID-19 are problematized.","Yarskaya-Smirnova, Valentina, Sorokina, Natalia","https://www.google.com/search?q=Â«<U+042F>+<U+0425><U+041E><U+0427><U+0423>+<U+0412>+<U+0422><U+0415>+<U+0412><U+0420><U+0415><U+041C><U+0415><U+041D><U+0410>,+<U+041A><U+041E><U+0413><U+0414><U+0410>+<U+041D><U+0415>+<U+0411><U+042B><U+041B><U+041E>+<U+041F><U+0410><U+041D><U+0414><U+0415><U+041C><U+0418><U+0418>Â»:+<U+0422><U+0415><U+041C><U+041F><U+041E><U+0420><U+0410><U+041B><U+042C><U+041D><U+041E><U+0421><U+0422><U+042C>+<U+041A><U+0420><U+0418><U+0417><U+0418><U+0421><U+0410>+COVID-19+<U+0412>+<U+0416><U+0418><U+0417><U+041D><U+0418>+<U+041B><U+042E><U+0414><U+0415><U+0419>+<U+0421>+<U+0418><U+041D><U+0412><U+0410><U+041B><U+0418><U+0414><U+041D><U+041E><U+0421><U+0422><U+042C><U+042E>","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Zhurnal Issledovanii Sotsialnoi Politiki = The Journal of Social Policy Studies; 19(4):651-668, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25636,""
"COVID management and prophylaxis among rural, hilly and tribal population of India","The Covid-19 pandemic has been around us for more than a year now, with millions of confirmed cases and related deaths around the World. Recently, during second wave in India we observed a large number of infected cases with high mortality and scarcity of health infrastructure and manpower. The worst hit states were Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. The uncertainty and hopelessness of the disease is more exaggerated in remote rural, hilly and tribal areas of our country because of scarcity and inefficiency of health care facilities. A streamlined treatment and prophylaxis protocol is the need of the hour. Uttar Pradesh was the first State in India that issued a Government order for Ivermectin prophylaxis to household contacts, health care workers and to treat mild to moderate cases of Covid-19 with combination of Ivermectin and Doxycycline. This author was one of the external experts who was behind the formulation of this Government order. He further observed the miraculous effect of combination of ivermectin and doxycycline which became the backbone of the treatment protocol designed by him for the people living in remote areas of the country. Author's concept is just the simplified version, mainly based on Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) protocol and the Government order issued by Uttar Pradesh which is more applicable and feasible and accessible in such resource poor localities of our country. Author's strategy for such areas is simply based on COVID symptoms and pulse oximetry measurement to diagnose, categorise and treat the mild and moderate cases of COVID. This innovative strategy can be very helpful for rapid and prompt treatment of Covid-19 in remote areas considering the scarcity of COVID testing, health infrastructure and difficult connectivity and transport facilities in these areas.","Surya, Kant","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID+management+and+prophylaxis+among+rural,+hilly+and+tribal+population+of+India","","Database: GIM; Publication details: Journal of the Indian Medical Association; 119(9):63-69, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25637,""
"Life after lockdown: Zooming out on perceptions in the post-videoconferencing era<U+2606><U+2606><U+2606><U+2605>","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply disrupted daily life across the globe, with profound effects on mental and physical health. After more than a year of isolation and communication via videoconferencing, people are returning to in-person activities. Objective This study aimed to investigate worsening self-perception, mental health, and anxiety with the return to in-person activities, with a focus on the influence of videoconferencing, social media, and the use of filters. Methods An anonymous survey was distributed online through social media platforms and student network pages. Results A total of 7295 participants responded to the survey. Seventy-one precent reported anxiety or stress related to returning to in-person activities, and nearly 64% sought mental health support services. Thirty-percent stated they plan to invest in their appearance as a coping strategy to deal with the anxiety of returning to in-person, and &gt;30% plan to take action in changing their appearance. The most reported dermatologic concerns were skin discoloration (32.36%), wrinkles (24.45%), and acne (14.85%). The prevalence of anxiety and mental health services increased relative to the use of filters in 18- to 24 year-olds. Conclusion This survey study of &gt;7000 participants across the country elucidates worsening self-perception, anxiety, and mental health as we return to in-person activities in relation to increased videoconferencing, social media usage, and the use of filters. Physicians should be aware of these effects to better serve their patients.","Silence, Channi, Rice, Shauna M.; Pollock, Samara, Lubov, Janet E.; Oyesiku, Linda O.; Ganeshram, Sonya, Mendez, Alexa, Feeney, Freyja, Kourosh, Arianne Shadi","https://www.google.com/search?q=Life+after+lockdown:+Zooming+out+on+perceptions+in+the+post-videoconferencing+era<U+2606><U+2606><U+2606><U+2605>","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: International journal of women's dermatology; 7(5Part B):774-779, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25638,""
"From the Editor's Desk","In ""The Need for an Integrative Conceptual Framework for Addressing Mental Health Challenges during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"" Dr. Bayan Jalalizadeh addresses a matter at the intersection of ongoing civilizational advance and the pressing needs of the moment, using the coronavirus pandemic as a lens to explore the strengths and weaknesses of our collective approach to mental health. By considering how the pandemic-illuminated shortcomings of the current framework for addressing mental health have their roots in certain conceptual assumptions, he helps us appreciate both the bounty of living in an age where we understand that the thoughts and emotions of a human being are integral to health, and the need to overcome the individualistic and fragmented paradigms through which this area of human knowledge, like so many others, is too often approached.

"Maintaining resilience through restorative clinical supervision during the Covid 19 pandemic within acute mental health services in Wales, United Kingdom","Worldwide, governments and healthcare providers have pledged to bolster support for frontline workers as they continue to engage with the Covid 19 pandemic (World Health Organization, 2020). During the on-going pandemic nurses have been required to move to different roles outside of their usual clinical responsibilities during unprecedented times. This paper reviews a pilot initiative entrusted to the author to provide clinical supervision within an acute mental health hospital which had undertaken a re-allocation of clinical remit to meet the needs of older people diagnosed with mental illness and vulnerable to covid-19. This requirement meant that healthcare works, including nurses had to trial a new model of care and to enhance their clinical skill set to meet the needs of a different client group. Snowdon et al. (2017) advocates the use of clinical supervision to create a positive impact on the quality of care provided by healthcare workers and their underlining well-being. Responsive and proactive to the increasing demands and emerging stresses on the healthcare workers within an acute mental health hospital, the author was tasked to embed himself within the clinical setting to initiate a program of clinical supervision to maintain and enhance resilience within the workforce.","Mottershead, R.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Maintaining+resilience+through+restorative+clinical+supervision+during+the+Covid+19+pandemic+within+acute+mental+health+services+in+Wales,+United+Kingdom","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Bioscience Research; 18:67-71, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25640,""
"Attitudes and Perceptions of Health Protection Measures Against the Spread of COVID-19 in Italy and Poland","Background: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (April to May 2020), 6,169 Polish and 939 Italian residents were surveyed with an online questionnaire investigating socio-demographic information and personality traits (first section) as well as attitudes, position, and efficacy perceptions on the impact of lockdown (second section) and various health protection measures enforced (third section). Methods: The â€œhealth protection attitude scoreâ€ (HPAS), an endpoint obtained by pooling up the answers to questions of the third section of the survey tool, was investigated by multiple linear regression models, reporting regression coefficients (RC) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: Concerns for business and health due to COVID-19 were associated with a positive attitude toward risk reduction rules. By contrast, male sex, concerns about the reliability of information available online on COVID-19 and its prevention, along with the feeling of not being enough informed on the transmissibility/prevention of SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a negative attitude toward risk mitigation measures. Discussion: A recent literature review identified two social patterns with different features in relation to their attitude toward health protection rules against the spread of COVID-19. Factors positively associated with adherence to public health guidelines were perceived threat of COVID-19, trust in government, female sex, and increasing age. Factors associated with decreased compliance were instead underestimation of the COVID-19 risk, limited knowledge of the pandemic, belief in conspiracy theories, and political conservativism. Very few studies have tested interventions to change attitudes or behaviors. Conclusion: To improve attitude and compliance toward risk reduction norms, a key intervention is fostering education and knowledge on COVID-19 health risk and prevention among the general population. However, information on COVID-19 epidemiology might be user-generated and contaminated by social media, which contributed to creating an infodemic around the disease. To prevent the negative impact of social media and to increase adherence to health protection, stronger content control by providers of social platforms is recommended.","Lorettu, Liliana, Mastrangelo, Giuseppe, Stepien, Joanna, Grabowski, Jakub, Meloni, Roberta, Piu, Davide, Michalski, Tomasz, Waszak, Przemyslaw M.; Bellizzi, Saverio, Cegolon, Luca","https://www.google.com/search?q=Attitudes+and+Perceptions+of+Health+Protection+Measures+Against+the+Spread+of+COVID-19+in+Italy+and+Poland","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication details: Frontiers in psychology; 12, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25641,""
"Development and results of an integrated platform based on emerging technologies for the evaluation of risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and geolocation in Pandemic Covid-19 by SARS-Cov-2","An explanatory longitudinal and prospective experimental cutting study was conducted with deliberate intervention, where a platform based on emerging technologies for epidemiological and clinical approach to the Covid 19 pandemic was developed in terms of risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and geolocation. The diagnostic efficacy of Covid 19 disease was demonstrated through evaluation by this application with a sensitivity of 56% and a specificity of 95%, with a positive likelihood ratio of 12. With regard to the assessment of the risk status in the population, there was a sensitivity of 18% with a specificity of 87%. While the positive likelihood rate was 1.5. The determination of ELISA Immunoassay Antibodies (IgM and IgG) for SARS-Cov-2 was positive in 86% of confirmed cases, the determination of antigens (Rapid Tests) showed efficacy for ruling out infection in 73.3% of patients studied. RT-qPCR was the confirming method of molecular diagnosis of virus infection in 90% of confirmed cases. 86% of confirmed cases required treatment and poor prognostic factors were detected in 18.6% of patients evaluated. There were no deaths for Covid 19. The relative risk of complications attributable to this coronavirus was twice as high before evaluation through the Emerging Technologies-based platform. 100% of the patients included were geolocated. The platform showed efficiency and effectiveness for the integral management of the Covid 19 Pandemic.","Leiva-Suero, L. E.; Proano-Alulema, R. X.; Chicaiza-Tayupanta, J. O.; Quishpe-Jara, G.

"The Challenges Just Keep Coming","This month Kroeger is going a little off topic to talk about something we are all experiencing in our communities. The lack of a workforce and supply chain issues are not just environmental health or public health problems--the concerns are all around us. Some of our food service industry friends might be the hardest hit, but it is undoubtedly not limited to just them. The last labor information he heard is that there are over 10 million advertised jobs in the country and only 8.5 million unemployed individuals.

"The Need for an Integrative Conceptual Framework for Addressing Mental Health Challenges During the COVID-19 Pandemic","[...]multiple studies have revealed that when epidemics of infectious disease strike, a strong correlation is seen with rising rates of mental health consequences (Shultz et al.;Yip et al. 88-90). [...]while small, contained amounts of stress can be a positive motivator for action in the short-term, persistently high levels of stress over time (chronic stress), or excessively high levels of stress in a short time, can actually lead to loss of brain mass in several areas and over-activation of hormone pathways, increasing the risk of developing behavioral disturbances and depressive disorders such as major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder (Brodal 369;McEwen 175;Sarahian et al.;Reynaud 41-42;Fenster 542). [...]it considers the realities of the community and institutions-not just individuals-which can serve to alleviate or exacerbate mental illnesses.

"HOW CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE PATIENTS WERE AFFECTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Objective: In the study, it was investigated how chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Method: COPD patients followed up by our clinic were called by phone and a questionnaire was applied. Complaints, applications to health institutions, use of masks, smoking and weight change, etc. were included in the questionnaire. Six questions of ""The Peritraumatic Distress Inventory"", which is used to measure stress during disasters, were also included in the questionnaire. Also, Hospital Anxiety/Depression scale was applied and compared with the pre-pandemic values. The data were analyzed in the SPSS program. Results: The mean age of 101 COPD patients included in the study was 64.9. During the pandemic period;17.8% of patients have various complaints and, 77% of these patients hesitated and did not go to the health institution. One of the patients was hospitalized and three of them were taken to outpatient treatment. No one was diagnosed with COVID-19. During the pandemic period;95.5% of the patients used masks outside the home. Weight gain was found in 47.5% of cases. One third of smokers reduced their amount of cigarettes. The rate of psychological deterioration (who experience at least one of six anxiety/symptoms) was 34.7%. The rate of fear of contamination with COVID-19 was 22.8%, the rate of ""fear of death"" was 8.9%. Anxiety/ depression scores and rates increased compared to the prepandemic levels, especially depression. Conclusions: During the pandemic;COPD patients gained weight. Their concerns and anxiety/depression scores increased. It will be useful to evaluate COPD patients in terms of aiuciery/depression and weight when applying to the clinic. The majority of COPD patients avoided going to a healthcare services due to contamination concerns, despite their complaints. If the pandemic process is prolonged, it is possible that we will encounter problems in COPD treatment and control.","Bozkurt, N.; Bozkurt, A.

"Mental health and psycho-social responses to COVID-19 in Ethiopia (Special Issue: Special issue)","COVID-19 has a wide range of effects on the mental health of the public, people in isolation, vulnerable individuals, and health workers. This article has collected reports from the Ethiopian national public health emergency operations center, the Federal Ministry of Health- Ethiopia and the Health Professionals Advisory Council and included direct observations from the responses to review the mental health and psycho-social responses of Ethiopia to the COVID-19 pandemic, to share experiences and provide policy recommendations. The worldwide effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and psycho-social aspects of the public, restrictions due to the State of Emergency in Ethiopia, the pre-existing resource limitations in mental health care and an increase in returnees with multiple needs had increased the need for mental health and psycho-social support of individuals affected by COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Multiple stakeholders from governmental institutions, professional associations and non-governmental organizations had come together to mitigate the impact. The response included training healthcare providers, preparing guiding documents, mental health messages to the public, and providing mental health and psycho-social support services to individuals admitted in quarantines and treatment centers as well as health workers. The inclusion of Mental Health and Psycho-social support in the emergency response has shown promising results in Ethiopia that can be adopted in the management of other public health emergencies. The effectiveness of mental health and psycho-social interventions relies on recognizing the need of mental health services and increasing metal health resource allocation.","Alemu, A.

"The Ability to Rest at Home During COVID-19 Symptom Manifestation and Depressive Symptoms: Evidence From Korea","This study investigated the association between ability to rest at home in times of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptom manifestation and depressive symptoms. The 2020 Korea Community Health Survey data were used. The presence of depressive symptoms was determined using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The relationship between depressive symptoms and ability to rest at home was examined using logistic regression analysis. Additional analysis was performed on the reasons for the inability to stay at home. Depressive symptoms were more common in participants who could not rest at home if symptoms manifested (4.1%) than those who could rest at home (2.7%). Participants who could not rest at home (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.34-1.74) were more likely to have depressive symptoms, particularly when they had to report to work (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.30-1.74) or purchase daily necessities (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.15-5.03). Inability to rest at home in the case of COVID-19 symptom manifestation was associated with depressive symptoms. The findings suggest the need to address the identified vulnerable groups to mitigate the mental health consequences of the pandemic.","Kim, Ju, Lee","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2021.0300","20220118","COVID-19; Depression; Rest; Symptom","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25648,""
"Quality of life of patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: The biopsychosocial path","Previous models that assess quality-of-Life (QoL) in patients with rheumatic diseases have a strong biomedical focus. We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 related-health care interruption (HCI) on the physical, psychological, social relationships and environment QoL-dimensions, and explored factors associated with QoL when patients were reincorporated to the outpatient clinic, and after six-month follow-up. Study phase-1 consisted of a COVID-19 survey administered from June 24th-October 31st 2020, to outpatients with rheumatic diseases who had face-to-face consultation at outpatient clinic reopening. Study phase-2 consisted of 3 consecutive assessments of patientÃ‚Â´s QoL (WHOQOL-BREF), disease activity/severity (RAPID-3), and psychological comorbidity/trauma (DASS-21 and IES-R) to patients from phase-1 randomly selected. Sociodemographic, disease and treatment-related information, and comorbidities were obtained. Multiple linear regression analysis identified factors associated with the score assigned to each WHOQOL-BREF dimension. Patients included (670 for phase-1 and 276 for phase-2), had primarily SLE and RA (44.2% and 34.1%, respectively), and all the dimensions of their WHOQOL-BREF were affected. There were 145 patients (52.5%) who referred HCI, and they had significantly lower dimensions scores (but the environment dimension score). Psycho-emotional factors (primarily feeling confused, depression and anxiety), sociodemographic factors (age, COVID-19 negative economic impact, years of scholarship, HCI and having a job), and biomedical factors (RAPID-3 score and corticosteroid use) were associated with baseline QoL dimensions scores. Psycho-emotional factors showed the strongest magnitude on dimensions scores. Most consistent predictor of six-month follow-up QoL dimensions scores was each corresponding baseline dimension score, while social determinants (years of scholarship and having a job), emotional factors (feeling bored), and biomedical aspects (RAPID 3) had an additional impact. HCI impacted the majority of patientÃ‚Â´s QoL dimensions. Psycho-emotional, sociodemographic and biomedical factors were consistently associated with QoL dimensions scores, and these consistently predicted the QoL trajectory.","Guaracha-BasÃƒÂ¡ÃƒÂ±ez, Contreras-YÃƒÂ¡ÃƒÂ±ez, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Molina, Estrada-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Pacheco-Santiago, Valverde-HernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Galindo-Donaire, PelÃƒÂ¡ez-Ballestas, Pascual-Ramos","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262756","20220118","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25649,""
"Ancestral Food Sources Rich in Polyphenols, Their Metabolism, and the Potential Influence of Gut Microbiota in the Management of Depression and Anxiety","The relationship between a population's diet and the risk of suffering from mental disorders has gained importance in recent years, becoming exacerbated due to the COVID-19 lockdown. This review concentrates relevant literature from Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar analyzed with the aim of rescuing knowledge that promotes mental health. In this context, it is important to highlight those flowers, seeds, herbaceous plants, fungi, leaves, and tree barks, among other ancestral matrices, that have been historically part of the eating habits of human beings and have also been a consequence of the adaptation of collectors, consuming the ethnoflora present in different ecosystems. Likewise, it is important to note that this knowledge has been progressively lost in the new generations. Therefore, this review concentrates an important number of matrices used particularly for food and medicinal purposes, recognized for their anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, establishing the importance of metabolism and biotransformation mainly of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols by the action of the gut microbiota.","ÃƒÂlvarez, Rocha-GuzmÃƒÂ¡n, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Laredo, Gallegos-Infante, Moreno-JimÃƒÂ©nez, Bravo-MuÃƒÂ±oz","https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c06151","20220118","ancestral food; anxiety; depression; microbiota; polyphenols","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25650,""
"Psychological Impact and Risk of Suicide in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients, During the Initial Stage of the Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","This study aimed to assess the psychological impact and risk of suicide in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted on a representative sample of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at the ""San Cecilio"" University Hospital (Granada, Spain) between March and May 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were collected. All participants were evaluated using the Gijon's Social-Familial Evaluation Scale to assess social problems, the Impact of Event Scale-6 and the Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale to assess psychological impact, the Columbia Suicide Severity and Beck Hopelessness scales to assess risk of suicide, and the List of Threatening Experiences questionnaire to control for confounding bias. Thirty-six COVID-19 patients were evaluated. Of them, 33.3% had a significant psychological impact; 13.9% showed symptoms of anxiety, 13.9% showed symptoms of depression, and 47.2% showed symptoms of anxiety-depression. Moderate and severe risk of suicide were found in 75% and 2.8% of the patients, respectively. Suicidal ideation was observed in 16.7% and suicide behaviors in 5.6% of the patients. Psychological impact was associated with previous psychological treatment, a greater degree of functional dependency, and increased social-familial risk. In addition, the risk of suicide was mainly associated with active treatment of a psychiatric illness and active smoking. No significant correlation was found between psychological impact and risk of suicide. Psychological impact and risk of suicide were significant in patients admitted for COVID-19. Although the risk of suicide was not associated with increased psychological impact, both should be assessed, especially in patients at higher risk based on significantly associated factors.","Benavente-Fernandez, Gutierrez-Rojas, Torres-Parejo, Parejo Moron, Fernandez Ontiveros, Vinuesa Garcia, Gonzalez-Domenech, Lainez Ramos-Bossini","https://doi.org/10.1097/PTS.0000000000000974","20220118","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25651,""
"[Some psychiatric and neurological aspects of the asymptomatic and mild course of COVID-19]","To study neurological and mental disorders associated with the inapparent and mild course of COVID-19. The study included 50 patients (mean age 35.2Ã‚Â±11.4 years) admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to depressive spectrum disorders. Patients were divided into two groups: patients (<i>n</i>=16) who had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (main group) and patients (<i>n</i>=34) without a history of COVID-19 (comparison group). Patients of the main group showed a difference in the structure of asthenic disorders compared with the comparison group. Also, there was a significant predominance of the severity of asthenic symptoms and anxiety in the structure of psychopathological disorders in depressive spectrum disorders. The viral intoxication contributes to the formation of a kind of asthenic Ã‚Â«soilÃ‚Â» (with characteristic manifestations). In the future, in the case of the development of any stress-associated disorder, more pronounced psychopathological disorders are noted compared with patients of the comparison group. The authors describe a variant of the course of COVID-19, in which the development of ischemic stroke was the first clinical manifestation of the disease. These disorders are based on the pronounced neurotropic effect of SARS-CoV-2 and its effect on the neurovascular unit.

"School Closures During Social Lockdown and Mental Health, Health Behaviors, and Well-being Among Children and Adolescents During the First COVID-19 Wave: A Systematic Review","School closures as part of broader social lockdown measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with the health and well-being of children and adolescents. To review published reports on the association of school closures during broader social lockdown with mental health, health behaviors, and well-being in children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years, excluding associations with transmission of infection. Eleven databases were searched from inception to September 2020, and machine learning was applied for screening articles. A total of 16Ã¢â‚¬Â¯817 records were screened, 151 were reviewed in full text, and 36 studies were included. Quality assessment was tailored to study type. A narrative synthesis of results was undertaken because data did not allow meta-analysis. A total of 36 studies from 11 countries were identified, involving a total of 79Ã¢â‚¬Â¯781 children and adolescents and 18Ã¢â‚¬Â¯028 parents, which occurred during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (February to July 2020). All evaluated school closure as part of broader social lockdown during the first COVID-19 wave, and the duration of school closure ranged from 1 week to 3 months. Of those, 9 (25%) were longitudinal pre-post studies, 5 (14%) were cohort, 21 (58%) were cross-sectional, and 1 (3%) was a modeling study. Thirteen studies (36%) were high quality, 17 (47%) were medium quality, and 6 (17%) were low quality. Twenty-three studies (64%) were published, 8 (22%) were online reports, and 5 (14%) were preprints. Twenty-five studies (69%) concerning mental health identified associations across emotional, behavioral, and restlessness/inattention problems; 18% to 60% of children and adolescents scored above risk thresholds for distress, particularly anxiety and depressive symptoms, and 2 studies reported no significant association with suicide. Three studies reported that child protection referrals were lower than expected number of referrals originating in schools. Three studies suggested higher screen time usage, 2 studies reported greater social media use, and 6 studies reported lower physical activity. Studies on sleep (10 studies) and diet (5 studies) provided inconclusive evidence on harms. In this narrative synthesis of reports from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, studies of short-term school closures as part of social lockdown measures reported adverse mental health symptoms and health behaviors among children and adolescents. Associations between school closure and health outcomes and behaviors could not be separated from broader lockdown measures.","Viner, Russell, Saulle, Croker, Stansfield, Packer, Nicholls, Goddings, Bonell, Hudson, Hope, Ward, Schwalbe, Morgan, Minozzi","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.5840","20220118","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25653,""

Data were collected through virtual means, with the participation of 719 nursing workers, from April to June 2020. To organize the data, the IRaMuTeQÃ‚Â® software and thematic analysis were used. the reports revealed the lack of value of workers and the loss of social labor rights; the progressive nature of the neoliberal policy, its threats and repercussions on workers' mental health; and recognition by female workers that political and class participation does not occur in isolation, but collectively. under the aegis of neoliberal policy, the COVID-19 pandemic brought an upsurge precarious work, influencing nursing workers' subjectivity and mental health.","Rezio, de Oliveira, Queiroz, Sousa, Zerbetto, Marcheti, Nasi, NÃƒÂ³brega","https://doi.org/10.1590/1980-220X-REEUSP-2021-0257","20220118","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25654,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Suicidal Behavior in Romania","Suicide rates reflect the mental health status in certain countries or regions. As the COVID-19 infection developed as a pandemic and governments imposed certain measures to stop the spread of the virus, mental health was affected worldwide. Romania was no exception as the government issued a complete lockdown with restriction regarding travels, social gatherings, transition to working from home and others. The increase in the rate of unemployment, the difficulties in accessing the health services and the social distancing generated by the restrictions had a major impact on lifestyle with a potential surge of psychiatric disorders, with or without history of illness. In this study, we analyzed the changes in regard to the number of suicides and suicide attempts as well as the methods employed and the underlying psychiatric pathology in Cluj County, Romania, throughout the first year of the pandemic. The results had not revealed changes in the overall suicide rate, but in the case of mild cognitive disorders and dementia the suicide figures increased, while a decrease was observed in the number of suicides related to substance use disorders. The long-term effects of the pandemic remain unknown, but there is a clear impact on mental health and measures should be taken in order to prevent suicides.","Vuscan, Buciuta, Vica, Balici, Rusu, Siserman, Coman, Matei","https://doi.org/10.1080/13811118.2021.2022052","20220118","Mental health; pandemic; suicidal behavior; suicide attempts","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25655,""
"Physicians' Health-Related Quality of Life and Its Associated Factors During COVID-19 Pandemic in Jordan: A Cross-Sectional Study","Healthcare workers worldwide have been exposed to extraordinary stress during COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) level and its health and occupational associated factors among Jordanian physicians during COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional design using an online survey was adopted targeting physicians at different Jordanian hospitals. The study survey included demographics, HRQoL measured by 12-item Short Form health survey (SF-12) mental and physical components, physicians' evaluation of work conditions during COVID-19, Neck Disability Index (NDI), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 21), and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Descriptive analyses were conducted to summarize primary data. Factors associated with HRQoL were determined using a multiple variable regression analysis. In total, 326 physicians successfully completed the survey, 44.2% were males with mean age of 32.08 (Ã‚Â±6.93). SF-12 mental component mean was 52.13 (Ã‚Â±20.84) and physical component mean was 69.24 (Ã‚Â±18.1). Physicians HRQoL level was significantly associated with levels of stress (<b>ÃŽÂ²</b> = -0.23, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.27), depression (<b>ÃŽÂ²</b> = -0.22, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.28), neck disability (<b>ÃŽÂ²</b> = -0.30, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.57), health self-evaluation (<b>ÃŽÂ²</b> = 0.14, 95% CI 1.66-7.87), sleep self-evaluation (<b>ÃŽÂ²</b> = 0.09, 95% CI 0.16-3.58), and physical activity level (<b>ÃŽÂ²</b> = 0.09, 95% CI 0.00-0.001). Jordanian physicians' level of HRQoL was relatively low during COVID-19. Healthcare facilities administrators should take into consideration factors associated with physicians' HRQoL level when planning for future healthcare emergencies.","Almhdawi, Alrabbaie, Arabiat, Alhammouri, Hamadneh, Obeidat, Alazrai, Jaber, Almousa","https://doi.org/10.1177/01632787211068899","20220118","COVID-19; depression; health-related quality of life; mental health; occupational stress; physicians; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25656,""
"Increase in Depression and Anxiety Among Australian Gay and Bisexual Men During COVID-19 Restrictions: Findings from a Prospective Online Cohort Study","We examined depression and anxiety prior to and during COVID-19 restrictions in Australian gay and bisexual men (GBM). In an online cohort, a COVID-19-focused survey was conducted in April 2020. During 2019 and in April 2020, 664 GBM completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9, measuring depression) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7, measuring anxiety). Increased depression and anxiety were defined as aÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°5 point increase on the respective scales. Mean PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores increased between 2019 and 2020 (PHQ-9: from 5.11 in 2019 to 6.55 in 2020; GAD-7: from 3.80 in 2019 to 4.95 in 2020). The proportion of participants with moderate-severe depression (PHQ-9Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°10) increased from 18.8% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°125) to 25.5% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°169), while the proportion of participants with moderate-severe anxiety (GAD-7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°10) increased from 12.7% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°84) to 17.3% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°115). Almost one-quarter of participants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°158, 23.8%) had increased depression; in these men, mean PHQ-9 increased from 2.49 in 2019 to 11.65 in 2020 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). One-in-five (20.6%) participants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°137) had increased anxiety; among these men, mean GAD-7 increased from 2.05 in 2019 to 10.22 in 2020 (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Increases were associated with concerns about job security, reduction in social and sexual connections and opportunities, and being personally concerned about COVID-19 itself. COVID-19 appeared to have a sudden and pronounced impact on depression and anxiety in Australian GBM, with a significant minority showing sharp increases. Ongoing monitoring is required to determine longer-term impacts and GBM need access to appropriate and sensitive supports both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bavinton, Chan, Hammoud, Maher, Haire, Degenhardt, Holt, Lea, Bath, Storer, Jin, Grulich, Bourne, Saxton, Prestage, Murphy, Mackie, Batrouney, Ellard, Grierson, Pastorelli","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-021-02276-2","20220118","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Gay and bisexual men; Mental health; Sexual orientation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25657,""
"Maternal Mental Health and Child Adjustment Problems in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Families Experiencing Economic Disadvantage","Parents living in low-income contexts shouldered disproportionate hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic with consequences to maternal mental health and child adjustment. The current study uses a sample of first-time mothers (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°147) of young toddlers, all living in low-income contexts, to examine the roles of pre-pandemic and COVID-19-specific risk and individual resilience factors in the prediction of changes to maternal mental health coinciding with the onset of the pandemic. Maternal mental health symptoms, in turn, were examined as predictors of child adjustment problems across 6Ã‚Â months of the pandemic and as a potential mechanism conferring pandemic risks to children. While pre-pandemic cumulative contextual risk (i.e., low income, single parent status, adolescent parent status, financial instability) did not predict changes in maternal mental health from prior to during the pandemic, COVID-19-specific health risks predicted changes in maternal mental health from before the pandemic, as well as across 6Ã‚Â months of the pandemic. Regarding individual resilience factors to changes in maternal mental health, pre-pandemic self-compassion predicted better maternal mental health during the pandemic, as did COVID-19-specific appraisal and coping strategies. In turn, maternal mental health predicted children's early pandemic levels of adjustment problems and changes in adjustment problems across 6Ã‚Â months of the pandemic, with maternal mental health serving an indirect pathway of COVID-19-specific health risks to children's adjustment. The findings highlight pathways of risk and resilience during a global health crisis and point to targets for interventions in community level crises to promote maternal and child mental health.","Thompson, Shimomaeda, Calhoun, Moini, Smith, Lengua","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10802-021-00888-9","20220118","Child adjustment; Maternal mental health; Pandemic; Resilience; Risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25658,""
"A Latent Class Analysis of Mental Health Severity and Alcohol Consumption: Associations with COVID-19-Related Quarantining, Isolation, Suicidal Ideations, and Physical Activity","The present study examined latent class cluster group patterns based on measures of depression and anxiety symptom severity and alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hypothesized correlates with latent class cluster groups including quarantining, self-isolation, suicidal ideations, sitting hours per day, and physical activity (vigorous intensity exercise in minutes per week) were examined. The delimited participant sample consisted of 606 university young adults 18 to 25Ã‚Â years of age (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21.24Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.62). Latent cluster analysis (LCA) modeled patterns of depression and anxiety symptom severity and alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between group analysis and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used to examine relationships between latent class clusters and correlates including quarantining, self-isolation, suicidal ideations, sitting hours per day, and physical activity (vigorous intensity exercise in minutes per week). LCA results showed that six latent cluster groups provided optimal model-to-date fit based on mental health symptom severity and alcohol consumption (<i>L</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°56.31, <i>BIC</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5012.79, <i>AIC</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4849.74, and the bootstrap <i>L</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> <i>p</i>-valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.88; Entropy <i>R</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.89).

"Risk perception, mental health distress, and flourishing during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: The role of positive and negative affect","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented disruptions to people's everyday life and induced wide-ranging impacts on people's physical health, mental health and well-being. This research investigated the relationship between risk perception, mental health distress, and flourishing during the peak period of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Three hundred and ninety Chinese completed measures on risk perception, mental health distress, positive and negative affect, flourishing, and demographic information. The results revealed that 27.2% of participants experienced some level of mental health distress, but they also experienced a relatively high level of flourishing. Higher level of risk perception and negative affect were risk factors, whereas positive affect was a protective factor, of mental illness and flourishing. Experiences of positive and negative affect mediated the relationship between risk perception and level of mental health distress and flourishing, respectively. Although the COVID-19 pandemic led to a higher level of mental distress among the general public in China, most people were also resilient during the pandemic.

"Impact of the fear of catching COVID-19 on mental health in undergraduate students: A Predictive Model for anxiety, depression, and insomnia","Most studies only describe mental health indicators (anxiety, depression, insomnia, and stress) and the risk factors associated with these indicators during the pandemic (sex, student status, and specific physical symptoms). However, no explanatory studies have been found that assess the impact of variables associated with COVID-19. Against this background, the objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of the fear of catching COVID-19 on the level of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in 947 university students of both sexes (41.6% males and 58.4% females) between the ages of 18 and 35 (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°<i>21.</i>6; <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°<i>3.</i>4). The Fear of catching COVID-19 Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were used to measure the variables. The results of the study show that the fear of catching COVID-19 significantly influences the level of anxiety (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.52; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01), insomnia (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.44; p&lt;.01), and depression (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.50; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) experienced by university students (Ãâ€¡2Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2075.93; dfÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°371; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.000; RMSEAÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.070 [CI 90% .067-.073]; SRMRÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.055; CFIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.95; TLIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.94). The descriptive results show that a notable percentage of university students present significant symptoms of anxiety (23%), depression (24%), and insomnia (32.9%).

"Emotion regulation in times of COVID-19: A person-centered approach based on self-determination theory","Although the COVID-19 crisis is a worldwide threat to individuals' physical health and psychological well-being, not all people are equally susceptible to increased ill-being. One potentially important factor in individuals' vulnerability (versus resilience) to ill-being in the face of stress is emotion regulation. On the basis of Self-Determination Theory, this study examined the role of three emotion regulation styles in individuals' mental health during the COVID-19 crisis, that is, integration, suppression, and dysregulation. Participants were 6584 adults (77% female, <i>M</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°45.16Ã‚Â years) who filled out well-validated measures of emotion regulation, depression, anxiety, life satisfaction, and sleep quality. To examine naturally occurring combinations of emotion regulation strategies, hierarchical k-means clustering was performed, yielding 3 profiles: (a) low scores on all strategies (indicating rather low overall levels of worry; 27%), (b) high scores on integration only (41%), and (c) high scores on suppression and dysregulation (32%). Participants in the profiles scoring high on suppression and dysregulation displayed a less favorable pattern of outcomes (high ill-being, low life satisfaction, and poorer sleep quality) compared to the other two groups. Between-cluster differences remained significant even when taking into account the corona-related worries experienced by people. Overall, the findings underscore the important role of emotion regulation in individuals' mental health during mentally challenging periods such as the COVID-19 crisis. Practical implications and directions for future research are discussed.","Waterschoot, MorbÃƒÂ©e, Vermote, Brenning, Flamant, Vansteenkiste, Soenens","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02623-5","20220118","COVID-19; Emotion regulation; Mental health; Self-determination theory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25662,""
"Healthcare Workers' Burn-out, Hopelessness, Fear of COVID-19 and Perceived Social Support Levels","During the pandemic, all healthcare workers have tried to cope with mental challenges. This study evaluated the healthcare workers' levels of burn-out, hopelessness, fear of COVID-19 and perceived social support, the relation between these factors, and other possible related components. Four hundred and fifty-one HCW (healthcare workers) all across Turkey were included in the study. Participants were given sociodemographic information form, Maslach Burn-out Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. This was a cross-sectional study via various online platforms. The participants who were on duty in the COVID-19 clinic, complaining about the low salary or not having enough time for themselves or their own family, had significantly higher scores on three subscales of burn-out scale, and hopelessness scale. Working atÃ‚Â governmentalÃ‚Â hospitals, working atÃ‚Â departmentsÃ‚Â containing a high risk of COVID-19 infection, and having a history of COVID-19 infection wereÃ‚Â foundÃ‚Â to beÃ‚Â significantlyÃ‚Â associated with emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and hopelessness. Feeling control of your profession and getting social support from others were the two factors that tackle burnout in HCW. Family support is the only support that tackles all 3 subscales of burn-out and hopelessness. The findings emphasized that to tackle the burn-out and hopelessness of HCWs, it is important for HCW to receive financial compensation for their hard work, to work under improved conditions, and to receive adequate social support.","KaragÃƒÂ¶l, Kaya","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpsy.2022.01.001","20220118","Burn-out; COVID-19 pandemic; perceived social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25663,""
"The Mental Health Impacts of Successive Disasters: Examining the Roles of Individual and Community Resilience Following a Tornado and COVID-19","Prior research has found that exposure to natural hazards and infectious disease are associated with adverse mental health outcomes. Less studied are the ways that individual-level and community-level resilience can protect against problematic mental health outcomes following exposure to successive disaster events. In the current study, we examine the role of individual and community resilience on mental health outcomes among 412 adults in Nashville, Tennessee exposed to an EF-3 tornado followed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Results found the cumulative impact of exposure to the tornado and COVID-19 was related to higher levels of PTS and depression symptoms. Individual resilience had a protective, inverse relationship with PTS and depression symptoms and mediated the relationship between community resilience and adverse mental health outcomes. Findings support the development of a multi-system disaster resilience framework that links individual resilience capacities to broader community resilience capacities to activate and sustain healthy adaptation following exposure to successive disasters.","First, Houston","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10615-021-00830-y","20220118","COVID-19; Disasters; Mental health; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25664,""
"Coronial postmortem reports and indirect COVID-19 pandemic-related mortality","Widespread disruption of healthcare services and excess mortality not directly attributed to COVID-19 occurred between March and May 2020. We undertook the first UK multicentre study of coroners' autopsies before and during this period using postmortem reports. We reviewed reports of non-forensic coroners' autopsies performed during the first COVID-19 lockdown (23 March to 8 May 2020), and the same period in 2018. Deaths were categorised as natural non-COVID-19, COVID-19-related, non-natural (suicide, drug and alcohol-related, traumatic, other). We provided opinion regarding whether delayed access to medical care or changes in behaviour due to lockdown were a potential factor in deaths. Seven centres covering nine coronial jurisdictions submitted a total of 1100 coroners' autopsies (498 in 2018, 602 in 2020). In only 54 autopsies was death attributed to COVID-19 (9%). We identified a significant increase in cases where delays in accessing medical care potentially contributed to death (10 in 2018, 44 in 2020). Lockdown was a contributing factor in a proportion of suicides (24%) and drug and alcohol-related deaths (12%). Postmortem reports have considerable utility in evaluating excess mortality due to healthcare and wider societal disruption during a pandemic. They provide information at an individual case level that is not available from assessment of death certification data. Detailed evaluation of coroners' autopsy reports, supported by appropriate regulatory oversight, is recommended to mitigate disruption and indirect causes of mortality in future pandemics. Maintaining access to healthcare, including substance misuse and mental health services, is an important consideration.","Pell, Suvarna, Cooper, Rutty, Green, Osborn, Johnson, Hayward, Durno, Estrin-Serlui, Mafham, Roberts","https://doi.org/10.1136/jclinpath-2021-208003","20220118","COVID-19; autopsy; death; epidemiology; reports","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25665,""

We cautiously propose that points of convergence across stories indicate a level of shared experience among participants relating to COVID-19 in Australia. We suggest this is due to intensive media coverage of the pandemic, persistent public health messaging, engagement with social media and instant messaging technologies, and extended lockdowns that impacted the mental health of vast numbers of Australians.","Vaughan, Lenette, Boydell","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057393","20220118","COVID-19; mental health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25666,""

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health response on people with eating disorder symptomatology: an Australian study","People with lived experience of eating disorders (ED) may be particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health response due to exasperating situations such as social isolation, presence of other mental and physical health conditions, disruptions to treatment, etc. This study investigates the association of the pandemic with ED symptomatology to consider impact and identify risk factors for clinical consideration. Participants with self-reported ED diagnosis and/or symptomatology over 16Ã‚Â years were invited to complete an online survey during the first months of the pandemic in Australia. Questions included history of ED, occurrence of co-occurring mental health conditions, change in ED symptoms since the start of the pandemic, and validated measures of ED illness, state mental health and loneliness. Of 1723 participants (mode age 24.9Ã‚Â years, 91.6% identifying as female, EDE-Q Global Score xÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.08, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.18, 79.0% reporting co-occurring mental health condition, predominantly obsessive-compulsive disorder and/or anxiety), 88.0% reported an increase in body image concerns, 74.1% in food restriction, 66.2% binge eating and 46.8% driven exercise during the pandemic. Increased ED symptomatology was associated with poorer state mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress) and loneliness across the ED symptom profile. Most participants were negatively impacted by various aspects of the public health response, more so for those with more acute ED illness as measured by the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). Associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is a mental health crisis, particularly for those with a lived experience of an eating disorder. With 40.5% of participants not having sought formal diagnostic assessment and less than half in treatment, this study provides evidence for the detrimental impact of the pandemic on people with a lived experience of an eating disorder, especially for those not yet supported by the health care system. This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health response on people with a self-reported lived experience of eating disorders across Australia. A nation-wide online survey of 1723 participants aged 16Ã¢â‚¬â€œ80Ã‚Â years indicated eating disorders symptoms increased globally including body image concern (for 88% of participants), food restriction (74%) and binge eating (66%), especially for those reporting more acute eating disorder illness, poorer mental health (including depression, anxiety, and stress) and experience of loneliness. Albeit necessary, several pandemic experiences were identified as being particularly associated with more acute eating disorder illness such as changes in daily routine, social media reactions, restricted access to support people, and changes to treatment. As less than half of the participants were in treatment at assessment and over 40% had never sought formal diagnosis or treatment, this study highlights the prevalence of unidentified and unsupported people in the community experiencing increase eating disorder symptoms during this pandemic and the need for clinical awareness in general medical and mental health practice.","Miskovic-Wheatley, Koreshe, Kim, Simeone, Maguire","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-021-00527-0","20220118","Anorexia nervosa; COVID-19; Eating disorders; Pandemic; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25668,""
"Psychosocial impacts of home-schooling on parents and caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has been highly disruptive, with the closure of schools causing sudden shifts for students, educators and parents/caregivers to remote learning from home (home-schooling). Limited research has focused on home-schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic, with most research to date being descriptive in nature. The aim of the current study was to comprehensively quantify the psychosocial impacts of home-schooling on parents and other caregivers, and identify factors associated with better outcomes. A nationally representative sample of 1,296 Australian adults was recruited at the beginning of Australian COVID-19 restrictions in late-March 2020, and followed up every two weeks. Data for the current study were drawn from waves two and three. Surveys assessed psychosocial outcomes of psychological distress, work and social impairment, and wellbeing, as well as a range of home-schooling factors. Parents and caregivers who were home-schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic experienced significantly higher levels of psychological distress and work/social impairment compared to those who were not home-schooling or had no school-aged children. A current mental health diagnosis or lower levels of perceived support from their child's school negatively affected levels of psychological distress, work and social impairment, and wellbeing in parents and caregivers involved in home-schooling. The mental health impacts of home-schooling were high and may rise as periods of home-schooling increase in frequency and duration. Recognising and acknowledging the challenges of home-schooling is important, and should be included in psychosocial assessments of wellbeing during periods of school closure. Emotional and instrumental support is needed for those involved in home-schooling, as perceived levels of support is associated with improved outcomes. Proactive planning by schools to support parents may promote better outcomes and improved home-schooling experiences for students.","Calear, McCallum, Morse, Banfield, Gulliver, Cherbuin, Farrer, Murray, Rodney Harris, Batterham","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12532-2","20220118","COVID-19; Home-schooling; Impairment; Parents; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25669,""
"Factors associated with insomnia among frontline nurses during COVID-19: a cross-sectional survey study","Research predominantly suggests that nurses are at high risk of developing psychopathology. The empirical data show that the occurrence rate of problem-related sleep quality among clinical nurses is high. Therefore, this study was conducted to address the lack of information on the relationship between the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and insomnia. A convenience sample of nurses (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°680) completed an online survey that included the Insomnia severity index, the COVID-19-related psychological distress scale, the general health questionnaire, neuroticism, dysfunctional beliefs, attitudes about sleep scale, and difficulties in emotion regulation scale. The results showed that 35.8% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°253) of nurses were classified as individuals with moderate to severe clinical insomnia. The results showed that the psychological distress generated by COVID-19 predicted insomnia (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.47, SEÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001, tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.27, 95% CI 0.31-0.46). Additionally, the association is mediated by psychopathology vulnerabilities, emotion dysregulation, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and neuroticism. Moreover, female nurses exhibited higher levels of insomnia (Cohen's dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.37), neuroticism (Cohen's dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30), psychopathology vulnerability (Cohen's dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.26), and COVID-19-related psychological distress (Cohen's dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.23). The present study's findings help to explain how pandemic consequences can be associated with insomnia. Additionally, the findings make a significant contribution to better understanding the role of neuroticism, emotion dysregulation, beliefs, and psychopathology vulnerability in the development of insomnia among nurses. The findings suggest the potential influence of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and transdiagnostic integrated therapies that could be incorporated into therapeutic programs designed to develop as a way of inhibiting or preventing insomnia among clinical nurses.","Nazari, Sadeghi, Samusenkov, Aligholipour","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-03690-z","20220118","COVID-19; DBAS; Depression; Insomnia; Neuroticism; Nurses; Sleep disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25670,""
"Could COVID expand the future of addiction research? Long-term implications in the pandemic era","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted face-to-face research. This has propelled ideas and plans for more remote styles of research and provided new perspectives on conducting research. This paper aimed to identify challenges specific to conducting remote forms of experimental addiction research, although some of these challenges apply to all types of addiction research. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to important lessons for future addiction research. Whilst remote research has been conducted for decades, little experimental research has been performed remotely. To do so requires a new perspective on what research questions we can ask and could also enable preferential capture of those who may be more reluctant to engage in research based in clinical settings. There may, however, be crucial factors that will compromise this process. We illustrate our argument with three real-world, ongoing case studies centred on gambling behaviour, opioid overdose, and cannabinoid psychopharmacology. We highlight the obstacles to be overcome to enable more remote methods of study. The future of experimental research and, more generally, addiction research, will be shaped by the pandemic and may result in advantages, such as reaching different populations and conducting addiction research in more naturalistic settings.","Englund, Sharman, Tas, Strang","https://doi.org/10.1111/add.15790","20220117","Addiction research; COVID-19; Cannabis; Gambling; Opioids; Research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25671,""

This multicentre study recruited 588 patients (29.2% women; M age = 47.4 Ã‚Â± 11.7 years) in thirteen centres for addiction treatment in Catalonia, Spain. All subjects were evaluated with validated instruments and ad hoc questionnaires. The sample was divided into 3 groups according to how the substance consumption pattern changed during lockdown (maintained pattern, worsened pattern, and improved pattern). More than 62% of the patients maintained or worsened their consumption pattern during confinement, and about 38% improved throughout this time. Diverse factors were associated with the changes in pattern like age, addiction severity, psychological distress during lockdown, social and familial issues, and therapeutic variables. The home lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with major implications for substance consumption and psychiatric distress among SUD outpatients. Considering this, the need to plan appropriate interventions in cases of similar health crises is highlighted.","Grau-LÃƒÂ³pez, Daigre, Palma-Alvarez, Sorribes-Puertas, Serrano-PÃƒÂ©rez, Quesada-Franco, Segura, Coronado, Ramos-Quiroga, Colom","https://doi.org/10.1159/000521425","20220117","Anxiety; COVID-19; Consumption patterns; Dual diagnosis; Lockdown; Pandemic; Substance use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25672,""
"Sleep profiles as a longitudinal predictor for depression magnitude and variability following the onset of COVID-19","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disrupted multiple domains of life including sleep. The present study used a longitudinal dataset (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 671) and a person-centered analytic approach - latent profile analysis (LPA) - to elucidate the relationship between sleep and depression. We used LPA to identify profiles of sleep patterns assessed by Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at the beginning of the study. The profiles were then used as a predictor of depression magnitude and variability over time. Three latent profiles were identified (medicated insomnia sleepers [MIS], inefficient sleepers [IS], and healthy sleepers [HS]). MIS exhibited the highest level of depression magnitude over time, followed by IS, followed by HS. A slightly different pattern emerged for the variability of depression: While MIS demonstrated significantly greater depression variability than both IS and HS, IS and HS did not differ in their variability of depression over time. Medicated insomnia sleepers exhibited both the greatest depression magnitude and variability than inefficient sleepers and healthy sleepers, while the latter two showed no difference in depression variability despite inefficient sleepers' greater depression magnitude than healthy sleepers. Clinical implications and limitations are discussed.","Bi, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.01.024","20220117","COVID-19; Depression; Latent profile analysis; Longitudinal design; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25673,""
"Burnout and post-traumatic stress disorder in frontline nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of studies published in 2020","This study aimed to systematically synthesize evidence regarding burnout and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among nurses engaged in the frontline during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting their risk and protective factors. The specific literature on nurses' mental health outcomes still remains not synthesized. A systematic review was performed (PROSPERO: CRD42021227939), searching literature published in 2020 on Pubmed, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycInfo. We quantitatively pooled means of included studies measuring burnout and PTSD with the same tools. Twenty-five studies were included in this review. Seven (3766 nurses) were included in the meta-analysis for estimating means of depersonalization and emotional exhaustion assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, respectively: 7,40 (95%CI=6,00-8,80) and 22,82 (95%CI=19,24-26,41). Likely, 12 studies were used to estimate two pooled means for PTSD, one for six studies adopting the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (1551 nurses), and six adopting the PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (8547 nurses). The main risk and protective factors of both outcomes were female sex and younger age, work-related variables, and physical and mental factors, such as concerns, skin lesions from wearing personal protective equipment. This systematic review portrayed the situation described in literature during 2020 on nurses' burnout and PTSD during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Quarantine and Mental Health Challenges for Occupational Medicine: The Case Report of a Nurse Infected With SARS-CoV-2","This case study draws attention to the psychosocial difficulties that emerged in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in relation to the remote management of subjects with psychiatric vulnerabilities following exposure to prolonged quarantine. The case involves a 56-year-old hospital nurse, followed by the Occupational Health Department of a major university hospital in central Italy for mood instability in the context of a cyclothymic temperament. She was quarantined for occupationally acquired COVID-19 and remained positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via swab test for more than 2 months between March and May 2020. In this case study, we discuss the challenges presented by the risk of a prolonged quarantine in a psychologically vulnerable employee, the need for occupational medicine to provide adequate health surveillance of all health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of telepsychiatry, and the difficulties in formulating a proper treatment strategy.","Buselli, Corsi, Veltri, Baldanzi, Chiumiento, Del Lupo, Marino, Necciari, Caldi, Perretta, Foddis, Guglielmi, Cristaudo","https://doi.org/10.1177/21650799211045715","20220118","COVID-19; HCWs; SARS-CoV-2; cyclothymic temperament; health care workers; mental health; mood instability; quarantine; telepsychiatry; COVID-19; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Occupational Medicine; Pandemics; Psychiatry; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25676,""
"The effects of COVID-19 on the mental health and job stress of frontline homelessness services workers in Texas (US)","As the COVID-19 pandemic persists in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is a growing need to understand the impacts of the pandemic on essential and frontline workers. Given the dearth of research on the experiences of homelessness services workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study aimed to understand the impact of COVID-related stressors in the workplace on the wellbeing of the homelessness services workers in the state of Texas (U.S.). Using a cross-sectional survey design, the analysis focusses on examining the relationship between COVID stressors with mental health symptoms and job stress indictors. Data were collected from a sample of 132 frontline homelessness services workers across the state during April, May and June of 2021. Primary outcomes of interest were measured with the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-42) and the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL). Multiple linear regression models were specified to explore associations between the outcomes of interest and predictor variables (i.e. demographics, work experiences and COVID-19 stressors). Results showed that perceiving a decline in job satisfaction because of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with higher stress (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â ++0.18), 95% CI [.13, 6.68], higher burnout (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.32), 95% CI [2.54, 7.30] and lower compassion satisfaction (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.42), 95% CI [-8.14, -3.69]. Additionally, being worried about contracting COVID-19 at work was associated with an increase in burnout (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.19), 95% CI [.40, 4.79]. Also notable is that older age and Black/African American race were associated with lower stress, lower burnout and higher compassion satisfaction. Implications for supporting the homelessness sector through high-quality supervision, useful training, adequate benefits and routine check-ins are discussed.","Aykanian","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13723","20220117","COVID-19; Texas; burnout; homelessness; providers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25677,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the size of US transplant waiting lists","More patients are waitlisted for solid organs than transplants are performed each year. The COVID-19 pandemic immediately increased waitlist mortality and decreased transplants and listings. To calculate the number of candidate listings after the pandemic began and short-term changes that may affect waiting time, we conducted a Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients surveillance study from January 1, 2012, to February 28, 2021. The number of candidates on the liver waitlist continued a steady decline that began before the pandemic. Numbers of candidates on the kidney, heart, and lung waitlists decreased dramatically. More than 3000 fewer candidates were awaiting a kidney transplant on March 7, 2021, than on March 8, 2020. Listings and removals decreased for each solid organ beginning in March 2020. The number of heart and lung listings returned to equal or above that of removals. Listings for kidney transplant, which is often less urgent than heart and lung transplant, remain below numbers of removals. Removals due to transplant decreased for all organs, while removals due to death increased for only kidneys. We found no evidence of the predicted surge in listings for solid organ transplant with a plateau or control of the pandemic. This article is protected by copyright.

"Measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review","In response to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), governments have implemented a variety of measures to control the spread of the virus and the associated disease. Among these, have been measures to control the pandemic in primary and secondary school settings. To assess the effectiveness of measures implemented in the school setting to safely reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the COVID-19 pandemic, with particular focus on the different types of measures implemented in school settings and the outcomes used to measure their impacts on transmission-related outcomes, healthcare utilisation outcomes, other health outcomes as well as societal, economic, and ecological outcomes.Ã‚ SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Educational Resources Information Center, as well as COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease (indexing preprints) on 9 December 2020. We conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews. We considered experimental (i.e. randomised controlled trials; RCTs), quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of measures implemented in the school setting to safely reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcome categories were (i) transmission-related outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of cases); (ii) healthcare utilisation outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of hospitalisations); (iii) other health outcomes (e.g. physical, social and mental health); and (iv) societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. costs, human resources and education). We considered studies that included any population at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and/or developing COVID-19 disease including students, teachers, other school staff, or members of the wider community.Ã‚ DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author extracted data and critically appraised each study. One additional review author validated the extracted data. To critically appraise included studies, we used the ROBINS-I tool for quasi-experimental and observational studies, the QUADAS-2 tool for observational screening studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. Three review authors made an initial assessment of the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed and agreed on the ratings. We included 38 unique studies in the analysis, comprising 33 modelling studies, three observational studies, one quasi-experimental and one experimental study with modelling components. Measures fell into four broad categories: (i) measures reducing the opportunity for contacts; (ii) measures making contacts safer; (iii) surveillance and response measures; and (iv) multicomponent measures. As comparators, we encountered the operation of schools with no measures in place, less intense measures in place, single versus multicomponent measures in place, or closure of schools. Across all intervention categories and all study designs, very low- to low-certainty evidence ratings limit our confidence in the findings. Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the model structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to deviations from intended interventions or missing data. Across all categories, few studies reported on implementation or described how measures were implemented. Where we describe effects as 'positive', the direction of the point estimate of the effect favours the intervention(s); 'negative' effects do not favour the intervention.Ã‚ We found 23 modelling studies assessing measures reducing the opportunity for contacts (i.e. alternating attendance, reduced class size). Most of these studies assessed transmission and healthcare utilisation outcomes, and all of these studies showed a reduction in transmission (e.g. a reduction in the number or proportion of cases, reproduction number) and healthcare utilisation (i.e. fewer hospitalisations) and mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (i.e. fewer number of days spent in school). We identified 11 modelling studies and two observational studies assessing measures making contacts safer (i.e. mask wearing, cleaning, handwashing, ventilation). Five studies assessed the impact of combined measures to make contacts safer. They assessed transmission-related, healthcare utilisation, other health, and societal, economic and ecological outcomes. Most of these studies showed a reduction inÃ‚Â transmission, and a reduction in hospitalisations; however, studies showed mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (i.e. fewer number of days spent in school). We identified 13 modelling studies and one observational study assessing surveillance and response measures, including testing and isolation, and symptomatic screening and isolation. Twelve studies focused on mass testing and isolation measures, while two looked specifically at symptom-based screening and isolation. Outcomes included transmission, healthcare utilisation, other health, and societal, economic and ecological outcomes. Most of these studies showed effects in favour of the intervention in terms of reductions in transmission and hospitalisations, however some showed mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. fewer number of days spent in school). We found three studies that reported outcomes relating to multicomponent measures, where it was not possible to disaggregate the effects of each individual intervention, including one modelling, one observational and one quasi-experimental study. These studies employed interventions, such as physical distancing, modification of school activities, testing, and exemption of high-risk students, using measures such as hand hygiene and mask wearing. Most of these studies showed a reduction inÃ‚Â transmission, however some showed mixed or no effects.Ã‚Â Ã‚ As the majority of studies included in the review were modelling studies, there was a lack of empirical, real-world data, which meant that there were very little data on the actual implementation of interventions. Our review suggests that a broad range of measures implemented in the school setting can have positive impacts on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and on healthcare utilisation outcomes related to COVID-19. The certainty of the evidence for most intervention-outcome combinations is very low, and the true effects of these measures are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Measures implemented in the school setting may limit the number or proportion of cases and deaths, and may delay the progression of the pandemic. However, they may also lead to negative unintended consequences, such as fewer days spent in school (beyond those intended by the intervention). Further, most studies assessed the effects of a combination of interventions, which could not be disentangled to estimate their specific effects. Studies assessing measures to reduce contacts and to make contacts safer consistently predicted positive effects on transmission and healthcare utilisation, but may reduce the number of days students spent at school. Studies assessing surveillance and response measures predicted reductions in hospitalisations and school days missed due to infection or quarantine, however, there was mixed evidence on resources needed for surveillance. Evidence on multicomponent measures was mixed, mostly due to comparators. The magnitude of effects depends on multiple factors. New studies published since the original search date might heavily influence the overall conclusions and interpretation of findings for this review.","Krishnaratne, Littlecott, Sell, Burns, Rabe, Stratil, Litwin, Kreutz, Coenen, Geffert, Boger, Movsisyan, Kratzer, Klinger, Wabnitz, Strahwald, Verboom, Rehfuess, Biallas, Jung-Sievers, Voss, Pfadenhauer","https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015029","20220117","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25679,""
"Depression prevention in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Few studies have assessed depression in healthcare workers (HCWs) in Japan owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and no studies have proposed effective interventions to help support their mental health. To test the hypothesis that enhancing access to mental healthcare professionals helps to improve HCWs' mental health. This cross-sectional study assessed depressive symptoms in HCWs at three hospitals in Osaka prefecture between May and July, 2020. The survey obtained information on HCWs' mental state and related situations/perceptions. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms. Of the 3291 eligible HCWs, 1269 (39%) completed the survey. Of all HCWs, 87 (7%) were physicians, and 700 (55%) were nurses. A total of 181 (14%) HCWs had moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression. Being a frontline worker was not significantly associated with depressive symptoms (odds ratio: 0.86 [95% confidence intervals: 0.54-1.37], P = 0.50). The unwillingness to consult with anyone was significantly associated with more severe depressive symptoms (1.70 [1.10-2.63], P &lt; 0.01). HCWs who had no opportunity to confide in family/friends (1.66 [1.10-2.52], P &lt; 0.01) or colleagues/supervisors (3.19 [2.22-4.58], P &lt; 0.001) were significantly more likely to have depressive symptoms. Being a frontline HCW in a Japanese hospital treating patients with COVID-19 was not significantly associated with having depressive symptoms. The study highlights that encouraging daily communication with close persons (family, friends, colleagues and supervisors), rather than improving access to mental health professionals, might help to prevent depression in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Takada, Ae, Ogawa, Kagomoto","https://doi.org/10.1093/occmed/kqab192","20220117","Coronavirus disease 2019; depression; health personnel; healthcare worker; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25680,""
"Seeking and Sharing Mental Health Information on Social Media During COVID-19: Role of Depression and Anxiety, Peer Support, and Health Benefits","This study conducted a cross-sectional online survey (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°865) to determine whether self-ratings of depression and anxiety, perceived peer support, and perceived health benefits of social media predicted mental health-related information seeking and sharing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hierarchical regression models showed only depression self-ratings, anxiety self-ratings, and perceived health benefits predicted information seeking, whereas depression self-ratings, anxiety self-ratings, perceived peer support, and perceived health benefits all predicted information sharing. There was a statistically significant positive interaction of anxiety self-ratings and perceived peer support on information sharing. Participants' experience of COVID-19 predicted both information seeking and sharing. Mental health-related information seeking and sharing differed across social media platforms, with YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram used most for information seeking and Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter used most for information sharing. Findings suggest social media mental health-related seeking and sharing behaviors have the potential to facilitate coping surrounding mental health.","Akhther, Sopory","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41347-021-00239-x","20220117","COVID-19; Depression and anxiety; Information seeking; Information sharing; Mental health coping; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25681,""
"How Did Awareness, Emotion, and Motivation Shape Behavior Toward COVID-19 in Tunisians?","This study was conducted to assess the psychological distress in the general population of Tunisia during the pandemic of COVID-19 and examines how awareness of the disease, emotional experience, and motivation shaped the behavior toward this outbreak. The study covers 1492 Tunisian participants. Gender effects and age limits were studied in relation with the seriousness of the disease and lockdown impacts. The data were analyzed and interpreted using the chi-square test, ANOVA, path analysis (PA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). We found a significant effect of gender and age on the awareness of the pandemic dangerousness, the attitude, and the commitment to respect the preventive measures. Women are significantly more aware and committed than men to respect preventive health measures. The 35-45 age group showed more awareness and dedication than the other age groups, while the 20-35 age group showed the most less promise. PA and CFA results showed how awareness, emotion, and motivation shaped behavior toward COVID-19.

"Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes by targeting the Sigma-1 receptor disrupts cytoarchitecture and beating","SARS-CoV-2 infects cardiac cells and causes heart dysfunction. Conditions such as myocarditis and arrhythmia have been reported in COVID-19 patients. The Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) is a ubiquitously expressed chaperone that plays a central role in cardiomyocyte function. S1R has been proposed as a therapeutic target because it may affect SARS-CoV-2 replication; however, the impact of the inhibition of S1R in human cardiomyocytes remains to be described. In this study, we investigated the consequences of S1R inhibition in iPSC-derived human cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM). SARS-CoV-2 infection in hiPSC-CM was productive and reduced cell survival. S1R inhibition decreased both the number of infected cells and viral particles after 48 hours. S1R inhibition also prevented the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cell death. Although the S1R antagonist NE-100 triggered those protective effects, it compromised cytoskeleton integrity by downregulating the expression of structural-related genes and reducing beating frequency. Our findings suggest that the detrimental effects of S1R inhibition in human cardiomyocytes' integrity may abrogate its therapeutic potential against COVID and should be carefully considered.","Salerno, Torquato, Temerozo, Goto-Silva, Karmirian, Mendes, Sacramento, Fintelman-Rodrigues, Souza, Ornelas, VerÃƒÂ­ssimo, AragÃƒÂ£o, VitÃƒÂ³ria, Pedrosa, da Silva Gomes Dias, Cardoso Soares, Puig-Pijuan, Salazar, Dariolli, Biagi, Furtado, Barreto Chiarini, Borges, Bozza, Zaluar P GuimarÃƒÂ£es, Souza, Rehen","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.12595","20220117","Cardiomyocyte; IPSC; SARS-CoV-2; Sigma-1 Receptor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25683,""
"Impact of adaptive natural killer cells, KLRC2 genotype and cytomegalovirus reactivation on late mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 lung disease","SARS-CoV-2 infection results in severe lung disease in up to 50% of hospitalised patients. The aetiopathogenesis in a subset of such patients, who continue to have progressive pulmonary disease following virus clearance, remains unexplored. We investigated the role of NKG2C<sup>+</sup>/NKG2A<sup>-</sup> adaptive natural killer (ANK) cells, KLRC2 genotype and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in 22 such patients. The median duration of virus positivity was 23Ã¢â‚¬â€°days, and the median duration of hospitalisation was 48Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. The overall survival at 60Ã¢â‚¬â€°days in this group was 50%. Older age and comorbidities impacted survival negatively. CMV viraemia was documented in 11 patients, with a survival of 25% vs 80% in those without viraemia with viral load correlating with mortality. Both NK and T cells were markedly depressed in all patients at day 15. However, only persistently low ANK cells at 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°days along with an inversely high NKG2C<sup>-</sup>/NKG2A<sup>+</sup> inhibitory NK cells significantly correlated with high CMV viraemia and mortality, irrespective of KLRC2 genotype. However, day 30 ANK cells were significantly lower in the KLRC2 deletion group. The release of IFN-ÃŽÂ³ and perforin was severely compromised in all patients at day +15, with significant improvement in the survivors at day +30, but not in those with adverse outcome. Patients with progressive lung disease even after negative SARS-CoV-2 status, with persistently reduced and functionally compromised ANK cells, are more likely to have CMV reactivation and an adverse outcome, independent of KLRC2 genotype.","Jaiswal, Arunachalam, Bhardwaj, Saifullah, Lakhchaura, Soni, Bhagawati, Chakrabarti","https://doi.org/10.1002/cti2.1359","20220118","CMV; COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; KLRC2; NKG2C; adaptive NK cells","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25684,""
"Perception, knowledge and attitude towards influenza vaccine during COVID-19 pandemic in Jordanian population","Seasonal influenza is considered as one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This needs solutions to decrease burdens on the healthcare systems especially during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Population knowledge, perception and attitude towards influenza vaccine during COVID-19 pandemic could have a positive impact to decrease mortality, morbidity and burdens on the healthcare system. This study focuses on investigating knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of Jordanian adults towards influenza vaccine during COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study recruited 1112 randomly selected Jordanian adults. A four-part questionnaire was designed and included questions about the demographic and clinical characteristics, perception about influenza, attitudes towards the role of influenza vaccine during COVID-19 pandemic and the factors that affect respondents' practice towards influenza vaccine. 73.1% population were not vaccinated, and most were not willing to be vaccinated during the COVID-19 pandemic. 55% of the population thought that influenza vaccine decreased the burden on the Jordanian healthcare system. The major refusal factor to be vaccinated was because influenza was not considered as a threat (41.3%). People mostly got their information about influenza vaccine from social media (64.3%). The role of the pharmacist and physician was neglected. The reinforcement of the role of pharmacists, physician and media to educate people about the importance of influenza vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic is needed. Furthermore, campaigns should be conducted to increase the population awareness towards the importance of influenza vaccine uptake and its importance.","Zalloum, Elayeh, Ali, Zalloum","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2022.102100","20220118","Attitude; COVID-19; Influenza vaccine; Jordan; Knowledge; Perceptions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25685,""

This study aims to synthesize the extant literature reporting the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological outcomes of people in Southeast Asia, and its risk factors. A scoping review was adopted targeting articles published in PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus from January 2020 to March 30, 2021. Articles were screened using predetermined eligibility criteria, resulting in 26 papers. Elevated prevalence of adverse mental effects was noted in most of the countries as the pandemic progressed over time, with Malaysia and Philippines reporting higher prevalence rates. Mental decline was found to be more profound among the general population compared to healthcare workers and students. Dominant risk factors reported were age (younger), sex (females), education (higher), low coping skill and social/family support, and poor reliability in COVID-19 related information. Adverse mental effects were noted among population, healthcare workers and students in most of the Southeast Asian countries.

"Psychosocial Effects of COVID-19 Measures on (Pre-)Dementia Patients During Second Lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic poses enormous social challenges, especially during lockdown. People with cognitive decline and their caregivers are particularly at risk of lockdown consequences. To investigate psychosocial effects in (pre-)dementia patients and caregivers during second lockdown and compare effects between first and second lockdown. We included nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 511 (pre-)dementia patients and nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 826 caregivers from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort and via Alzheimer Nederland. All respondents completed a self-designed survey on psychosocial effects of COVID-19. We examined relations between experienced support and psychosocial and behavioral symptoms using logistic regression. In a subset of patients and caregivers we compared responses between first and second lockdown using generalized estimating equation. The majority of patients (Ã¢â€°Â¥58%) and caregivers (Ã¢â€°Â¥60%) reported that family and friends, hobbies, and music helped them cope. Support from family and friends was strongly related to less negative feelings in patients (loneliness: ORÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.3[0.1-0.6]) and caregivers (loneliness: ORÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.2[0.1-0.3]; depression: ORÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.4[0.2-0.5]; anxiety: ORÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.4[0.3-0.6]; uncertainty: ORÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.3[0.2-0.5]; fatigue: ORÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.3[0.2-0.4]; stress: ORÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.3[0.2-0.5]). In second lockdown, less psychosocial and behavioral symptoms were reported compared to first lockdown (patients; e.g., anxiety: 22% versus 13%, pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.007; apathy: 27% versus 8%, pÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.001, caregivers; e.g., anxiety: 23% versus 16%, pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.033; patient's behavioral problems: 50% versus 35%, pÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.001).

"A Proposed Brain-, Spine-, and Mental- Health Screening Methodology (NEUROSCREEN) for Healthcare Systems: Position of the Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics","The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated neurological, mental health disorders, and neurocognitive issues. However, there is a lack of inexpensive and efficient brain evaluation and screening systems. As a result, a considerable fraction of patients with neurocognitive or psychobehavioral predicaments either do not get timely diagnosed or fail to receive personalized treatment plans. This is especially true in the elderly populations, wherein only 16% of seniors say they receive regular cognitive evaluations. Therefore, there is a great need for development of an optimized clinical brain screening workflow methodology like what is already in existence for prostate and breast exams. Such a methodology should be designed to facilitate objective early detection and cost-effective treatment of such disorders. In this paper we have reviewed the existing clinical protocols, recent technological advances and suggested reliable clinical workflows for brain screening. Such protocols range from questionnaires and smartphone apps to multi-modality brain mapping and advanced imaging where applicable. To that end, the Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics (SBMT) proposes the Brain, Spine and Mental Health Screening (NEUROSCREEN) as a multi-faceted approach. Beside other assessment tools, NEUROSCREEN employs smartphone guided cognitive assessments and quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) as well as potential genetic testing for cognitive decline risk as inexpensive and effective screening tools to facilitate objective diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and guide personalized treatment interventions. Operationalizing NEUROSCREEN is expected to result in reduced healthcare costs and improving quality of life at national and later, global scales.","Nami, Thatcher, Kashou, Lopes, Lobo, Bolanos, Morris, Sadri, Bustos, Sanchez, Mohd-Yusof, Fiallos, Dye, Guo, Peatfield, Asiryan, Mayuku-Dore, Krakauskaite, Soler, Cramer, Besio, Berenyi, Tripathi, Hagedorn, Ingemanson, Gombosev, Liker, Salimpour, Mortazavi, Braverman, Prichep, Chopra, Eliashiv, Hariri, Tiwari, Green, Cormier, Hussain, Tarhan, Sipple, Roy, Yu, Filler, Chen, Wheeler, Ashford, Blum, Zelinsky, Yamamoto, Kateb","https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-215240","20220117","Brain mapping; brain screening; cMEG; mental health screening; neuro-screening; neurotechnologies; preventive medicine; qEEG","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25688,""
"Elephants in Nepal: Correlating disease, tourism, and welfare","Asian elephants and humans have long shared their lives, but recent changes in human perspectives on animal use have created ripples through the small country of Nepal. Captive elephants are caught in the crossfire between local communities, elephant owners, mahouts, and NGOs in debates over their treatment, health, welfare and use in tourism. In addition, zoonotic disease, natural disasters and political strife affect the lives of captive elephants and mahouts. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, elephants, caregivers and owners found themselves facing income loss, decreased welfare from housing and husbandry issues, and food shortages. Many owners sold elephants, fired mahouts, and ""quit"" the tourism industry. Others sought help from outside organizations, community members, and governmental agencies to retain ownership of what they viewed as valuable commodities. NGOs and grassroots organizations assisted in the hopes of keeping elephants in Nepal, thus preventing them from long, treacherous walks across the border and into situations where they might face further welfare decreases. This article combines elephant stable visits and interviews with mahouts, owners, NGO, and government staff between January 2019 and December 2021. It highlights the ongoing health and welfare challenges faced by elephants and mahouts in Nepal . .","Szydlowski","https://doi.org/10.1080/10888705.2022.2028628","20220117","Nepal; covid-19; disease; elephant; welfare","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25689,""
"COVID-19 Experiences and Mental Health Among Graduate and Undergraduate Nursing Students in Los Angeles","Nurses and nursing students are at risk for negative mental health as a result of significant work stressors from the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to (1) describe the mental health of nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) investigate relationships between stressful COVID-19 experiences and mental health, and (3) examine correlates of mental health service use. This observational study used a web-based survey to assess COVID-19 experiences, self-reported mental health, and mental health service utilization among nursing students in Los Angeles in spring 2021 (<i>N</i> = 174, 30.1% response rate). The survey used measures of stressful COVID-19 experiences (personal COVID-19 illness, hospitalization of close friends or family, and death of close friends or family), loneliness, resilience, depression, anxiety, COVID-19-related traumatic stress, and utilization of campus and noncampus mental health services. Students had high levels of depression (30%), anxiety (38%), and traumatic stress (30%). There was no relationship between stressful COVID-19 experiences and mental health, but loneliness was associated with higher odds of mental health problems and resilience with lower odds. Mental health problems were not associated with use of campus or noncampus mental health services. Students with primary caregiving responsibilities (<i>OR</i> = 0.22, 95% CI [0.05, 0.87]) and students who identified as Asian/Pacific Islander (<i>OR</i> = 0.24, 95% CI [0.09, 0.70]) had lower odds of mental health service utilization. Resilience and loneliness affect nursing student risk for negative mental health as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Targeted, accessible mental health support within nursing education programs may be warranted.","Jardon, Choi","https://doi.org/10.1177/10783903211072222","20220117","advocacy; college populations; community mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25690,""
"Impact on mental health of the COVID-19 pandemic in a radiation oncology department","To evaluate the emotional state and organizational well-being of healthcare workers in radiation oncology departments, during the COVID pandemic. A survey was carried out with three questionnaires: Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R); Italian ANAC questionnaire; and Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Comparisons between groups were done by Student's t test. Seventy-eight questionnaires for 26 workers were analyzed. Thirty-three percent of the sample obtained an IES-R high score, such as post-traumatic syndrome. In terms of organizational well-being, younger age and lower working seniority were statistically significant for higher score of ANAC items (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.5). Regarding MBI, 0, 27 and 50% high scores of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and personal accomplishment were reported, respectively. Low working seniority and male sex were correlated with high score of personal accomplishment (p:0.05; p:0.03).

"Understanding the conversation around COVID-19 and eating disorders: A thematic analysis of Reddit","Current research has found dramatic changes in the lives of those with eating disorders (EDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We build on existing research to investigate the long-term effects and adaptations that people with EDs have faced due to COVID-19 related changes. We collected 234 posts from three separate time periods from the subreddit r/EatingDisorders and analyzed them using thematic analysis. The posts were examined for initial patterns, and then those concepts were grouped into themes to reveal the authentic experiences of people living with EDs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, we found ""lack of control"" and ""familial influences (loved ones seeking support)"" emerge as themes within our broader data set throughout all three timeframes. There were additional themes that were present in only one or two of the collection periods. These themes consisted of ""symptom stress,"" ""technical stresses and concerns,"" and ""silver linings."" Our analysis shows that people with EDs have fought significantly during the pandemic. Initially, the (lack of) control and routine in their lives has caused symptoms to become more challenging, while being forced to move back home also caused significant stress. However, concerns transformed as the pandemic progressed, resulting in new pressures causing people to exhibit novel ED symptoms or relapse altogether. Also notable is the relatively few COVID-specific posts as the pandemic progressed, suggesting that people have accepted COVID as their ""new normal"" and begun to build resilience to the challenges associated. These are vital factors for clinicians to consider as they begin taking existing and new patients, particularly as face-to-face treatment options become a possibility again. Existing research shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the lives of people who live with eating disorders in various ways. First, the pandemic has placed barriers on the path to recovery by limiting coping mechanism (and sometimes removing them altogether) and changing their relationships with food and the people in their lives. Second, the pandemic has forced treatment options to change since ED patients can no longer seek treatment face-to-face. Finally, there have been unexpected benefits to the pandemic, such as allowing individuals time to slow down and focus on their mental health. Previous studies examined individuals in clinical contexts rather than in their natural environments. We explored an online forum for people with eating disorders for the various themes that were discussed at three points over the period of March 2020-December 2020 and found that many people with EDs report worsening symptoms or relapse. However, we also noted that, compared to the beginning of the pandemic, people seemed to be less frequently asking for support during the third data collection period, implying an adaptation to the ""new normal"" of life in a pandemic. We conclude with a discussion of the findings.","Shields, Taylor, Welch","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-022-00530-z","20220116","COVID-19; Eating disorders; Reddit; Thematic analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25692,""
"Noninvasive respiratory support for COVID-19 patients: when, for whom, and how?","The significant mortality rate and prolonged ventilator days associated with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in patients with severe COVID-19 have incited a debate surrounding the use of noninvasive respiratory support (NIRS) (i.e., HFNC, CPAP, NIV) as a potential treatment strategy. Central to this debate is the role of NIRS in preventing intubation in patients with mild respiratory disease and the potential beneficial effects on both patient outcome and resource utilization. However, there remains valid concern that use of NIRS may prolong time to intubation and lung protective ventilation in patients with more advanced disease, thereby worsening respiratory mechanics via self-inflicted lung injury. In addition, the risk of aerosolization with the use of NIRS has the potential to increase healthcare worker (HCW) exposure to the virus. We review the existing literature with a focus on rationale, patient selection and outcomes associated with the use of NIRS in COVID-19 and prior pandemics, as well as in patients with acute respiratory failure due to different etiologies (i.e., COPD, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, etc.) to understand the potential role of NIRS in COVID-19 patients. Based on this analysis we suggest an algorithm for NIRS in COVID-19 patients which includes indications and contraindications for use, monitoring recommendations, systems-based practices to reduce HCW exposure, and predictors of NIRS failure. We also discuss future research priorities for addressing unanswered questions regarding NIRS use in COVID-19 with the goal of improving patient outcomes.","Sullivan, Zazzeron, Berra, Hess, Bittner, Chang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40560-021-00593-1","20220116","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); Acute respiratory failure (ARF); COVID-19; Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP); H1N1; High flow nasal cannula (HFNC); Hypoxemic respiratory failure; Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV); MERS; Noninvasive respiratory support (NIRS); Noninvasive ventilation (NIV); SARS","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25693,""
"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the UK: a longitudinal household cross-sectional study","The approved COVID-19 vaccines have shown great promise in reducing disease transmission and severity of outcomes. However, the success of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout is dependent on public acceptance and willingness to be vaccinated. In this study, we aim to examine how the attitude towards public sector officials and the government impact vaccine willingness. The secondary aim is to understand the impact of ethnicity on vaccine-willingness after we explicitly account for trust in public institutions. This cross-sectional study used data from a UK population based longitudinal household survey (Understanding Society COVID-19 study, Understanding Society: the UK Household Longitudinal Study) between April 2020-January 2021. Data from 22,421 participants in Waves 6 and 7 of the study were included after excluding missing data. Demographic details in addition to previous survey responses relating to public sector/governmental trust were included as covariates in the main analysis. A logit model was produced to describe the association between public sector/governmental mistrust and the willingness for vaccination with interaction terms included to account for ethnicity/socio-economic status. In support of existing literature, we identified those from BAME groups were more likely to be unwilling to take the COVID-19 vaccine. We found that positive opinions towards public sector officials (OR 2.680: 95% CI 1.888 - 3.805) and the UK government (OR 3.400; 95% CI 2.454-4.712) led to substantive increase in vaccine willingness. Most notably we identified this effect to vary across ethnicity and socio-economic status with those from South Asian background (OR 4.513; 95% CI 1.012-20.123) and possessing a negative attitude towards public officials and the government being the most unwilling to be vaccinated. These findings suggests that trust in public sector officials play a key factor in the low vaccination rates particularly seen in at-risk groups. Given the additional morbidity/mortality risk posed by COVID-19 to those from lower socio-economic or ethnic minority backgrounds, there needs to be urgent public health action to review how to tailor health promotion advice given to these groups and examine methods to improve trust in public sector officials and the government.","Chaudhuri, Chakrabarti, Chandan, Bandyopadhyay","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-12472-3","20220116","COVID-19; Ethnicity; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-19","",25694,""

The diagnosis of hypogonadism was established. Then the patient was ordered to maintain mental health outward of hospital without drug intervention. One month after presentation, his gonadotropin hormone level and sexual desire had recovered, while bilateral gynecomastia and erectile dysfunction symptoms disappeared.

"Risk Factors for Depression and Anxiety During COVID-19 in Israel: A Two-Wave Study Before and During the Pandemic","Research indicates that mental health problems increased across the globe after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a need for research examining specific risk factors for mental health problems, while accounting for symptoms before the pandemic. This study examined risk factors for depression and anxiety symptoms among Israeli adults following the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, above and beyond depression and anxiety symptoms reported three years before the pandemic. We performed a two-wave 3-year longitudinal study (W1 July-September 2017; W2 May-June 2020). The final sample included 578 participants who completed anxiety and depression self-report questionnaires at both waves. The W2 assessment additionally included being considered high-risk for COVID, and measures regarding loneliness, perceived stress, and COVID-19 worries. Both anxiety and depression symptoms were significantly higher at W2 during the pandemic. Worries related to COVID-19, perceived stress, loneliness, and prior mental health symptoms predicted depression and anxiety in W2. Additionally, being younger was associated with W2 anxiety. The current study highlights risk factors for psychological distress in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Attention of clinicians and policy makers should be given to the important role of loneliness when screening and treating people during this pandemic. This article is protected by copyright.
