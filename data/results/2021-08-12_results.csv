"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Early Child Cognitive Development: Initial Findings in a Longitudinal Observational Study of Child Health","Since the first reports of novel coronavirus in the 2020, public health organizations have advocated preventative policies to limit virus, including stay-at-home orders that closed businesses, daycares, schools, playgrounds, and limited child learning and typical activities. Fear of infection and possible employment loss has placed stress on parents; while parents who could work from home faced chal-lenges in both working and providing full-time attentive childcare. For pregnant individuals, fear of at-tending prenatal visits also increased maternal stress, anxiety, and depression. Not surprising, there has been concern over how these factors, as well as missed educational opportunities and reduced interaction, stimulation, and creative play with other children might impact child neurodevelopment. Lev-eraging a large on-going longitudinal study of child neurodevelopment, we examined general childhood cognitive scores in 2020 and 2021 vs. the preceding decade, 2011-2019. We find that children born during the pandemic have significantly reduced verbal, motor, and overall cognitive performance com-pared to children born pre-pandemic. Moreover, we find that males and children in lower socioeconom-ic families have been most affected. Results highlight that even in the absence of direct SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness, the environmental changes associated COVID-19 pandemic is signifi-cantly and negatively affecting infant and child development.","Sean Deoni; Jennifer Beauchemin; Alexandra Volpe; Viren D'Sa","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.10.21261846","20210811","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17015,""
"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence and Drug Use in Trauma Patients from Six Sites in the United States","In comparison to the general patient population, trauma patients show higher level detections of bloodborne infectious diseases, such as Hepatitis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus. In comparison to bloodborne pathogens, the prevalence of respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2 and how that relates with other variables, such as drug usage and trauma type, is currently unknown in trauma populations. Here, we evaluated SARSCoV2 seropositivity and antibody isotype profile in 2,542 trauma patients from six Level 1 trauma centers between April and October of 2020 during the first wave of the COVID19 pandemic. We found that the seroprevalence in trauma victims 18 to 44 years old (9.79%, 95% confidence interval/CI: 8.33 - 11.47) was much higher in comparison to older patients (45-69 years old: 6.03%, 4.59-5.88; 70+ years old: 4.33%, 2.54 - 7.20). Black/African American (9.54%, 7.77 - 11.65) and Hispanic/Latino patients (14.95%, 11.80 - 18.75) also had higher seroprevalence in comparison, respectively, to White (5.72%, 4.62 - 7.05) and Non-Latino patients (6.55%, 5.57 - 7.69). More than half (55.54%) of those tested for drug toxicology had at least one drug present in their system. Those that tested positive for depressants had a significant negative correlation with seropositivity, while those on anti-depressants trended positive. These findings represent an important consideration for both the patients and first responders that treat trauma patients facing potential risk of respiratory infectious diseases like SARSCoV2.","Tran B Ngo; Maria Karkanitsa; Kenneth M Adusei; Lindsey A Graham; Emily E Ricotta; Jenna R Darrah; Richard D Blomberg; Jacquelyn Spathies; Kyle J Pauly; Carleen Klumpp-Thomas; Jameson Travers; Jennifer Mehalko; Matthew Drew; Matthew D Hall; Matthew J Memoli; Dominic Esposito; Rosemary A Kozar; Christopher Griggs; Kyle W Cunningham; Carl I Schulman; Marie Crandall; Mark Neavyn; Jon D Dorfman; Jeffrey T Lai; Jennifer M Whitehill; Kavita M Babu; Nicholas M Mohr; Jon Van Heukelom; James C Fell; Whit Rooke; Heather Kalish; F.

"Heterogeneity in COVID-19 Pandemic-Induced Lifestyle Stressors Predicts Mental Health in Adults and Children in the US and UK","Identifying predictors of mental health symptoms after the initial phase of the pandemic may inform the development of targeted interventions to reduce its negative long-term mental health consequences. In the current study, we aimed to simultaneously evaluate the prospective influence of life change stress, personal COVID-19 impact, prior mental health, worry about COVID-19, state-level indicators of pandemic threat, and socio-demographic factors on mood and anxiety symptoms in November 2020 among adults and children in the US and UK. We used a longitudinal cohort study using the Coronavirus Health Impact Survey (CRISIS) collected at 3 time points: an initial assessment in April 2020 (April), a reassessment 3 weeks later (May), and a 7-month follow-up in November 2020 (November). Online surveys were collected in the United States and United Kingdom by Prolific Academic, a survey recruitment service, with a final sample of 859 Adults and 780 children (collected via parent report). We found subtypes of pandemic-related life change stress in social and economic domains derived through Louvain Community Detection. We assessed recalled mood and perceived mental health prior to the pandemic; worries about COVID-19; personal and family impacts of COVID-19; and socio-demographic characteristics. Levels of mood symptoms in November 2020 measured with the circumplex model of affect. We found 3 life change stress subtypes among adults and children: Lower Social/Lower Economic (adults and children), Higher Social/Higher Economic (adults and children), Lower Social/Higher Economic (adults), and Intermediate Social/Lower Economic (children). Overall, mood symptoms decreased between April and November 2020, but shifting from lower to higher-stress subtypes between time points was associated with increasing symptoms. For both adults and children, the most informative predictors of mood symptoms in November identified by conditional random forest models were prior mood and perceived mental health, worries about COVID, and sources of life change. The relative importance of these predictors was the most prominent difference in findings between adults and children, with lifestyle changes stress regarding friendships being more predictive of mood outcomes than worries about COVID in children. In the US, objective state-level indicators of COVID-19 threat were less predictive of November mood than these other predictors. We found that in addition to the well-established influences of prior mood and worry, heterogeneous subtypes of pandemic-related stress were differentially associated with mood after the initial phase of the pandemic. Greater research on diverse patterns of pandemic experience may elucidate modifiable targets for treatment and prevention.","Aki Nikolaidis; Jacob DeRosa; Mirelle Kass; Irene Droney; Lindsay Alexander; Adriana Di Martino; Evelyn Bromet; Kathleen Merikangas; Michael Milham; Diana Paksarian","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.10.21261860","20210811","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17017,""
"Mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents with chronic health conditions","Objective: To investigate the changes in mental health and activities of children with chronic health conditions (CHC) during the pandemic. Additionally, to gather information from parents about healthcare experiences, family stressors and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: A prospective longitudinal single site cohort study Setting: Royal Childrens Hospital, Melbourne, Australia Participants: 151 parents of children aged 1.5-17 years (M = 9.8 years, 58.3% male) with a CHC (colorectal disorder, cleft palate and neurofibromatosis type 1) completed the survey. Main outcome measures: An adapted version of the COVID-19 Wellbeing and Mental Health Survey for Children and Adolescents (Parent/Caregiver version) (CRISIS) was utilised. The CRISIS tool collects data on child activities and mental health and parent mental health prior to, and during, the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare experiences families was also examined. Parents completed the Kessler 10. Results: Compared to pre-COVID lockdown, parents reported their children were experiencing higher rates of loneliness, irritability, worry and anxiety. Parents reported that the restrictions in face-to-face contact with family and friends had been stressful for 80.0% of children. The activities of the children changed considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic with screen time increasing by 40%. Thirty percent of parents reported significant distress of their own. Parents felt telehealth were of poorer quality than face-to-face appointments. Conclusions: Children with CHC experienced a significant increase in mental health symptoms during lockdown for the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the increased need for clinical monitoring for children with CHC during periods of community stress and restrictions.","Louise Crowe; Cathriona Clarke; Stephen Hearps; Remy Pugh; Nicky Kilpatrick; Emma Branson; Jonathan Payne; Kristina Haebich; Natalie McCloughan; Chris Kintakas; Genevieve Charles; Misel Trajanovska; Ivy Hsieh; Penny Hartmann; Sebastian King; Nicholas Anderson; Vicki Anderson","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.10.21261816","20210811","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17018,""

"Promoting youth mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study","The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced novel stressors into the lives of youth. Identifying factors that protect against the onset of psychopathology in the face of these stressors is critical. We examine a wide range of factors that may protect youth from developing psychopathology during the pandemic. We assessed pandemic-related stressors, internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, and potential protective factors by combining two longitudinal samples of children and adolescents (N = 224, 7-10 and 13-15 years) assessed prior to the pandemic, during the stay-at-home orders, and six months later. We evaluated how family behaviors during the stay-at-home orders were related to changes in psychopathology during the pandemic, identified factors that moderate the association of pandemic-related stressors with psychopathology, and determined whether associations varied by age. Internalizing and externalizing psychopathology increased substantially during the pandemic. Higher exposure to pandemic-related stressors was associated with increases in internalizing and externalizing symptoms early in the pandemic and six months later. Having a structured routine, less passive screen time, lower exposure to news media about the pandemic, and to a lesser extent more time in nature and getting adequate sleep were associated with reduced psychopathology. The association between pandemic-related stressors and psychopathology was reduced for youths with limited passive screen time and was absent for children, but not adolescents, with lower news media consumption related to the pandemic. We provide insight into simple, practical steps families can take to promote resilience against mental health problems in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic and protect against psychopathology following pandemic-related stressors.","Rosen, Rodman, Kasparek, Mayes, Freeman, Lengua, Meltzoff, McLaughlin","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255294","20210811","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17021,""
"Psychological distress and health-related quality of life in patients after hospitalization during the COVID-19 pandemic: A single-center, observational study","Illnesses requiring hospitalization are known to negatively impact psychological well-being and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after discharge. The impact of hospitalization during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic on psychological well-being and health-related quality of life is expected to be higher due to the exceptional circumstances within and outside the hospital during the pandemic surge. The objective of this study was to quantify psychological distress up to three months after discharge in patients hospitalized during the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic wave. We also aimed to determine HRQoL, to explore predictors for psychological distress and HRQoL, and to examine whether psychological distress was higher in COVID-19 confirmed patients, and in those treated in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). In this single-center, observational cohort study, adult patients hospitalized with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 between March 16 and April 28, 2020, were enrolled. Patients were stratified in analyses based on SARS-CoV-2 PCR results and the necessity for ICU treatment. The primary outcome was psychological distress, expressed as symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, up to three months post-discharge. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was the secondary outcome. Exploratory outcomes comprised predictors for psychological distress and HRQoL. 294 of 622 eligible patients participated in this study (median age 64 years, 36% female). 16% and 13% of these patients reported probable PTSD, 29% and 20% probable anxiety, and 32% and 24% probabledepression at one and three months after hospital discharge, respectively. ICU patients reported less frequently probable depression, but no differences were found in PTSD, anxiety, or overall HRQoL. COVID-19 patients had a worse physical quality of life one month after discharge, and ICU patients reported a better mental quality of life three months after discharge. PTSD severity was predicted by time after discharge and being Caucasian. Severity of anxiety was predicted by time after discharge and being Caucasian. Depression severity was predicted by time after discharge and educational level. COVID-19 suspected patients hospitalized during the pandemic frequently suffer from psychological distress and poor health-related quality of life after hospital discharge. Non-COVID-19 and non-ICU patients appear to be at least as affected as COVID-19 and ICU patients, underscoring that (post-)hospital pandemic care should not predominantly focus on COVID-19 infected patients.","Vlake, Wesselius, van Genderen, van Bommel, Boxma-de Klerk, Wils","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255774","20210811","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17022,""
"Mild and Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection Induces Respiratory and Intestinal Microbiome Changes in the K18-hACE2 Transgenic Mouse Model","Transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in millions of deaths and declining economies around the world. K18-hACE2 mice develop disease resembling severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in a virus dose-dependent manner. The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the intestinal or respiratory microbiome is not fully understood. In this context, we characterized the cecal and lung microbiomes of SARS-CoV-2-challenged K18-hACE2 transgenic mice in the presence or absence of treatment with the M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor GC-376. Cecum microbiome showed decreased Shannon and inverse (Inv) Simpson diversity indexes correlating with SARS-CoV-2 infection dosage and a difference of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distances among control and infected mice. Bacterial phyla such as Firmicutes, particularly, Lachnospiraceae and Oscillospiraceae, were significantly less abundant, while Verrucomicrobia, particularly, the family Akkermansiaceae, were increasingly more prevalent during peak infection in mice challenged with a high virus dose. In contrast to the cecal microbiome, the lung microbiome showed similar microbial diversity among the control, low-, and high-dose challenge virus groups, independent of antiviral treatment. Bacterial phyla in the lungs such as Bacteroidetes decreased, while Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were significantly enriched in mice challenged with a high dose of SARS-CoV-2. In summary, we identified changes in the cecal and lung microbiomes of K18-hACE2 mice with severe clinical signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of deaths. The host's respiratory and intestinal microbiome can affect directly or indirectly the immune system during viral infections. We characterized the cecal and lung microbiomes in a relevant mouse model challenged with a low or high dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the presence or absence of an antiviral M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor, GC-376. Decreased microbial diversity and taxonomic abundances of the phyla Firmicutes, particularly, Lachnospiraceae, correlating with infection dosage were observed in the cecum. In addition, microbes within the family Akkermansiaceae were increasingly more prevalent during peak infection, which is observed in other viral infections. The lung microbiome showed similar microbial diversity to that of the control, independent of antiviral treatment. Decreased Bacteroidetes and increased Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were observed in the lungs in a virus dose-dependent manner. These studies add to a better understanding of the complexities associated with the intestinal microbiome during respiratory infections.","Seibert, CÃƒÂ¡ceres, Cardenas-Garcia, Carnaccini, Geiger, Rajao, Ottesen, Perez","https://doi.org/10.1128/Spectrum.00536-21","20210811","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; cecum; intestine; lung; microbiome; mouse; respiratory infection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17023,""

"Impact of social isolation and coping strategies in older adults with mild cognitive impairment during the covid-19 pandemic: A qualitative study","The objective of this study was to explore the experiences and feelings of older adults with MCI during the COVID-19 outbreak in Chile and to know what strategies they used to overcome social isolation. A qualitative design was used. Ten participants with a diagnosis of MCI took part in this study. All interviews were recorded and coded using thematic analysis. The thematic analysis identified three themes related to the quarantine experience of older adults with MCI diagnosis: (1) Effects of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic (2) Believes, feelings and behaviors about the SARS-CoV-2 virus (3) Coping with social isolation/response to difficulties during the pandemic. It was found that older adults with MCI have been mainly psychologically and socially affected by social distancing and isolation, particularly individuals who were alone during COVID-19 outbreak. The only physical dimension negatively affected was the level of activity. Social isolation led to a significant number of negative emotions such as anger, fear of contracting the virus or possibility of contagion for their families, worries and sadness as well as emotional loneliness. It is noteworthy that the majority of participants have used several coping strategies during this challenging time. Since social isolation and a sedentary life have been associated with poorer cognition and functionality in people with MCI, a rational plan to both prevent the progression of cognitive decline and to increase social contact, is essential. Special attention must be drawn to maintaining people physically active at home and keeping their daily routine (within the possibilities) and also to ensure social connectedness through technology. Implementation of these measures could potentially reduce negative emotions during the pandemic.","Farhang, Miranda-Castillo, Behrens, Castillo, Mosquera Amar, Rojas","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1958145","20210811","COVID-19 pandemic; mild cognitive impairment; older adults; qualitative study; quarantine experience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17026,""
"Prevalence and Correlates of Suicidal Ideation and Deliberate Self-harm in Canadian Adolescents During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","In light of recent evidence that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in marked increases in depression, anxiety, substance use, and other mental health concerns among Canadian adolescents, we investigated the rates of self-harm thoughts and behaviours in this population. Specifically, this study explored: (1) the demographic and geographic distributions of suicidal ideation (SI) and deliberate self-harm (DSH), and (2) the associations of mental health and substance use with SI and DSH. A total of 809 Canadian adolescents, aged 12-18 years, completed an online survey between June 17, 2020 and July 31, 2020. 44% of adolescents reported experiencing SI since the pandemic began, while 32% reported engaging in DSH. SI and DSH were more common among youth who: identified as transgender, non-binary or gender fluid; who did not reside with both parents; and who reported psychiatric concerns or frequent cannabis use. Canadian adolescents appear to be experiencing higher rates of self-harm thoughts and behaviours relative to before the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important for adults who are likely to interact with distressed youth to be aware of potential warning signs that a youth is struggling with self-harm, and to refer youth to specialty mental health services where appropriate.","Turner, Robillard, Ames, Craig","https://doi.org/10.1177/07067437211036612","20210811","adolescence; child and adolescent psychiatry; self harm; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17027,""
"Living in rural area:a protective factor for a negative experience of the lockdown and the COVID-19 crisis in the oldest old population?","Some factors influence the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic (health, loneliness, digital access...), but what about the living area? The objective was to compare between rural and urban areas, the psychological and social experiences of the older individuals with regard to the COVID-19 crisis during the first French lockdown. The sample included participants of three existing population-based cohorts on aging. Telephone interviews conducted by psychologists focused on the lockdown period. Data collected included living environment, professional assistance, social support, contacts with relatives, difficulties encountered, health, and knowledge and representations of the epidemic. The negative experience was defined by the presence of at least two of the following items: high anxiety symptomatology, depressive symptoms, worries or difficulties during the lockdown and insufficient social support. The sample included 467 participants, aged on average 87.5 years (5.2), 58.9% were female and 47.1% lived in rural areas. Persons living in rural area had better social support, greater family presence, a less frequent feeling of imprisonment (OR=0.60, 95CI%=0.36-0.99), 95% had a garden (vs. 56%), fewer depressive symptoms and lower anxiety scores, but also tended to lower comply with the health measures. Finally, they had an almost twofold lower risk of having a negative experience of the lockdown compared to their urban counterparts (OR = 0.55, 95%CI=0.33-0.92, p=0.0223). The oldest old living in rural area experienced the first lockdown better than the urbans. Living conditions, with access to nature, a greater social support and family presence, could have contributed to these findings. This article is protected by copyright.

"Health-related quality of life, uncertainty and coping strategies in solid organ transplant recipients during shielding for the COVID-19 pandemic","Strict isolation of vulnerable individuals has been a strategy implemented by authorities to protect people from COVID-19. Our objective was to investigate health-related quality of life (HRQoL), uncertainty and coping behaviours in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey of adult SOT recipients undergoing follow-up at our institution was performed. Perceived health status, uncertainty and coping strategies were assessed using the EQ-5D-5L, Short-Form Mishel Uncertainty-in-Illness scale (SF-MUIS) and Brief Cope, respectively. Interactions with COVID-19 risk perception, access to healthcare, demographic and clinical variables were assessed. The survey was completed by 826 of 3,839 (21.5%) invited participants. Overall, low levels of uncertainty-in-illness were reported, and acceptance was the major coping strategy (92%). Coping by acceptance, feeling protected, self-perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 were associated with lower levels of uncertainty. Health status index scores were significantly lower for those with mental health illness, compromised access to healthcare, a perceived high risk of severe COVID-19 infection and higher levels of uncertainty. A history of mental health illness, risk perceptions, restricted healthcare access, uncertainty and coping strategies were associated with poorer HRQoL in SOT recipients during strict isolation. These findings may allow identification of strategies to improve HRQoL in SOT recipients during the pandemic.","McKay, Lembach, Hann, Okoth, Anderton, Nirantharakumar, Magill, Torlinska, Armstrong, Mascaro, Inston, Pinkney, Ranasinghe, Borrows, Ferguson, Isaac, Calvert, Perera, Hartog","https://doi.org/10.1111/tri.14010","20210811","COVID-19; health-related quality of life; isolation; mental health; shielding; transplant","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17029,""
"Analyzing COVID-19 Using Multisource Data: An Integrated Approach of Visualization, Spatial Regression, and Machine Learning","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. As the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths worldwide continues to increase rapidly, the prevention and control of COVID-19 remains urgent. This article aims to analyze COVID-19 from a geographical perspective, and this information can provide useful insights for rapid visualization of spatial-temporal epidemic information and identification of the factors important to the spread of COVID-19. A new type of vitalization method, called the point grid map, is integrated with calendar-based visualization to show the spatial-temporal variations in COVID-19. The combination of mixed geographically weighted regression (mixed GWR) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is used to identify the potential factors and the corresponding importance. The visualization results clearly reflect the spatial-temporal patterns of COVID-19. The quantified results reveal that the impact of population outflow from Wuhan is the most important factor and indicate statistically significant spatial heterogeneity. Our results provide insights into how multisource big geodata can be employed within the framework of integrating visualization and analytical methods to characterize COVID-19 trends. In addition, this work can help understand the influential factors for controlling and preventing epidemics, which is important for policy design and effective decision-making for controlling COVID-19. The results reveal that one of the most effective ways to control COVID-19 include controlling the source of infection, cutting off the transmission route, and protecting vulnerable groups.","Wu, Zhou, Liu, Yang","https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GH000439","20210811","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; XGBoost; geographical perspective; mixed GWR; spatialÃ¢â‚¬Âtemporal patterns; visualization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17030,""

"Monitoring the impact of Movement Control Order (MCO) in flattening the cummulative daily cases curve of Covid-19 in Malaysia: A generalized logistic growth modeling approach","COVID-19 has affected almost every country in the world, which causing many negative implications in terms of education, economy and mental health. Worryingly, the trend of second or third wave of the pandemic has been noted in multiple regions despite early success of flattening the curve, such as in the case of Malaysia, post Sabah state election in September 2020. Hence, it is imperative to predict ongoing trend of COVID-19 to assist crucial policymaking in curbing the transmission. Generalized logistic growth modelling (GLM) approach was adopted to make prediction of growth of cases according to each state in Malaysia. The data was obtained from official Ministry of Health Malaysia daily report, starting from 26 September 2020 until 1 January 2021. Sabah, Johor, Selangor and Kuala Lumpur are predicted to exceed 10,000 cumulative cases by 2 February 2021. Nationally, the growth factor has been shown to range between 0.25 to a peak of 3.1 throughout the current Movement Control Order (MCO). The growth factor range for Sabah ranged from 1.00 to 1.25, while Selangor, the state which has the highest case, has a mean growth factor ranging from 1.22 to 1.52. The highest growth rates reported were in WP Labuan for the time periods of 22 Nov - 5 Dec 2020 with growth rates of 4.77. States with higher population densities were predicted to have higher cases of COVID-19. GLM is helpful to provide governments and policymakers with accurate and helpful forecasts on magnitude of epidemic and peak time. This forecast could assist government in devising short- and long-term plan to tackle the ongoing pandemic.","Pang, Kamu, Mohd Kassim, Ho","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2021.07.004","20210811","COVID-19; Forecast; Generalized logistic growth modelling; Malaysia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17032,""
"Dynamic functional connectivity associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms in COVID-19 survivors","Accumulating evidence shows that Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) survivors may encounter prolonged mental issues, especially post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Despite manifesting a plethora of behavioral or mental issues in COVID-19 survivors, previous studies illustrated that static brain functional networks of these survivors remain intact. The insignificant results could be due to the conventional statistic network analysis was unable to reveal information that can vary considerably in different temporal scales. In contrast, time-varying characteristics of the dynamic functional networks may help reveal important brain abnormalities in COVID-19 survivors. To test this hypothesis, we assessed PTSS and collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with COVID-19 survivors discharged from hospitals and matched controls. Results showed that COVID-19 survivors self-reported a significantly higher PTSS than controls. Tapping into the moment-to-moment variations of the fMRI data, we captured the dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) states, and three discriminative reoccurring brain dFNC states were identified. First of all, COVID-19 survivors showed an increased occurrence of a dFNC state with heterogeneous patterns between sensorimotor and visual networks. More importantly, the occurrence rate of this state was significantly correlated with the severity of PTSS. Finally, COVID-19 survivors demonstrated decreased topological organizations in this dFNC state than controls, including the node strength, degree, and local efficiency of the supplementary motor area. To conclude, our findings revealed the altered temporal characteristics of functional networks and their associations with PTSS due to COVID- 19. The current results highlight the importance of evaluating dynamic functional network changes with COVID-19 survivors.","Fu, Tu, Calhoun, Zhang, Zhao, Chen, Meng, Lu, Hu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ynstr.2021.100377","20210811","Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19); Dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC); Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Mental health; Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17033,""
"Telepsychiatry for Patients with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder During the COVID-19 Outbreak","The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged from Wuhan, China, causing a pandemic. Access to outpatient psychiatric care was limited. We conducted a pilot study of telepsychiatry during a national shutdown. Adult patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) participated via Zoom. Patient preference comparing televisits to face-to-face visits was assessed. Telemedicine has emerged as new technological tool in the evolution of the patient-physician relationship, changing the way we interact. Physicians and patients now have access to the electronic medical record, remote point-of-care testing, and each other. The present epidemic allows us to test the limits of technology in combating limited access to care for patients with psychiatric illness. Twenty (90% male) patients with PTSD participated. Most (90 %) were moderately to severely depressed, and 50% used medical cannabis and increased their dosage during the study period. Patients preferred face-to-face meetings for its ease of use (p &lt; .01) and general satisfaction from therapy (p &lt; .01). However, given continued outbreak-limiting access to care, most patients stated they would continue with telepsychiatry. While most patients preferred face-to-face visits, telepsychiatry can be used during times of outbreak-limiting access to care. Future research and development should be directed at improving technological ease of use.","Malka, Gropp, Jaworowski, Oberbaum, Katz","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40501-021-00245-z","20210811","Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19); Depression; PatientÃ¢â‚¬â€œdoctor relationship; Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); Social distancing; Telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17034,""

She was successfully treated by pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. She was examined by forensic psychiatrists leading to the conclusion that her responsibility was highly diminished, and her reoffending risk was low.

"Knowledge, attitude, and practice of healthcare workers toward COVID-19 and its prevention in Ethiopia: A multicenter study","An emerging respiratory disease abbreviated as coronavirus disease 2019 was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan city of China. The virus is zoonotic and tends to be transmitted between animals to humans and humans to humans. The major route of transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 is droplet and close contact. The Ethiopian Ministry of Health has initiated training for health care workers at a different level. Thus, the main objective of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of health workers in Ethiopia toward coronavirus disease 2019 and its prevention techniques. An institution-based multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted in each of eight teaching and referral hospitals. A total of 422 Ethiopian healthcare workers were selected for the assessment of knowledge, attitude, and practice toward coronavirus disease 2019. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with the attitude and knowledge of healthcare workers toward coronavirus disease 2019 at a significance level of p &lt; 0.05. Three hundred ninety-seven healthcare workers participated in the study, with a response rate of 94%.

"Wrist actigraphic approach in primary, secondary and tertiary care based on the principles of predictive, preventive and personalised (3P) medicine","Sleep quality and duration as well as activity-rest-cycles at individual level are crucial for maintaining physical and mental health. Although several methods do exist to monitor these parameters, optimal approaches are still under consideration and technological development. Wrist actigraphy is a non-invasive electro-physical method validated in the field of chronobiology to record movements and to allow for monitoring human activity-rest-cycles. Based on the continuous recording of motor activity and light exposure, actigraphy provides valuable information about the quality and quantity of the sleep-wake rhythm and about the amount of motor activity at day and night that is highly relevant for predicting a potential disease and its targeted prevention as well as personalisation of medical services provided to individuals in suboptimal health conditions and patients. Being generally used in the field of sleep medicine, actigraphy demonstrates a great potential to be successfully implemented in primary, secondary and tertiary care, psychiatry, oncology, and intensive care, military and sports medicines as well as epidemiological monitoring of behavioural habits as well as well-being medical support, amongst others. Activity-rest-cycles have been demonstrated to be an important predictor for many diseases including but not restricted to the development of metabolic, psychiatric and malignant pathologies. Moreover, activity-rest-cycles directly impact individual outcomes in corresponding patient cohorts. Data acquired by actigraphy are instrumental for the evidence-based targeted prevention by analysing individualised patient profiles including light exposure, sleep duration and quality, activity-rest-cycles, intensity and structure of motion pattern. Wrist actigraphic approach is increasingly used in clinical care. Personalised measurements of sedation/agitation rhythms are useful for ICU patients, for evaluation of motor fatigue in oncologic patients, for an individual enhancement of performance in military and sport medicine. In the framework of personalised therapy intervention, patients can be encouraged to optimise their behavioural habits improving recovery and activity patterns. This opens excellent perspectives for the sleep-inducing medication and stimulants replacement as well as for increasing the role of participatory medicine by visualising and encouraging optimal behavioural patterns of the individual.","Acker, Golubnitschaja, BÃƒÂ¼ttner-Teleaga, Richter","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-021-00250-5","20210811","Actigraphy; Behavioural patterns; COVID-19 pandemic; Cancer; Chronobiology; Circadian rhythm; Dementia; Depression; Exposition to light; Fatigue; Health policy; ICU; Individual outcomes; Individualised patient profiling; Insomnia; Mental health; Military; Mood; Motor activity; Pain; Patient stratification; Performance enhancement; Personalised medication; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Predictive preventive personalised medicine (PPPM/3PM); Primary secondary tertiary care; Recommendations; Sleep disorder; Sleep disturbance; Sleep quality tool; SleepÃ¢â‚¬â€œwake rhythm; Sport medicine; Tailored treatment; Targeted prevention; Traffic safety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17037,""
"Multifaceted COVID-19-Related Stressors and Associations with Indices of Mental Health, Well-being, and Substance Use Among Young Adults","Alongside direct health concerns pertaining to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the stressors and life disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may provoke secondary concerns for health and well-being. The implications of COVID-19-related stressors may be particularly salient for young adults, who are at higher-risk for mental health concerns and substance use behaviors. We developed a multifaceted scale that assessed distinct domains of COVID-19-related stressors and examined associations between these stressors and indices of mental health, well-being, and substance use (alcohol and marijuana use). In April-June of 2020, 1181 young adults were recruited from two- and four-year colleges to participate in this study (<i>M</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20.40; 59.95% women). Exploratory factor analysis identified five domains of COVID-19-related stressors: job insecurity, social/relational, financial, illness-related, and school-related. The overall pattern of results indicated that COVID-19-related stressors were related to poorer mental health and well-being. Social/relational stressors emerged as a primary concern most strongly associated with indices of mental health and alcohol use, relative to other stressors. However, illness-related stressors and school-related stressors were associated with <i>less</i> alcohol use. Stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may impact young adults' health and well-being but disentangling various stressor domains informs more tailored intervention and prevention strategies.

"IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON MENTAL HEALTH AND AGING","The potential ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population's mental health are a rising global concern. Both at the individual and community level, the erratic and uncertain COVID-19 outbreak has the prospective to exhibit a detrimental effect on psychological health and aging. At present, various measures are dedicated to the parameters like awareness of epidemiology, clinical aspects, mode of transmission, counteracting the spread of the infection, and public health problems, although this initiative has neglected critical mental health concerns. This study is to investigate the outbreak to study the level of harmful effects on mental health and its crosstalk with aging. Global execution of preventive, control measures and resilience establishment are challenging factors whereas reformed lifestyle such as lockdown, coping with self-isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and post-traumatic stress disorders are alarming. Hallmarks of aging which interact with each other, have been suggested to affect the healthspan in aged adults, possibly due to attenuated immunity. Among various hallmarks, we concentrated on those that show direct or indirect interaction with viral infections, comprising inflammation, genomic instability, impaired mitochondrial function, epigenetic modification, telomere attrition, and damaged autophagy. These hallmarks possibly contribute to the elicited pathophysiological responses to SARS-CoV-2 and may add an additive risk of accelerated aging post-recovery among aged adults. Here, the role of antiaging drug candidates that require main consideration in COVID-19 research is discussed briefly. In the later future, it can emerge as a potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of patients with severe infection.","Sharma, Sharma","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.07.087","20210811","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Telomere; antiaging drug; autophagy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17039,""
"'Scrambling to figure out what to do': a mixed method analysis of COVID-19's impact on sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States","A weak and politicised COVID-19 pandemic response in the United States (US) that failed to prioritise sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) overlaid longstanding SRHR inequities. In this study we investigated how COVID-19 affected SRHR service provision in the US during the first 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of the pandemic. We used a multiphase, three-part, mixed method approach incorporating: (1) a comprehensive review of state-by-state emergency response policies that mapped state-level actions to protect or suspend SRHR services including abortion, (2) a survey of SRHR service providers (n=40) in a sample of 10 states that either protected or suspended services and (3) in-depth interviews (n=15) with SRHR service providers and advocacy organisations. Twenty-one states designated some or all SRHR services as essential and therefore exempt from emergency restrictions. Protections, however, varied by state and were not always comprehensive. Fourteen states acted to suspend abortion. Five cross-cutting themes surrounding COVID-19's impact on SRHR services emerged across the survey and interviews: reductions in SRHR service provision; shifts in service utilisation; infrastructural impacts; the critical role of state and local governments; and exacerbation of SRHR inequities for certain groups. This study demonstrates serious disruptions to the provision of SRHR care that exacerbated existing SRHR inequities. The presence or absence of policy protections for SRHR services had critical implications for providers and patients. Policymakers and service providers must prioritise and integrate SRHR into emergency preparedness planning and implementation, with earmarked funding and tailored service delivery for historically oppressed groups.","Maier, Samari, Ostrowski, Bencomo, McGovern","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsrh-2021-201081","20210811","COVID-19; health policy; qualitative research; reproductive health services; reproductive rights; sexual health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17040,""
"Hospital workers mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: methods of data collection and characteristics of study sample in a university hospital in Milan (Italy)","The COVID-19 pandemic is currently a severe challenge for healthcare workers, with a considerable impact on their mental health. In order to focus preventive and rehabilitation measures it's fundamental to identify risk factors of such psychological impairment. We designed an observational longitudinal study to systematically examine the psychological wellbeing of all employees in a large University Hospital in Italy, using validated psychometric scales in the context of the occupational physician's health surveillance, in collaboration with Psychiatric Unit. The study started after ethical approval in August 2020. For each worker, the psychological wellbeing is screened in two steps. The first level questionnaire collects sociodemographic characteristics, personal and occupational COVID-19 exposure, worries and concerns about COVID-19, general psychological discomfort (GHQ-12), post-traumatic stress symptoms (IES-R) and anxiety (GAD-7). Workers who score above the cut-off in at least one scale are further investigated by the second level questionnaire composed by PHQ-9, DES-II and SCL-90. If second level shows psychological impairments, we offer individual specialist treatment (third level). We plan to follow-up all subjects to monitor symptoms and possible chronicization; we aim to investigate potential risk factors through univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions. Preliminary results refer to a sample of 550 workers who completed the multi-step evaluation from August to December 2020, before vaccination campaign started. The participation rate was 90%. At first level screening, 39% of the subjects expressed general psychological discomfort (GHQ-12), 22% post-traumatic stress symptoms (IES-R), and 21% symptoms of anxiety (GAD-7). Women, nurses, younger workers, subjects with COVID-19 working exposure and with an infected family member showed significantly higher psychological impairment compared to colleagues. After the second level screening, 12% and 7% of all workers showed, respectively, depressive and dissociative symptoms; scorings were significantly associated with gender and occupational role. We are currently extending sample size and evaluating subjects over a period of further 12Ã‚Â months. The possibility to perform a systematic follow-up of psychological wellbeing of all hospital workers, directly or indirectly exposed to pandemic consequences, constitutes a unique condition to detect individual, occupational, and non-occupational risk factors for psychological impairment in situations of prolonged stress, as well as variables associated with symptoms chronicization.","Fattori, CantÃƒÂ¹, Comotti, Tombola, Colombo, Nava, Bordini, Riboldi, Bonzini, Brambilla","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-021-01355-1","20210811","COVID-19 psychological impact; COVID-19 research methods; Longitudinal studies; Occupational stress; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Risk assessment; WorkersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ health surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-12","",17041,""
