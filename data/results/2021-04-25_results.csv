"Objectively measured digital technology use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Impact on depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among young adults","Research suggests that the disruptions introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased psychological distress and time spent on digital technology among young people, thus intensifying pre-pandemic concerns regarding the putative effects of digital technology use on mental health. To robustly examine whether increases in digital technology use are associated with increases in psychological distress during the pandemic it is crucial to (1) collect objective data on digital technology use and (2) account for potential confounding caused by pandemic-related stressors. We conducted a four-wave panel study of U.S. young adults (N=384; M<sub>age</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 24.5 Ã‚Â± 5.1; 57% female) from August-November of 2020. Participants provided screenshots of their iPhone &quot;Screen Time&quot; application and completed measures assessing current mental health status (depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation) and pandemic-related impacts on well-being. We used random-intercept multilevel models to examine the within- and between-person associations between mental health, objective digital technology use, and pandemic-related stressors. Multilevel analyses revealed that none of the objectively-measured digital technology use variables were positively associated with depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation at the within- or between-person levels. In contrast, pandemic-related impacts on mental health had by far the largest effects on depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. The convenience-based sample and use of single-item measures of pandemic-related impacts are limitations of the study. Current speculations about the direct harms of digital technology use on mental health may be unfounded and risk diverting attention from a more likely cause: pandemic-related distress.","Sewall, Goldstein, Rosen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.04.008","20210424","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-25","",13148,""
"COVID-19 Impact in Neurosurgery Residency: Grit in the Face of Pandemic","The Coronavirus-19 (COVID) pandemic presented a significant challenge to healthcare providers. Neurosurgeons work with critically ill patients who were at particularly high risk for COVID and the pandemic produced ever-shifting circumstances to allow this continued care. This study explores the psychological impact of the pandemic on neurosurgical residents at a single institution. Residents completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomology 30 (IDS-30) two validated surveys prior to and during the pandemic. PSS scores may range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicative of increased stress. IDS-30 ranges from 0 to 84 with higher scores indicating more severe levels of depression. Survey results were compared collectively amongst residents and statistically analyzed. The surveys had 19 out of 28 total responders (68%). Mean score on the PSS was 16.1 pre-pandemic and 14.7 during the pandemic (p&gt;0.05). The mean score on the IDS-30 was 14.7 pre-pandemic and 12.0 during the pandemic (p&gt; 0.05). Matching the survey questionnaire results by each resident revealed an average decrease of 2.3 and 2.4 for the PSS and IDS-30, respectively. There were no significant changes in perceived stress or depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Resilience and perseverance are commonly sought traits amongst neurosurgical residents and are components stressed during their training. Neurosurgical residents prove unwavering while caring for patients during the COVID pandemic.","Algattas, Roy, Agarwal, Maroon","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2021.04.057","20210424","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Grit; Neurosurgery; Perseverance; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-25","",13149,""
"Mental health and social interactions of older people with physical disabilities in England during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal cohort study","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected mental health, psychological wellbeing, and social interactions. People with physical disabilities might be particularly likely to be negatively affected, but evidence is scarce. Our aim was to evaluate the emotional and social experience of older people with physical disabilities during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. In this longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing collected in 2018-19 and June-July, 2020, from participants aged 52 years and older and living in England. Physical disability was defined as impairment in basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) and impaired mobility. Depression, anxiety, loneliness, quality of life, sleep quality, and amount of real-time and written social contact were assessed online or by computer-assisted telephone interviews. Comparisons of experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic of people with and without a physical disability were adjusted statistically for pre-pandemic outcome measures, age, sex, wealth, ethnicity, presence of a spouse or partner, number of people in the household, and chronic pain. All participants with full data available for both surveys were included in the analyses. Between June 3 and July 26, 2020, 5820 participants responded, 4887 of whom had full data available for both the pre-pandemic measures and the COVID-19 survey and were included in the analysis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly more people with ADL impairment had clinically significant symptoms of depression (odds ratio 1Ã‚Â·78 [95% CI 1Ã‚Â·44-2Ã‚Â·19]; p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001), anxiety (2Ã‚Â·23 [1Ã‚Â·72-2Ã‚Â·89]; p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001), and loneliness (1Ã‚Â·52 [1Ã‚Â·26-1Ã‚Â·84]; p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001) than people without ADL impairment. Significantly more people with ADL impairment also had impaired sleep quality (1Ã‚Â·44 [1Ã‚Â·20-1Ã‚Â·72]; p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001) and poor quality of life than people without ADL impairment. The results were similar when disability was defined by impaired mobility. People with ADL impairment had less frequent real-time contact (0Ã‚Â·70 [0Ã‚Â·55-0Ã‚Â·89]; p=0Ã‚Â·0037) and written social contact (0Ã‚Â·54 [0Ã‚Â·45-0Ã‚Â·64]; p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001) with family than people without ADL impairment. Results for social contact were similar when disability was defined by impaired mobility. People with physical disability might be at particular risk for emotional distress, poor quality of life, and low wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for additional support and targeted mental health services.

"Sense of coherence and burnout in nursing home workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain","Care staff in nursing homes work in a challenging environment, and the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated those challenges in an unprecedented way. On the other hand, the sense of coherence (SOC) is a competence that could help these professionals perceive the situation as understandable, manageable and meaningful. This study aims to analyse the extent to which potential risk and protective factors against burnout have affected nursing home workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess the contribution of these factors to their burnout. Three hundred forty professionals who worked in nursing homes in Spain completed a survey and reported on their sociodemographic characteristics and their organisational characteristics of the job related to COVID-19, SOC and burnout. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed. The results showed that the SOC is highly related to the dimensions of burnout and is a protective factor against this. In addition, the increase in hours has a negative effect, facilitating inadequate responses to stressful situations; and whereas perceived social support and availability of resources have a protective effect, the deterioration in mental and physical health is the most important risk factor. This study could help better understand the psychological consequences of the effort that nursing home workers and can also help design mental health prevention and care interventions for workers that provide them with resources and supports that foster their coping skills.","Navarro Prados, JimÃƒÂ©nez GarcÃƒÂ­a-TizÃƒÂ³n, MelÃƒÂ©ndez","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13397","20210424","burnout; nursing homes; older adults; pandemics; protective factors; sense of coherence; workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-25","",13151,""
"Dealing with distress from the COVID-19 pandemic: Mental health stressors and coping strategies in vulnerable latinx communities","Distress secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic has been substantial, especially in vulnerable Latinx communities who are carrying an undue share of the pandemic-related social, health and economic burden in the United States. In collaboration with 43 community health workers (CHWs) and Promotor/as serving the needs of underserved Latinx communities in South Texas and guided by principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR), the purpose of this study was to identify relevant mental health stressors and related consequences, and to identify strategies for coping with distress among underserved Latinx communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected on July 2020 using mixed methods to obtain more in-depth information. Surveys were administered, and three focus groups were conducted. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, whereas qualitative data were analysed systematically by starting with a priori questions and themes followed by data categorisation, reduction, display and conclusion drawing. Results showed six themes related to mental health stressors including economics (e.g., job insecurity), immigration (e.g., undocumented status), misinformation, family stress (e.g., changes in family dynamics and the home environment), health (e.g., limited healthcare access) and social isolation. Coping skills of the community were categorised into four themes with multiple codes including behavioural strategies (e.g., identifying reliable information), cognitive strategies (e.g., collectivistic thinking), social support and spirituality. Findings indicate that underserved Latinx communities are dealing with substantial distress and mental health concerns secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic; yet these are resilient communities. Implications of these findings can inform development of resources, interventions, best practices and training avenues to address the mental health needs of underserved Latinx communities, while considering relevant cultural and contextual factors that may influence their effectiveness.","Garcini, Rosenfeld, Kneese, Bondurant, Kanzler","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13402","20210424","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-25","",13152,""
"Factors affecting frontline Korean nurses' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","To identify the factors affecting fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms among frontline nurses working with COVID-19 patients or are in charge of COVID-19 screening in Korea. Nurses are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection because they are in closer, longer-duration contact with patients. These situations can negatively affect the mental health of nurses. This study analysed data from COVID-19 module in the Korean Nurses' Health Study. Data from 906 participants were analysed. To identify the factors influencing mental health, descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed. Caring for patients who are COVID-19-positive increased levels of fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms of nurses. The hospital safety climate influenced mental well-being among nurses. Caring for patients with COVID-19 had a negative impact on fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, the higher was the perceived hospital safety climate, the lower were the nurses' psychological symptoms. Further research on the mental health of nurses is warranted. Institutions should manage human resources to enable periodic rotation of nurses' work and working periods related to COVID-19. In addition, hospital managers should provide sufficient personal protective equipment, related education, and safety climate.","Cho, Kim, Pang, Kim, Jeong, Lee, Jung, Jeong, Park, Choi, Dan","https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12679","20210424","COVID-19; anxiety; depressive symptoms; fear; hospital safety climate; mental health pandemic; nurses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-25","",13153,""
"Severe mental illness is associated with increased mortality and severe course of COVID-19","Psychiatric disorders have been associated with unfavorable outcome following respiratory infections. Whether this also applies to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been scarcely investigated. Using the Danish administrative databases, we identified all patients with a positive real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 in Denmark up to and including January 2, 2021. Multivariable Cox regression was used to calculate 30-day absolute risk and average risk ratio (ARR) for the composite endpoint of death from any cause and severe COVID-19 associated with psychiatric disorders, defined using both hospital diagnoses and redemption of psychotropic drugs. We included 144,321patients with COVID-19. Compared with patients without psychiatric disorders, the standardized ARR of the composite outcome was significantly increased for patients with severe mental illness including schizophrenia spectrum disorders 2.43 (95% confidence intervalÃ‚Â [CI], 1.79-3.07), bipolar disorder 2.11 (95% CI, 1.25-2.97), unipolar depression 1.70 (95% CI, 1.38-2.02), and for patients who redeemed psychotropic drugs 1.70 (95% CI, 1.48-1.92). No association was found for patients with other psychiatric disorders 1.13 (95% CI, 0.86-1.38). Similar results were seen with the outcomes of death or severe COVID-19. Among the different psychiatric subgroups, patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders had the highest 30-day absolute risk for the composite outcome 3.1% (95% CI, 2.3-3.9%), death 1.2% (95% CI, 0.4-2.0%) and severe COVID-19 2.7% (95% CI, 1.9-3.6%).

"Association between resilience and burnout of front-line nurses at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic: Positive and negative affect as mediators in Wuhan","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is having a dramatic effect on the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs). Upon the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government dispatched about 42Ã‚Â 000 HCWs to Wuhan City and Hubei Province to fight this pandemic. This study briefly examines front-line nurses who experienced burnout, with the main objective of investigating the mediating roles of positive and negative affect in the relationship between resilience and burnout in Wuhan hospitals at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 180 front-line nurses voluntarily participated via a social media group. They completed the online questionnaires, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), demographics, and work-related characteristics. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis was used to examine the mediating effect of positive and negative affect on the relationship between resilience and burnout. The total prevalence of burnout was 51.7%, of which 15.0% were severe burnout. These preliminary results revealed that positive and negative affect fully mediated the effects of resilience on burnout, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment of front-line nurses. It is necessary to know the impact of resilience on HCWs with burnout through the positive and negative affect of individual backgrounds and situations, and how policymakers can deploy resilience interventions to support front-line HCWs.","Zhang, Jiang, Ni, Li, Li, Zhou, Ou, Guo, Cao","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12847","20210424","COVID-19 pandemic; burnout; front-line nurses; positive and negative affect; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-25","",13155,""
"Dementia care from behind the mask? Maintaining well-being during Covid-19 pandemic restrictions; observations from Dementia Care Mapping on NHS mental health hospital wards in Wales","The effect of coronavirus (Covid-19) on people living with dementia is potentially severe in its clinical impacts. More widely, for this vulnerable group, the social restrictions to limit the spread of infection may be emotionally and psychologically damaging. To explore the impact of restrictions on well-being for people with moderate to severe dementia in acute mental health hospital care. 'Dementia Care Mapping' was the observational tool used to determine well or ill-being. Observations were undertaken in two mental health hospital wards during a time of restrictions and the use of personal protective equipment. We report levels of well-being that are higher than might be expected alongside a change in the focus of psychological care delivered through mental health nursing interventions aimed at enhancing well-being. We postulate that mental health nurses faced with an unprecedented challenge respond by changing practice to mitigate for infection prevention measures and to compensate for family absence. We suggest that the desirable enhancing actions by nursing staff which raise well-being in these hospital settings are readily transferable to other settings that are aiming to maintain well-being but also practicing under Covid-19 restrictions.","Page, Davies-Abbott, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12763","20210424","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-25","",13156,""
"Medium-term outcome of severe to critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection","The medium and long-term effects of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection on survivors are unknown. Here we studied the medium term effects of COVID-19 on survivors of severe disease. This is a retrospective, case series of 200 patients hospitalised across three large Birmingham hospitals with severe-to-critical COVID-19 infection 4-7 months from disease-onset. Patients underwent comprehensive clinical, laboratory, imaging, lung function test, quality of life and cognitive assessments. At 4-7 months from disease-onset, 63.2% of patients experienced persistent breathlessness, 53.5% complained of significant fatigue, 37.5% reduced mobility and 36.8% pain. Serum markers of inflammation and organ injuries that persisted at hospital discharge had normalised on follow-up indicating no sustained immune response causing chronic maladaptive inflammation. Chest radiographs showed a complete resolution in 82.8%; and significantly improved or no change in 17.2%. Lung function test (LFT) revealed gas transfer abnormalities in 80.0% and spirometry in 37.6% patients. Patients with breathlessness had significantly high incidence of comorbidities, abnormal residual chest X-ray and LFT (p&lt;0.01 to all). In all parameters assessed and persisting symptoms there was no statically significant difference between patients managed on hospital wards and on ITU groups. All patients reported a significantly reduced quality of life in all domains of the EQ-5D-5L quality of life measures.

"Changes in substance supply and use characteristics among people who use drugs (PWUD) during the COVID-19 global pandemic: A national qualitative assessment in Canada","People who use drugs (PWUD) may be at an increased risk of experiencing negative effects related to COVID-19. Border and non-essential service closures may have placed PWUD at an increased risk of experiencing unintended consequences regarding drug consumption and supply patterns, as well as related outcomes. However, the extent of these effects upon this population is unknown. The current study examined how COVID-19 has impacted substance use supply and use characteristics among a national cohort of PWUD in Canada. We conducted semi-structured one-on-one telephone-based interviews with 200 adult PWUD across Canada who were currently using a licit or illicit psychoactive substance at least weekly, and/or currently receiving opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Thematic analyses were conducted using qualitative software. PWUD attributed adverse changes to their substance use frequency, supply, use patterns, and risk behaviors and outcomes to COVID-19. Many participants noted supply disruptions with the majority indicating a decrease in potency and availability, and an increase in the price of substances since COVID-19. Nearly half of participants specified that they had increased their substance use, with some experiencing relapses. In terms of changes to risk level, many participants perceived they were at a greater risk for experiencing an overdose. This study demonstrated the impacts of COVID-19 on PWUD, including a significant disruption substance supply. For many, these changes led to increased use and substitution for toxic and adulterated substances, which ultimately amplified PWUD's risk for experiencing related harms, including overdoses. These findings warrant the need for improved supports and services, as well as accessibility of safe supply programs, take home naloxone kits, and novel approaches to ensure PWUD have the tools necessary to mitigate risk when using substances.","Ali, Russell, Nafeh, Rehm, LeBlanc, Elton-Marshall","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103237","20210424","Addiction; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Drug overdoses; Public Health; Substance supply","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-25","",13159,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the general population: a comparison between Germany and the UK","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to dramatic social and economic changes in daily life. First studies report an impact on mental health of the general population showing increased levels of anxiety, stress and depression. In this study, we compared the impact of the pandemic on two culturally and economically similar European countries: the UK and Germany. Participants (UKÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°241, GermanÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°541) completed an online-survey assessing COVID-19 exposure, impact on financial situation and work, substance and media consumption, mental health using the Symptom-Check-List-27 (SCL-27) and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. We found distinct differences between the two countries. UK responders reported a stronger direct impact on health, financial situation and families. UK responders had higher clinical scores on the SCL-27, and higher prevalence. Interestingly, German responders were less hopeful for an end of the pandemic and more concerned about their life-stability. As 25% of both German and UK responders reported a subjective worsening of the general psychological symptoms and 20-50% of German and UK responders reached the clinical cut-off for depressive and dysthymic symptoms as well as anxieties, it specifically shows the need for tailored intervention systems to support large proportions of the general public.","Knolle, Ronan, Murray","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-021-00565-y","20210424","COVID-19; Depression; General population; Mental health; SPQ","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-25","",13160,""
"Instruments to measure fear of COVID-19: a diagnostic systematic review","The COVID-19 pandemic has become a source of fear across the world. Measuring the level or significance of fear in different populations may help identify populations and areas in need of public health and education campaigns. We were interested in diagnostic tests developed to assess or diagnose COVID-19-related fear or phobia. We performed a systematic review of studies that examined instruments diagnosing or assessing fear or phobia of COVID-19 (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020197100). We utilized the Norwegian Institute of Public Health's Live map of covid-19 evidence, a database of pre-screened and pre-categorized studies. The Live map of covid-19 evidence identified references published since 1 December 2019 in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Following biweekly searches, two researchers independently categorized all studies according to topic (seven main topics, 52 subordinate topics), population (41 available groups), study design, and publication type. For this review, we assessed for eligibility all studies that had been categorized to the topic &quot;Experiences and perceptions, consequences; social, political, economic aspects&quot; as of 25 September 2020, in addition to hand-searching included studies' reference lists. We meta-analyzed correlation coefficients of fear scores to the most common reference tests (self-reports of anxiety, depression, and stress), and reported additional concurrent validity to other reference tests such as specific phobias. We assessed study quality using the QUADAS-2 for the minority of studies that presented diagnostic accuracy statistics. We found 18 studies that validated fear instruments. Fifteen validated the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S). We found no studies that proposed a diagnosis of fear of COVID-19 or a threshold of significant/clinical versus non-significant/subclinical fear. Study quality was low, with the most common potential biases related to sampling strategy and un-blinded data analysis. The FSV-19S total score correlated strongly with severe phobia (rÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.703, 95%CI 0.634-0.761) in one study, and moderately with anxiety in a meta-analysis. The accuracy of the FSV-19S needs to be measured further using fear-related reference instruments, and future studies need to provide cut-off scores and normative values. Further evaluation of the remaining three instruments is required.","Muller, Himmels, Van de Velde","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-021-01262-5","20210424","Diagnostic accuracy; Fear; Psychometrics; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-25","",13161,""
"A mental health informatics study on the mediating effect of the regulatory emotional self-efficacy","To identify the internal mechanism of the relationship between physical activity and mental health in home exercises. Participants were 2233 college students with an average age of 19.34 (SD = 1.07) recruited from southern China using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and hierarchical multiple regression. They completed the college student physical activity questionnaire, regulatory emotional self-efficacy scale (RES) and Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) to explore the internal mechanism of the relationship between home exercises and mental health in the context of fitness campaign. Statistical analysis based on ANOVA and hierarchical multiple regression, and the results showed that gender differences is a critical factor influencing the effectiveness of home exercise on mental health in college students.

"COVID-19 pandemic and psychological wellbeing among health care workers and general population: A systematic-review and meta-analysis of the current evidence from India","Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared as pandemic and measures adopted for its control included quarantine of at-risk, isolation of infected along with other measures such as lockdown, restrictions on movement, and social interactions. Both the pandemic and these measures have the potential to cause mental health problems among individuals. Objective The present study aimed to investigate and estimate the prevalence of psychological well-being, particularly from an Indian perspective using systematic review and meta-analysis of existing literature. Methods We searched in the PubMed database, starting from the onset of the current pandemic and until 10th October 2020 to synthesize evidence on mental health outcomes from India. DerSimonian and Laird method of the random-effects meta-analysis was employed and heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the Chi-square based Cochran's Q statistic and I-squared (I2) statistics. Results The pooled prevalence of stress in nine studies was 60.7% (95% CI: 42.3%â€“77.7%), depression in eight studies was 32.7% (95% CI: 24.6%â€“41.3%), anxiety in six studies was 34.1% (95% CI: 26.3%â€“42.3%) and sleep disturbances in six studies was 26.7% (95% CI: 13.9%â€“41.8%). As expected, high heterogeneity was observed in the above-mentioned outcomes. Sub-group analysis showed that Health Care Workers (HCWs) had a higher prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression & psychological distress in comparison to the general population. Conclusion A significant impact on psychological well-being during COVID-19 was observed in India as common adverse outcomes were stress (61%), psychological distress (43%), anxiety (34%), depression (33%), and sleep disturbances (27%). Thus the COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented threat to mental health, which should become a priority for public health strategies.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2021.100737","20210701","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-25","",13163,""

"What does it mean to measure general mental health in adolescents? A meta-review of content and psychometrics","Mental health in adolescence is a major concern but clear strategies for measurement in general population samples are lacking. This meta-review focused on the content and psychometric properties of self-report measures to inform judicious selection of indicators and measures. We identified 22 brief measures from 19 systematic reviews, under the following domains: general mental health (positive and negative aspects together), life satisfaction, quality of life (mental health subscales only), symptoms, and wellbeing. Measures were often classified inconsistently within these appearing under multiple constructs. While overlap between measures within and between domains was generally low, only 25 unique indicators were found. Several indicators were found across the majority, and measures also consistently tapped mostly emotional content. Psychometric quality was generally low. Findings suggest well-developed measures are lacking. We provide guidance on existing measures, how better measures might be developed, and the implications for research considering general mental health in adolescence.","Louise Black et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621E-C33-18E","20210421","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-25","",13165,""
