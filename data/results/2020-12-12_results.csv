"Predictors of Physical and Mental Health in Healthcare Teams Working with COVID-19 patients: a scoping review protocol","Introduction: As a result of the current pandemic (COVID-19), many clinical teams are exposed to stressful situations that may lead to physical and mental issues for clinical staff themselves (we exclude the effects of personal infection with the virus). Recent studies suggest some predictors could depend on context, notably country and the type of the health system. Methods and Analysis: This protocol was follows using the PRISMA-ScR guideline (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews), which was revised and approved by the research team. This study aims to identify factors and evidence of the physical, behavioural and mental consequences of sustained clinical practice in a continuing pandemic. Our research seeks to fill this gap in the literature, and the results may suggest to governments, healthcare authorities and healthcare providers appropriate measures to mitigate risks to healthcare workers during a pandemic response. Dissemination and ethics: The current research design is based on the use of publicly available information and does not require ethical approval. The findings will be disseminated in conferences. Results will be published and additionally shared with relevant local and national authorities.","Nelson Aguirre-Duarte; John Ovretveit; Timothy Kenealy","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20247304","20201211","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-12","",8106,""
"Online Instruction during a Pandemic: Faculty Collaboration and Self-Care","This article will provide an overview of the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019, also known as COVID-19, pandemic on educators  The transition from face-to-face to online instruction revolutionized perspectives on synchronous and asynchronous course modalities  New live media methods of interaction were adopted with little to no training for teachers and students  Simultaneously, educators, counselors, students, and families faced a multitude of challenges occurring in their own lives and those of their students  These challenges included but were not limited to anxiety and depression, low self-efficacy, fear, domestic violence, substance abuse, oppression, and trauma (Bozkurt & Sharma, 2020;Dorn et al , 2020)  The conversion to online instruction during periods of governmental lockdowns, particularly in large cities with high population density, greatly obstructed lifestyles, expectations, and self-care routines for individuals across age groups and socioeconomic levels  While many dramatic changes were occurring due to a healthcare crisis, teachers, counselors, and administrators were troubleshooting student difficulties while working from home and often with limited resources and support (Stone, 2020)  The article documents the realities of educating students during a pandemic and the changes that may impact education indefinitely, as well as lessons learned regarding the importance of collaboration, flexibility, and self-care","Cicco, Gina","https://doi.org/10.26634/jet.17.3.17545","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: i-Manager's Journal of Educational Technology;17(3):1-5, 2020.; Publication details: i-Manager's Journal of Educational Technology;17(3):1-5, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-12","",8107,""

"The mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with and without depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders: a longitudinal study of three Dutch case-control cohorts","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in people with pre-existing mental health disorders is unclear. In three psychiatry case-control cohorts, we compared the perceived mental health impact and coping and changes in depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry, and loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic between people with and without lifetime depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders. Between April 1 and May 13, 2020, online questionnaires were distributed among the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons, and Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Association cohorts, including people with (n=1181) and without (n=336) depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders. The questionnaire contained questions on perceived mental health impact, fear of COVID-19, coping, and four validated scales assessing depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry, and loneliness used in previous waves during 2006-16. Number and chronicity of disorders were based on diagnoses in previous waves. Linear regression and mixed models were done. The number and chronicity of disorders showed a positive graded dose-response relation, with greater perceived impact on mental health, fear, and poorer coping. Although people with depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders scored higher on all four symptom scales than did individuals without these mental health disorders, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, they did not report a greater increase in symptoms during the pandemic. In fact, people without depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders showed a greater increase in symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas individuals with the greatest burden on their mental health tended to show a slight symptom decrease. People with depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders are experiencing a detrimental impact on their mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires close monitoring in clinical practice. Yet, the COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to have further increased symptom severity compared with their prepandemic levels.

"Cognitive flexibility and perceived threat from COVID-19 mediate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and state anxiety","Converging empirical evidence indicates that exposure to adversity in childhood is associated with increased vulnerability to mental health problems in adulthood. As early life adversity has the potential to alter an individual's appraisal of threat, we hypothesized that individuals exposed to adversity in childhood may also exhibit increased threat from environmental stressors, which in turn may impact their state anxiety levels. We examined the relations between adverse childhood experiences, assessed using the Adverse Childhood Experiences Scale (ACEs), perceived threat from COVID-19, and state anxiety in a sample of adults. Additionally, flexibility is implicated in adaptive coping with life's stressors so we also assessed participants' cognitive flexibility. Parallel mediation regression analyses revealed that both perceived threat from COVID-19 and flexibility in the appraisal of challenges mediated the influence of maltreatment, but not household dysfunction, on state anxiety. Our data indicate that experience with early life adversity in the form of maltreatment is associated with increased perceived threat from COVID-19, which results in higher anxiety levels for the individual. In contrast, childhood maltreatment is associated with reduced flexibility in appraising challenges, which in turn mediates the relationship between maltreatment and anxiety. The findings of this study adds to the limited literature on the impact of early life adversity on cognitive flexibility and highlights the psychological toll of COVID-19 on individuals who have been exposed to adverse childhood experiences.","Kalia, Knauft, Hayatbini","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243881","20201211","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-12","",8116,""

We conducted a cross-sectional study starting on March 29 to April 5, 2020, based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques. Symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), and acute stress (Acute Stress Disorder Inventory) were assessed. Differences in the presence of symptoms and the relationship of coexistence and domestic violence were evaluated from a gender perspective. Men showed significant lower mean (SD) in anxiety, depression, and acute stress levels than women [HARS, 14.1 (9.8) versus. 18.4 (10.2), FÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 56.2, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001; BDI 3.4 (3.9) versus 4.5 (4.3), FÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 16.6, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001, and ASDI 3.6 (2.9) versus 4.7 (3.1), FÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 39.0, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001, respectively), as well as a weaker depressive syndrome (28.1% males versus 39.9% females, Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 25.5, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001).

"Factors associated with the mental health status of medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study in Japan","The COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on university students, including those in medical schools, with disruption in routine education causing significant psychological distress. The objective of this study was to evaluate the factors associated with psychological distress among medical students during the period of enforced home quarantine from March through May 2020. A cross-sectional study. One Japanese medical school. 571 medical students. Self-administered electronic questionnaires including the K-6 scale for psychological distress, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) for self-esteem and the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) for self-efficacy were distributed. To assess the determinant factor for psychological distress, variables such as sex, grade in school, living conditions, and RSES and GSES scores were evaluated in regression analysis. 163 respondents (28.5%) scored Ã¢â€°Â¥5 on the K-6 scale, indicating a significant degree of psychological distress. Logistic regression revealed that a higher score on RSES (p&lt;0.001) and GSES (p&lt;0.01) was an independent factor associated with lower levels of psychological distress. Multiple regression analysis focusing on students with a K-6 score Ã¢â€°Â¥5 revealed that higher scores on RSES correlated with lower levels of psychological distress. By contrast, those with higher GSES scores also scored higher for indicators of psychological distress. This study identified that self-efficacy and self-esteem were both influential factors for predicting psychological distress during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Medical schools should provide support for mental health and educational initiatives directed at enhancing self-esteem and self-efficacy, with a focus on improving personal resilience. In emergency situations, such as that faced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, initial programmes might target students with higher levels of self-efficacy. By contrast, under routine situations, these efforts should be directed towards students with lower self-esteem as primary means to prevent depression.","Arima, Takamiya, Furuta, Siriratsivawong, Tsuchiya, Izumi","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043728","20201211","COVID-19; depression &amp; mood disorders; medical education &amp; training; mental health; social medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-12","",8122,""
"Birth experience during COVID-19 confinement (CONFINE): protocol for a multicentre prospective study","The absence of companionship during childbirth is known to be responsible for negative emotional birth experience, which can increase the risk of postpartum depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The context of COVID-19 epidemic and the related confinement could increase the rate of negative experience and mental disorders. The main objective is to compare, in immediate post partum, the maternal sense of control during childbirth between a group of women who gave birth during confinement ('confinement' group) versus a group of women who gave birth after confinement but in the context of epidemic ('epidemic' group) versus a group of control women ('control' group; excluding confinement and epidemic context). This is a national multicentre prospective cohort study conducted in four French maternity units. We expect to include 927 women in a period of 16 months. Women will be recruited immediately in post partum during three different periods constituting the three groups: 'confinement'; 'epidemic' and 'control' group. The maternal sense of control will be evaluated by the Labour Agentry Scale questionnaire completed immediately in post partum. Postnatal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), post-traumatic stress disorder (Impact of Event Scale-Revised) and breast feeding (evaluative statement) will be evaluated at 2 months post partum. The study was approved by the French Ethics Committee, the CPP (ComitÃƒÂ© de Protection des Personnes) SUD OUEST ET OUTRE-MER IV on 16th of April 2020 with reference number CPP2020-04-040. The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and will be presented at relevant conferences.

"How COVID-19 Changed Our Management of Nasal Bone Fractures and Its Impact on Patient Outcomes-A Retrospective Study","Nasal bone fractures are a common presentation to the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon. Simple, closed fractures are assessed and considered for closed manipulation under anesthesia (MUA #nasal bones). Most departments perform this under general anesthesia (GA). Our protocol changed in the face of COVID-19, where procedures were alternatively performed under local anesthesia (LA) in the clinic, to cope with lack of elective theater capacity during the pandemic, while still allowing a nasal fracture service to take place. We present postoperative patient outcomes on breathing and shape, comparing GA versus LA. Patient records retrospectively analyzed (January 2020-August 2020), and patients undergoing MUA #nasal bones interviewed by telephone after one month. Exclusion criteria were open injuries or depressed nasal bones requiring elevation. Breathing and shape scores were evaluated subjectively using a Likert scale (1 = very unsatisfied, 5 = very satisfied). Two hundred five nasal injury referrals were made (21 MUA #nasal bones under GA and 27 under LA). Manipulation under anesthesia #nasal bones significantly improved both breathing satisfaction scores (GA; 2.88 Ã‚Â± 0.24 to 4.06 Ã‚Â± 0.23, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05; LA; 2.86 Ã‚Â± 0.22 to 3.77 Ã‚Â± 0.27, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and aesthetic scores (GA; 2.00 Ã‚Â± 0.21 to 3.94 Ã‚Â± 0.23, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05; LA; 1.64 Ã‚Â± 0.19 to 3.59 Ã‚Â± 0.28, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) in both GA and LA groups. There was no statistically significant difference between LA and GA in postoperative outcomes. There was a trend toward greater satisfaction for GA, though this was not statistically significant and may be impacted by the rate of cartilaginous deformity in the LA group. Both techniques were well tolerated and most patients would repeat the procedure in hindsight. Local anesthesia could provide a safer, cheaper, and satisfactory alternative for performing MUA #nasal bones in the clinic for selected patients, particularly with reduction of elective theater capacity in the event of further COVID-19 surges. We recommend training junior ENT surgeons to perform this procedure under supervision with adequate protective measures.","Bastianpillai, Khan, Acharya, Tanna, Pal","https://doi.org/10.1177/0145561320981439","20201211","anesthesia; day case surgery; nasal trauma; rhinology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-12","",8124,""
"Mental Health Status of University Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Post-Movement Lockdown Assessment","This study investigated the prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety, and stress and determined the association between various factors, social support, and depression, anxiety, and stress among university healthcare workers in Malaysia after the government lifted the movement control order (MCO) put in place to curb the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This online, cross-sectional survey recruited 399 participants from two university hospitals, and they were administered a self-reported questionnaire on demographic, personal, and clinical characteristics, as well as COVID-19-related stressors and coping. In addition, they completed the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) to measure perceived social support, as well as the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to assess depression, anxiety, and stress. We found that the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress were 21.8%, 31.6%, and 29.1%, respectively. Participants with moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress made up 13.3%, 25.8%, and 8.1% of the sample, respectively. Being single or divorced, fear of frequent exposure to COVID-19 patients, agreeing that the area of living had a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases, uncertainty regarding the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the area of living, and a history of pre-existing psychiatric illnesses were associated with higher odds of depression, anxiety, and stress. Conversely, having more than three children and greater perceived friend support were associated with lower odds of depression, anxiety, and stress. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress remained elevated even after the MCO was lifted.","Woon, Sidi, Nik Jaafar, Leong Bin Abdullah","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249155","20201211","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; postÃ¢â‚¬â€œmovement lockdown; stress; university healthcare workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-12","",8125,""
