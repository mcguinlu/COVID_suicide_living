"Long-COVID post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome and affective symptoms are associated with oxidative damage, lowered antioxidant defenses and inflammation: a proof of concept and mechanism study","The immune-inflammatory response during the acute phase of COVID-19, as assessed using peak body temperature (PBT) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), predicts the severity of chronic fatigue, depression and anxiety (physio-affective) symptoms three to four months later. The present study was performed to characterize whether the effects of SpO2 and PBT on the physio-affective phenome of Long COVID are mediated by immune, oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO&NS) pathways. This study assayed SpO2 and PBT during acute COVID-19, and C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls (PCs), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitric oxide (NO), zinc, and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) in 120 Long COVID individuals and 36 controls. Cluster analysis showed that 31.7% of the Long COVID patients had severe abnormalities in SpO2, body temperature, increased oxidative toxicity (OSTOX) and lowered antioxidant defenses (ANTIOX), and increased total Hamilton Depression (HAMD) and Anxiety (HAMA) and Fibromylagia-Fatigue (FF) scores. Around 60% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome of Long COVID (a factor extracted from HAMD, HAMA and FF scores) was explained by OSTOX/ANTIOX ratio, PBT and SpO2. Increased PBT predicted increased CRP and lowered ANTIOX and zinc levels, while lowered SpO2 predicted lowered Gpx and increased NO production. Both PBT and SpO2 strongly predict OSTOX/ATIOX during Long COVID. In conclusion, the impact of acute COVID-19 on the physio-affective symptoms of Long COVID is partly mediated by OSTOX/ANTIOX, especially lowered Gpx and zinc, increased MPO and NO production and lipid peroxidation-associated aldehyde formation. Post-viral physio-affective symptoms have an inflammatory origin and are partly mediated by neuro-oxidative toxicity.","Hussein K Al-Hakeim; Haneen Al-Rubaye; Dhurgham Al-Hadrawi; Abbas Almulla; Michael Maes","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.25.22274251","20220427","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30654,""
"Workplace and lifestyle heterogeneity in subjective wellbeing: Latent Class Analysis of UK Time Use Survey before and during COVID-19","Background: Mental health in the UK had deteriorated compared with pre-pandemic trends. The impact of COVID-19 on the subjective wellbeing of working populations with distinct lifestyles is not yet studied. Methods: Combining time use surveys collected pre- and during COVID-19, latent class analysis was used to identify distinct lifestyles based on aggregated daily activity patterns and reported working modes. We provide qualitative pen portraits alongside pre-versus-during pandemic comparisons of intraday time use and wellbeing patterns. Lifestyle heterogeneity in wellbeing was quantified in relation to aggregated activity types. Results: COVID-19 impact on wellbeing varied significantly between usual working hours (6am-6pm) and rest of the day. The decline in wellbeing outside of usual working hours was significant and consistent across lifestyles. During usual working hours, the direction of impact varied in line with working modes: wellbeing of homeworkers decreased, remained relatively stable for commuters, and increased for certain hybrid workers. Magnitude of impact correlates strongly with lifestyle: those working long and dispersed hours are more sensitive, whereas non-work dominated lifestyles are more resilient. Conclusion: The direction and magnitude of impact from COVID-19 were not uniformly manifested across activity types, time of day, and latent lifestyles. Blurring work-life boundaries and general anxiety about the pandemic may be key determinants of the decline outside of usual working hours. During usual working hours, strong yet complex correlations between wellbeing and time-use changes suggested that policies aiming to enhance wellbeing of workers need to consider not only spatial flexibility but also provide wider support for temporal flexibility.","Jerry Chen; Li Wan","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.27.22273297","20220427","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30655,""
"Health care use attributable to COVID-19: A propensity matched national electronic health records cohort study of 249,390 people in Wales, UK","Background: To determine the extent and nature of changes in infected patients healthcare utilization, we studied healthcare contact in the 1-4 weeks and 5-24 weeks following a COVID-19 diagnosis compared to propensity matched controls. Methods: Survival analysis was used for time to death and first clinical outcomes including clinical terminology concepts for post-viral illness, fatigue, embolism, respiratory conditions, mental and developmental conditions, fit note, or hospital attendance. Increased instantaneous risk for the occurrence of an outcome for positive individuals was quantified using hazard ratios (HR) from Cox Regression and absolute risk was quantified using relative risk (RR) from life table analysis. Results: Compared to matched individuals testing negative, surviving positive community-tested patients had a higher risk of post-viral illness (HR: 4.57, 95%CI: 1.77-11.80, p=0.002), fatigue (HR: 1.47, 95%CI: 1.24-1.75, p<0.001) and embolism (HR: 1.51, 95%CI: 1.13-2.02, p=0.005) at 5-24 weeks post-diagnosis. In the four weeks after COVID-19 higher rates of sick notes were being issued for community-tested (HR: 3.04, 95%CI: 0.88 to 10.50, p<0.079); the risk was reduced after four weeks, compared to controls. Overall healthcare attendance for anxiety, depression was less likely in those with COVID-19 in the first four weeks (HR: 0.83, 95%CI: 0.73-1.06, p=0.007). After four weeks, anxiety, depression is less likely to occur for the positive community-tested individuals (HR: 0.87, 95%CI: 0.77-1.00, p=0.048), but more likely for positive hospital-tested individuals (HR: 1.16, 95%CI: 1.00-1.45, p=0.053). Although statistical associations between positive infection and post-infection healthcare use are clear, the absolute use of healthcare is very. Conclusions: Community COVID-19 disease is associated with increased risks of post-viral illness, fatigue, embolism, depression, anxiety and respiratory conditions. Despite these elevated risks, the absolute healthcare burden is low. Either very small proportions of people experience adverse outcomes following COVID-19 or they are not presenting to healthcare.

"Mental health status of dentists during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background The effect of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on the mental health status of dentists has been studied in various studies. The aim of this study was to review the mental health status of dentists during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods English databases including PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus were systematically searched till July 2021. Studies that examined the mental health status of dentists during COVID-19 pandemic were included. The heterogeneity of articles was assessed with the Cochran Test and I2 statistics. The prevalence rates of anxiety, fear, sadness, concern, and anger were calculated using the random-effect model. Findings Of 560 initial searched articles, 15 articles were eligible to include. The prevalence of anxiety, fear of carrying the infection, fear of getting infected, fear of getting quarantined, and fear of dying people by COVID-19 were 64%, 92%, 85%, 61%, and 65%, respectively. The distribution frequency of light, moderate, and intense sadness was 22%, 25%, and 30%, respectively;light, moderate, and intense anger was 21%, 14%, and 23%, respectively;light, moderate, and intense concern was 30%, 30%, and 34%, respectively;light, moderate, and intense fear was 38%, 24%, and 15%, respectively. Conclusion Fear of COVID-19 and anxiety was very high among dentists. A significant proportion of dentists had moderate to intense COVID-19-associated sadness, concern, and anger. Providing educational content along with providing the necessary personal protective equipment and extensive vaccinations will help maintain the mental health of dentists and provide better quality services.","Salehiniya, Hamid, Hatamian, Sare, Abbaszadeh, Hamid","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.617","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Science Reports; 5(3):e617, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30657,""
"""New Normal"" implications for global talent in the wake of economic nationalism and slowdown","As a result of global economies' protectionist policies, followed by economic nationalism and a downturn, there is a shortage of talent with the requisite skills, knowledge, and abilities to meet the contingencies amid COVID-19. The recent developments have necessitated multinational businesses to manage their talent in a new international business context. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the implications of the ""New Normal"" for global talent which is manifested by economic nationalism and slowdown. This study used an inductive method to qualitative research, conducted in-depth interviews with 28 top executives from multinational corporations. The implications for the global talent emerged from the current study as skill enhancement based on the emerged business model;training and development pertinent to new responsibilities and activities;adaptability to changes in the macroenvironment;emphasis on employee proactivity, experimentation, and risk-taking;emphasis on hyperspecialization to take on contract positions;global talent needs to participate in remote learning;global talent must emphasize on mental health issues;and registering in talent exchange programs to fill talent skill shortages.","Showkat, S.; Wani, T.; Kaur, J.","https://doi.org/10.1002/tie.22270","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Thunderbird Int.

"Pre-trained ensemble model for identification of emotion during COVID-19 based on emergency response support system dataset","The COVID-19 precautions, lockdown, and quarantine implemented throughout the epidemic resulted in a worldwide economic disaster. People are facing unprecedented levels of intense threat, necessitating professional, systematic psychiatric intervention and assistance. New psychological services must be established as quickly as possible to support the mental healthcare needs of people in this pandemic condition. This study examines the contents of calls landed in the emergency response support system (ERSS) during the pandemic. Furthermore, a combined analysis of Twitter patterns connected to emergency services could be valuable in assisting people in this pandemic crisis and understanding and supporting peopleâ€™s emotions. The proposed Average Voting Ensemble Deep Learning model (AVEDL Model) is based on the Average Voting technique. The AVEDL Model is utilized to classify emotion based on COVID-19 associated emergency response support system calls (transcribed) along with tweets. Pre-trained transformer-based models BERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa are combined to build the AVEDL Model, which achieves the best results. The AVEDL Model is trained and tested for emotion detection using the COVID-19 labeled tweets and call content of the emergency response support system. This is the first deep learning ensemble model using COVID-19 emotion analysis to the best of our knowledge. The AVEDL Model outperforms standard deep learning and machine learning models by attaining an accuracy of 86.46 percent and an F1-score of 85.20 percent.","Nimmi, K.; Janet, B.; Selvan, A.

"Exploring the effect of loneliness on fear: Implications for the effect of COVID-19-induced social disconnection on anxiety","The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in many disruptions to daily life, including an abrupt increase in social disconnection. As measures were put in place to combat the spread of COVID-19, people across the globe began living in states of limited social contact, fostering feelings of social isolation and loneliness. Previous literature suggests that these increases in social disconnection can have profound effects on both physical and mental health, perhaps especially in the case of fear disorders. The combination of feeling disconnected from others and the high level of daily threat experienced due to COVID-19 created conditions under which dysfunctional and persistent fears were especially likely to develop. Building on current understanding of the harmful effects of social disconnection on well-being in general as well as specific implications for fear, here we present findings from three preliminary investigations that are the first to directly examine the effects of loneliness on how fears are learned and maintained. The Results of this work show that loneliness impairs the process by which fears are extinguished, which is central to both the regulation of fear and treatment of fear disorders, and provide insight into potential avenues to mitigate such effects.","Hornstein, Erica A.; Eisenberger, Naomi I.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2022.104101","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Behaviour Research and Therapy;: 104101, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30662,""
"Potential urinary biomarkers in young adults with short-term exposure to particulate matter and bioaerosols identified using an unbiased metabolomic approach","Numerous epidemiological studies have shown a close relationship between outdoor air pollution and increased risks for cancer, infection, and cardiopulmonary diseases. However, very few studies have investigated the potential health effects of coexposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) and bioaerosols through the transmission of infectious agents, particularly under the current circumstances of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. In this study, we aimed to identify urinary metabolite biomarkers that might serve as clinically predictive or diagnostic standards for relevant diseases in a real-time manner. We performed an unbiased gas/liquid chromatographyâ€“mass spectroscopy (GC/LC-MS) approach to detect urinary metabolites in 92 samples from young healthy individuals collected at three different time points after exposure to clean air, polluted ambient, or purified air, as well as two additional time points after air repollution or repurification. Subsequently, we compared the metabolomic profiles between the two time points using an integrated analysis, along with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes-enriched pathway and time-series analysis. We identified 33 and 155 differential metabolites (DMs) associated with PM and bioaerosol exposure using GC/LCâ€“MS and follow-up analyses, respectively. Our findings suggest that 16-dehydroprogesterone and 4-hydroxyphenylethanol in urine samples may serve as potential biomarkers to predict or diagnose PM- or bioaerosol-related diseases, respectively. The results indicated apparent differences between PM- and bioaerosol-associated DMs at five different time points and revealed dynamic alterations in the urinary metabolic profiles of young healthy humans with cyclic exposure to clean and polluted air environments. Our findings will help in investigating the detrimental health effects of short-term coexposure to airborne PM and bioaerosols in a real-time manner and improve clinically predictive or diagnostic strategies for preventing air pollution-related diseases.","Li, Guang-xi, Duan, Yuan-yuan, Wang, Yi, Bian, Ling-jie, Xiong, Meng-ran, Song, Wen-pin, Zhang, Xia, Li, Biao, Dai, Yu-long, Lu, Jia-wei, Li, Meng, Liu, Zhi-guo, Liu, Shi-gang, Zhang, Li, Yao, Hong-juan, Shao, Rong-guang, Li, Liang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119308","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Environmental Pollution;: 119308, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30663,""
"Poke Not Prod: Improving Quality of Life Through Non-Invasive Rejection Surveillance for Heart Transplant Recipients","Purpose: Gene expression profiling (GEP) and donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) provide effective non-invasive rejection surveillance for heart transplant (HT) recipients with a trend toward improved quality of life. During the COVID-19 pandemic, rejection monitoring and titration of mediations in HT patients was difficult due to limited health-care resources for endomyocardial biopsy (EMBx). This is the first Canadian study to assess non-invasive rejection surveillance in improving patient satisfaction and reducing anxiety during HT rejection screening. Methods: Adult HT recipients, at least 6 months post-transplant, were enrolled to have surveillance EMBx replaced by non-invasive rejection testing with GEP and dd-cfDNA. Patients with multiorgan transplant, dialysis, or high rejection risk (recent acute cellular rejection = grade 2R, new graft dysfunction, or heart failure) were excluded. All patients completed the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and a patient satisfaction survey. Thematic analysis was performed for open-ended responses. Results: Out of 90 patients screened, 31 had their routine EMBx replaced by non-invasive rejection testing. Based on test results, 89% of EMBx were safely eliminated. On the SF-12, participants had a median physical health score of 43 (40-53) and mental health score of 53 (46-58) out of 100. Patientsâ€™ self-reported satisfaction was 90%. Median self-reported anxiety score prior to EMBx was 50 (10-71) versus 2.5 (0-7.5) out of 100 prior to GEP/dd-cfDNA. Four codes (â€œemotionsâ€ (pain, anxiety, fear), â€œtimeâ€, â€œbiopsyâ€, â€œaccuracyâ€) were used to uncover two themes of â€œSuperiority to Biopsyâ€ and â€œMental or Physical Stressâ€. Patients described feeling much more satisfied and less emotionally distressed with the non-invasive screening compared to EMBx. HT patients reported less fear and anxiety, reduced pain, and enjoyed the simplicity of non-invasive testing. Conclusion: Non-invasive rejection surveillance screening can positively impact patientsâ€™ mental health. In this study, non-invasive rejection surveillance eliminated the recovery time and risk of an invasive procedure for HT recipients while reducing anxiety, improving patient satisfaction, and providing an alternative way to screen patients during a period of limited resources due to a global pandemic.","Amadio, J.

"Psychological stress self-help interventions for healthcare workers in the context of COVID-19 in China: A randomized controlled trial protocol","Background Public health emergencies may lead to severe psychological stress, especially for healthcare workers, including frontline healthcare workers and public health workers. However, few stress management interventions have been implemented for healthcare workers even though they require more comprehensive interventions than the general public. Self-Help Plus (SH+) is a novel psychological self-help intervention developed by the World Health Organization. It is accessible, scalable, and cost-effective and has the potential to be quickly applied to help people cope with stress and adversity. The major objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of SH+ interventions on the alleviation of stress levels and mental health problems among healthcare workers. Methods A randomized controlled trial of SH+ will be conducted to investigate the stress level and mental health status of Chinese healthcare workers and control subjects in Guangzhou. Assessments will be performed before (baseline), at the end of (1Â month), and 2Â months after (3Â months) the intervention. After completing the baseline screening questionnaire, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups in a 1:1 ratio by block randomization. During the 1-month intervention period, the intervention group will receive the SH+ intervention and the control group will receive information about mental health promotion. The intervention will be delivered by the research assistant via social media platforms. The primary outcome is the level of stress, which will be measured by a 10-item Perceived Stress Scale. Secondary outcomes including mental health symptoms will also be collected. Discussion Given the potential for multiple COVID-19 waves and other infectious disease pandemics in the future, we expect that SH+ will be an effective stress management intervention for healthcare workers. The findings from this study will facilitate the application of SH+, and the trial is expected to be extended to a larger population in the future.","Luo, Rui, Guo, Pengyue, Shang, Menglin, Cai, Yuqi, Huang, Jinying, He, Yiling, Mo, Phoenix K.

"TCTAP C-005 Conundrum of a â€˜Primaryâ€™ Angioplasty: Provisional Stenting of Left Main Stem / Left Anterior Descending During STEMI With Double Bifurcation","Clinical Information Patient Initials or Identifier Number: R Relevant Clinical History and Physical Exam: A 64-year-old lady with underlying dyslipidemia presented to our emergency department with typical chest pain. Immediate electrocardiogram was performed which showed sinus rhythm, ST elevation at lead 1, aVL and V1, hyperacute T wave at V2 till V3 with ST depression at leads II, III and aVF. Hence a diagnosis of acute anterolateral myocardial infarction, Killip 1 was given and urgent referral to cardiologist was made. Subsequently, she was subjected for primary angioplasty. Relevant Test Results Prior to Catheterization: Blood results showed sodium of 134 mmol/L, potassium of 3.5 mmol/L, urea of 3.2 mmol/L and creatinine of 67 mmol/L. Liver enzymes were within normal limits with aspartate transaminase of 38 U/L and alkaline phosphatase of 91 U/L. Creatinine kinase was 330 U/L but increased to 2861 U/L during subsequent day. In addition, COVID-19 RTK antigen was negative. Relevant Catheterization Findings: Coronary angiogram revealed mild disease at proximal right coronary artery and proximal left circumflex. Minimal disease was noted at distal left main stem, but severe disease was observed from proximal left anterior descending till mid left anterior descending. Heterogenous plague suggesting thrombus was seen at ostial first diagonal as well. [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Interventional Management Procedural Step: Right femoral assess was obtained with 7Fr sheath, and SL 3.5 7Fr guiding catheter was engaged to left coronary artery. Intracoronary heparin and tirofiban were given prior to wiring. First diagonal was wired with Sion Blue while left anterior descending was wired with Runthrough Floppy. Post-wiring both vessels, coronary flow remained TIMI 3 and hence we decided to proceed with IVUS. From IVUS, noted fibrous elastic plague with heavy thrombus burden. Intracoronary streptokinase was given and noted improvement of thrombus from IVUS. BMW wired to left circumflex. Lesion predilated with scoring balloon and associated with no reflow events, resolved post vasodilators. Left main stem was stented with Onyx 3.5 x 26 mm and deployed at 16 atm. Both side branches wires were rewired into same branches via Crusade microcatheter. LMS stent was post dilated with NC Euphora 4.5 mm at nominal pressure. Noted impingement of both ostium diagonal and circumflex branches. Balloon kissing inflation was performed for both LAD/Diagonal bifurcation and LMS/LAD/circumflex bifurcation. POT was performed post balloon kissing inflation with NC Euphora 3.5 mm and 4.5 mm for both LAD and LMS respectively. Next, IVUS was repeated for mid LAD stent length and Onyx 3.0 mm X 15 mm was deployed at nominal pressure. IVUS repeated and noted under-expansion of overlapped segments and post dilated with NC Euphora 3.0 mm at high pressure. [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Conclusions: Our clinical vignette demonstrated few learning points including utilization of IVUS during primary angioplasty. Understanding of plague characteristic ensures adequate stents expansion especially with fibro elastic plague. In addition, we also demonstrated several precautions in dealing with bifurcation lesions including usage of double lumen microcatheter for wiring the side branches. Even though we opted for provisional stenting, balloon kissing inflation played pivotal role in preserving flow into side branches.","Bin Mohd Said, M. R.; Rajalingam, V.; Silveraju, A.

Results 21 PED directors from 18 states were interviewed. Directors perceived an increased volume of mental health visits and higher patient acuity. Some PEDs innovatively adapted services but were also met with new barriers in providing care due to increased use of PPE and required COVID-19 testing. Transfer to inpatient psychiatric units was more complicated due to reduced overall bed capacity and the need for a negative COVID test. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic strained an already fragile pediatric emergency mental health system. Building infrastructure for adaptations and mental health service reserve capacity could help ensure proper care for pediatric patients with mental health crises during future public health emergencies.","Bowden, Cadence F.; Worsley, Diana, Doupnik, Stephanie K.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2022.03.019","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Adolescent Health;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30667,""
"Health Impact On The Elderly Survivors Of Covid-19: Six Months Follow Up","Purpose: To analyse factors associated with mortality at 6 months in survivors older than 70 years after hospital admission for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Descriptive observational study with follow-up at 6 months. All patients over 70 years of age, discharged from the Hospital Central de la Cruz Roja, after hospitalization for COVID-19 consecutively during the months March to May 2020 were included. The outcome at 6 months (mortality, readmissions) were collected. Results: A total of 165 patients were included. Mean age 88.5Â±6.73, women 69.1%. High comorbidity 33.9%.Mean previous Barthel Index was 65.39Â±33.64 and at discharge 58.12Â±34.04.24.2% had severe polypharmacy and 47.9% severe frailty.Six months after hospital discharge, 13% died and 23.8% required at least one readmission. More than half of the sample had some of the following sequelae: dyspnea 20%(33), functional impairment 41.7%(69), cognitive impairment 31.3%(52)or depressive symptoms 42.4%(70).Functional impairment at discharge was associated with an increased risk of mortality (OR 5.33;95% CI 1.11-25.73). Conclusions: The functional status was a factor associated with risk of mortality at 6 months.

"Correlates of COVID-19 vaccination intentions: Attitudes, institutional trust, fear, conspiracy beliefs, and vaccine skepticism","Successful campaigns to combat the COVID-19 pandemic depend, in part, on people's willingness to be vaccinated. It is therefore critical to understand the factors that determine people's vaccination intentions. We applied a reasoned action approach - the theory of planned behavior - to explore these factors. We used data from an online survey of adults (18â€“74 years;nÂ =Â 5044) conducted in Germany between April 9 and April 28, 2021 and found that attitudes toward getting vaccinated predicted vaccination intentions, while normative and control beliefs did not. In turn, positive attitudes toward getting vaccinated were supported by trust in science and fear of COVID-19 whereas negative attitudes were associated with acceptance of conspiracy theories and skepticism regarding vaccines in general. We advise policymakers, physicians, and health care providers to address vaccination hesitancy by emphasizing factors that support positive attitudes toward getting vaccinated, such as prevention of serious illness, death, and long-term health detriments, as opposed to exerting social pressure or pointing to the ease of getting vaccinated.","Seddig, Daniel, Maskileyson, Dina, Davidov, Eldad, Ajzen, Icek, Schmidt, Peter","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.114981","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Science & Medicine;: 114981, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30669,""
"Galveston County Youth Risk Survey: A Glimpse into Our Childrenâ€™s Health and Wellbeing","OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The 2020-2021 Galveston County Youth Risk Survey continues past efforts to characterize behavioral risks for local youth, identify disproportionate risks among groups, and provide the data needed for action and intervention to improve the health and safety of our youth in Galveston, Texas. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: While the survey is based on the CDC Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), there was community need for an expanded survey and thus a workgroup was formed to create the Galveston Youth Risk Survey, including members from UTMBs Institute for Translational Sciences, a number of other UTMB departments and Centers, the Research, Education, and Community Health (REACH) Coalition, several school districts, Teen Health Clinic, and a variety of other community health organizations with vested interest. The survey was administered in November 2020 via ScanTron and REDCap to two local high schools with populations greater than 2,000. CDC guidelines for administration of the YRBSS were followed. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: A total of 2,428 students completed the survey from GISD and DISD. The survey provided insight into the following categories, with mental health emerging as a pressing issue, specifically stress and depression, particularly among females. All results are reported in several contexts, including comparisons by gender, grade, and ethnicity, a comparison to state and national statistics when available, as well as risk trends from previous surveys. Demographics Safety, including driving, violence, and bullying Mental Health: stress, depression, suicidal ideation, and ACEs Human Trafficking Substance Use, including smoking, alcohol, marijuana, and other drug use Sexual Behaviors, including contraceptive use Body Weight and Body Image Health Conditions Home Life: Support and Security DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The report has been presented to the school districts, immediate stakeholders, REACH membership, and the general public.

"Engaging the public in bidirectional communications to increase research literacy and improve the health of Indiana residents through All IN for Health","OBJECTIVES/GOALS: All IN for Health has initiated social media engagement strategies to create bi-directional communication around improved health and research literacy with the public. In addition, the All IN for Healths community-led advisory board, comprised of diverse individuals and organizations, will provide insight on research design and dissemination. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI) has committed to enhancing the publics engagement efforts in the All IN for Health program. This program was established in 2017 to improve the health of Indiana residents through the promotion of health resources and opportunities to participate in research. In 2021, the Indiana CTSI decided to integrate public engagement more formally. An official collaboration with the Indiana CTSIs Community Health Partnerships program was created, a digital engagement specialist was hired, and several new community and population health advisory board members were welcomed for quarterly meetings representing the rural and urban areas of the state, faith-based communities, health departments, and underrepresented groups in research. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: A social media campaign, informed by the All IN for Health advisory board was launched in November 2021, and the advisory board has been meeting on a quarterly basis. All IN for Healths established priority area is currently COVID-19 vaccination uptake, and our prioritized audiences are underserved and under resourced in urban and rural communities, and minoritized populations. All IN for Health has posted approximately 20 times per month on topics including COVID-19, Alzeheimers Disease, Diabetes, fitness, mental health, and research studies with a goal to increase followers and engagements by 20%. The hope is that this engagement will also result in an increase in the monthly e-newsletter subscribers and study volunteer registry participants. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: All IN for Health has initiated new public engagement efforts to increase the value of the services offered to Indiana residents. Through consultation and co-design with members of the public and dissemination of research opportunities All IN for Health will be better suited to improve health and research literacy.","Claxton, Gina, Delp, Lynsey, Hudson, Brenda, Drury, Christine","https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2022.52","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical and Translational Science; 6(s1):11-12, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30671,""
"Sustaining community engagement during COVID-19: High stress and loneliness reported","OBJECTIVES/GOALS: COVID-19 has taken a big toll on health, mental health and community well-being. COVID-19 has also presented unique opportunities for community engagement programs to sustain their work within communities. Low-tech methods of engagement might provide opportunities for success. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: When we could not be in the field due to COVID-19, we recontacted our 12.4k HealthStreet members by phone and in 12 months successfully contacted 3.2k. By contrast, over the two COVID affected years (2019 & 2020), our in-person recruitment efforts in the community fell to 832 from 1817 in the two prior years (2017 & 2018). Reconnecting with existing members is an important aspect of sustainable community engagement. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: While 8/10 of the 3.2 K sample had internet access in their homes, 9/10 said having it was somewhat to very important. Importantly, 1 in 3 people who had additional needs or suggestions were looking for better COVID-19 knowledge or ways to reduce the threat of illness, 1 in 4 wanted resources;and 1 in 5 encouraged us to keep doing what we were doing. Among recontacted members, 30.2% indicated a high stress level (8 & over on a 10 point scale) while 15.2% reported a high level of loneliness (8 & over on a 10 point scale). High stress was significantly more likely among those identifying as African American (23.1%) compared to non-African American (16.6%). Loneliness did not vary (10.1% among both). DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Sustainable community engagement was important to reach community members during the pandemic, especially given the high rates of stress and loneliness among members contacted. In-person connections were reduced, but phone contact provided an opportunity for successful engagement.","Striley, Catherine Woodstock, Varma, Deepthi S.; Chaudhari, Piyush V.; Cottler, Linda B.","https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2022.68","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical and Translational Science; 6(s1):17, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30672,""
"Identification of Symptom-Based Phenotypes in PASC Patients through Bipartite Network Analysis: Implications for Patient Triage and Precision Treatment Strategies","OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients experience multiple symptoms weeks and months after the acute phase of infection. Our goal was to use advanced machine learning methods to identify PASC phenotypes based on their symptom profiles, and their association with critical adverse outcomes, with the goal of designing future targeted interventions. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Data. All COVID-19 outpatients from 12 University of Minnesota hospitals and 60 clinics. Independent variables consisted of 20 CDC-defined PASC symptoms extracted from clinical notes using NLP. Covariates included demographics, and outcomes included New Psychological Diagnostic Evaluation, and Number of PASC Hospital Visits (&gt;=5). Cases (n=3235) consisted of patients with at least one symptom, and controls (n=3034) consisted of patients with no symptoms. Method. (1) Used bipartite network analysis and modularity maximization to identify patient-symptom biclusters. (2) Used multivariable logistic regression (adjusted for demographics and corrected through Bonferroni) to measure the odds ratio of each patient bicluster to adverse outcomes, compared to controls, and to each of the other biclusters. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The analysis identified 6 PASC phenotypes (http://www.skbhavnani.com/DIVA/Images/Fig-1-PASC-Network.jpg), which was statistically significant compared to 1000 random permutations of the data (PASC=.31, Random Median=.27, z=11, P&lt;.01). Three of the clusters (Cluster-1, Cluster-4, and Cluster-5 encircled with ovals in Fig. 1) contained CNS-related symptoms, which had statistically significant risk for one or both of the adverse outcomes. For example, Cluster-1 with critical CNS symptoms (depression, insomnia, anxiety, brain-fog/difficulty-thinking), had a significantly higher OR compared to the controls for New Psychological Diagnostic Evaluation (OR=6.6, CI=4.9-9.1, P-corr&lt;.001), in addition to having a significantly higher ORs for the same outcome compared to all the other clusters. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The results identified distinct PASC phenotypes based on symptom profiles, with three of them related to CNS symptoms, each of which had significantly higher risk for specific adverse outcomes compared to controls. We will test whether these phenotypes replicate in the N3C data, and explore their translation into triage and treatment strategies.","Bhavnani, Suresh K.; Zhang, Weibin, Hatch, Sandra, Urban, Randall, Tignanelli, Christopher","https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2022.207","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical and Translational Science; 6(s1):68, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30673,""
"Rates of self-reported postpartum depressive symptoms in the United States before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic","This study aimed to determine the relationship between the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in postpartum depressive symptoms (PDS) in individuals in the United States. Further analyses explored how these changes related to state-level measures of pandemic severity, economic hardship, and social isolation. Data were collected from users of the Flo mobile health application who completed a survey about their mood within 90 days of giving birth. Analyses assessed changes in national and state-level self-reported PDS from a pre-pandemic period (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 159,478) to a pandemic period (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 118,622). Linear regression determined which state-level pandemic severity or economic factors were associated with changes in PDS. National rates of PDS increased from 6.5% (pre-pandemic) to 6.9% (pandemic). There was a significant increase in PDS over the course of the pandemic timeframe. Linear regressions revealed a negative association between percent change in PDS across states and COVID-19 deaths per 100Ã‚Â K residents as well as 2020 women's unemployment rate. There was no association between change in PDS and COVID-19 cases per 100Ã‚Â K residents, percent job loss, percent change in women's unemployment rate, or percentage of population staying at home. There was a national increase in PDS that worsened over the course of a year following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. States with a greater increase in PDS tended to show overall fewer deaths from COVID-19 and lower women's unemployment rates. Further work is needed to identify what individual-level factors may be driving these differences.","Bajaj, Salimgaraev, Zhaunova, Payne","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.04.011","20220427","COVID-19; Postpartum depressive symptoms; Pregnancy and postpartum","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30674,""
"Healthcare contacts with self-harm during COVID-19: An e-cohort whole-population-based study using individual-level linked routine electronic health records in Wales, UK, 2016-March 2021","Reduced rates of help seeking by those who self-harmed during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported. To understand changes in healthcare service contacts for self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic across primary, emergency and secondary care. This retrospective cohort study used routine electronic healthcare data for Wales, United Kingdom, from 2016 to March 14, 2021. Population-based data from primary care, emergency departments and hospital admissions were linked at individual-level. All Welsh residents aged Ã¢â€°Â¥10 years over the study period were included in the study. Primary, emergency and secondary care contacts with self-harm at any time between 2016 and March 14, 2021 were identified. Outcomes were counts, incidence, prevalence and proportion of self-harm contacts relative to all contacts in each and all settings, as well as the proportion of people contacting one or more settings with self-harm. Weekly trends were modelled using generalised estimated equations, with differences between 2020 (to March 2021) and comparison years 2016-2018 (to March 2017-2019) quantified using difference in differences, from which mean rate of odds ratios (ÃŽÂ¼ROR) across years was reported. The study included 3,552,210 individuals over the study period. Self-harm contacts reduced across services in March and December 2020 compared to previous years. Primary care contacts with self-harm reduced disproportionately compared to non-self-harm contacts (ÃŽÂ¼ROR = 0.7, p&lt;0.05), while their proportion increased in emergency departments during April 2020 (ÃŽÂ¼ROR = 1.3, p&lt;0.05 in 2/3 comparison years) and hospital admissions during April-May 2020 (ÃŽÂ¼ROR = 1.2, p&lt;0.05 in 2/3 comparison years). Despite this, those who self-harmed in April 2020 were more likely to be seen in primary care than other settings compared to previous years (ÃŽÂ¼ROR = 1.2, p&lt;0.05). A lower proportion of those with self-harm contacts in emergency departments were subsequently admitted to hospital in December 2020 compared to previous years (ÃŽÂ¼ROR = 0.5, p&lt;0.05). These findings suggest that those who self-harmed during the COVID-19 pandemic may have been less likely to seek help, and those who did so faced more stringent criteria for admission. Communications encouraging those who self-harm to seek help during pandemics may be beneficial. However, this needs to be supported by maintained provision of mental health services.","DelPozo-Banos, Lee, Friedmann, Akbari, Torabi, Lloyd, Lyons, John","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266967","20220427","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30675,""
"Rates, perceptions and predictors of depression, anxiety and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)-like symptoms about Covid-19 in adolescents","Increasing evidence has shown that the Covid-19 outbreak, and subsequent school closures and exam cancellations that followed, has impacted adolescent mental health. The current cross-sectional study examined rates of depression, anxiety and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)-like symptoms about Covid-19 in adolescents and whether current or past mental health support, additional support in school, keyworker status, poorer household relationships since the outbreak of Covid-19 or reduced physical activity were associated with elevated levels of depression, anxiety or PTSD-like symptoms. Lastly, it examined perceived changes in mental health due to the Covid-19 pandemic, school closures and the cancellation of exams. A total of 899 adolescents (14-18 years) took part in the 'in isolation instead of in school' (INISS) project. Findings indicated that older adolescents, females, those who currently or previously received mental health support or additional support in school and adolescents who reported poorer relationships at home since Covid-19 were more likely to meet clinical threshold levels for their mental health. Adolescents highlighted worsening of their mental health due to Covid-19 and school closures with mixed positive and negative impact of exam cancellations. Adolescents experiencing clinical threshold levels of depression and anxiety uniquely reported worsening of their mental health since the Covid-19 pandemic, school closures and exam cancellations. Understanding the rates, perceptions and factors associated with increases in depression, anxiety and PTSD-like symptoms in adolescents during the Covid-19 pandemic will inform national policy in supporting adolescent mental health and recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.","Stewart, Fry, McAra, Hamilton, King, Laurie, McCluskey","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266818","20220427","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30676,""

"Substance Use Among Youth During the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Systematic Review","To review the literature on the trends in substance use among youth during the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The pandemic has given rise to concerns about the mental health and social well-being of youth, including its potential to increase or exacerbate substance use behaviors. This systematic review identified and included 49 studies of use across alcohol, cannabis, tobacco, e-cigarettes/vaping, and other drugs, and unspecified substances. The majority of studies across all categories of youth substance use reported reductions in prevalence, except in the case of other drugs and unspecified drug and substance use, which included three studies that reported an increase in use and three studies that reported decrease in use. Overall, the results of this review suggest that the prevalence of youth substance use has largely declined during the pandemic. Youth substance use in the post-pandemic years will require monitoring and continued surveillance.","Layman, Thorisdottir, Halldorsdottir, Sigfusdottir, Allegrante, Kristjansson","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-022-01338-z","20220427","Adolescents; COVID-19; Drug abuse; Pandemic; Substance use; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30678,""
"Depression in healthcare workers from the COVID-19 Care and Isolation Center - Villa Panamericana: a single-center prospective study in Peru","Depression is a mental problem that affects the well-being of healthcare workers, impacting the quality of care and even leading to commit suicide. We aim to the levels of depression in frontline healthcare workers during the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in Peru. A prospective cohort study was designed in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Care and Isolation Center - Villa Panamericana in eastern Lima. Care and Isolation Center-Villa Panamericana houses about 150 healthcare workers and COVID-19 patients. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating scale was used for depression assessment. A total of 96 participants (30Ã‚Â±5.6 years) were analyzed: 15 (15.6%) physicians, 39 (40.6%) nurses, 14 (14.6%) medical technologists, and 28 (29.2%) nurse technicians. Mild, moderate, and severe depression were present in 35 (36.5%), 44 (45.8%), and 9 (9.4%) of the cases, respectively. The physicians and nurses reported more severe levels of depression: 8 (53.3%) physicians and 18 (46.2%) nurses presented moderate depression; and 2 (13.3%) physicians and 3 (7.7%) nurses presented severe depression (p=0.005). This study determined greater symptoms of depression according to years of work (p=0.001). Thirty-two healthcare workers had COVID-19, 4 (12.5%) physicians, 9 (28.1%) nurses, 7 (21.9%) medical technologists, and 12 (37.5%) nurse technicians. Twenty-four (75%) participants showed symptoms of COVID-19 and developed moderate (12 [37.5%]) and severe (3 [9.4%]) symptoms of depression (p=0.041).

"The Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Substance Use in the US","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been associated with dramatic increases in substance use, as marked by increased alcohol, nicotine and cannabis sales. Lethal opioid overdoses also increased dramatically, especially during the initial phases of the epidemic when lockdowns and social isolation combined with increasing fentanyl contamination of the illicit drug supply resulted in more overdoses and fewer opportunities for rescue. Substance use, and especially inhalational drug use, increases the likelihood of both transmission and severe infection. Youth are especially vulnerable to substance use and have increased risk of long-term problems. These outcomes highlight the need for greater access to substance use treatment. Virtual treatment, which emerged as a promising format during the pandemic, may reduce access barriers.

"Association of Social Determinants of Health and Vaccinations With Child Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the US","The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected mental health in socioeconomically disadvantaged children in the US. However, little is known about the relationship of preexisting and time-varying social determinants of health (SDoH) at individual and structural levels, vaccination eligibility/rates, and the racial and ethnic differences to trajectories of child mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. To estimate the association of trajectories of child mental health to multilevel SDoH and vaccination eligibility/rates. This prospective longitudinal cohort study, conducted from May 16, 2020, to March 2, 2021, integrated structural-level, pandemic-related data with the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort data (release 4.0). The ABCD study recruited 11Ã¢â‚¬Â¯878 children (baseline) and conducted 6 COVID-19 rapid response surveys across 21 US sites (in 17 states) from May 16, 2020, to March 2, 2021. Preexisting individual (eg, household income) and structural (area deprivation) SDoH and time-varying individual (eg, food insecurity, unemployment) and structural (eg, social distancing, vaccination eligibility/rates) SDoH. Perceived Stress Scale, the National Institutes of Health-Toolbox emotion measures, and COVID-19-related worry. The longitudinal sample included 8493 children (mean [SD] age, 9.93 [0.63] years; 5011 girls [47.89%]; 245 Asian [2.34%], 1213 Black [11.59%], 2029 Hispanic [19.39%], 5851 White [55.93%], and 1124 children of other/multiracial ethnicity [10.74%]). Trajectories of stress, sadness, and COVID-19-related worry decreased after adult vaccination rollout. Compared with younger children, boys, White children, or those living with married parents, those who reported greater perceived stress included older children aged 12 to 15 years (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.26; 95% CI, 0.12-0.41; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001); girls (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.89; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001); Hispanic children (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.24; 95% CI, 0.01-0.47; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.04); children living with separated parents (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.50; 95% CI, 0.03-0.96; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.04); children experiencing disrupted medical health care access (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.19; 95% CI, 0.01-0.36; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.04); children living in economically deprived neighborhoods (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.28; 95% CI, 0.05-0.51; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.02); children living in areas with more full-time working-class adults who were unable to social distance (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.35; 95% CI, 0.13-2.67; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.04); and children living in states with fewer fully vaccinated adults (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.59; 95% CI, 0.16-1.02; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.007). COVID-19 pandemic-related worry was higher among Asian children (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.37; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.003), Black children (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.33; 95% CI, 0.22-0.43; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), children of other/multiracial ethnicity (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.17; 95% CI, 0.09-0.25; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and children with disrupted medical health care (ÃŽÂ² = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.21) and disrupted mental health treatment (ÃŽÂ² = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06-0.16). Inability to afford food was associated with increased sadness (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.50; 95% CI, 0.06-2.93; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.04). States with later vaccination eligibility dates for all adults were associated with greater COVID-19-related worry (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.16; 95% CI, 0.01-0.31; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.03) and decreased positive affect (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-1.78; 95% CI, -3.39 to -0.18; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.03) among children. Results of this study suggest a disproportionately adverse association of the COVID-19 pandemic with child mental health among racial and ethnic minority groups, which may be improved by addressing modifiable individual (food insecurity, unemployment, health services, parental supervision) and structural (area deprivation, job protection, vaccination) SDoH.","Xiao, Yip, Pathak, Mann","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.0818","20220427","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30682,""
"Abuse and Discrimination Experienced by Older Women in the Era of COVID-19: A Two-Wave Representative Community Survey in Hong Kong","Although there is a growing volume of research on violence against women, violence against older women has received little attention to date. Little is known about the experience of elder abuse, discrimination, loneliness, and health among older women, in particular in the era of COVID-19 when our lives have been changed drastically. Using two waves of survey data (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1,498), this study compared the estimates of elder abuse and age discrimination before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, examined their associations with physical and mental health, and explored the mediating effects of loneliness on the associations in two independent samples of older women in Hong Kong. Reductions in some forms of abuse and discrimination against older women during the pandemic were observed. Findings from regression analyses show that elder abuse and age discrimination were associated with poorer health, and these associations were mediated by loneliness.","Yan, Lai, Lee, Bai, K L Ng","https://doi.org/10.1177/10778012221085998","20220427","COVID-19; discrimination; elder abuse; health; loneliness; violence against women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30683,""
"Psychological impact of the quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic on the general European adult population: a systematic review of the evidence","Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) different countries implemented quarantine measures to limit the spread of the virus. Many studies analysed the mental health consequences of restrictive confinement, some of which focused their attention on specific populations. The general public's mental health also requires significant attention, however. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 quarantine on the general population's mental health in different European countries. Risk and protective factors associated with the psychological symptoms were analysed. A systematic search was conducted on four electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus and Google Scholar). Studies published up until 20th April 2021, and following eligibility criteria were selected for this review. One thousand three hundred thirty-five (1335) studies were screened, 105 of which were included. Via network analysis, the current study investigated the pathways that underlie possible risk factors for mental health outcomes. Anxiety, depression, distress and post-traumatic symptoms are frequently experienced during the COVID-19 quarantine and are often associated with changes in sleeping and eating habits. Some socio-demographic and COVID-19-related variables were found to be risk factors for an individual's wellbeing. In particular, being female, young, having a low income, being unemployed and having COVID-19-like symptoms or chronic disorders, were found to be the most common risk factors for mental health symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic represented an unprecedented threat to mental health globally. In order to prevent psychological morbidity and offer support tailored to short-, medium- and long-term negative outcomes, it is essential to identify the direct and indirect psychosocial effects of the lockdown and quarantine measures, especially in certain vulnerable groups. In addition to measures to reduce the curve of viral transmission, policy makers should urgently take into consideration provisions to alleviate hazards to mental health.","Bonati, Campi, Segre","https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796022000051","20220427","COVID-19 pandemic; general population; mental health; quarantine; review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30684,""
"Integrating Telepsychiatry Into Rural Primary Care for Upstream Prevention: Feasibility Case Study of the Faith Net Program","For decades, there has been a deficit of mental health services in rural areas of the United States. Beyond that longstanding need, the COVID-19 pandemic has reportedly increased the prevalence of unmet mental health needs among adults. Presently, many non-critical but urgent mental health concerns are first identified in rural emergency departments. This report describes the results of a 6-month feasibility case study of a program to integrate telepsychiatric triage ""upstream"" from emergency departments in rural primary care. At routine primary care encounters in a single midwestern rural county, patients at risk for moderate-severe or severe depression, expressing thoughts of self-harm, or otherwise presenting in a way that raised clinical concern for mental or behavioral health, were referred to on-site telepsychiatric triage. Patients whose triage indicated further concern were provided six psychiatric and/or social work encounters for stabilization and treatment. 68 patients were referred to telepsychiatric triage during the pilot study (.85% of the estimated adult population in the county). Of those, only two had a documented mental/behavioral health diagnosis prior to triage, but 46 were diagnosed with at least one psychiatric disorder during the program. This model of telepsychiatric triage was feasible in rural primary care and may support identification and mitigation of unmet mental health needs.","Agley, Barnes, Tidd, Todd, Friedman, Gordon, Richardson, Delong","https://doi.org/10.1177/00469580221097428","20220427","case study; primary care; rural health; telehealth; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30685,""
"Comparison of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children-Related Myocarditis, Classic Viral Myocarditis, and COVID-19 Vaccine-Related Myocarditis in Children","Background Although rare, classic viral myocarditis in the pediatric population is a disease that carries significant morbidity and mortality. Since 2020, myocarditis has been a common component of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 2021, myocarditis related to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines was recognized as a rare adverse event. This study aims to compare classic, MIS-C, and COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis with regard to clinical presentation, course, and outcomes. Methods and Results In this retrospective cohort study, we compared patients aged &lt;21Ã‚Â years hospitalized at our institution with classic viral myocarditis from 2015 to 2019, MIS-C myocarditis from March 2020 to February 2021, and vaccine-related myocarditis from May 2021 to June 2021. Of 201 total participants, 43 patients had classic myocarditis, 149 had MIS-C myocarditis, and 9 had vaccine-related myocarditis. At presentation, ejection fraction was lowest for those with classic myocarditis, with ejection fraction &lt;55% present in 58% of patients. Nearly all patients with MIS-C myocarditis (n=139, 93%) and all patients with vaccine-related myocarditis (n=9, 100%) had normal left ventricular ejection fraction at the time of discharge compared with 70% (n=30) of the classic myocarditis group (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). At 3 months after discharge, of the 21 children discharged with depressed ejection fraction, none of the 10 children with MIS-C myocarditis had residual dysfunction compared with 3 of the 11 (27%) patients in the classic myocarditis group. Conclusions Compared with classic myocarditis, those with MIS-C myocarditis had better clinical outcomes, including rapid recovery of cardiac function. Patients with vaccine-related myocarditis had prompt resolution of symptoms and improvement of cardiac function.","Patel, Kelleman, West, Peter, Dove, Butto, Oster","https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.121.024393","20220427","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; MISÃ¢â‚¬ÂC; mRNA vaccine; myocarditis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30686,""
"Two years after lockdown: reviewing the effects of COVID-19 on health services and support for adolescents living with HIV in South Africa","South Africa's progress towards the 95-95-95 goals has been significantly slower among adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV), among whom antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, retention in care and viral suppression remain a concern. After 2 years of living with COVID-19, it is important to examine the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic on healthcare resources, access to HIV services and availability of support structures, to assess their impact on HIV care for ALHIV. The COVID-19 response in South Africa has shifted healthcare resources towards combatting COVID-19, affecting the quality and availability of HIV services-especially for vulnerable populations, such as ALHIV. The healthcare system's response to COVID-19 has threatened to diminish fragile gains in engaging ALHIV with HIV services, especially as this group relies on overburdened public health facilities for their HIV care. Reallocation of limited health resources utilized by ALHIV disrupted healthcare workers' capacity to form and maintain therapeutic relationships with ALHIV and monitor ALHIV for ART-related side effects, treatment difficulties and mental health conditions, affecting their ability to retain ALHIV in HIV care. Prevailing declines in HIV surveillance meant missed opportunities to identify and manage opportunistic infections and HIV disease progression in adolescents. ""Lockdown"" restrictions have limited access to healthcare facilities and healthcare workers for ALHIV by reducing clinic appointments and limiting individual movement. ALHIV have had restricted access to social, psychological and educational support structures, including national feeding schemes. This limited access, coupled with reduced opportunities for routine maternal and sexual and reproductive health services, may place adolescent girls at greater risk of transactional sex, child marriages, unintended pregnancy and mother-to-child HIV transmission. Adolescent HIV care in South Africa is often overlooked; however, ART adherence among ALHIV in South Africa is particularly susceptible to the consequences of a world transformed by COVID-19. The current structures in place to support HIV testing, ART initiation and adherence have been reshaped by disruptions to health structures, new barriers to access health services and the limited available education and psychosocial support systems. Reflecting on these limitations can drive considerations for minimizing these barriers and retaining ALHIV in HIV care.","van Staden, Laurenzi, Toska","https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25904","20220427","ART adherence; COVID-19; adolescents living with HIV; barriers; limited support; resource reallocation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30687,""
"The incidence and characteristics of chronic pain and fatigue after 12 months later admitting with COVID-19; The Post- COVID 19 syndrome","This study aimed to evaluate chronic pain and fatigue in patients 12 months after hospitalization for Covid-19. We studied the COVID-19 patients discharged from Hospital, March 10 and April 20, 2020. A total of 157 patients were included in this study. Forty-three patients (27.4%) complained of chronic fatigue and muscle weakness in the last six months. The visual analog fatigue scale (VAFS) score of 3.84 Ã‚Â± 1.48 was obtained. Forty patients (25.5%) were suspected of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).Twenty-four patients (15.3%) had severe chronic pain or exacerbation of previous chronic pain, most of which were reported in the lower back (70.8%) and lower extremities (66.7%). Pain intensity had a mean score of 2.33 Ã‚Â± 0.87 and was mainly described as ""muscle cramps,"" ""persistent dull pain,"" and ""boring and numbing.""

"Assessment of safety attitudes, professionalism and exploration of medical students' experiences","The present study was conducted to examine the interns' perceptions of safety attitude and professionalism and to explore their experiences about adherence to the principles during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study was a mixed-method that was performed in two quantitative and qualitative stages. The medical interns at X University (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°140) were entered. In the quantitative phase, the assessment of the interns' Safety Attitudes and Professionalism was conducted by a survey. In the qualitative phase, data were gathered by semi-structured interviews. The experiences of participants were analyzed by the inductive content analysis approach of Graneheim and Lundman. Participants' perception scores on safety attitude and professionalism were 98.02 (14.78). The results were explained in a theme of ""weakness in systemic accountability in compliance with professionalism and safety"". The theme included three categories: 'support system inadequacy', and 'null curriculum in safety and professionalism education'. The present results showed participants' perception scores on safety attitude and professionalism were below the moderate level. The systemic issues were explored as influencing factors in the occurrence of unsafe and unprofessional behaviors. They reported the weakness of the support system (individual, teamwork, mental health, well-being, management, and culture), and the null curriculum in education of professional, and safety principles effective on unprofessional and unsafe behaviors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is recommended to create mechanisms to support the development of professionalism of healthcare workers, especially, novice providers and students, and pay attention to the safety and professionalism in formal and informal educational programs.","Keshmiri, Raadabadi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03387-7","20220427","Attitudes; COVID-19 pandemic; Medical student; Professionalism; Qualitative; Safety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30689,""
"High-risk pregnant women's experiences of the receiving prenatal care in COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study","Women with high-risk pregnancies are among the most vulnerable groups that require additional precautionary measures against the spread of COVID-19 plus receiving prenatal care. Yet, there is limited information on the status of prenatal care in women with high-risk pregnancies. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of women with high-risk pregnancies who were receiving prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present qualitative study was conducted on mothers with high-risk pregnancies from September 2020 to March 2021. Purposeful sampling continued until achieving data saturation. Ghaem, Ommolbanin, and Imam Reza in Mashhad, Iran served as the research environment. Face-to-face and semi-structured interviews were effective data collection methods. Each interview lasted between 20 to 45Ã¢â‚¬â€°min (on average 30). The total number of participants was 31. Data analysis was carried out simultaneously with data collection using the qualitative content analysis method developed by Granheim and Landman (2004). Following the reduction and analysis of data from women in high-risk pregnancies, as well as their perceptions and experiences with health services during the COVID-19 pandemic, eight subcategories and three main categories were identified, including 1) ""Negative psychology responses,"" 2) ""Adoption behavior,"" and 3) ""Adjustment of health services in mutual protection."" Fear, anxiety, stress, feelings of loneliness, sadness, depression, guilt, doubt and conflict in receiving services were examples of negative psychological responses. The adaptive behaviors' category reflected the behaviors of women with high-risk pregnancies in the context of the COVID COVID-19 pandemic. The Adjustment of health services in mutual protection indicated that health workers took preventive and protective measures against COVID-19, which, in addition to protecting themselves and their clients against COVID-19, gave women a sense of security. Receiving prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges for women with high-risk pregnancies, negatively impacting their psychological state and health-seeking behavior. Supportive and preventive care can ensure that women with high-risk pregnancies receive optimal prenatal care that focuses on COVID-19 prevention. We recommend implementing screening, psychological counseling, and education for women with high-risk pregnancies, as well as ensuring that they have access to women-centered health care services.","Mirzakhani, Shoorab, Akbari, Khadivzadeh","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04676-1","20220427","COVID-19; High risk; Pandemic; Pregnancy; Prenatal care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30690,""
"""When you have an immune disease like HIV and there is a pandemic, you still have to pay your bills"": COVID-19-related challenges among people living with HIV and lessons for care delivery","COVID-19 has disrupted routine medical care and increased psychosocial and economic stressors on a global scale, yet the full impact on people living with HIV (PLWH) and the HIV continuum of care remains unknown. As the pandemic continues to pose a significant threat to PLWH and their care, this research qualitatively aimed to elicit COVID-19-related challenges and perspectives of PLWH during the early phase of the pandemic and to identify lessons learned and impactful strategies for facilitating HIV care. We recruited 32 PLWH who receive care at a large academic medical center for semi-structured remote interviews to assess psychological/structural stressors experienced during the pandemic and to discern strategies for improving care. Most participants identified as Black (91%) and heterosexual (56%). Overall, PLWH reported exacerbated mental health stressors (e.g., anxiety, depression, substance use). Most participants cited no issues with antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence or retention in care, yet five participants reported appointment cancellations or physician inaccessibility. Participants provided specific feedback for facilitating continued engagement in care during the pandemic, including telemedicine and education/patient empowerment. By seeking participant-provided solutions, this study centered on PLWH's experiences and emphasized proactive HIV care strategies for prioritizing patient empowerment and healthcare adaptability during a rapidly evolving pandemic.","Joseph, Hall, Devlin, Kerman, Schmitt, McNulty, Ridgway","https://doi.org/10.1080/09540121.2022.2067314","20220427","ART adherence; COVID-19; PLWH; psychosocial stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30691,""
"Development and Evaluation of a Blended Learning Mindfulness Program for High School Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Many adolescents worldwide suffer from stress or unhealthy emotional states such as depression. There is a trend toward limited physical contact via social distancing practices that developed during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. An experimental study aimed at investigating the effects of a mindfulness program on stress, concentration, self-esteem, and self-control in high school students. A 10-week mindfulness intervention was provided to the experimental group (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°89) from September-November 2020, while the control group (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°89) received general health education. Four weeks after the program, the experimental group showed reduced stress and improved concentration, self-esteem, and self-control compared to baseline.The blended learning mindfulness program is effective improving concentration and should be incorporated into the formal high school curriculum.","Kang, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1177/10598405221095346","20220427","COVID-19; adolescent; concentration; distance education; mental health; mindfulness; school nurses; schools; self-control; self-esteem; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30692,""
"Impact of SARS-COV2 Pandemic on Patients with Endometriosis and Their Health Care","<b><i>Background:</i></b> Endometriosis is a debilitating chronic inflammatory disease. The current SARS-COV2 pandemic has had an impact on the management of these patients. Tele-health care has been a relevant tool. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of the SARS-COV2 pandemic on the perceived clinical health status and the type of care received in patients with endometriosis. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We evaluated 945 premenopausal women treated at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona between October 1 and December 31, 2020. Five hundred forty-nine women had endometriosis, and 396 had other benign gynecological diseases. An online health survey was sent to these patients. Clinicopathological features data were recorded. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Compared to patients with other benign gynecological diseases, a higher proportion of patients with endometriosis reported worsening of their symptoms (148/549, 27% vs. 85/396, 21.5%) and concern about their disease (515/549, 93.8% vs. 342/396, 86.4%), and more frequently received tele-health care (73.8% vs. 54.0%) during the pandemic. Patients with endometriosis and ""significant"" pelvic pain reported more concern and worsening than patients without ""significant"" pelvic pain, and evaluated the assistance received poorly. Multivariate analysis showed pelvic pain, limitation in usual activity, and sadness as risk factors of perception of disease worsening. Awaiting surgery and the feeling of sadness were risk factors of concern. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Patients with endometriosis, and especially patients with ""significant"" pelvic pain, reported greater concern and the perception of worsening during the SARS-COV2 pandemic. Tele-health is a useful tool in patients with endometriosis, and face-to-face visit should be considered in those reporting ""significant"" pelvic pain.

"Measuring various aspects of coronavirus anxiety: A psychometric evaluation of Pandemic anxiety and Coronophobia scales from the latent and network perspective","Background Since the outbreak of COVID-19, understanding and describing the changes in experiences related to the pandemic and its correlates have become crucial. The current study aims to provide a psychometric evaluation and examination of the relationship of two COVID-related anxiety scales through the latent and network approach. Methods The data was collected from the same participants at two time points (Nwave 1 = 1283; Nwave 2 = 1326). The study examined the psychometric properties of the Pandemic Anxiety Scale and Coronaphobia scale. It also examined the factor structure, invariance and relationship with selected variables through both the latent and network approach. Results The PAS and Coronaphobia scale provided good fit and psychometric properties. The results also indicated that distinguishing between them is crucial as they were related differently to various variables. The global network models provided a more complex insight in their connections with the set of selected variables. Conclusion The PAS and Coronaphobia scales are brief and valid measures that can be used in research looking at mental health issues related to the pandemic. The present study shows a unique pattern of relationships of these scales with other variables, extending previous studies into the topic of COVID-related anxiety.","Lenka VargovÃ¡ et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E010B-BB0-603","20220428","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; coronavirus anxiety; pandemic anxiety scale; network analysis; coronaphobia scale; psychometric evaluation","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30694,""
"Daily affect intensity and variability of adolescents and their parents before and during the second COVID-19 lockdown in the Netherlands","In this 100-daily diary study, we examined how affect intensity and variability of adolescents (N=159, Mage=13.3) and parents (N=159, Mage=45.3) changed after the onset and during (>50 days) the second COVID-19 lockdown in the Netherlands. Using preregistered piecewise growth models, we found only an unexpected increase in parentsâ€™ positive affect intensity after the lockdown onset (difference=1.75, p=.005), but no changes in negative affect intensity or variability. Both adolescents and parents reported gradual increases in negative affect intensity and variability as the lockdown prolonged (Mslope=0.44-0.67, p<.008). Yet, we found individual differences, which were partly explained by life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, and self-reported lockdown impact. Overall, our findings suggest that a lockdown might trigger changes in affective well-being, especially as it prolongs.","Lianne de Vries et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E018A-EB2-206","20220428","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30695,""
"How the COVID-19 pandemic affected young peopleâ€™s mental health and wellbeing in the UK: A qualitative study","There is emerging evidence of the detrimental impact of the pandemic and associated restrictions on young peopleâ€™s mental health in the UK but to date, this data has been largely quantitative. The aim of the current study was to gain a deeper understanding of young peopleâ€™s experiences in relation to their mental health and wellbeing during the pandemic. Seventeen young people, aged 11-16 years, sampled for diverse characteristics, and living in the UK, were interviewed virtually between December 2020 and February 2021. Eighteen parents/carers and 10 professionals working with children and families and were also interviewed to gain a more comprehensive perspective of young peopleâ€™s experiences. Reflexive thematic analysis was carried out by the research team, which included individuals with lived experience, and revealed five overarching themes: (1) positives; (2) worries and anxiety; (3) sadness and anger about losses; (4) mental exhaustion; and (5) support from others. Young peopleâ€™s experiences appeared to vary according to key background characteristics. Continued measurement of young peopleâ€™s mental health, initiatives to identify young people who have been struggling and the provision of support (including evidence-based and accessible interventions) will be important for protecting young people from future adversities as we emerge from the pandemic.","Polly Waite et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E011F-3DC-550","20220427","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; wellbeing; child; pandemic; interviews; mental health; qualitative; covid-19; thematic analysis; adolescent","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-28","",30696,""
