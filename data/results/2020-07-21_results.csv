"[Adjustment Disorder, Depression, Stress Symptoms, Corona Related Anxieties and Coping Strategies during the Corona Pandemic (COVID-19) in Swiss Medical Staff]","International studies point to increased mental health problems of medical staff during the Corona pandemic (COVID-19). This is the first study to investigate mental health, i.Ã¢â‚¬â€°e. adjustment disorder, depression, stress symptoms, Corona related fears as well as coping mechanisms in this group in a German-speaking country. In April 2020, N=100 subjects were recruited that currently are engaged in a hospital. A series of standardized assessments were included: adjustment disorder (ADNM-20), depression (PHQ-9), stress symptoms and coping strategies (SCI). Currently, cross-sectional data are analyzed, because the study is still going on and longitudinal data is not yet assessed. Frequencies of adjustment disorder and depression are 8 and 15%, respectively. Two hierarchical regression models were run to predict adjustment disorder and depression; predictive power was higher for the first (41 vs. 35%). Fear of infection was reported to be higher regarding one's family than oneself. Nursing staff, those with preloads, and women were found to report more mental health problems. Those with direct contact to people that fell ill with COVID-19 did not differ from those with no direct contact. Currently, medical staff has a high risk for being mentally stressed. China, being epidemically experienced, has published principles for psychiatric interventions in January 2020. This might be relevant for Switzerland, too. Specific psychotherapeutic interventions, targeting at cognitive restructuring and sensitizing regarding dealing with alcohol and cigarettes, may be needed in order to protect this vulnerable group of person during and after the Corona pandemic.

Es wurden 100 Personen, die derzeit in einer Klinik beschÃƒÂ¤ftigt sind, im April 2020 befragt. Erhoben wurden AnpassungsstÃƒÂ¶rung (ADNM-20), Depression (PHQ-9), Stresssymptome und BewÃƒÂ¤ltigungsstrategien (SCI). Vorliegend wurde der Querschnitt ausgewertet, die Datenerhebung lÃƒÂ¤uft derzeit noch, es werden LÃƒÂ¤ngsschnittdaten ÃƒÂ¼ber 15 Monate hinweg entstehen. Die HÃƒÂ¤ufigkeit von AnpassungsstÃƒÂ¶rung betrÃƒÂ¤gt 8% und diejenige von Depression 15%.

"Preexisting Comorbidities Predicting COVID-19 and Mortality in the UK Biobank Community Cohort","Hospitalized COVID-19 patients tend to be older and frequently have hypertension, diabetes or coronary heart disease (CHD), but whether these co-morbidities are true risk factors (i.e. more common than in the general older population) is unclear. We estimated associations between pre-existing diagnoses and hospitalized COVID-19 alone or with mortality, in a large community cohort. UK Biobank (England) participants with baseline assessment 2006 to 2010, followed in hospital discharge records to 2017 and death records to 2020. Demographic and pre-existing common diagnoses association tested with hospitalized laboratory confirmed COVID-19 (16th March to 26th April 2020), alone or with mortality, in logistic models. Of 269,070 participants aged 65+, 507 (0.2%) became COVID-19 hospital inpatients, of which 141 (27.8%) died. Common co-morbidities in hospitalized inpatients were hypertension (59.6%), history of fall or fragility fractures (29.4%), coronary heart disease (CHD, 21.5%), type 2 diabetes (type 2, 19. 9%) and asthma (17.6%). However, in models adjusted for comorbidities, age-group, sex, ethnicity and education, pre-existing diagnoses of dementia, type 2 diabetes, COPD, pneumonia, depression, atrial fibrillation and hypertension emerged as independent risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization, the first five remaining statistically significant for related mortality. Chronic Kidney Disease and asthma were risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization in women but not men. There are specific high risk pre-existing co-morbidities for COVID-19 hospitalization and related deaths in community based older men and women. These results do not support simple age-based targeting of the older population to prevent severe COVID-19 infections.","Atkins, Masoli, Delgado, Pilling, Kuo, Kuchel, Melzer","https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaa183","20200720","COVID-19; Epidemiology; Morbidity; Mortality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-21","",3228,""

"Techniques, Methods, and Dissemination of Community-Based Psychological Support Strategies in Times of the COVID-19 Pandemic","In times of the coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 psychological support needs to meet certain requirements. Due to the lockdown in many countries of the world, the every-day activities of millions of people are reduced to a minimum. This may cause increased psychosomatic symptoms in persons with pre-existing mental illnesses, and additionally raises new challenges for the general population. As a result of the current contact restrictions, access to psychotherapy is further complicated. To guarantee the best possible care under the given conditions, we developed the CoPE (Coping with Corona: Extended Psychosomatic care in Essen) concept. CoPE is delivered by telephone or video calls as well as online contents. The materials presented at our webpage www.cope-corona.de aim to easily reach citizens affected by symptoms such as worries, depression or anger and let them receive readily understandable expert knowledge and training in basic self-help methods.","Benecke, BÃƒÂ¤uerle, Jansen, Schneider, DÃƒÂ¶rrie, Teufel, Skoda","https://doi.org/10.1177/2150132720943328","20200720","coronavirus; mental health; psychological support strategies; self-help strategies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-21","",3231,""
"Psychological Impact of Quarantine on Caregivers at a Children's Hospital for Contact with Case of COVID-19","Quarantine often provokes negative psychological consequences. Thus, we aimed to identify the psychological and behavioral responses and stressors of caregivers quarantined with young patients after a close contact to a coronavirus disease 2019 case at a children's hospital. More than 90% of the caregivers reported feelings of worry and nervousness, while some of them reported suicidal ideations (4.2%), and/or homicidal ideations (1.4%). Fear of infection of the patient (91.7%) and/or oneself (86.1%) were most frequently reported stressors. A multidisciplinary team including infection control team, pediatrician, psychiatrist, nursing staff and legal department provided supplies and services to reduce caregiver's psychological distress. Psychotropic medication was needed in five (6.9%), one of whom was admitted to the psychiatry department due to suicidality. Quarantine at a children's hospital makes notable psychological impacts on the caregivers and a multidisciplinary approach is required.","Kim, Park, Shin, Lee, Chung, Lee, Kim, Jung, Lee, Yum, Lee, Koh, Ko, Lim, Lee, Lee, Choi, Han, Shin, Lee, Kim, Kim","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e255","20200720","COVID-19; Caregivers; Psychological Response; Stressor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-21","",3232,""
"Debate: Exposing the most serious infirmity-racism's impact on health in the era of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic retells a story that other diseases like HIV, diabetes, and cancer have clearly internationally illustrated. Minorities in developed countries across the globe - especially those of African, Hispanic, and Native American descent - suffer a greater burden of disease than whites. The evidence of the cause and effect relationship of racism on mental and minority health outcomes is staggering. Racism and its influence on policy and important structural systems allow health inequities across racial and ethnic groups to persist. What's more troubling is how systemic racism impacts children from all races and has been perpetuated across many generations dating back hundreds of years. The impact of racial oppression is seen through intergenerational trauma which impacts youth in varying ways. For this article, we offer three areas in which racism causes healthcare disparities, intergenerational trauma, social determinants, and cultural mistrust. Effective policy change and a greater level of accountability must be placed on major systems including health care, to most fully counter racism's varied role in sustaining mental health inequities.","Farquharson, Thornton","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12407","20200720","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-21","",3233,""
"[Meta-analysis of single-group rate of the distribution of traditional Chinese medicine syndromes in 2 139 patients with coronavirus disease 2019]","To systematically evaluate the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and to provide a basis for the standard of COVID-19 syndrome differentiation. CNKI, China Medical Journal Network, PubMed and Embase databases were searched by computer, and TCM syndrome data of COVID-19 cross-sectional surveys and case series were collected from the establishment of the database to March 31st in 2020. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted relevant data such as TCM syndromes, and evaluated the quality of the literature according to the quality assessment tool recommended by the JBI Evidence-Based Health Care Center. Stata 14.0 software was used to perform a single-group Meta-analysis of TCM syndromes. Thirteen cross-sectional studies and 5 case series studies were included, with a total of 2 139 patients. The analysis of the cross-sectional studies showed that the risk bias was higher in the identification, control and accuracy of the confounding factors, and the description of the reliability and validity of the outcome indicators was unclear. The analysis of the case series studies showed that the overall risk bias was small, but there was a lack of a comprehensive description of the assessment when selecting patients. A total of 33 TCM syndromes of COVID-19 were sorted out by combining the TCM syndromes with the same disease position and pathogenic syndrome in the included 18 literatures, and there were 10 types of TCM syndromes of which the number of occurrences was Ã¢â€°Â¥ 50, the incidence rate was Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10%, and had statistical significance [indicated that 95% confidence interval (95%CI) didn't cross the meaningless line 0], including cold dampness syndrome (469 cases, incidence rate was 28.2%, 95%CI was 5.9%-50.6%), damp heat syndrome (247 cases, incidence rate was 32.1%, 95%CI was 10.7%-53.6%), epidemic closed lung syndrome (228 cases, incidence rate was 28.9%, 95%CI was 12.5%-45.2%), pulmonary and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome (202 cases, incidence rate was 22.1%, 95%CI was 9.5%-34.7%), dampness stagnation lung syndrome (180 cases, incidence rate was 41.2%, 95%CI was 18.4%-64.1%), dampness obstructing lung and spleen syndrome (81 cases, incidence rate was 56.3%, 95%CI was 48.1%-64.4%), evil heat syndrome lung syndrome (76 cases, incidence rate was 31.1%, 95%CI was 25.3%-36.9%), dampness-blocking lung and stomach syndrome (70 cases, incidence rate was 13.4%, 95%CI was 10.4%-16.3%), heat poisoning lung closure syndrome (55 cases, incidence rate was 16.9%, 95%CI was 8.3%-25.5%), and Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome (53 cases, incidence rate was 13.7%, 95%CI was 2.7%-24.8%). Subgroup analysis showed that there were 6 types of TCM syndromes that met the above conditions in cross-sectional studies, namely cold and damp lung syndrome (200 cases, incidence rate was 20.9%, 95%CI was 12.6%-29.2%), damp heat syndrome (221 cases, incidence rate was 41.8%, 95%CI was 9.4%-74.2%), dampness-disease lung syndrome (120 cases, incidence rate was 41.4%, 95%CI was 8.6%-74.3%), lung and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome (115 cases, incidence rate was 19.2%, 95%CI was 6.8%-31.7%), heat-fever lung syndrome (76 cases, incidence rate was 31.1%, 95%CI was 25.3%-36.9%) and Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome (53 cases, incidence rate was 13.7%, 95%CI was 2.7%-24.8%). There were 3 kinds of TCM syndromes in case series studies, which were virus closed lung syndrome (133 cases, incidence rate was 44.0%, 95%CI was 24.5%-63.4%), lung and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome (87 cases, incidence rate was 38.7%, 95%CI was 32.3%-45.0%), and dampness and depression lung syndrome (60 cases, incidence rate was 40.6%, 95%CI was 29.3%-52.0%). The TCM syndromes of COVID-19 syndrome were widely distributed and complex. The main TCM syndromes were cold dampness syndrome, damp heat syndrome, epidemic closed lung syndrome, pulmonary and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome, dampness stagnation lung syndrome, dampness obstructing lung and spleen syndrome, evil heat syndrome lung syndrome, dampness-blocking lung and stomach syndrome, heat poisoning lung closure syndrome, Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome, which can provide reference for the standard of TCM syndrome differentiation of COVID-19.","Li, Liu, He, Xie, Li","https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-202000509-00372","20200720","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-21","",3234,""
"Psychological distress and adaptation to the COVID-19 crisis in the United States","Background There is growing concern that the COVID-19 crisis may have long-standing mental health effects across society particularly amongst those with pre-existing mental health conditions. In this observational population-based study, we examined how psychological distress changed following the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis in the United States and tested whether certain population subgroups were vulnerable to persistent distress during the crisis. Methods We analyzed longitudinal nationally representative data from seven waves of the Understanding America Study (UAS) collected between March 10th and June 23rd, 2020 (N=7231 Obs.= 40199). Differences in distress trends were examined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and household income and by the presence of a pre-existing mental health diagnosis. Psychological distress was assessed using the standardized total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). Findings On average psychological distress increased significantly by 0.27 standard deviations (95% CI [0.23,0.31], p<.001) from March 10-18 to April 1-14, 2020 as the COVID-19 crisis emerged and lockdown restrictions began in the US. Distress levels subsequently declined to mid-March levels by the end of June (d =-.31, 95% CI [-0.35,-0.27], p<.001). Across all sociodemographic groups examined and those with pre-existing mental health conditions we observed a sharp rise in distress followed by a recovery to baseline distress levels. Interpretation This study identified substantial increases in distress in the US during the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis that largely diminished in the weeks that followed and suggests that population level resilience in mental health may be occurring in response to the pandemic.","Michael Daly et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46077-F92-717","20200721","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; adaptation; mental health; resilience; psychological distress; covid-19; longitudinal research","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-21","",3235,""
"Mental health risk factors during COVID-19 pandemic in the Polish population","Background: The level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms was assessed. Risk factors for mental health in the Polish population have been identified. Methods: The 926 respondents completed a set of questionnaires consisting of questions concerning COVID-19, PTSS related to the COVID-19 outbreak (Impact of Event Scale-Revised, IES-R) and their mental health status (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, DASS-21). Results: Most respondents reported severe PTSS related to the COVID-19 outbreak (44.06%), normal intensity of depressive symptoms (52.38%), anxiety symptoms (56.05%) and stress (56.48%). Female gender, parental status, having a relationship, at least a two-person household are associated with higher PTSS and DASS-21 subscale. A few physical symptoms, a medical visit, quarantine, negative health evaluation, and chronic diseases, knowledge of the increase in the number of infected people and the number of deaths are associated with higher levels of PTSS. Some of the precautions and the need for additional information on COVID-10, the certainty of a high probability of contracting COVID-19, a low survival rate and concerns about loved ones are associated with higher PTSS. Conclusions: The indicated risk factors can be used to develop psychological interventions to improve mental health.","Pavel Larionov et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46213-169-48A","20200720","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; depressive symptoms; anxiety symptoms; coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19); stress; post-traumatic stress symptoms","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-21","",3236,""
