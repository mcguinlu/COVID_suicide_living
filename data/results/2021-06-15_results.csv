"The prevalence, incidence, prognosis and risk factors for depression and anxiety in a UK cohort during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had profound immediate impacts on population mental health. However, in whom the effects may be prolonged is less clear. Aims: To investigate the prevalence, incidence, prognosis, and risk factors for depression and anxiety reported in a UK cohort over three distinct periods in the pandemic in 2020. Method: An online survey was distributed to a UK community cohort (n=3097) at three points: April (baseline), July-September (T2) and November-December (T3). Participants completed validated measures of depression and anxiety on each occasion and we prospectively explored the role of socio-demographic factors and psychological factors (loneliness, positive mood, perceived risk of and worry about COVID-19) as risk factors. Results: Depression (PHQ-9 means - baseline: 7.69, T2: 5.53, T3: 6.06) and anxiety scores (GAD-7 means -baseline: 6.59, T2: 4.60, T3: 4.98) were considerably greater than pre-pandemic population norms. Women reported greater depression and anxiety than men. Being younger, having prior mental health disorders, more negative life events due to COVID-19, as well as greater loneliness and lower positive mood at baseline were significant predictors of poorer mental health outcomes. Conclusion: The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health has persisted to some degree. Younger people and individuals with prior mental health disorders were at greatest risk. Easing of restrictions might bring the opportunity for a return to social interaction, which could mitigate the risk factors of loneliness and positive mood.","Ru Jia; Kieran Ayling; Trudie Chalder; Adam Massey; Norina Gasteiger; Elizabeth Broadbent; Carol Coupland; kavita vedhara","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.11.21258750","20210614","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14811,""

"The psychology of COVID-19: Building resilience for future pandemics","Sociologists have argued that we live nowadays in a World Risk Society, in which we are hyperconnected and exposed to many risks  Although risks involve gradients on a grey scale, individuals often seem to have black-or-white perceptions and responses to the world risk society: either they deny that any risks exist and continue living in their habitual ways, or they feel overwhelmed by the risks, develop panic and engage in obsessive-compulsive self-protection  These black-or-white perceptions and responses may have large consequences for the physical, mental and social well-being of individuals, and for the epidemiological risks and the economy in general  This book discusses the following key players: politicians;science;individuals experiencing stress and mental health problems;media;individuals impacted by existential threats, quarantine, and inequality  It discusses COVID-19 in the context of SARS, MERS, Ebola, Zika, HIV, H1N1, H5N1, and other pandemics  The book is based on systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses  It offers examples of resilience for each of the themes and describes the World Resilience Society  The book exemplifies the themes with citations from interviews with individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic  To understand the psychology of COVID-19 is to understand how individuals perceive and respond to the uncertainties of the World Risk Society  However, we need to differentiate uncertainties in different life domains, which each have their own key actors  Resilience is the capacity to adjust to challenges flexibly and to recover quickly from difficulties, like a young twig on a tree is resilient as it can withstand storms whereas an old rigid branch may crack  The book offers glimpses of hope for coping in more resilient ways with future pandemics, and these will lay out how we could move from a World Risk Society to a World Resilience Society  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Vos, Joel","https://doi.org/10.4135/9781529757156","","Database: APA PsycInfo; Publication details: Sage swifts;: 179, 2021.; Publication details: Sage swifts;: 179, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14816,""

Vivimos en un mundo globalizado que se mantiene conectado mediante el internet. Determinar la veracidad de la informaciÃ³n que recibimos es difÃ­cil, mÃ¡s aÃºn en aquella relacionada con la salud. El internet es una de las fuentes mÃ¡s populares para la bÃºsqueda de informaciÃ³n relacionada con la salud y esta conducta se incrementa en el contexto de brotes epidemiolÃ³gicos. En el contexto de la pandemia actual, se ha encontrado un incremento de ansiedad por temas de salud, siento la principal preocupaciÃ³n el estar infectado por SARS-CoV-2. Estrategia de bÃºsqueda: Se realizÃ³ una bÃºsqueda en la base de datos PubMed de todos los artÃ­culos publicados hasta el 30 de junio de 2020. La bÃºsqueda de tÃ©rminos incluyo las palabras clave sugeridas por el vocabulario controlado Medical Subjects Headings (MeSH) y conectores. Cibercondria, COVID-19 y Salud Mental: Es crucial el papel de los medios de comunicaciÃ³n, porque podrÃ­an inducir ansiedad en la poblaciÃ³n. La cibercondrÃ­a implica experimentar ansiedad despuÃ©s de buscar informaciÃ³n mÃ©dica y abordar problemas de salud mediante el internet. Se origina como un comportamiento que busca la sensaciÃ³n de seguridad, sin embargo, tiene un carÃ¡cter repetitivo y excesivo, lo que conduce a empeorar las preocupaciones. Uno de los riesgos es que los pacientes desarrollen desconfianza hacia el mÃ©dico y mayor probabilidad de automedicaciÃ³n. La prevalencia de este ente, en nuestro paÃ­s y en muchos otros es desconocida. En el marco de esta pandemia, es importante que la investigaciÃ³n se enfoque hallar pronto un medicamento eficaz o una vacuna; sin embargo, no debemos ignorar la salud mental de la poblaciÃ³n, que se ha visto impactada por todos los cambios sociales en nuestras vidas. Conclusiones: La cibercondrÃ­a es un ente clÃ­nico nuevo, que conlleva a la bÃºsqueda excesiva y repetitiva de informaciÃ³n sobre temas de salud, en internet; incrementando la ansiedad en las personas. En el contexto de la actual pandemia es necesario evaluar dicho aspecto.; Introduction. We live in a globalized world that is kept connected through the internet. Determining the veracity of the information we receive is difficult, even more so in that related to health. The internet is one of the most popular sources for the search for healthrelated information and this behavior increases in the context of epidemiological outbreaks. In the context of the current pandemic, an increase in anxiety about health issues has been found, the main concern being being infected by SARS-CoV-2. Search strategy: A search was carried out in the PubMed database of all articles published up to June 30, 2020. The search for terms included the keywords suggested by the controlled vocabulary Medical Subjects Headings (MeSH) and connectors. Cyberchondria, COVID-19 and Mental Health: The role of the media is crucial, because it could induce anxiety in the population. Cyberchondria involves experiencing anxiety after searching for medical information and addressing health problems online. It originates as a behavior that seeks the feeling of security, however, it is repetitive and excessive, which leads to worse worries. One of the risks is that patients develop distrust of the doctor and a greater likelihood of self-medication. The prevalence of this entity, in our country and in many others, is unknown. In the context of this pandemic, it is important that research focuses on finding an effective drug or vaccine soon; however, we must not ignore the mental health of the population, which has been impacted by all the social changes in our lives. Conclusions: Cyberchondria is a new clinical entity, which leads to the excessive and repetitive search for information on health issues on the internet; increasing anxiety in people. In the context of the current pandemic, it is necessary to evaluate this aspect.","Ovalle-QuiÃ±ones, Milluska; VÃ¡squez-Tirado, Gustavo A","http://fi-admin.bvsalud.org/document/view/vk6p3","","Country: PE; PERU; PERU; PERU; Database: LILACS; Publication details: Rev.

"The rapidly changing composition of the global street drug supply and its effects on high-risk groups for covid-19","Background: Globally, an alarming number of pharmaceutically active compounds are now routinely added to the street drugs of abuse, cocaine and heroin  In some cases, seventeen (17) or more potentially toxic compounds are found in a single street purchased bag or block of cocaine or heroin  Pharmacologically active compounds, impurities, or breakdown products from drug manufacturing and industrial chemicals (collectively referred to as toxic adulterants) are now found in street drugs  They include, but are not limited to: Antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antihistamines, anthelmintics, anesthetics, anti-inflammatorys, antipyretics, analgesics, antispasmodics, antiarrhythmics, antimalarials, veterinary medications, bronchodilators, expectorants, sedatives, muscle relaxers, natural/synthetic hallucinogens, decongest- ants, new psychoactive substances (NPS), industrial compounds, fungicides, and impurities in the manufacturing process  All can be found within a single street purchase of heroin or cocaine  Routine clinical or workplace drug testing will not detect all these toxic adulterants  Only specialty forensic tests, specifically ordered, will detect them  The synergistic effect on the human body of such an unprecedented combination of pharmacologically active compounds is unknown and potentially deadly  This is especially seen in daily substance users who are exposed to these combinations multiple times a day over an extended period of time  Individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) have several co-occurring health problems that make them more susceptible to COVID-19, including compromised immune, pulmonary, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems  These problems are high-risk factors for the acquisition of COVID-19 infection and more serious complications from the virus, including hospitalization and death  Objective: The study aims to bring to the attention of public health officials, addiction medicine specialists, treatment officials, therapists, and the general public the alarming increase of dangerous toxic adulterants being added to street drugs and their potentially lethal synergistic effects  Also, it aims to provide insights into how these new formulations can have serious pathophysiological effects on individuals with Substance Abuse Disorders (SUDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic  Methods: The literature on street drug cutting agents, toxic adulterants, NPS, manufacturing byproducts, and other industrial compounds will be reviewed  Also, a review of the literature of pathophysiological effects, especially on SUD patients, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic will be presented  This is combined with international and USA studies that were carried out by the Colombo Plan that identified these new combinations of toxic adulterants in street drugs, using state-of-the-art field and forensic laboratory detection technologies  Results: The majority of street drugs, in some cases more than ninety-five percent, now have multiple toxic adulterants  It is rare that a street purchase of cocaine or heroin does not contain multiple toxic adulterants, cutting agents, NPS, manufacturing byproducts, or industrial chemicals  Conclusion: This dangerous new composition in world street drug supply is unprecedented and may be the undetected cause of many psychostimulant and opioid overdose deaths, as many toxic adulter- ants are not routinely tested in post-mortem or street drug seizure cases  In addition, several of these toxic adulterants create a catastrophic drop in white blood cells, causing neutropenia and making the substance users susceptible to a wide range of opportunistic infections, including COVID-19  This profound change in the world street drug supply has catastrophic implications for individuals with SUDs and our health care system, especially in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic","Browne, T.; Gold, M.

"The Impact of Personality and Lifestyle Change on Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic provided a unique opportunity for quantifying the impact of Five Factor Model personality domains (i e  neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) and COVID -related lifestyle changes on psychological distress  To examine these relationships, we designed and preregistered the present study (https://osf io/qfw9h)  We assessed a large, heterogeneous sample including undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and staff of a large, public, Midwestern university (n = 1055) to ascertain whether personality domains uniquely predicted distress in response to COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders  This was a three-panel study in which the same potential participant pools were invited to participate at each survey announcement  Data collection occurred between early March through late May 2020, from within days of local shelter-in-place order onset to within days of reaching 100,000 COVID-related deaths in the USA  Domain and distress scores were determined from self-reported ratings on the Big Five Inventory and the 21-Item Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales, respectively  Participants also reported personal experiences with six COVID-specific lifestyle impacts: insufficient outdoor or indoor living space, job insecurity, income insecurity, or taking care of or homeschooling school-aged children during working hours  Zero-order correlations revealed that all personality domains except openness had statistically significant correlations with distress, and all correlations were negative except for that of neuroticism  When entered simultaneously, neuroticism was the predominant risk factor of distress that held across all preregistered and exploratory analyses  Our expectation that extraversion would be negatively associated with distress was not supported broadly, while agreeableness was a unique potential risk factor (though this effect was mostly limited to exploratory analyses)  The results especially highlight the link between employment and income uncertainty with psychological distress, while also identifying insufficient indoor and outdoor space as potential risk factors  We hope these findings inform future public health action and further emphasize the utility of personality trait models in general","Balling, C.

"Outdoor tourism to escape social surveillance: health gains but sustainability costs","We analyse motivations and perspectives of outdoor tourists and tourism stakeholders in the Islamic Republic of Iran  We use semi-structured qualitative interviews, and interpretivist grounded theory, with basic and axial coding and fine-scaled differential narrative analysis  We distinguish three principal tourist segments, seeking: exhilaration through adventure;enjoyment of nature;and escape from cultural restrictions and associated social surveillance  The nature and adventure segments behave as ecotourists, and gain improved eudaimonic wellbeing  Nature tourists gain psychological restoration through calm and tranquil nature contemplation  Adventure tourists gain psychological recharge through challenge and achievement  The escape segment, in contrast, aims for hedonic wellbeing, is heedless of its social and ecological impacts, and does not behave as ecotourists  It adopts an ecotourism disguise, to avoid being observed as it flouts expected cultural norms  It uses unauthorised and clandestine logistics providers, creating substantial management obstacles for authorised commercial outdoor tour providers  Temporary escape from social surveillance generates mental health gains as a psychological safety valve for the tourists concerned, but their behaviour imposes unsustainable costs on local communities, natural environment, nature and adventure tourists, and outdoor tourism operators  These costs reduce the net social economic gains achieved from the mental health benefits of outdoor tourism","Akhoundogli, M.; Buckley, R.","https://doi.org/10.1080/14724049.2021.1934688","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Journal of Ecotourism;: 21, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Ecotourism;: 21, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14882,""

"Socio-demographic and health factors drive the epidemic progression and should guide vaccination strategies for best COVID-19 containment","We propose and study an epidemiological model on a social network that takes into account heterogeneity of the population and different vaccination strategies  In particular, we study how the COVID-19 epidemics evolves and how it is contained by different vaccination scenarios by taking into account data showing that older people, as well as individuals with comorbidities and poor metabolic health, and people coming from economically depressed areas with lower quality of life in general, are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms, and quicker loss of immunity and are therefore more prone to reinfection  Our results reveal that the structure and the spatial arrangement of subpopulations are important epidemiological determinants  In a healthier society the disease spreads more rapidly but the consequences are less disastrous as in a society with more prevalent chronic comorbidities  If individuals with poor health are segregated within one community, the epidemic outcome is less favorable  Moreover, we show that, contrary to currently widely adopted vaccination policies, prioritizing elderly and other higher-risk groups is beneficial only if the supply of vaccine is high  If, however, the vaccination availability is limited, and if the demographic distribution across the social network is homogeneous, better epidemic outcomes are achieved if healthy people are vaccinated first  Only when higher-risk groups are segregated, like in elderly homes, their prioritization will lead to lower COVID-19 related deaths  Accordingly, young and healthy individuals should view vaccine uptake as not only protecting them, but perhaps even more so protecting the more vulnerable socio-demographic groups","Markovic, Rene, Å terk, Marko, Marhl, Marko, Perc, MatjaÅ¾, Gosak, Marko","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2021.104433","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Results in Physics;: 104433, 2021.; Publication details: Results in Physics;: 104433, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14884,""

"Learning from pandemics: Applying resilience thinking to identify priorities for planning urban settlements","Based in an interdisciplinary review of the literature on COVID-19 and recent outbreaks, this paper uses pandemics as a lens to examine the socio-ecological resilience of human settlements  This narrative literature review applies the conceptual framework for resilience developed for complex systems to identify five planning and policy issues critical to disease emergence, transmission, and outbreak  First, since urban settlements and activities facilitate pathogen transmission between species, reducing 'shocks' like zoonotic diseases and climate change requires not just prioritizing urbanization patterns and land use in urban policies for environmental health, but also animal rearing practices and biodiversity maintenance  Second, since disease transmission is linked to not just contact rate but also host susceptibility, reducing vulnerability by improving equity in access to essential infrastructures like housing, water, sanitation, healthy food, green/public spaces, healthcareâ€”that impact human health directly and indirectlyâ€”is critical  In its absence, curbing disease transmission requires focusing on contact rate suppression, but doing so brings human activity to a halt, decimating the economy and livelihoods  Third, the persistence of many pathogens or their vectors in environmental media suggests that built environment & public health professionals must address maintenance of environmental quality at various scales  Fourth, there is a need for redundancy, be it in commodity supply chains (like PPE, food) or data management for say, monitoring & enforcement of home quarantines during a pandemic  Fifth, while it is crucial to have a centralized response for healthcare, decentralized infrastructure management has been critical during this outbreak: including participatory governance structures to recruit civil society in data collection and self-reporting, reliance on and quick development of mutual aid groups to distribute food and other essential supplies, localized approaches to repurposing infrastructures to create safe public spaces  This application of resilience thinking also evokes the need to study cities as social-ecological systems","Syal, Shruti","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jum.2021.05.004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Urban Management;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Urban Management;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14886,""

"[Covid-19 and front-line nurses' mental health: a literature review]; Covid-19 e salute mentale del personale infermieristico in prima linea: una revisione della letteratura","INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic caused a severe health crisis that has affected millions of people and quarantined half of the world's population. The health emergency from Covid-19 has seen health workers on the front line face all the difficulties related to the burden of care and the reorganization of procedures, roles, and tools at the hospital level. One of the most significant and probably underestimated aspects is the psychological stress of frontline nurses. The article aims to analyze the literature relating to the impact on the mental health of nurses engaged in the management and care of Covid-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic review of the published articles on the subject was conducted from January 2020 to November 2020. The search for papers was conducted on scientific databases like PubMed, Scopus and Embase. RESULTS: The results show the onset of anxiety, depression and stress and insomnia in healthcare workers. These aspects are closely related to numerous factors, including the fear of contracting the disease and infecting family members, stressful shifts and little rest, leading to a state of psychological and physical tension capable of activating pathological behaviours. The literature highlights the importance of support interventions for frontline personnel to avoid the onset of psycho-pathophysical severe problems. CONCLUSION: The review suggests that frontline nurses during the emergency phase of Covid- 19 may be prone to psychological disorders that can compromise mental health. Therefore, the surveillance and monitoring of symptoms, together with targeted support interventions, should be guaranteed daily to all professionals involved to prevent the onset of psychological disorders.","Ruta, Federico; Dal Mas, Francesca; Biancuzzi, Helena; Ferrara, Paolo; Della Monica, Annalisa","https://dx.doi.org/10.7429/pi.2021.741041","","Country: IT; ITÃLIA; ITALY; ITALIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Prof Inferm;74(1): 41-47, 2021.; Publication details: Prof Inferm;74(1): 41-47, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14897,""
"A qualitative study on the elderly and mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown in Buenos Aires, Argentina - Part 1; Estudio cualitativo sobre los adultos mayores y la salud mental durante el confinamiento por COVID-19 en Buenos Aires, Argentina - parte 1","Introduction: On March 19, 2020, preventive and mandatory social isolation was decreed in Argentina in response to the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the disease it causes (COVID-19). This measure aimed to reduce the transmission of the virus and the resulting severe respira-tory condition that frequently besets older adults. However, this measure can also affect the support networks of these isolated people. Objectives: To explore the emerging needs related to the mental health of isolated older adults in this period and to identify the main support networks they have and the emerging coping strategies in the face of the situation. Methodology: We carried out an exploratory qualitative study, summoning participants over 60 years of age. Using snowball sampling, a group of researchers contacted them by phone to collect data. The analysis of the findings was triangulated among researchers with different academic backgrounds (medicine, psychology, and sociology). The concepts emerging from the interviews were linked in conceptual networks using an inductive methodology and were mapped into conceptual frameworks available to researchers. Atlas.ti 8 software was used for coding. Results: Thirty-nine participants belonging to the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area were interviewed between April and July 2020. For greater clarity, the main themes were described in five cross-sectional axes: network configurations, resources and coping strategies, affective states and emo-tions, perceptions and reflections on the future, and actions emerging from the participatory approach. Participants reported distress, anxiety, anger, uncertainty, exhaustion, and expressed fear of contagion from themselves and their loved ones. We identify greater vulnerability in people living alone, in small and closed environments, with weak linkages and networks, or limited access to technologies. We also found vari-ous coping strategies and technology was a fundamental factor in maintaining the bonds. Conclusions: The findings of this research have implications for decision-making at the individual level, health systems, professional care, and policy devel-opment. Future research may elucidate the regional, temporal, and socioeconomic variations of the phenomena explored in our research.","Pisula, Pedro; Salas Apaza, Julieta Aldana; Baez, GermÃ¡n NicolÃ¡s; Loza, Candela Agustina; Valverdi, Rodrigo; Discacciati, Vilda; Granero, Mariano; Pizzorno Santoro, Ximena SalomÃ©; Franco, Juan VÃ­ctor Ariel","https://dx.doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2021.04.8186","","Country: CL; CHILE; CHILE; CHILE; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Medwave;21(4): e8186, 2021 May 24.; Publication details: Medwave;21(4): e8186, 2021 May 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14898,""
"Hidden Tales of Ebola: Airing the Forgotten Voices of Ugandan ""Ebola Nurses""","INTRODUCTION: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ebola has affected the lives of thousands, including health care workers. With few studies describing the experience of nurses who survived Ebola, the study aimed to describe Ugandan nurses' experiences. METHOD: Using a phenomenological design, in-depth interviews were conducted among five Ugandan nurses who contracted Ebola and survived. RESULT: Thematic analysis revealed themes of expectations of dying, hopelessness, loneliness, and betrayal by family, community, and the health system. DISCUSSION: Results support the need for policies targeting holistic practice protocols to protect all health care professionals during future outbreaks. Last, nursing survivors should have access to government-guaranteed support programs, including free health care and financial stipends. These results and recommendations transcend to the current reality of living with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). Efficient practice protocols could protect all rights and privileges and contribute to access to treatment and stigma removal.","Okello Wonyima, Isaac; Fowler-Kerry, Susan; Nambozi, Grace; Barry, Charlotte; Wills, Jeanie; Palmer-Clarke, Yolanda; Locsin, Rozzano C","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10436596211017968","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Transcult Nurs;: 10436596211017968, 2021 Jun 06.; Publication details: J Transcult Nurs;: 10436596211017968, 2021 Jun 06.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14899,""
"Relationship between wealth and emotional well-being before, during, versus after a nationwide disease outbreak: a large-scale investigation of disparities in psychological vulnerability across COVID-19 pandemic phases in China","OBJECTIVES: This research investigated whether certain population segments might be more psychologically vulnerable in different phases of a pandemic. Specifically, the research examined how disparities in wealth might be associated with differences in emotional well-being before, during, versus after the nationwide COVID-19 outbreak in China. SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: In this large-scale cross-sectional study, three rounds of nationally representative data collection (N=27 760) were conducted immediately before (December 2019), in the midst of (February 2020), versus immediately after (April 2020) the countrywide COVID-19 outbreak in China. Participants' emotional well-being, wealth (income, property ownership) and demographic information were measured using established instruments. Statistical analyses examined relationships between disparities in different types of wealth and emotional well-being across the pandemic phases. RESULTS: Although the onset of the coronavirus outbreak substantially degraded emotional well-being, having a higher income was associated with better emotional well-being during the outbreak. Property owners experienced a larger drop in emotional well-being during the outbreak than non-owners; however, the former was not emotionally worse off than the latter during the outbreak. After the nationwide COVID-19 outbreak had been contained and the economy reopened, those with more wealth of either type again became better off in emotional well-being than those with less. The highest income segment even experienced better emotional well-being after the end of the nationwide outbreak than prior to the outbreak. In contrast, the lowest income segment became worse off in emotional well-being after the nationwide outbreak ended than before the outbreak began. CONCLUSION: People with less wealth tend to be emotionally worse off throughout the different phases of a disease outbreak. In particular, even after an outbreak has been contained, the poor are less able to restore their psychological well-being. Policies and interventions are needed to address disparities in mental health in the age of pandemics.","Yang, Haiyang; Ma, Jingjing","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044262","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(6): e044262, 2021 06 04.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(6): e044262, 2021 06 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14900,""

"Underlying Medical Conditions Associated With Severe COVID-19 Illness Among Children","Importance: Information on underlying conditions and severe COVID-19 illness among children is limited. Objective: To examine the risk of severe COVID-19 illness among children associated with underlying medical conditions and medical complexity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included patients aged 18 years and younger with International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification code U07.1 (COVID-19) or B97.29 (other coronavirus) during an emergency department or inpatient encounter from March 2020 through January 2021. Data were collected from the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release, which included data from more than 800 US hospitals. Multivariable generalized linear models, controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, were used to estimate adjusted risk of severe COVID-19 illness associated with underlying medical conditions and medical complexity. Exposures: Underlying medical conditions and medical complexity (ie, presence of complex or noncomplex chronic disease). Main Outcomes and Measures: Hospitalization and severe illness when hospitalized (ie, combined outcome of intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death). Results: Among 43Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯465 patients with COVID-19 aged 18 years or younger, the median (interquartile range) age was 12 (4-16) years, 22Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯943 (52.8%) were female patients, and 12Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯491 (28.7%) had underlying medical conditions. The most common diagnosed conditions were asthma (4416 [10.2%]), neurodevelopmental disorders (1690 [3.9%]), anxiety and fear-related disorders (1374 [3.2%]), depressive disorders (1209 [2.8%]), and obesity (1071 [2.5%]). The strongest risk factors for hospitalization were type 1 diabetes (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 4.60; 95% CI, 3.91-5.42) and obesity (aRR, 3.07; 95% CI, 2.66-3.54), and the strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness were type 1 diabetes (aRR, 2.38; 95% CI, 2.06-2.76) and cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies (aRR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.48-1.99). Prematurity was a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness among children younger than 2 years (aRR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.47-2.29). Chronic and complex chronic disease were risk factors for hospitalization, with aRRs of 2.91 (95% CI, 2.63-3.23) and 7.86 (95% CI, 6.91-8.95), respectively, as well as for severe COVID-19 illness, with aRRs of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.69-2.26) and 2.86 (95% CI, 2.47-3.32), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found a higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness among children with medical complexity and certain underlying conditions, such as type 1 diabetes, cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies, and obesity. Health care practitioners could consider the potential need for close observation and cautious clinical management of children with these conditions and COVID-19.","Kompaniyets, Lyudmyla; Agathis, Nickolas T; Nelson, Jennifer M; Preston, Leigh Ellyn; Ko, Jean Y; Belay, Brook; Pennington, Audrey F; Danielson, Melissa L; DeSisto, Carla L; Chevinsky, Jennifer R; Schieber, Lyna Z; Yusuf, Hussain; Baggs, James; Mac Kenzie, William R; Wong, Karen K; Boehmer, Tegan K; Gundlapalli, Adi V; Goodman, Alyson B","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.11182","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(6): e2111182, 2021 Jun 01.; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(6): e2111182, 2021 Jun 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14903,""

"Hemodynamic Response to Three Types of Urban Spaces before and after Lockdown during the COVID-19 Pandemic","(1) Background: Prolonged lockdowns with stay-at-home orders have been introduced in many countries since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic  They have caused a drastic change in the everyday lives of people living in urbanized areas, and are considered to contribute to a modified perception of the public space  As research related to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on mental health and well-being emerges, the associated longitudinal changes of brain hemodynamics in healthy adults remain largely unknown  (2) Methods: this study examined the hemodynamic activation patterns of the prefrontal and occipital cortices of 12 participants (5 male, Mage = 47 80, SDage = 17 79, range 25 to 74, and 7 female, Mage = 39 00, SDage = 18 18, range 21 to 65) passively viewing videos from three urban sites in Singapore (Urban Park, Neighborhood Landscape and City Center) at two different time pointsâ€”T1, before the COVID-19 pandemic and T2, soon after the lockdown was over  (3) Results: We observed a significant and marginally significant decrease in average oxyhemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) over time for each of the visual conditions  For both green spaces (Urban Park and Neighborhood Landscape), the decrease was in the visual cortex, while for the City Center with no green elements, the marginal decrease was observed in the visual cortex and the frontal eye fields  (4) Conclusions: The results suggest that the COVID-19-related lockdown experienced by urban inhabitants may have contributed to decreased brain hemodynamics, which are further related to a heightened risk of mental health disorders, such as depression or a decline in cognitive functions  Moreover, the busy City Center scenes induced a hemodynamic pattern associated with stress and anxiety, while urban green spaces did not cause such an effect  Urban green scenes can be an important factor to offset the negative neuropsychological impact of busy urban environments post-pandemic","Olszewska-Guizzo, Agnieszka, Mukoyama, Ayako, Naganawa, Sho, Dan, Ippeita, Husain, Syeda Fabeha, Ho, Cyrus S.; Ho, Roger","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18116118","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(11):6118, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(11):6118, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14923,""

"Economic Aspects of Emergency Transition to Distance Education, or The Price of Going Online in Higher Education","As Russian universities switched to distance education in March 2020 to prevent COVID-19 from spreading, self-paying students started questioning the fairness of tuition fees during the pandemic  They filed petitions, emphasizing that distance learning could not be equated to traditional classroom-based learning, that educational services delivered to the full extent, and that educational quality had decreased  On those grounds, students required cutting tuition fees down to the size of those in part-time or extramural education  To understand whether universities can afford making this step, we undertake to measure the price that they have paid for the transition to distance learning  For this purpose, we use data from a survey of faculty teaching and curriculum organization practices carried out at a federal university between March 23, 2020 and June 21, 2020, which involved 4,099 faculty members, as well as financial records of some departments within that university  Findings show that teaching workload reduced by 15% with distance learning during the pandemic, and the number of contact hours decreased 1 7 times  However, the overall amount of faculty workload increased by 50%, first of all due to a 2 4-time rise in curriculum organization activities  Therefore, the transition to distance education led to a significant increase in faculty workload, given that contact hours were preserved  Furthermore, the university invested heavily in the transition to distance learning and continuity of educational processes during the pandemic, in particular by financing the establishment of a new department for digitalization of learning processes  Â© 2021, Mir Rossii All Rights Reserved","Larionova, V.; Semenova, T.; Murzakhanova, E.; Daineko, L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Economic+Aspects+of+Emergency+Transition+to+Distance+Education,+or+The+Price+of+Going+Online+in+Higher+Education","","Database: Scopus; Publication details: Mir Rossii; 30(1):38-157, 2021.; Publication details: Mir Rossii; 30(1):38-157, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14951,""

"[COVID-19 effect on mental health and sleep disorders]; Psikhoemotsional'nye rasstroistva i narusheniya sna u patsientov s COVID-19","PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To study the prevalence of anxiety-depressive disorders and sleep disorders in their structure among patients hospitalized in connection with COVID-19, as well as to develop differentiated recommendations for their therapy in patients with new coronavirus infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this publication, the authors present preliminary results of their own observations of psychoemotional disorders and sleep disorders in their structure in patients with a new coronavirus infection. We analyzed the data of 119 patients (aged 47 to 69 years, male and female), conducted a detailed interview, including using telemedicine technologies, and assessed the scales: The hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), subjective the asthenia rating scale (MFI-20, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. RESULTS: According to the results of the HADS questionnaire, clinically pronounced anxiety-depressive symptoms were observed in 33 (28%) patients of 119 hospitalized in connection with the diagnosis of COVID-19. Of them, only clinically significant anxiety was recorded in 11% of cases (n=13), in 5 (4%) patients - clinically significant depression, an increase in both subscales of anxiety and depression - in 13% (n=15). An increase in the MFI-20 scale (more than 20 points) was found in 87 (73%) patients, sleep disorders in accordance with the PSQI questionnaire was recorded in 32 (27%) patients. CONCLUSION: According to the results of the study, it was noted that in most patients with COVID-19, along with a depressive symptom complex, anxiety and hypochondriacal disorders, an asthenic symptom complex, sleep disturbances with difficulty falling asleep, and dissatisfaction with the quality of sleep are recorded. Differentiated recommendations for the treatment of the studied conditions have been developed, taking into account the side effects of the prescribed drugs, drug interactions and the characteristics of the somatic status of patients. The choice of the drug should be based on the severity of the violations identified.","Samushiya, M A; Kryzhanovsky, S M; Ragimova, A A; Berishvili, T Z; Chorbinskaya, S A; Ivannikova, E I","https://dx.doi.org/10.17116/jnevro202112104249","","Country: RU; FEDERAÃ‡ÃƒO RUSSA; RUSSIA; RUSIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova;121(4.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Physical and Mental Health in China and Spain: Cross-sectional Study","BACKGROUND: Differences in physical and mental health impact across continents during the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the levels of impact of COVID-19 on mental health among people from Spain and China and correlated mental health parameters with variables relating to symptoms similar to COVID-19, COVID-19 knowledge, and precautionary measures. METHODS: We collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms, contact history with persons with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, COVID-19 knowledge, and precautionary measures. Participants completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21). To analyze the differences in the mental health parameters, the mean scores between Chinese and Spanish respondents were compared using the independent samples t test. The differences in categorical variables between the two samples were analyzed by the chi-square test. Linear regression was used to calculate the univariate associations between the independent variables and mental health parameters for both groups separately, with adjustments made for age, gender, and education. RESULTS: A total of 1528 participants (Spain: n=687; China: n=841) were recruited. The mean age of the Chinese respondents was 24.73 years (SD 7.60; range 18-65 years), and the mean age of the Spanish respondents was 43.06 years (SD 11.95; range 18-76 years). Spanish participants reported significantly more symptoms similar to COVID-19 infection (eg, fever, sore throat, and breathing difficulties), contact history with COVID-19, higher perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, frequent use of medical services, and less confidence in medical services compared with their Chinese counterparts (P<.001). Spanish participants reported significantly higher DASS-21 stress and depression scores, while Chinese participants reported significantly higher IES-R scores (P<.001). Chinese participants encountered more discrimination from other countries (P<.001). Significantly more Chinese participants reported using face masks than Spanish ones (P<.001). More exposure to health information was associated with adverse mental health in Spain (depression: P=.02; anxiety: P=.02; stress: P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that Spanish respondents reported higher levels of stress and depression as well as more symptoms and use of medical services. In preparation for the next pandemic, Spain needs to establish a prompt policy to implement rapid response and enhance medical services to safeguard physical and mental health.","Wang, Cuiyan; LÃ³pez-NÃºÃ±ez, MarÃ­a Inmaculada; Pan, Riyu; Wan, Xiaoyang; Tan, Yilin; Xu, Linkang; Choo, Faith; Ho, Roger; Ho, Cyrus; Aparicio GarcÃ­a, Marta E","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/27818","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(5): e27818, 2021 May 21.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(5): e27818, 2021 May 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14956,""
"Rise in Use of Digital Mental Health Tools and Technologies in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Survey Study","BACKGROUND: Accompanying the rising rates of reported mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a reported increase in the use of digital technologies to manage health generally, and mental health more specifically. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to systematically examine whether there was a COVID-19 pandemic-related increase in the self-reported use of digital mental health tools and other technologies to manage mental health. METHODS: We analyzed results from a survey of 5907 individuals in the United States using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk); the survey was administered during 4 week-long periods in 2020 and survey respondents were from all 50 states and Washington DC. The first set of analyses employed two different logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of having symptoms indicative of clinical depression and anxiety, respectively, as a function of the rate of COVID-19 cases per 10 people and survey time point. The second set employed seven different logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of using seven different types of digital mental health tools and other technologies to manage one's mental health, as a function of symptoms indicative of clinical depression and anxiety, rate of COVID-19 cases per 10 people, and survey time point. These models also examined potential interactions between symptoms of clinical depression and anxiety, respectively, and rate of COVID-19 cases. All models controlled for respondent sociodemographic characteristics and state fixed effects. RESULTS: Higher COVID-19 case rates were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of reporting symptoms of depression (odds ratio [OR] 2.06, 95% CI 1.27-3.35), but not anxiety (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.77-1.88). Survey time point, a proxy for time, was associated with a greater likelihood of reporting clinically meaningful symptoms of depression and anxiety (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.27 and OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19, respectively). Reported symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with a greater likelihood of using each type of technology. Higher COVID-19 case rates were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of using mental health forums, websites, or apps (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.49-4.88), and other health forums, websites, or apps (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.55-4.34). Time was associated with increased odds of reported use of mental health forums, websites, or apps (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.11-1.30), phone-based or text-based crisis lines (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10-1.31), and online, computer, or console gaming/video gaming (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19). Interactions between COVID-19 case rate and mental health symptoms were not significantly associated with any of the technology types. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggested increased use of digital mental health tools and other technologies over time during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, additional effort is urgently needed to consider the quality of these products, either by ensuring users have access to evidence-based and evidence-informed technologies and/or by providing them with the skills to make informed decisions around their potential efficacy.","Sorkin, Dara H; Janio, Emily A; Eikey, Elizabeth V; Schneider, Margaret; Davis, Katelyn; Schueller, Stephen M; Stadnick, Nicole A; Zheng, Kai; Neary, Martha; Safani, David; Mukamel, Dana B","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/26994","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(4): e26994, 2021 04 16.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(4): e26994, 2021 04 16.; /psychology; Mental Health Services/statistics & numerical data; Mental Health; Telemedicine/statistics & numerical data; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders/therapy; Pandemics; Surveys and Questionnaires; Technology; United States/epidemiology; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14957,""
"[How can an emergency department be strengthened against aÂ pandemic?]; Was macht eine Notaufnahme schlagkrÃ¤ftig gegenÃ¼ber einer Pandemie?","The emergency department (ED) is one of the crucial parts of the hospital infrastructure during all phases of the pandemic. The ED plays an important part in detecting an increasing number of new contagious diseases, which could potentially lead to an epidemic or pandemic.During a pandemic, the ED's main task is to detect infected individuals. These patients then need to be isolated and an adequate treatment is required. The ED must be prepared in order to perform well in such a situation. One major part for readiness is communication in an open manner to all partners within the department, as well as with emergency medical services and other departments of the hospital.The ED must be restructured to withstand the rising number of infected patients. These patients must be separated from other critically ill patients. Strategies for a diagnostic workup depending on the kind of infection have to be put in place. Pathways for the outpatient and inpatient management must be defined to avoid overcrowding in the ED. Depending on the number of patients, escalation and de-escalation strategies have to be set up within the hospital.Over the whole course of the pandemic, all staff members are the key resources for the ED and the entire hospital. The ED can only cope with a pandemic situation if staff are working together as a whole. This implies several important steps to get the staff prepared: Recurring, open conversations about fears, problems, and successes are critical for staff morale. Training must be continually provided, and protection strategies implemented. In the chronic phase of the pandemic the focus should shift more towards strategies on how to create possibilities for recuperation, domestic support measures, and mental health care for staff.","Schmid, Bonaventura; Lang, Corinna N; Danner, Timo; Kramer, Katharina; Hans, Felix P; Busch, Hans-JÃ¶rg","https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1226-8701","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Dtsch Med Wochenschr;146(10): 657-666, 2021 May.; Publication details: Dtsch Med Wochenschr;146(10): 657-666, 2021 May.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14958,""
"[Experiences of families of autistic children during a period of lockdown: Exploratory study]; VÃ©cus de familles d'enfants autistes en pÃ©riode de confinementÂ : Ã©tude exploratoire","Objective: The lockdown periods associated with the Covid-19 pandemic are a particularly significant challenge for families of children with autism. Exchanges by e-mail and interviews were aimed at collecting testimonies from parents for a better understanding of their difficulties and the help provided by the mobilization of professionals. Methods and results: Eight parents of autistic children living in the Seine-Saint-Denis area agreed to testify about their experience, either in person, taking into account the barrier measures after the first lockdown, or by telephone during the second lockdown. By way of comparison, e-mails were exchanged with a mother and two fathers of autistic children from higher socio-economic backgrounds living in other parts of France or Belgium. While at the beginning of the first lockdown, some children may have felt soothed by being at home with their parents, the extension of the situation led to crises related to feelings of anxiety or boredom. Despite the closure of many medical-social facilities, professionals mobilized to continue helping families and children whose routines were disrupted. Conclusion: Depending on the conditions of lockdown, the families' experiences differed and evolved over time. The major problems encountered by some families were the worsening of their child's troubles (self-harm, tantrums, violence, and shouting). Pedagogical tools were adapted by the teachers, activity sheets were sent out, group workshops were organized, and consultations were given at a distance. The teams of the child psychiatry services and the medico-social services have mobilized themselves and have shown reactivity and inventiveness in order to ensure the care and follow-up of children and their families.","Chamak, B","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neurenf.2021.05.003","","Country: FR; FRANÃ‡A; FRANCE; FRANCIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Neuropsychiatr Enfance Adolesc;2021 Jun 02.; Publication details: Neuropsychiatr Enfance Adolesc;2021 Jun 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14959,""

In the department of Pas-de-Calais, one step of the crisis measures was setting up a psychiatric regulation line, which aims to manage calls with strong emotional valence (in connexion with containment, anxiety related to the epidemic context, or break in psychiatric cares for people suffering of mental disorders). This psychiatric hotline was provided from 20 March 2020 to 15 May 2020 by fifteen psychiatric careers (psychiatrists, psychologists and psychiatric nurses) from the network of the medical-psychological emergency unit (unit of the emergency call center which aims to manage people involved in psychotraumatic events). In total, 556 calls were answered, i.e. an average of 9,8 calls per day. The typology of calls was in a quarter of the cases anxiety related to the fear of being infected, in the second quarter, adjustment disorders related to containment, and for about half of the calls, psychiatrics symptoms whether it was preexisting and increased by the discontinuation of care, or context-induced. The benefits identified by this device were as follows: -the discharge of time-consuming calls for the medical dispatcher assistant, -the expertise of a mental health professional, knowing the mental health network, to make the decision more fluid. Last but not least, it is interesting to note that the presence of the psychiatric regulator in the regulation room allowed a transfer of calls and a reciprocal acculturation. In view of the relevance of the establishment of a psychiatric regulation line in the epidemic context of Covid-19, it seems interesting to consider the sustainability of this system, which is part of a global context of evolution of the provision of emergency care.","Rougegrez, Laure; Dupont, Marine","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.05.006","","Country: FR; FRANÃ‡A; FRANCE; FRANCIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ann Med Psychol (Paris);2021 May 28.; Publication details: Ann Med Psychol (Paris);2021 May 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14960,""

"[Experiences and perspectives of nursing home residents with depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: aÂ qualitative study]; Erfahrungen und Sichtweisen von Pflegeheimbewohnenden mit depressiver Symptomatik wÃ¤hrend der COVID-19-Pandemie: eine qualitative Studie","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic requires extensive health protection interventions in order to prevent infections in the long-term care setting. These interventions impact residents' lives, including an increase in depressive symptoms and other negative concomitants. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to explore the experiences and perspectives of nursing home residents with depressive symptoms during the pandemic. METHODS: In this study nine guideline-based interviews were conducted with residents. These were analyzed using the content-structured content analysis according to Kuckartz. RESULTS: Three main themes were identified: perceptions and emotions related to the pandemic, changes and limitations due to the interventions and wishes in terms of the pandemic. The residents reported both emotional distress and not being afraid of infection and its consequences. In addition, some respondents reported unpleasant restrictions, such as wearing masks. In some cases their usefulness was critically questioned. Furthermore, various wishes of the residents in relation to the pandemic, such as leaving the nursing home, were identified. CONCLUSION: The study showed complex perceptions, changes, and wishes due to the pandemic and its interventions. Therefore, an individual approach to residents with depressive symptoms is necessary to avoid an increase in mental health problems. Against this background, there is aÂ need for participatory implementation of health protection measures for the particularly vulnerable group of nursing home residents.","Schweighart, Roxana; Klemmt, Malte; Neuderth, Silke; Teti, Andrea","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00391-021-01926-3","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Z Gerontol Geriatr;2021 Jun 03.; Publication details: Z Gerontol Geriatr;2021 Jun 03.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-15","",14962,""
