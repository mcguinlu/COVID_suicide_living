"Environmental Health Threats to Latino Migrant Farmworkers","Approximately 75% of farmworkers in the United States are Latino migrants, and about 50% of hired farmworkers do not have authorization to work in the United States. Farmworkers face numerous chemical, physical, and biological threats to their health. The adverse effects of these hazards may be amplified among Latino migrant farmworkers, who are concurrently exposed to various psychosocial stressors. Factors such as documentation status, potential lack of authorization to work in the United States, and language and cultural barriers may also prevent Latino migrants from accessing federal aid, legal assistance, and health programs. These environmental, occupational, and social hazards may further exacerbate existing health disparities among US Latinos. This population is also likely to be disproportionately impacted by emerging threats, including climate change and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Latino migrant farmworkers are essential to agriculture in the United States, and actions are needed to protect this vulnerable population. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Public Health, Volume 42 is April 2021.

"Digital health literacy and online information seeking in times of COVID-19 A cross-sectional survey among university students in Germany","BACKGROUND: Digital communication technologies play an important role in governments' and public health authorities' health communication strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The internet and social media have become important sources of health-related information on the coronavirus and on protective behaviours. In addition, the COVID-19 infodemic spreads faster than the coronavirus itself, which interferes with governmental health-related communication efforts. This puts national public health containment strategies in jeopardy. Therefore, digital health literacy is a key competence to navigate coronavirus-related information and service environments. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate university students' digital health literacy and online information seeking behaviours during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic in Germany. METHODS: A cross-sectional study among N=14,916 university students aged &#8805;18 from 130 universities across all sixteen federal states of Germany was conducted using an online survey. Along with sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, subjective social status) measures included five subscales from the Digital Health Literacy Instrument (DHLI), which was adapted to the specific coronavirus context. Online information seeking behaviour was investigated by examining the online sources used by university students and the topics that students search for in connection with the coronavirus. Data were analysed using univariate and bivariate analyses. RESULTS: Across digital health literacy dimensions, the greatest difficulties could be found for assessing the reliability of health-related information (42.3%) and the ability to determine whether the information was written with commercial interest (38.9%). Moreover, respondents also indicated that they most frequently have problems finding the information they are looking for (30.4%). When stratified according to sociodemographic characteristics, significant differences were found with female university students reporting a lower DHLI for the dimensions of 'information searching' and of 'evaluating reliability'. Search engines, news portals and public bodies' websites were most often used by the respondents as sources to search for information on COVID-19 and related issues. Female students were found to use social media and health portals more frequently, while male students used Wikipedia and other online encyclopaedias as well as YouTube more often. The use of social media was associated with a low ability to critically evaluate information, while opposite differences were observed for the use of public websites. CONCLUSIONS: Although digital health literacy is, in summary, well developed in university students, a significant proportion of students still face difficulties with certain abilities to deal with information. There is need to strengthen the digital health literacy capacities of university students using tailored interventions. Improving the quality of health-related information on the internet is also key.","Dadaczynski, Kevin; Okan, Orkan; Messer, Melanie; Leung, Angela Y M; RosÃ¡rio, Rafaela; Darlington, Emily; Rathmann, Katharina","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/24097","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;2020 Dec 08.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;2020 Dec 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9062,""
"Mental health problems among Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19: The importance of nutrition and physical activity","Background/Objective: Mental health problems are common among adolescents and greatly influenced by stressful events. This study sought to assess the prevalence and correlates of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19. Method: Cross-sectional study (NÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯1794 adolescents, mean ageÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯15.26) was conducted in May 2020. An online survey was used to collect socio-demographic data, COVID-related fear (COVID-fear), nutrition, physical activity (PA) level and the symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Results: The prevalence of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms was 37.80%, 48.20% and 36.70%, respectively, among Chinese adolescents during the pandemic. Generalized linear models revealed that female, left behind children, and students with greater COVID-fear tended to report symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety concurrently. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors and COVID-fear, better nutritional status and moderately active PA were both associated with lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, while highly active PA was associated with lower levels of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: These findings suggest that more attention should be paid to psychological health among adolescents while combating COVID-19. To promote adolescents' mental health, educators should help adolescents develop a healthy lifestyle with balanced diet and regular exercise.","Chi, Xinli; Liang, Kaixin; Chen, Si-Tong; Huang, Qiaomin; Huang, Liuyue; Yu, Qian; Jiao, Can; Guo, Tianyou; Stubbs, Brendon; Hossain, Md Mahbub; Yeung, Albert; Kong, Zhaowei; Zou, Liye","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.100218","","Country: ES; ESPANHA; SPAIN; ESPAÃ‘A; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Clin Health Psychol;: 100218, 2020 Dec 24.; Publication details: Int J Clin Health Psychol;: 100218, 2020 Dec 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9063,""
"How are bariatric patients coping during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic? Analysis of factors known to cause weight regain among postoperative bariatric patients","BACKGROUND: The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is wreaking havoc on society. Bariatric patients are more prone to severe infection due to their high body mass index (BMI) and are more vulnerable to the effects of isolation, such as depression or disruption of their health habits. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the impact of self-quarantine on bariatric patients and self-quarantine's relationship with weight gain. SETTING: Academic hospital, United States. METHODS: A 30-item survey examining several known contributors to weight regain was distributed among the postoperative bariatric patients of our clinic. Changes in eating habits, exercise, depression, social support, loneliness, and anxiety were studied, among others. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients completed the survey (29.3% response rate). A large percentage of patients reported increases in their depression (44.2%), loneliness (36.2%), nervousness (54.7%), snacking (62.6%), loss of control when eating (48.2%), and binge eating (19.5%) and decreases in their social support (23.2%), healthy food eating (45.5%), and activity (55.2%). Difficulty in accessing vitamins was reported by 13%. Patients more than 18 months out of surgery regained more than 2 kg during an average of 47 days. Risk factors for weight regain were found to be loss of control when eating, increases in snacking and binge eating, reduced consumption of healthy food, and reduced physical activity. CONCLUSION: Bariatric patients are negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social isolation on many levels. This patient population is vulnerable to crisis situations; thus, additional intervention is needed to address behaviors that lead to weight regain.","Athanasiadis, Dimitrios I; Hernandez, Edward; Hilgendorf, William; Roper, Alexandra; Embry, Marisa; Selzer, Don; Stefanidis, Dimitrios","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2020.11.021","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Surg Obes Relat Dis;2020 Nov 28.; Publication details: Surg Obes Relat Dis;2020 Nov 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9064,""

"A comprehensive drug repurposing study for COVID19 treatment: novel putative dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitors show association to serotonin-dopamine receptors","Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a key enzyme required for de novo pyrimidine synthesis and it is suggested as a target for COVID19 treatment due to high pyrimidine demand by the virus replication in the infected host cells as well as its proven effect of blocking of cytokine release by the immune cells to prevent inflammation leading to acute respiratory distress. There are a number of clinical trials underway for COVID19 treatment using DHODH inhibitors; however, there are only a small number of known DHODH antagonists available for testing. Here, we have applied a methodology to identify DHODH antagonist candidates, and compared them using in silico target prediction tools. A large set of 7900 FDA-approved and clinical stage drugs obtained from DrugBank were docked against 20 different structures DHODH available in PDB. Drugs were eliminated according to their predicted affinities by Autodock Vina. About 28 FDA-approved and 79 clinical trial ongoing drugs remained. The mode of interaction of these molecules was analyzed by repeating docking using Autodock 4 and DS Visualiser. Finally, the target region predictions of 28 FDA-approved drugs were determined through PASS and SwissTargetPrediction tools. Interestingly, the analysis of in silico target predictions revealed that serotonin-dopamine receptor antagonists could also be potential DHODH inhibitors. Our candidates shared a common attribute, a possible interaction with serotonin-dopamine receptors as well as other oxidoreductases, like DHODH. Moreover, the Bruton Tyrosine Kinase-inhibitor acalabrutunib and serotonin-dopamine receptor inhibitor drugs on our list have been found in the literature that have shown to be effective against Sars-CoV-2, while the path of activity is yet to be identified. Identifying an effective drug that can suppress both inflammation and virus proliferation will play a crucial role in the treatment of COVID. Therefore, we suggest experimental investigation of the 28 FDA-approved drugs on DHODH activity and Sars-CoV-2 virus proliferation. Those who are found experimentally effective can play an important role in COVID19 treatment. Moreover, we suggest investigating COVID19 case conditions in patients using schizophrenia and depression drugs.","Berber, Doluca","https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa379","20210106","COVID19; DHODH; Sars-CoV-2; molecular docking; target prediction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9073,""

We confirm the previously documented average deterioration in mental health for the whole sample of individuals interviewed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we find that the average increase in mental distress varies by ethnicity and gender. Both women -regardless of their ethnicity- and Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) men experienced a higher average increase in mental distress than White British men, so that the gender gap in mental health increases only among White British individuals. These ethnic-gender specific changes in mental health persist after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Finally, we find some evidence that, among men, Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani individuals have experienced the highest average increase in mental distress with respect to White British men.","Proto, Quintana-Domeque","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244419","20210106","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9074,""
"The willingness to adopt m-Health among Chinese parents during the COVID-19 outbreakÃ¯Â¼Å¡Cross-Sectional Questionnaire Study","Parental involvement in m-health to consult with medical professionals appears to be prevalent in China with rapid development in Internet. More parents with busy jobs choose m-health without time limitation. During the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, m-Health can assist with health promotion, directions for medication usage and disease diagnosis via online chat and video consultation without contacting others. To our knowledge, no studies have been performed to explore the role of m-health in parents' attitudes towards child health at home during COVID-19 outbreak. Our study aimed to identify the associated factors of willingness to adopt m-Health among Chinese parents during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore the correlation between the frequency of adopting m-Health and parents' attitudes towards child health at home. Chinese parents were asked to complete an online survey from 25th January to 15th February, 2020. The questionnaire comprised of two parts with a total of sixteen items, including parents' demographic variables and attitudes towards child health at home. By multivariate logistic regression we explored factors associated with parents' willingness to adopt m-Health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Pearson chi-square test was used to reveal the correlation between the frequency of adopting m-Health and parents' attitudes towards child health at home. A total of 254 parents enrolled, from which 202 out 254 (79.5%) were willing to adopt m-Health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Parents' age ((adjusted OR (AOR): 8.114(95% CI: 1.471 to 44.764)), parents' interest in the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR: 8.753(95% CI: 2.009 to 38.127); AOR: 22.194(95% CI: 5.509 to 89.411)), the source to recommend m-Health (AOR: 4.257(95% CI: 1.439 to 12.596)), presence of chronic disease in children (AOR: 20.844(95% CI: 4.600 to 94.443)), parents' duration of daily internet use (AOR: 6.487(95% CI: 1.870 to 22.495); AOR: 8.766(95% CI: 1.883 to 40.804)), and adoption of m-Health before the COVID-19 outbreak (AOR: 3.413(95% CI: 1.234 to 9.444)) were significantly correlated with parents' willingness to adopt m-Health during the COVID-19 outbreak. The frequency of m-health usage among parents was correlated with their behaviors in regards to hand-washing (2=18.967, P=.004), mask-wearing (2=45.364, P&lt; .001), frequency of leaving the home (2=16.767, P=.01), room disinfection and ventilation (2=19.515, P=.003), temperature checking (2=17.47, P=.007), and mental health-care of children (2=63.810, P&lt; .001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found various objective factors to be associated with parents' willingness to adopt m-Health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Overall, parents' willingness to adopt m-Health was high. The frequency of m-health usage among parents was correlated with their attitudes towards child health at home. The option of m-Health to patients at home during the COVID-19 outbreak would be beneficial for education and improvement in self-management of child health at home.","Yang, Chen, Zhou, Huang, Dai","https://doi.org/10.2196/23155","20210106","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9075,""

Effects on quality of life of persistent poor physical or mental health associated with COVID-19 are not well understood. Adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18Ã‚Â years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and matched control patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection at outpatient facilities associated with 11 medical centers in the United States were interviewed to assess symptoms, illness duration, and health-related quality of life. Duration of symptoms, health-related quality of life measures, and days of poor physical health by symptoms experienced during illness were compared between case patients and controls using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Symptoms associated with COVID-19 case status were evaluated by multivariable logistic regression. Among 320 participants included, 157 were COVID-19 cases and 163 were SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. Loss of taste or smell was reported by 63% of cases and 6% of controls and was strongly associated with COVID-19 in logistic regression models (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 32.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.6-83.1).

"Religious Support as a Contribution to Face the Effects of Social Isolation in Mental Health During the Pandemic of COVID-19","Coping with the COVID-19 pandemic has required measures to contain the contagion, including social isolation. However, this and other factors have caused mental health problems, both in patients and health professionals and in family members or asymptomatic population. Religious support can be an ally for this type of confrontation. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, spiritual/religious care has been restricted and insufficient. When accessible to patients and frontline professionals, they are offered by virtual means, almost always by recorded media and made available in bulk. This essay argues, based on references in the areas of psychology, psychoneuroimmunology, biosafety, and military, that the face-to-face and personalized relationship between religious leaders, patients, health professionals, family members, and faith communities is as essential as possible for the dignified treatment victims, referral to spiritual needs and resilience of society, in addition to contributing to the improvement of the immune response of all.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children's Conduct Problems and Callous-Unemotional Traits","The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered family life, but whether family exposures to and worries about the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted child conduct problems (CP) and callous-unemotional (CU) traits is unknown. Thus, we evaluated 303 parents (M<sub>age</sub> = 38.04; SD = 5.21; 92.4% biological mothers) and children (M<sub>age</sub> = 6.43; SD = 2.13; 51.8% female) during a four-month period early in the pandemic. We examined associations between parental exposures to COVID-19, parental worries about the pandemic, harsh and warm parenting practices, and child CP and CU traits. Although more parental worries were not directly related to parenting practices, more worry about COVID-19 was specifically related to higher levels of child CP, particularly parental worries about themselves or family members contracting the virus. Our findings add to a growing literature demonstrating the burden that the pandemic has placed on families and its implications for children's mental health.","Waller, Powell, Rodriguez, Corbett, Perlstein, White, Barzilay, Wagner","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-020-01109-y","20210106","Callous-unemotional traits; Conduct problems; Families; Parenting; Prevention science","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9080,""
"Impact of COVID-19 in the Mental Health in Elderly: Psychological and Biological Updates","Since December 2019, the world has been experiencing the challenge of facing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), a severe infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The individuals with the most severe symptoms and the highest risk of death are the elderly and those with chronic illness. Among chronic conditions, those with a certain degree of chronic inflammation may predispose to a more severe evolution of COVID-19. Elderly with psychiatric disorders can present a persistent inflammatory state, a characteristic of the age's immunological senescence, but the disorder can accentuate that. Social isolation is still the safest way to avoid contamination. However, isolated older people may have or worsen mental health conditions due to isolation and health concerns. In this scenario, a SARS-CoV-2 infection may progress to more severe disease. Conversely, COVID-19 can predispose or aggravate psychiatric disorders, as it induces a cytokine storm, causing systemic hyper inflammation. It may damage the blood-brain barrier, resulting in inflammation in the central nervous system. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to reach and trigger an inflammatory process directly in the nervous system. This review makes an update about research on the mental health of the elderly during the pandemic. Also, it discusses the vulnerability of these individuals in the face of stress and in the case of contracting COVID-19, considering mainly the stress's hormonal and inflammatory mechanisms. Finally, the review points out possible care and attention strategies and entertainment and activities that can reduce the damage to mental and physical health and improve the elderly's quality of life. Graphical abstract Isolation and concerns about COVID-19 may harm elderly mental health. Immunosenescence and pandemic stress increase the risk of psychiatric disorders. Stress and disorders may potentiate the elderly's inflammation and COVID-19 symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 hyperinflammation is a risk factor for elderly psychiatric disorders.","Grolli, Mingoti, Bertollo, Luzardo, Quevedo, RÃƒÂ©us, IgnÃƒÂ¡cio","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-020-02249-x","20210106","COVID-19; Elderly; Inflammation; Mental health; Psychiatric disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9081,""
"The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Lived Experience of Diverse Older Adults Living Alone With Cognitive Impairment","Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults with cognitive impairment living alone (an estimated 4.3 million individuals in the United States) were at high risk for negative health outcomes. There is an urgent need to learn how this population is managing during the pandemic. This is a qualitative study of 24 adults aged 55 and older living alone with cognitive impairment from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds. Participants' lived experiences during the pandemic were elicited via 59 ethnographic interviews conducted over the phone either in English, Spanish, or Cantonese. Using a qualitative content analysis approach, interview transcripts were analyzed to identify codes and themes. Qualitative analysis of transcripts revealed 5 themes: (a) fear generated by the pandemic, (b) distress stemming from feeling extremely isolated, (c) belief in misinformation, (d) strategies for coping during the pandemic, and (e) the importance of access to essential services. This pandemic put a spotlight on the precarity and unmet needs of older adults living alone with cognitive impairment. Findings underscore the need to expand access to home care aides and mental health services for this population.","Portacolone, Chodos, Halpern, Covinsky, Keiser, Fung, Rivera, Tran, Bykhovsky, Johnson","https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaa201","20210106","Health equity; Living arrangements; Precarity; Social isolation; United States","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9082,""
"The low-cost Shifter microscope stage transforms the speed and robustness of protein crystal harvesting","Despite the tremendous success of X-ray cryo-crystallography in recent decades, the transfer of crystals from the drops in which they are grown to diffractometer sample mounts remains a manual process in almost all laboratories. Here, the Shifter, a motorized, interactive microscope stage that transforms the entire crystal-mounting workflow from a rate-limiting manual activity to a controllable, high-throughput semi-automated process, is described. By combining the visual acuity and fine motor skills of humans with targeted hardware and software automation, it was possible to transform the speed and robustness of crystal mounting. Control software, triggered by the operator, manoeuvres crystallization plates beneath a clear protective cover, allowing the complete removal of film seals and thereby eliminating the tedium of repetitive seal cutting. The software, either upon request or working from an imported list, controls motors to position crystal drops under a hole in the cover for human mounting at a microscope. The software automatically captures experimental annotations for uploading to the user's data repository, removing the need for manual documentation. The Shifter facilitates mounting rates of 100-240 crystals per hour in a more controlled process than manual mounting, which greatly extends the lifetime of the drops and thus allows a dramatic increase in the number of crystals retrievable from any given drop without loss of X-ray diffraction quality. In 2015, the first in a series of three Shifter devices was deployed as part of the XChem fragment-screening facility at Diamond Light Source, where they have since facilitated the mounting of over 120Ã¢â‚¬â€¦000 crystals. The Shifter was engineered to have a simple design, providing a device that could be readily commercialized and widely adopted owing to its low cost. The versatile hardware design allows use beyond fragment screening and protein crystallography.","Wright, Collins, Koekemoer, Krojer, Talon, Nelson, Ye, Nowak, Newman, Ng, Mitrovich, Wiggers, von Delft","https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798320014114","20210107","COVID-19; MPro; X-ray crystallography; XÃ¢â‚¬â€œY stage; automation; fragment screening; high-throughput screening; microplates; protein crystal mounting; structural genomics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9083,""
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers in China Xi'an central hospital","COVID-19 significantly altered our routine, lifestyle, and stress level across the globe. This study investigated the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers in China Xi'an Center hospital. A modified online questionnaire of Psychological Status and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was provided to 1,967 healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participation was voluntary, and the responses were anonymous. The survey lasted for 2Ã‚Â weeks, and the GHQ-12 was completed every other day. The data were collected automatically and electronically and then statistically analyzed. The 431 (21.9%) responders included 214 nurses (49.7%), 146 clinicians (33.9%), 29 pharmacists (6.7%), 15 medical technicians (3.5%), 17 administrative staff (3.9%), and 10 other departments (2.3%). Of these, 46.2% had 10Ã‚Â years of work experiences or more and 78.2% were married. Work experience increased emotional stress as 23% of participants with 10Ã‚Â years or more of experience exhibited higher stress compared to those with fewer than 3Ã‚Â years of work experience (7.5%). Moreover, 33.3% of participants who worked in or were exposed to the affected areas of the pandemic experienced psychological stress. Overall, this study identified four factors that were significantly associated with psychological stress: (a) work experience (OR 2.99; 95% CI: 1.06 to 8.41); (b) change in job position (OR 1.99; 95% CI: 1.10 to 3.59); (c) change in lifestyle (OR 4.06; 95% CI: 1.81 to 9.10); and (d) need for psychological counseling (OR 3.07; 95% CI: 1.62 to 5.82).

"Prevalence and predictors of psychological response during immediate COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 pandemic has created a serious psychological impact worldwide since it has been declared. This study aims to investigate the level of psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on Turkish population and to determine related factors. The study was carried out by using an online questionnaire using the virtual snowball sampling method. The sociodemographic data were collected on the following subjects: participants' experience on any signs of infection within the last month, the history of COVID-19 contact-treatment-quarantine, level of compliance with precautionary measures, the sources of information and level of knowledge about the pandemic process and their belief levels on the knowledge they acquire. Besides, the questions that take place in the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), and &quot;Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) were asked to participants. Of the 3549 participants, anxiety was found in 15.8%, depression in 22.6%, stress in 12.9%, and psychological trauma in 20.29% based on moderate and above levels. Female gender, young age, higher education level, being single, high monthly income, presence of psychiatric illness, a large number of people living together, having any signs of infection, and contact history with COVID-19 infected person or contaminated object are identified as risk factors that may increase psychological impact.

Many are prone to depression, anxiety and loneliness, and extra isolation leaves them vulnerable to compromised mental health. In this study, trained volunteers providing befriending for residents with symptoms of depression, anxiety and loneliness switched to remote befriending during COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to gauge volunteer perceptions of the switch. <b>Methods</b>: A qualitative phenomenological approach was used to understand how switching to remote befriending impacted on volunteers and residents. A convenience sample of 18 participants responded to questions either in individual or group interviews. <b>Results</b>: Volunteers adapted their befriending visits, switching from face to face visits to remote options. The format was decided collaboratively. Hearing impairments hindered phone calls. Residents sometimes felt uncomfortable with digital technology but on the whole, the change to remote &quot;visiting&quot; was accepted. <b>Conclusions</b>: Further research is being conducted to gauge mental health outcomes for residents. Most volunteers and residents accepted the switch to remote befriending as better than no contact. <b>Clinical implications</b>: Volunteers can provide valuable support for residents living with social isolation during COVID-19.

"Meaning in Life, Religious Coping, and Loneliness During the Coronavirus Health CrisisÃ‚Â in Turkey","Since December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has causedÃ‚Â serious mental health challenges and consequentlyÃ‚Â the Turkish population has been adversely affected by the virus. The present study examined how meaning in life related to loneliness and the degree to which religious coping strategies mediated these relations. Participants were a sample of 872 adults (242 males and 360 females) drawn from general public in Turkey. Data were collected using Meaning in Life Questionnaire, UCLA Loneliness Scale, andÃ‚Â the Religious Coping Measure. Meaning in life was associated with more positive religious coping and less negative religious coping and loneliness. Positive religious coping was associated with less loneliness, while negative religious coping was associated with more loneliness. Religious coping strategies mediated the impact of meaning in life on loneliness. These findings suggest that greater meaning in life may link with lesser loneliness due to, in part, an increased level of positive religious coping strategies and a decreased level of negative coping strategies.","YÃ„Â±ldÃ„Â±rÃ„Â±m, KÃ„Â±zÃ„Â±lgeÃƒÂ§it, SeÃƒÂ§er, Karabulut, AngÃ„Â±n, DaÃ„Å¸cÃ„Â±, Vural, Bayram, Ãƒâ€¡inici","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-020-01173-7","20210106","Coronavirus; Loneliness; Meaning in life; Negative religious coping; Positive religious coping","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9088,""

"COVID-19 and Its Psychological Impacts on Healthcare Staff - A Multi-Centric Comparative Cross-Sectional Study","Background Since the first case of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in Pakistan was reported in February 2020,Ã‚Â the medical and paramedical staff has been working on the frontlines to deal with this disease. They have been facing significant strain and stress due to the pandemic, affecting their social, mental, and personal life. The purpose of this study is to investigate the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, etiology, personal coping mechanisms, and the strategies that are being adopted to reduce stress by the healthcare workers (HCWs) working in COVID-19 dedicated wards (group 2) and compare it with staff working in other departments but not in COVID-19 wards amid this pandemic (group 1) in various hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan. Methods The comparative cross-sectional study was designed which included doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals from various hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan. A questionnaire was designed which consisted of five sections, and 51 questions. A Chi-square test was used to compare the responses between these two groups. Results The study questionnaire was submitted by 200 participants, 100 responses for each group (see the Appendix). In group 1, HCWs not working in COVID-19 dedicated floors were afraid of getting infected, transmitting the infection to their families and concerned about using personal protective equipment (PPE) improperly. They reported a lack of concentration and tense muscles. The coping mechanisms of this group were exercise, strict precautions at work, and social distancing measures. While HCWs serving in COVID-19 dedicated wards were concerned and afraid of putting their families at risk by working in the high-risk environment; the major stresses in this group were: lack of knowledge about proper strategies for treatment, they faced insecurity due to physical and verbal violence by caretakers of COVID-19 patients, and lack of concentration. The coping mechanism was the support of their families and taking strict precautions, with self-isolation if required, to avoid any disease transmission to their families. The proposed strategies to be implemented included teaching skills for self-rescue as well as the implementation of policies at the administrative level to reduce working hours and frequent shift rotation. Conclusion The COVID-19 outbreak posed a great deal of mental stress among HCWs working on the COVID-19 floor as well as those serving in other departments of the hospital. The HCWs from group 1 were most afraid of getting infected and putting family members at risk, experienced tense muscles and lack of concentration, coped their stress by exercise and being more vigilant, and suggested the strategies of teaching skills for self-rescue and better community awareness. While the staff from the second group were most afraid of being the source of infection and violence from the caretakers of patients, experienced tense muscles, used family support, and strict isolation measures as coping mechanisms and suggested the strategies of self-rescue and increase in wages of directly exposed healthcare workers to deal with such pandemics in future in a better way.","Shahid, Haider, Taqi, Gulzar, Zamani, Fatima, Khalid, Ahmed, Nadeem, Anwer","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.11753","20210106","covid-19; evidence based medicine; infectious disease; internal medicine; medical staff; mental health; pandemic; primary healthcare workers; psychological impacts; quality improvement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9090,""

"COVID-19 related health inequality exists even in a city where disease incidence is relatively low: a telephone survey in Hong Kong","We examined whether COVID-19 could exert inequalities in socioeconomic conditions and health in Hong Kong, where there has been a relatively low COVID-19 incidence. 752 adult respondents from a previous random sample participated in a telephone survey from 20 April to 11 May 2020. We examined demographic and socioeconomic factors, worry of COVID-19, general health, economic activity, and personal protective equipment (PPE) and related hygiene practice by deprivation status. The associations between deprivation and negative COVID-19 related issues were analysed using binary logistic regressions, while the associations of these issues with health were analysed using linear regressions. Path analysis was conducted to determine the direct effect of deprivation, and the indirect effects via COVID-19 related issues, on health. Interactions between deprivation and the mediators were also tested. Deprived individuals were more likely to have job loss/instability, less reserves, less utilisation and more concerns of PPE. After adjustments for potential confounders, being deprived was associated with having greater risk of low reserve of face masks, being worried about the disease and job loss/instability. Being deprived had worse physical (ÃŽÂ²=-0.154, p&lt;0.001) and mental health (ÃŽÂ²=-0.211, p&lt;0.001) and had an indirect effect on mental health via worry and job loss/instability (total indirect effect: ÃŽÂ²=-0.027, p=0.017; proportion being mediated=11.46%). In addition, significant interaction between deprivation and change of economic activity status was observed on mental health-related quality of life. Even if the COVID-19 incidence was relatively low, part of the observed health inequality can be explained by people's concerns over livelihood and economic activity, which were affected by the containment measures. We should look beyond the incidence to address COVID-19 related health inequalities.","Chung, Chung, Marmot, Allen, Chan, Goldblatt, Wong, Lai, Woo, Yeoh, Wong","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-215392","20210106","communicable diseases; deprivation; health inequalities; poverty; social inequalities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9093,""

We assessed change in perceived health behaviors prior to and following introduction of COVID-19. We conducted hierarchical linear regression to explore and identify risk/protective factors related to physical activity, diet quality, and social isolation. <b>Results:</b> There have been substantial decreases in physical activity and increases in sedentary behavior and social isolation, but no changes in diet quality since COVID-19. We identified modifiable and non-modifiable factors associated with each health behavior. <b>Conclusions:</b> Negative effects indicate the need for universal intervention to promote health behaviors. Inequalities in health behaviors among vulnerable populations may be exacerbated since COVID-19, suggesting need for targeted invention. Social support may be a mechanism to promote health behaviors.

"Analysis of personal and national factors that influence depression in individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic: a web-based cross-sectional survey","The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Previous studies of infectious diseases showed that infectious diseases not only cause physical damage to infected individuals but also damage to the mental health of the public. Therefore this study aims to analyze the factors that affected depression in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide evidence for COVID-19-related mental health policies and to emphasize the need to prepare for mental health issues related to potential infectious disease outbreaks in the future. This study performed the following statistical analyses to analyze the factors that influence depression in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, to confirm the level of depression in the public in each country, the participants' depression was plotted on a Boxplot graph for analysis. Second, to confirm personal and national factors that influence depression in individuals, a multi-level analysis was conducted. As a result, the median Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score for all participants was 6. The median was higher than the overall median for the Philippines, Indonesia, and Paraguay, suggesting a higher level of depression. In personal variables, depression was higher in females than in males, and higher in participants who had experienced discrimination due to COVID-19 than those who had not. In contrast, depression was lower in older participants, those with good subjective health, and those who practiced personal hygiene for prevention. In national variables, depression was higher when the Government Response Stringency Index score was higher, when life expectancy was higher, and when social capital was higher. In contrast, depression was lower when literacy rates were higher. Our study reveals that depression was higher in participants living in countries with higher stringency index scores than in participants living in other countries. Maintaining a high level of vigilance for safety cannot be criticized. However, in the current situation, where coexisting with COVID-19 has become inevitable, inflexible and stringent policies not only increase depression in the public, but may also decrease resilience to COVID-19 and compromise preparations for coexistence with COVID-19. Accordingly, when establishing policies such as social distancing and quarantine, each country should consider the context of their own country.","Lee, Lee, Kim, Moon, Nam","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00650-8","20210106","COVID-19; Depression; Government response stringency index; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9095,""
"Mental health consequences of COVID-19 media coverage: the need for effective crisis communication practices","During global pandemics, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), crisis communication is indispensable in dispelling fears, uncertainty, and unifying individuals worldwide in a collective fight against health threats. Inadequate crisis communication can bring dire personal and economic consequences. Mounting research shows that seemingly endless newsfeeds related to COVID-19 infection and death rates could considerably increase the risk of mental health problems. Unfortunately, media reports that include infodemics regarding the influence of COVID-19 on mental health may be a source of the adverse psychological effects on individuals. Owing partially to insufficient crisis communication practices, media and news organizations across the globe have played minimal roles in battling COVID-19 infodemics. Common refrains include raging QAnon conspiracies, a false and misleading &quot;Chinese virus&quot; narrative, and the use of disinfectants to &quot;cure&quot; COVID-19. With the potential to deteriorate mental health, infodemics fueled by a kaleidoscopic range of misinformation can be dangerous. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of research on how to improve crisis communication across media and news organization channels. This paper identifies ways that legacy media reports on COVID-19 and how social media-based infodemics can result in mental health concerns. This paper discusses possible crisis communication solutions that media and news organizations can adopt to mitigate the negative influences of COVID-19 related news on mental health. Emphasizing the need for global media entities to forge a fact-based, person-centered, and collaborative response to COVID-19 reporting, this paper encourages media resources to focus on the core issue of how to slow or stop COVID-19 transmission effectively.","Su, McDonnell, Wen, Kozak, Abbas, Ã…Â egalo, Li, Ahmad, Cheshmehzangi, Cai, Yang, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00654-4","20210106","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Crisis communication; Disinformation; Infodemic; Mental health; Misinformation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9096,""
"Impact of Covid-19 on Mental Health: An Overview","The COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) pandemic is a major threat to public health affecting the world; it has been identified as originating in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. It is spreading widely and rapidly spread across the globe, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia. Such global outburst is associated with adverse effects on mental health. Fear, stress, anxiety seem more definitely an outcome of mass quarantine. Keeping this pandemic situation in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 crisis relevant to mental health was redeemed via a literature search from PubMed database. Collected published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of self-reported stress, anxiety and depression are common psychological impact to the pandemic, and may be associated with disrupted sleep. Regional, state, National-international borders have almost been shut down, economies crashed, and billions of people quarantined or isolated at their own homes and quarantine centers. In this situational frame of covid-19, patients, front-line healthcare professionals, geriatric population with existing psychiatric conditions may be encountering further suffering. COVID-19 will continue to affect mental health and wellbeing intensely; also, mental health serves an important role in battling the epidemic. With the scare of COVID-19 pandemic on the rise, it is time that as psychiatrists should try to integrate the health-care services keeping mental health at prime.","Kshirsagar, Dodamani, Dodamani, Khobragade, Deokar","https://doi.org/10.2174/1574887115666210105122324","20210106","COVID-19; Communicable disease; epidemics; healthcare professionals.; mental health; psychological factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9097,""
"Psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study of online help-seeking Canadian men","<b>Purpose</b>: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the lives of men. In addition to physical health, there is increasing recognition of the need to understand the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19. The present study investigated psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on a help-seeking community sample of Canadian men, focusing on diverse aspects of their psychosocial well-being. <b>Methods</b>: A cross-sectional, open survey study design was used. Canadian adult men who were visiting an eHealth depression resource (HeadsUpGuys.org) were recruited to complete an online survey. Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequency and percentages for categorical variables, were used to summarize survey responses. Regression analysis was utilised to identify factors associated with various mental health indicators (anxiety, depression, fear of COVID-19, suicidality). The Patient Health Questionnaire-4, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and item 9 (suicidality item) from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were used to assess the mental health indicators. <b>Results</b>: A total of 434 men completed the study. Most respondents (79.3%; N = 344) indicated that their mental health was negatively affected by COVID-19, and two-thirds (65.5%; N = 284) conveyed that government-imposed physical distancing measures had negatively affected their mental health. Half the sample (51.2%; N = 222) reported at least moderate financial stress due to COVID-19. Nearly a third of respondents (31.1%; N = 135) reported that their current living situation has had a considerable or severe negative impact on their mental health since COVID-19. About two-fifths (37.7%; N = 94) of men felt that COVID-19 has had a negative impact on their relationship with their intimate partner. Nearly a third of respondents who were in a relationship (30.9%; N = 77) reported that they engaged in some type of abuse (primarily verbal abuse, 22.9%; N = 57) toward their intimate partner during COVID-19, and more than a quarter (27.3%; N = 68) reported being abused by their intimate partner (also primarily verbal abuse, 22.5%; N = 56). Just under half (42.2%; N = 183) of the respondents indicated experiencing suicidal ideation. <b>Conclusion</b>: These findings can help inform providers of health services to Canadian men, as well as policies that will be implemented during subsequent waves of COVID-19 or during future infectious outbreaks.","Ogrodniczuk, Rice, Kealy, Seidler, Delara, Oliffe","https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2021.1873027","20210106","COVID-19; men; mental health; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-07","",9098,""
