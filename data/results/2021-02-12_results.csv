"The Impact of a Digital Intervention (Happify) on Loneliness During COVID-19: Qualitative Focus Group","BACKGROUND: Loneliness is a growing area of concern, attracting attention as a public health concern due to its association with a variety of psychological and physical health problems. However, interventions targeting loneliness are less common than interventions for other mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, and existing interventions focus primarily on building social skills and increasing opportunities for social interaction despite research suggesting these techniques are not the most effective. Furthermore, although there is an increasing need for scalable and convenient interventions, digital interventions for loneliness are even less common. OBJECTIVE: Using a qualitative approach, we explore how adults (18-64 years of age) who express wanting to be more connected to others experience loneliness and react to a digital mental health intervention targeting loneliness. METHODS: A total of 11 participants were recruited from a pilot randomized controlled trial exploring the impact of a digital mental health intervention, Happify Health, on loneliness among adults aged 18-64 years who indicated wanting to feel more connected to others when signing up for the platform. Participants were invited to participate in a 3-day asynchronous focus group about their experiences with loneliness, with Happify Health, and with social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. All 11 participants completed the focus group in May 2020. RESULTS: Participants' responses were coded using thematic analysis, which led to identifying five themes, each with separate subthemes, that could be applied across the 3-day focus group: loneliness, relationships, social distancing, skill acquisition, and coping. Overall, we observed variability across participants in terms of the source of their loneliness, their perceptions of their social connections, and their motivation to reduce feelings of loneliness; however, participants commonly referred to negative self-perceptions as a cause or consequence of loneliness. Participants also varied in the extent to which they felt social distancing increased or decreased feelings of loneliness. In regard to the intervention, participants showed evidence of adopting skills they used to address their loneliness, particularly mindfulness and gratitude, and then using these skills to shift toward more active coping strategies following the intervention, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity in participants' experiences with loneliness described during this focus group emphasizes the subjective and complex nature of loneliness. This highlights the importance of developing loneliness interventions that use a variety of strategies, including both direct and indirect strategies for reducing loneliness. However, based on our data, a key component to loneliness interventions is incorporating strategies for addressing underlying negative self-perceptions that stem from, but also contribute to, loneliness. This data also provides preliminary evidence that digital platforms may be an effective tool for disseminating loneliness interventions while providing the added benefit of offering a productive distraction when feeling lonely.","Boucher, Eliane M; McNaughton, Emily C; Harake, Nicole; Stafford, Julia L; Parks, Acacia C","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/26617","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(2): e26617, 2021 Feb 08.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;8(2): e26617, 2021 Feb 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10618,""
"Suitability of Video Consultations During the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown: Cross-sectional Survey Among Norwegian General Practitioners","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic imposed an acute, sharp rise in the use of video consultations (VCs) by general practitioners (GPs) in Norway. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to document GPs' experiences with the large-scale uptake of VCs in the natural experiment context of the pandemic. METHODS: A nationwide, cross-sectional online survey was conducted among Norwegian GPs during the pandemic lockdown (April 14-May 3, 2020). Each respondent was asked to evaluate up to 10 VCs. Basic demographic characteristics of the GPs and their practices were collected. The associations between GPs' perceived suitability of the VCs, the nature of the patients' main problems, prior knowledge of the patients (relational continuity), and follow-up of previously presented problems (episodic continuity) were explored using descriptive statistics, diagrams, and chi-square tests. RESULTS: In total, 1237 GPs (26% of the target group) responded to the survey. Among these, 1000 GPs offered VCs, and 855 GPs evaluated a total of 3484 VCs. Most GPs who offered VCs (1000/1237; 81%) had no experience with VCs before the pandemic. Overall, 51% (1766/3476) of the evaluated VCs were considered to have similar or even better suitability to assess the main reason for contact, compared to face-to-face consultations. In the presence of relational continuity, VCs were considered equal to or better than face-to-face consultations in 57% (1011/1785) of cases, as opposed to 32% (87/274) when the patient was unknown. The suitability rate for follow-up consultations (episodic continuity) was 61% (1165/1919), compared to 35% (544/1556) for new patient problems. Suitability varied considerably across clinical contact reasons. VCs were found most suitable for anxiety and life stress, depression, and administrative purposes, as well as for longstanding or complex problems that normally require multiple follow-up consultations. The GPs estimate that they will conduct about 20% of their consultations by video in a future, nonpandemic setting. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of VCs performed in general practice during the pandemic lockdown indicates a clear future role for VCs in nonpandemic settings. The strong and consistent association between continuity of care and GPs' perceptions of the suitability of VCs is a new and important finding with considerable relevance for future primary health care planning.","Johnsen, Tor Magne; Norberg, BÃ¸rge LÃ¸nnebakke; Kristiansen, Eli; Zanaboni, Paolo; Austad, Bjarne; Krogh, Frode Helgetun; Getz, Linn","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/26433","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(2): e26433, 2021 Feb 08.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(2): e26433, 2021 Feb 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10619,""
"Analyzing Digital Evidence From a Telemental Health Platform to Assess Complex Psychological Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Content Analysis of Text Messages","BACKGROUND: The novel COVID-19 disease has negatively impacted mortality, economic conditions, and mental health. These impacts are likely to continue after the COVID-19 pandemic ends. There are no methods for characterizing the mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, and differentiating this burden from that of the prepandemic era. Accurate illness detection methods are critical for facilitating pandemic-related treatment and preventing the worsening of symptoms. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify major themes and symptom clusters in the SMS text messages that patients send to therapists. We assessed patients who were seeking treatment for pandemic-related distress on Talkspace, which is a popular telemental health platform. METHODS: We used a machine learning algorithm to identify patients' pandemic-related concerns, based on their SMS text messages in a large, digital mental health service platform (ie, Talkspace). This platform uses natural language processing methods to analyze unstructured therapy transcript data, in parallel with brief clinical assessment methods for analyzing depression and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Our results show a significant increase in the incidence of COVID-19-related intake anxiety symptoms (P<.001), but no significant differences in the incidence of intake depression symptoms (P=.79). During our transcript analyses, we identified terms that were related to 24 symptoms outside of those included in the diagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings for Talkspace suggest that people who seek treatment during the pandemic experience more severe intake anxiety than they did before the COVID-19 outbreak. It is important to monitor the symptoms that we identified in this study and the symptoms of anxiety and depression, to fully understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.","Hull, Thomas D; Levine, Jacob; Bantilan, Niels; Desai, Angel N; Majumder, Maimuna S","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/26190","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(2): e26190, 2021 Feb 09.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;5(2): e26190, 2021 Feb 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10620,""

"A Telemedicine Buprenorphine Clinic to Serve New York City: Initial Evaluation of the NYC Public Hospital System's Initiative to Expand Treatment Access during the COVID-19 Pandemic","OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and clinical impact of telemedicine-based opioid treatment with buprenorphine-naloxone following the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: Participants included in this retrospective analysis consisted of adult New York City residents with opioid use disorder eligible for enrollment in the NYC Health+Hospitals Virtual Buprenorphine Clinic between March and May 2020 (nÃ¢<U+0080><U+008A>=Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>78). Follow-up data were comprised of rates of retention in treatment at 2 months, referrals to community treatment, and induction-related events. RESULTS: During the initial 9 weeks of clinic operations, the clinic inducted 78 patients on to buprenorphine-naloxone and completed 252 visits. Patient referrals included non-NYC Health + Hospitals (nÃ¢<U+0080><U+008A>=Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>22, 28.2%) and NYC Health + Hospitals healthcare providers (nÃ¢<U+0080><U+008A>=Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>17, 21.8%), homeless shelter staff (nÃ¢<U+0080><U+008A>=Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>13, 16.7%), and the NYC Health + Hospitals jail reentry program in Rikers Island (nÃ¢<U+0080><U+008A>=Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>11, 14.1%). At 8 weeks, 42 patients remained in care (53.8%), 21 were referred to a community treatment program (26.9%), and 15 were lost to follow-up (19.2%). No patients were terminated from care due to disruptive behavior or suspicions of diversion or misuse of Buprenorphine. Adverse clinical outcomes were uncommon and included persistent withdrawal symptoms (nÃ¢<U+0080><U+008A>=Ã¢<U+0080><U+008A>8, 4.3%) and one nonfatal opioid overdose (0.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine-based opioid treatment and unobserved home induction on buprenorphine-naloxone offers a safe and feasible approach to expand the reach of opioid use disorder treatment, primary care, and behavioral health for a highly vulnerable urban population during an unprecedented natural disaster.","Tofighi, Babak; McNeely, Jennifer; Walzer, Dalia; Fansiwala, Kush; Demner, Adam; Chaudhury, Chloe S; Subudhi, Ipsita; Schatz, Daniel; Reed, Timothy; Krawczyk, Noa","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000809","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Addict Med;2021 Feb 05.; Publication details: J Addict Med;2021 Feb 05.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10622,""
"Suspension of fertility treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic: views, emotional reactions and psychological distress among women undergoing fertility treatment","RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the views and emotional reactions of patients towards the suspension of fertility treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what are the factors affecting their psychological distress? DESIGN: A cross-sectional study conducted in an academic fertility centre. Online questionnaires were distributed between 18 April 2020 and 23 April 2020 to patients whose treatment cycle had been postponed or discontinued. The outcome measures included agreement with the reproductive society guidelines to postpone treatments; willingness to resume treatments, given the choice; patients' emotional reactions; and psychological distress level, measured by the Mental Health Inventory validated scale. A multivariate linear regression was conducted to identify factors associated with psychological distress. RESULTS: Because of the small number of male respondents, only women were included in the analysis (nÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯181). Forty-three per cent expressed disagreement with the guidelines and 82% were willing to resume treatments, given the choice. Sadness and anxiety were the most common emotional reactions expressed towards the guidelines. In the multivariate analysis, COVID-19-related anxiety (BÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯0.145, PÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯0.04) and disagreement with treatment suspension (BÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯-0.44, PÃ¢<U+0080>Â¯=Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯0.001) were found to be significantly associated with patients' psychological distress. Background characteristics of patients did not contribute significantly to their distress. CONCLUSIONS: Suspension of fertility treatment during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with patients' negative emotional reactions. Anxiety related to COVID-19 and disagreement with treatment suspension were found to be significantly associated with psychological distress among women undergoing fertility treatment, regardless of their background characteristics. Our findings suggest the need to monitor the mental health of patients and provide psychological support should a shutdown of fertility care re-occur.","Marom Haham, Lilach; Youngster, Michal; Kuperman Shani, Adi; Yee, Samantha; Ben-Kimhy, Reut; Medina-Artom, Tamar R; Hourvitz, Ariel; Kedem, Alon; Librach, Clifford","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2021.01.007","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Reprod Biomed Online;2021 Jan 19.; Publication details: Reprod Biomed Online;2021 Jan 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10623,""
"Psychological Risk Factors of Functional Impairment After COVID-19 Deaths","CONTEXT: People bereaved from COVID-19 report higher levels of grief than people bereaved from natural causes. The full impact of this onslaught of grief will not be known for some time. Ensuring high-quality bereavement care in the context of COVID-19 presents unprecedented challenges to end-of-life care. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine how psychological symptoms explain functional impairment. METHODS: A sample of people bereaved through COVID-19 (NÂ =Â 307) in the United States completed demographic questions and self-report measures of neuroticism; symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress, separation distress, and dysfunctional grief; and functional impairment due to a COVID-19 loss. RESULTS: Most participants' scores were in the clinical ranges for generalized anxiety, depression, dysfunctional grief, and functional impairment. Functional impairment scores were not associated with age, gender, and time since loss but were associated with being diagnosed with COVID-19, having received professional help with the loss, and a close relationship to the deceased. A logistic regression model showed that, after controlling for covariates, the odds of functional impairment significantly increased by 27% for higher scores in separation distress, 25% for higher scores in dysfunctional grief, and 13% for higher scores in posttraumatic stress. CONCLUSION: People bereaved because of COVID-19 are at risk of functional impairment, especially if they have symptoms of separation distress, dysfunctional grief, and/or posttraumatic stress. Attention to identifying and treating functional impairment may be important in facilitating grieving persons' full participation in social and economic life during and after the pandemic.","Breen, Lauren J; Lee, Sherman A; Neimeyer, Robert A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2021.01.006","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Pain Symptom Manage;2021 Jan 18.; Publication details: J Pain Symptom Manage;2021 Jan 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10624,""

"Going through the lockdown: a longitudinal study on the psychological consequences of the coronavirus pandemic","Coronavirus 2019 pandemic lockdown in Italy lasted for 2 months, 1 week and 2 days  During this long period, one of the longest in Europe, the restrictions produced effects on people's psychological well-being, with consequences that also continued after lockdown  The purpose of the study is to investigate these effects and how they changed in the general population over a period of time  We are also interested in exploring people's post-lockdown anxiety and concerns  We conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques  The longitudinal study consisted of four administrations covering a period of 10 weeks between April (baseline) and June (last follow-up)  Levels of anxiety and depression were assessed by GAD-7 and PHQ-9, coping strategies were assessed by Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) and social support was assessed by MSPSS  Post-lockdown anxiety was explored by developing a set of ad-hoc questions  PCA was used to determine the principal categories of post-lockdown anxiety/concern resulting from the ad-hoc questions  Longitudinal data, given their nested structure, were analyzed through mixed modeling  Of the 411 responders at baseline, 169 had at least 3 out of 4 data points;the analysis was therefore conducted on this sample  Levels of depression and anxiety were found to be significantly higher in the study sample in comparison with normative samples for each of the four-time points;levels of coping showed that scores from the study sample were significantly lower than normative data at all-time points  Levels of perceived social support were significantly lower than normative data at the baseline and the first follow-up  The results of the study suggest that the lockdown experience had enduring consequences on the mental health of individuals  Prevention and support interventions to limit the psychological distress caused by COVID-19 should be taken into consideration in countries experiencing a second wave of the pandemic","Gullo, S.; Misici, I.; Teti, A.; Liuzzi, M.; Chiara, E.","https://doi.org/10.4081/ripppo.2020.494","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Research in Psychotherapy-Psychopathology Process and Outcome;23(3):211-221, 2020.; Publication details: Research in Psychotherapy-Psychopathology Process and Outcome;23(3):211-221, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10632,""

"Fear and anxiety in patients with multiple sclerosis during COVID-19 pandemic; report of an Iranian population","There are reports that stress-related disorders are increasing during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are at higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders, which result in worsening of their disability. There are concerns about the mental health of MS patients during this pandemic. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and levels of fear about Corona in MS patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a cross-sectional study on MS patients who were admitted to the MS clinics affiliated with Isfahan University of medical sciences from May to June 2020. Anxiety and depression were evaluated according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The Corona Fear Questionnaire developed by Ahorsu etÃ‚Â al. was applied to evaluate the state of fear about COVID-19. Chi-square tests were used to compare depression and anxiety between different groups, Kruskal-Wallis was used for fear scores, Spearman correlation coefficient was also reported for correlations. 410 MS patients with a mean age of 38.6 years (Ã‚Â±10.35) were enrolled in the study. Among those patients who answered the HADS questionnaire completely (n=399, n=388, for anxiety and depression subscales respectively) the prevalence of anxiety and depression were 31.2% (n=128) and 39.3% (n=161), respectively. There was no significant relationship between anxiety and depression with any of the following variables: sex, marital status, history of drug abuse, smoking, duration of taking psychiatric medication, being tested for COVID-19, being quarantined. Regarding fear about COVID-19, patients with depression or anxiety showed higher scores on the fear questionnaire (p-value=0.03, p-value=0.008 respectively). The prevalence of anxiety and depression in MS patients was higher than previously reported. Fear about COVID-19 was correlated with anxiety and depression. Multicenter studies are required to develop specific recommendations for screening mental health problems in MS patients during COVID pandemic.","Ramezani, Ashtari, Bastami, Ghaderi, Hosseini, Naeini, Rajabi, Adibi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2021.102798","20210211","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Fear about COVID-19; Multiple Sclerosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10645,""

This prospective study aimed to investigate whether general psychopathology and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity increased during the pandemic as compared to prepandemic baseline data collected approximately 1 year earlier. Furthermore, we investigated whether an increase in symptomatology was linked to CTEs and mediated by a lack of perceived social support and fear of COVID-19. An online survey was administered to 85 individuals, including both participants with PTSD, major depression, or somatic symptom disorder (n = 63) and healthy volunteers (n = 22), during a period of the most severe social restrictions in Germany. The survey included the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Brief Symptom Inventory, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, ENRICHD Social Support Inventory, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale. In the whole sample, we found significant increases in general psychopathology and PTSD symptom severity, Ãâ€°<sup>2</sup> = .07-.08, during as compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic, with CTEs predicting increased PTSD symptom severity, ÃŽÂ² = .245, p = .042.

All the countries used the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to measure mental health. There were 4479 Asians completed the questionnaire with demographic characteristics, physical symptoms and health service utilization, contact history, knowledge and concern, precautionary measure, and rated their mental health with the IES-R and DASS-21. Descriptive statistics, One-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and linear regression were used to identify protective and risk factors associated with mental health parameters. There were significant differences in IES-R and DASS-21 scores between 7 MICs (p&lt;0.05). Thailand had all the highest scores of IES-R, DASS-21 stress, anxiety, and depression scores whereas Vietnam had all the lowest scores. The risk factors for adverse mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic include age &lt;30 years, high education background, single and separated status, discrimination by other countries and contact with people with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.05). The protective factors for mental health include male gender, staying with children or more than 6 people in the same household, employment, confidence in doctors, high perceived likelihood of survival, and spending less time on health information (p&lt;0.05).

At the onset of the pandemic, average steps decline from 10,000 to 4,600 steps per day, sleep increases by 25 to 30 min per night, time spent socializing declines by over half to less than 30 min, and screen time more than doubles to over 5 h per day. Over the course of the pandemic from March to July 2020 the proportion of participants at risk for clinical depression ranges from 46% to 61%, up to a 90% increase in depression rates compared to the same population just prior to the pandemic. Our analyses suggest that disruption to physical activity is a leading risk factor for depression during the pandemic. However, restoration of those habits through a short-term intervention does not meaningfully improve mental well-being.","Giuntella, Hyde, Saccardo, Sadoff","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2016632118","20210211","COVID-19; lifestyle disruptions; mental health; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10648,""

"Preventing Clinician Suicide: A Call to Action During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond","In this Invited Commentary, the authors offer a call to action in the longstanding fight to prevent clinicians from dying by suicide. In April 2020, the nation was shocked by the death by suicide of New York City emergency physician Dr. Lorna Breen, who died while recovering from COVID-19. She joins an unknown number of clinicians who have taken their lives over the past year. The authors introduce Dr. Breen, a highly talented physician working on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, and examine how pervasive distress and suicide are in clinicians. Then they explain the lived experience movement and highlight how clinicians speaking openly about their mental illness and treatment are making it easier for their colleagues to seek lifesaving help, despite the stigma still surrounding mental illness and treatment in medicine. The authors sort through the science of clinician distress, critique how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the lives of clinicians, and describe existing national initiatives to address clinician stress, burnout, and suicide. Finally, they recommend evidence-based actions to prevent clinician suicide that multiple stakeholder groups can take, including regulatory agencies, licensing boards, and hospital privileging boards; specialty boards, professional associations, and continuing education organizations; medical educators; and individual clinicians. Suicide is a complex but generally preventable cause of death. Those in medicine must forge ahead with collective momentum. Dr. Breen, so many other clinicians, and those they have left behind deserve nothing less.","Moutier, Myers, Feist, Feist, Zisook","https://doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000003972","20210211","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10650,""
"The 'Wish to Die' in later life: prevalence, longitudinal course and mortality Data from TILDA","'Wish to Die' (WTD) involves thoughts of or wishes for one's own death or that one would be better off dead. To examine the prevalence, longitudinal course and mortality-risk of WTD in community-dwelling older people. Observational study with 6-year follow-up. The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a nationally representative cohort of older adults. In total, 8,174 community-dwelling adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥50Ã‚Â years. To define WTD, participants were asked: 'In the last month, have you felt that you would rather be dead?' Depressive symptoms were measured using the CES-D. Mortality data were compiled by linking administrative death records to individual-level survey data from the study. At Wave 1, 3.5% of participants (279/8,174) reported WTD. Both persistent loneliness (OR 5.73 (95% CI 3.41-9.64)) and depressive symptoms (OR 6.12 (95% CI 4.33-8.67)) were independently associated with WTD.Of participants who first reported WTD at Wave 1 or 2, 72% did not report WTD when reassessed after 2Ã‚Â years, and the prevalence of depressive symptoms (-44%) and loneliness (-19%) was more likely to decline in this group at follow-up.Fifteen per cent of participants expressing WTD at Wave 1 died during a 6-year follow-up. WTD amongst community-dwelling older people is frequently transient and is strongly linked with the course of depressive symptoms and loneliness. An enhanced focus on improving access to mental health care and addressing social isolation in older people should therefore be a public health priority, particularly in the current context of the Covid-19 pandemic.","Briggs, Ward, Kenny","https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab010","20210211","Death Ideation; Depression; Loneliness; Older people; Social Isolation; Wish to Die","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10651,""
"Problematic internet-related behaviors mediate the associations between levels of internet engagement and distress among schoolchildren during COVID-19 lockdown: A longitudinal structural equation modeling study","Due to the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), policies based on the nature of &quot;spatial distancing&quot; have been implemented and have resulted in school suspensions and online learning among schoolchildren. In order to examine the impact of such policies on schoolchildren, the aims of the present study were to (i) assess changes in the level of engagement in three internet-related activities (smartphone use, social media use, and gaming) before and during the COVID-19 outbreak, including prolonged and problematic engagement in these activities; (ii) investigate the differences of psychological distress before and after COVID-19 outbreak; and (iii) to use structural equation modeling to investigate the mediating roles of problematic internet-related behaviors in the causal relationships of psychological distress and time spent on internet-related activities. Self-report measures were used to assess internet-related activities and psychological distress. Time spent on internet-related activities, problematic use of internet-related activities, and psychological distress were collected from primary school students (N = 535; 265 boys; M age = 10.32 years [SD = 0.84]). The data were first collected before the COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., early November 2019) and then collected again during the school suspension due to COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., end of March 2020) for comparisons of changes. Schoolchildren spent significantly more time on the smartphone (increased 1.02 h daily; P &lt; 0.001) and social media (increased 0.73 h daily; P &lt; 0.001) but not gaming (increased 0.14 h daily; P = 0.07) during the school suspension compared to the baseline. Schoolchildren who increased by 15 or 30 min daily on internet-related activities showed an increased level of psychological distress. The association between problematic use of social media and psychological distress was stronger during the school suspension (ÃŽÂ² = 0.584) than at the baseline (ÃŽÂ² = 0.451; P &lt; 0.001). Increased problematic use of internet-related activities among schoolchildren was associated with greater psychological distress. Parents should therefore monitor internet-related activities and psychological distress of their children to support their mental health.","Chen, Chen, Pakpour, Griffiths, Lin, Li, Tsang","https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2021.00006","20210211","COVID-19; child; problematic internet use; psychological distress; school suspension","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10652,""
"Intentions to Seek Mental Health Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Chinese Pregnant Women With Probable Depression or Anxiety: Cross-sectional, Web-Based Survey Study","Mental health problems are prevalent among pregnant women, and it is expected that their mental health will worsen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the underutilization of mental health services among pregnant women has been widely documented. We aimed to identify factors that are associated with pregnant women's intentions to seek mental health services. We specifically assessed pregnant women who were at risk of mental health problems in mainland China. A web-based survey was conducted from February to March, 2020 among 19,515 pregnant women who were recruited from maternal health care centers across various regions of China. A subsample of 6248 pregnant women with probable depression (ie, those with a score of Ã¢â€°Â¥10 on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) or anxiety (ie, those with a score of Ã¢â€°Â¥5 on the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder Scale) was included in our analysis. More than half (3292/6248, 52.7%) of the participants reported that they did not need mental health services. Furthermore, 28.3% (1770/6248) of participants felt that they needed mental health services, but had no intentions of seeking help, and only 19% (1186/6248) felt that they needed mental health services and had intentions of seek help. The results from our multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, education level, and gestational age were factors of not seeking help. However, COVID-19-related lockdowns in participants' cities of residence, social support during the COVID-19 pandemic, and trust in health care providers were protective factors of participants' intentions to seek help from mental health services. Interventions that promote seeking help for mental health problems among pregnant women should also promote social support from health care providers and trust between pregnant women and their care providers.","Wang, Song, Di, Yang, Wu, Lau, Xin, Wang, Mo","https://doi.org/10.2196/24162","20210211","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; help-seeking; intention; mental health; mental health services; pregnancy; pregnant women; social support; survey; trust","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10653,""

"A longitudinal study on the COVID-19 pandemic and its divergent effects on social participation and mental health across different study groups with and without mental disorders","With the rapid spread of COVID-19 and the restrictions imposed in many parts of the world, there is growing concern about its impact on mental health. This longitudinal study investigated the social participation, social inclusion and psychological well-being in adults with and without mental disorders before the beginning of the pandemic, as well as during and after strict lockdown restrictions in Germany. The sample (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°106) consisted of three groups: participants with a chronic mental disorder, with an acute mental disorder, and without a mental disorder at the time of the initial survey. Parameters of interest were assessed using the Measure of Participation and Social Inclusion for Use in People with a Chronic Mental Disorder (F-INK), the Index for the Assessment of Health Impairments (IMET) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18). The perceived impairments in social participation and the associated changes in behaviour varied depending on the presence of a mental disorder at the time of the initial survey and were largely temporary, i.e. limited to the period of strict lockdown restrictions. We found no further detrimental effects on mental health 4 weeks after lockdown or later, when a policy of physical distancing was in place. Overall, our findings suggest a general resilience to the official restrictions and measures as well as the pandemic itself. However, further efforts are needed to improve the situation of people with chronic mental disorders and their limited opportunities for social participation.","Mergel, SchÃƒÂ¼tzwohl","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-021-02025-9","20210211","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mental disorder; Mental health; Psychological well-being; Social participation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10655,""
"A Mixed-Method Study on COVID-19 Prevention in Iranian Restaurants","<b>Background:</b> In the face of the COVID-19, as a public health emergency, the restaurant industry is struggling to organize itself. The aim of this study is to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practice and also the perceptions of restaurants' customers and managers toward COVID-19 prevention. <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional study was conducted using the mixed-method approach. Two online questionnaires were undertaken through WhatsApp Messenger among the 210 customers and 50 managers of restaurants. Multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to identify the predictors of knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 prevention. Then semi-structured, in-depth phone interviews were conducted with 45 subjects to identify their perceptions about the restaurant industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Results:</b> The majority of customers had moderate knowledge (72.4%), positive attitude (90.5%), and desirable practice (38.6%); whereas the majority of managers had sufficient knowledge (50%), negative attitude (82%), and acceptable practice (58%) toward the prevention of COVID-19 in restaurants. Multiple linear regression analysis showed with increasing each 10 years in the age of the customers, the practice score significantly decreased (Beta = -0.155, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, qualitative results revealed three categories (1. restaurant industry, 2. social media, and 3. government) in 9 themes with 32 sub-themes which were explored based on the perception of the participants toward COVID-19 prevention in restaurants. <b>Conclusion:</b> The majority of restaurant customers and managers have sufficient knowledge and acceptable practice, but a positive attitude among customers and a negative attitude among managers about the prevention of COVID-19 were shown. There is an urgent need to understand public awareness about preventing COVID-19 in restaurants at these critical moments. The results seek to provide strategies for the policymakers and restaurant industry to plan the specific educational intervention about how to manage future crises and public health improvement.","Mohammadi-Nasrabadi, Salmani, Broumandnia, Esfarjani","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.585290","20210211","Covid-19 prevention; customers; managers; public health; restaurants","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10656,""
"Gambling in COVID-19 Lockdown in the UK: Depression, Stress, and Anxiety","To combat the spread of COVID-19, the UK Government implemented a range of &quot;lockdown&quot; measures.

To understand the impact of lockdown on gamblers, in April 2020, after ~6 weeks of lockdown, participants (<i>N</i> = 1,028, 72% female) completed an online questionnaire. Gambling engagement data was collected for pre-lockdown via the Brief Problem Gambling Screen (BPGS) allowing participants to be classified as Non-Gamblers (NG), Non-Problem Gamblers (NPG) or Potential Problem Gamblers (PPG). The Depression, Stress, and Anxiety Scale (DASS21) was used to measure depression, stress, and anxiety scores both pre- and during-lockdown. Results indicate that depression, stress and anxiety has increased across the whole sample. Participants classified in the PPG group reported higher scores on each sub scale at both baseline and during lockdown. Increases were observed on each DASS21 subscale, for each gambler group, however despite variable significance and effect sizes, the magnitude of increases did not differ between groups. Lockdown has had a significant impact on mental health of participants; whilst depression stress and anxiety remain highest in potential problem gamblers, pre-lockdown gambler status did not affect changes in DASS21 scores.","Sharman, Roberts, Bowden-Jones, Strang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.621497","20210211","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; disordered gambling; gambling; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10657,""

"Experiences and management of physician psychological symptoms during infectious disease outbreaks: a rapid review","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians experienced unprecedented levels of burnout. The uncertainty of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic along with increased workload and difficult medical triage decisions may lead to a further decline in physician psychological health. We searched Medline, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for primary research from database inception (Medline [1946], EMBASE [1974], PsycINFO [1806]) to November 17, 2020. Titles and abstracts were screened by one of three reviewers and full-text article screening and data abstraction were conducted independently, and in duplicate, by three reviewers. From 6223 unique citations, 480 articles were reviewed in full-text, with 193 studies (of 90,499 physicians) included in the final review. Studies reported on physician psychological symptoms and management during seven infectious disease outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], three strains of Influenza A virus [H1N1, H5N1, H7N9], Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS], and COVID-19) in 57 countries. Psychological symptoms of anxiety (14.3-92.3%), stress (11.9-93.7%), depression (17-80.5%), post-traumatic stress disorder (13.2-75.2%) and burnout (14.7-76%) were commonly reported among physicians, regardless of infectious disease outbreak or country. Younger, female (vs. male), single (vs. married), early career physicians, and those providing direct care to infected patients were associated with worse psychological symptoms. Physicians should be aware that psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression, fear and distress are common, manifest differently and self-management strategies to improve psychological well-being exist.

Participants from 3 adult cohorts in the general population in France were invited to participate in a survey on COVID-19. The main outcome was COVID-19-Like Symptoms (CLS), defined as a sudden onset of cough, fever, dyspnea, ageusia and/or anosmia, that lasted more than 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°days and occurred during the 17Ã¢â‚¬â€°days before the survey.

"Risk Factors for Potential Mental Illness Among Brazilians in Quarantine Due To COVID-19","During quarantine, both physical and mental health are a concern. To the same extent that physicians are a scarce resource during this crisis, psychiatrists and psychologists are also limited in number. To help practitioners and public managers decide where to invest their resources, the present research investigated the relationships of stress, depression and state anxiety levels with sociodemographic and behavioural variables. Data were collected in Brazil between March, 18 and 22, 2020 in 1,468 volunteers during quarantine. Participants with a history of or current mental health illnesses were excluded leaving 1,460 individuals in the final sample. The online assessment included instruments for psychological stress, depression and state anxiety. A sociodemographic and behavioural questionnaire with 15 items was used to assess other factors. Multiple linear regression was performed for each psychological outcome to determine a hierarchy of significant predictors. Stress, depression and state anxiety levels were all predicted by gender (women higher than men), quality of nutrition, attendance in tele-psychotherapy, exercise frequency, presence of elderly persons in quarantine with the person, obligation to work outside the home, level of education (more educated, lesser risk for mental illness) and age (younger age, greater risk). Having a perceived risk factor for COVID-19 predicted depression and state anxiety, but not stress. Finally, the presence of children in quarantine with the participant was a protective factor for depression. Even though this research is limited by its cross-sectional design, it is possible to infer that mental health varies by demographic attributes, obligations and health behaviours. Those who report higher distress must work outside the home during quarantine, live with an elderly person and carry a risk factor for COVID-19, among other factors. Identifying those who are most vulnerable would help to prioritize those who may need the greatest psychological aid and assist public health practitioners in developing support strategies.","Filgueiras, Stults-Kolehmainen","https://doi.org/10.1177/0033294120976628","20210211","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; mental health; psychology; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10663,""

"A real-world ten-week follow-up of the COVID outbreak in an outpatient drug clinic in Salamanca (Spain)","Objective To compare over ten weeks the number of relapses, hospital admissions, calls made, admissions to therapeutic communities, face-to-face visits, treatment adjustment, number of injectables administered, and number of emergencies attended due to emotional and behavioral alterations and/or substance use disorder, and to describe and quantify social emergencies in an outpatient drug clinic (ODC) in Salamanca (Spain) from March 16, 2020, to May 22, 2020. Methods This is an ecological study of the COVID pandemic over ten weeks. The study examines the set of alcohol or other drug-dependent or dual disorder patients in the population of Salamanca, Spain. The measurements were: professionals; calls made; percentage of successful calls; face-to-face visits; first visits made; reviews made; techniques; injectable treatments; other treatments; evolution; relapses. The ODC includes about 375 new patients each year and another 650 other patients annually. Results The study found the number of relapses to be greater in the last five weeks of the 10-week study period. Patients' psychopathological instability also increased, and face-to-face visits were necessary. The most frequent psychopathology that required face-to-face intervention was depressive disorder. The number of interventions with patients increased. In parallel, social workers' efforts were greater after the seventh week. There was a decrease in response to calls. Throughout this time, the ODC attended to patients who needed to be treated for the first time. Conclusions Confinement due to the coronavirus pandemic generated maladaptive emotional responses and other behaviors, such as excessive alcohol consumption. The number of face-to-face consultations, admissions, and referrals to therapeutic communities increased. Patients under stress and in social isolation resorted more often to substance use. The ODC had to adopt a flexible approach to evaluate patients with more serious problems, by using face-to-face assessments.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108303","20210601","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10666,""
"Characterization and impact assessment of super cyclonic storm AMPHAN in the Indian subcontinent through space borne observations","Tropical cyclones can cause extensive damage in coastal regions as a result of high winds, storm tide, and intense rainfall. The West Bengal state in India was severely affected by a recent cyclonic storm 'Amphan' a 'super cyclone'with a high wind speed of above 220Â km/h. The present study aimed to assess the impact of the cyclone Amphan in the potential impact zone covering the two states of India (Odisha and West Bengal) and the west coast of Bangladesh. The present study analyzed the land use land cover, rainfall variability, and potential storm surge along the cyclone track to assess the possible impact on the coastal landscape as well as community. The cyclone Amphan was formed in the Northern Indian Ocean near Equatorial Easterly wave over south Andaman Sea and adjoiningsoutheast Bay of Bengal (BoB) at 10Â° N 87Â° E on 16 May 2020 as deep depression and moved toward the north direction and had land fall at the coast of West Bengal on 20 May 2020 as an extremely severe cyclonic storm with the wind speed 155Â km/h and central pressure of 960hpa.The cyclone devastated the coastal districts of West Bengal due to the high intensity of precipitation along with the extreme storm surge. About 100 people lost their lives and ~20 million people severely affected in West Bengal alone. Within the West Bengal state, around 7877 sq km area was observed under the potential storm surge zone. Cropland was observed as the most surge affected land cover with 5191 sq km area (65.9%), followed by wetlands (1635.2 sq km (20.75%) along with 38.34 sq km (0.48%)) of built up land under the potential surge impact zone The cyclone more severely affected the west Medinapur and South 24 Parganas, which were also the most affected by COVID-19 which resulted in slow evacuation, delay in medical support and concomitant increase in loss of life. The present study provided near real time cyclone hazard and risk assessment to help in prioritization of coastal mitigation and planning.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105532","20210501","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10667,""

"Moral Injury and Light Triad traits: anxiety and depression in health-care personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, health workers are facing morally challenging, stressful, and life-threatening decisions while working with limited human and medical resources. The purpose of the current study was to determine the influence of Moral Injury and Light Triad (LT) personality traits on anxiety and depression symptoms of health-care personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. A quantitative, cross-sectional research design was used, the study included a sample of 169 health-care workers. Data was gathered through the Moral Injury Symptom Scale for Health Professionals (MISS-HP), Light Triad Scale (LTS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder- 7 (GAD-7), and the Patient-Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Results suggest that almost 9 out of 10 respondents experienced at least one potentially morally injurious event, 45.6% were at significant risk of impairment related to Moral Injury. Working with limited staff and resources, and the implications of it, were among the most common potentially morally injurious situations reported by the respondents. Results suggest that MISS-HP Mistrust subscale has significant negative correlations with Light Triad traits. A hierarchical regression model determined that Moral Injury, but not Light Triad traits, significantly affected depression symptoms. The overall model accounted for 42.6% of the variance in depression scores. On the other hand, anxiety symptoms were significantly predicted by Moral Injury, as did LTS-Humanism. The model accounted for 38.2% of the variance in anxiety scores. Control variables included respondentsâ€™ sex, years of experience, profession, and prior COVID-19 diagnosis. The results were discussed according to their implications to public health.","Elizabeth Andino RodrÃ­guez et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BB-31D-6C3","20210212","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; moral injury; health-care workers; light triad; covid-19; anxiety; depression","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-12","",10671,""
