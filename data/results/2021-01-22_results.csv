"The psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 4,378 UK healthcare workers and ancillary staff: initial baseline data from a cohort study collected during the first wave of the pandemic","Objectives This study reports preliminary findings on the prevalence of, and factors associated with, mental health and wellbeing outcomes of healthcare workers during the early months (April-June) of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Methods Preliminary cross-sectional data were analysed from a cohort study (n=4,378). Clinical and non-clinical staff of three London-based NHS Trusts (UK), including acute and mental health Trusts, took part in an online baseline survey. The primary outcome measure used is the presence of probable common mental disorders (CMDs), measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Secondary outcomes are probable anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (PCL-6), suicidal ideation (CIS-R), and alcohol use (AUDIT). Moral injury is measured using the Moray Injury Event Scale (MIES). Results Analyses showed substantial levels of CMDs (58.9%, 95%CI 58.1 to 60.8), and of PTSD (30.2%, 95%CI 28.1 to 32.5) with lower levels of depression (27.3%, 95%CI 25.3 to 29.4), anxiety (23.2%, 95%CI 21.3 to 25.3), and alcohol misuse (10.5%, 95%CI, 9.2 to 11.9). Women, younger staff, and nurses tended to have poorer outcomes than other staff, except for alcohol misuse. Higher reported exposure to moral injury (distress resulting from violation of one's moral code) was strongly associated with increased levels of CMDs, anxiety, depression, PTSD symptoms, and alcohol misuse. Conclusions Our findings suggest that mental health support for healthcare workers should consider those demographics and occupations at highest risk. Rigorous longitudinal data are needed in order to respond to the potential long-term mental health impacts of the pandemic.","Danielle Lamb; Sam Gnanapragasam; Neil Greenberg; Rupa Bhundia; Ewan Carr; Matthew Hotopf; Reza Razavi; Rosalind Raine; Sean Cross; Amy Dewar; Mary Docherty; Sarah Dorrington; Stephani Hatch; Charlotte Wilson-Jones; Daniel Leightley; Ira Madan; Sally Marlow; Isabel McMullen; Anne Marie Rafferty; Martin Parsons; Catherine Polling; Danai Serfioti; Helen Gaunt; Peter Aitken; Joanna Morris-Bone; Chloe Simela; Veronica French; Rachel Harris; Sharon A.M.

"Symptoms of anxiety and depression in relation to work patterns during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Philadelphia PA: a cross-sectional survey","Objective: We investigated whether patterns of work during COVID-19 pandemic altered by effort to contain the outbreak affected anxiety and depression. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of 911 residents of Philadelphia, inquiring about their working lives during early months of the epidemic, symptoms of anxiety and depression, plus demographics, perceived sources of support, and general health. Results: Occupational contact with suspected COVID-19 cases was associated with anxiety. Concerns about return to work, childcare, lack of sick leave, and loss/reduction in work correlated with anxiety and depression, even when there was no evidence of occupational contact with infected persons; patterns differed by gender. Conclusions: Heightened anxiety and depression during COVID-19 pandemic can be due to widespread disruption of working lives, especially in non-essential low-income industries, on par with experience in healthcare.","Igor Burstyn; Tran Huynh","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250117","20210122","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-22","",9725,""
"Exploring support needs of people living with diabetes during the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic: insights from a UK survey","Background The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic has radically compromised healthcare for people living with chronic conditions such as diabetes. Government-imposed restrictions to contain the spread of the virus has forced people to suddenly adjust their lifestyle. This study aimed to capture the impact of the pandemic on people living with diabetes and the views of these individuals on ways in which the information, advice and support they are receiving could be improved. Research design and methods An online anonymous survey was distributed across the UK during the first lockdown and initial easing. The survey comprised questions about confidence in diabetes self-management, resources used to obtain information, advice and support, and opinions on how these could be improved. Open-ended captured subjective experiences. Results The survey was completed by 773 adults living with diabetes (69.2% type 1, 28.5% type 2). There was notable variability in the impact of the pandemic on confidence in self-management, with confidence having deteriorated most commonly in the ability to take care of own mental wellbeing (37.0% respondents) and improved most commonly in maintaining a healthy weight (21.1% respondents). 41.2% of respondents living alone reported not receiving any outside support. The quality of information, advice and support received from the healthcare team was rated poorly by 37.2%. Respondents sought greater communication and tailored advice from their care team, clear and consistent information from the government and news channels, and improved understanding of diabetes and its challenges from their personal networks and employers. Conclusion Adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic has strained the mental health and wellbeing of people living with diabetes. Diabetes care teams must receive assistance to support these individuals without risking further inequalities in access to healthcare. Equipping personal networks and employers with knowledge on diabetes and skills to support self-management may reduce the burden on the NHS.","Sarah Sauchelli; Julia Bradley; Clare England; Aidan Searle; Alex Whitmarsh","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.20.21249888","20210122","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-22","",9726,""
"Longitudinal trends and risk factors for depressed mood among Canadian adults during the first wave of COVID-19","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised serious concerns about the mental health impact of people directed and indirectly affected by the virus. Because this is a rapidly evolving situation, our goal was to explore potential risk factors and trends in feelings of anxiety and depression among the general population in Canada over the first five months of the pandemic. Methods: We completed on-line surveys of 3,127 unique individuals representative of the Canadian general population at 4 discreet periods every 6 weeks from April 15th to July 28th 2020. We assessed feelings of anxiety, depression and loss of interest with the interRAI self-reported mood scale using a multivariable generalized estimating equation model to examine factors associated with having a 5+ score on the scale (indicating potentially depressed mood). We also investigated potential longitudinal trends to examine temporal changes in mood scores. Results: More than 30% of participants felt highly anxious, depressed, and disinterested in everyday activities in the first survey (April), but this number decreased to about 20% over 4 months. Feeling lonely, younger age, feeling overwhelmed by one's health needs, having financial concerns, and living outside of Quebec were significantly associated with depressed mood. Interpretation: The prevalence of depressed mood during the pandemic was between 2 and 3 times the pre-pandemic rate (especially among young people), but it can change rapidly in response to social changes. Thus, monitoring of psychological distress among vulnerable groups that may benefit from additional supports should be a priority.","Gustavo Betini; John Hirdes; Rheda Adekpedjou; Chris Perlman; Nathan Huculak; Paul Hebert","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.20245795","20210122","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-22","",9727,""
"Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine for the Prevention or Treatment of COVID-19 in Africa: Caution for Inappropriate Off-label Use in Healthcare Settings","Abstract: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 pandemic has spread to Africa, where nearly all countries have reported laboratory-confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  Although there are ongoing clinical trials of repurposed and investigational antiviral and immune-based therapies, there are as yet no scientifically proven, clinically effective pharmacological treatments for COVID-19  Among the repurposed drugs, the commonly used antimalarials chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have become the focus of global scientific, media, and political attention despite a lack of randomized clinical trials supporting their efficacy  Chloroquine has been used worldwide for about 75 years and is listed by the WHO as an essential medicine to treat malaria  Hydroxychloroquine is mainly used as a therapy for autoimmune diseases  However, the efficacy and safety of CQ/HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 remains to be defined  Indiscriminate promotion and widespread use of CQ/HCQ have led to extensive shortages, self-treatment, and fatal overdoses  Shortages and increased market prices leave all countries vulnerable to substandard and falsified medical products, and safety issues are especially concerning for Africa because of its healthcare system limitations  Much needed in Africa is a cross-continental collaborative network for coordinated production, distribution, and post-marketing surveillance aligned to low-cost distribution of any approved COVID-19 drug;this would ideally be piggybacked on existing global aid efforts  Meanwhile, African countries should strongly consider implementing prescription monitoring schemes to ensure that any off-label CQ/HCQ use is appropriate and beneficial during this pandemic","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Chloroquine+and+Hydroxychloroquine+for+the+Prevention+or+Treatment+of+COVID-19+in+Africa:+Caution+for+Inappropriate+Off-label+Use+in+Healthcare+Settings","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene;102(6):1184-1188, 2020.; Publication details: American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene;102(6):1184-1188, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-22","",9728,""

"Reports of Forgone Medical Care Among US Adults During the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major disruptions in the US health care system. To estimate frequency of and reasons for reported forgone medical care from March to mid-July 2020 and examine characteristics of US adults who reported forgoing care. This survey study used data from the second wave of the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Civic Life and Public Health Survey, fielded from July 7 to July 22, 2020. Respondents included a national sample of 1337 individuals aged 18 years or older in the US who were part of National Opinion Research Center's AmeriSpeak Panel. The initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, defined as from March to mid-July 2020. The primary outcomes were missed doses of prescription medications; forgone preventive and other general medical care, mental health care, and elective surgeries; forgone care for new severe health issues; and reasons for forgoing care. Of 1468 individuals who completed wave 1 of the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Civic Life and Public Health Survey (70.4% completion rate), 1337 completed wave 2 (91.1% completion rate). The sample of respondents included 691 (52%) women, 840 non-Hispanic White individuals (63%), 160 non-Hispanic Black individuals (12%), and 223 Hispanic individuals (17%). The mean (SE) age of respondents was 48 (0.78) years. A total of 544 respondents (41%) forwent medical care from March through mid-July 2020. Among 1055 individuals (79%) who reported needing care, 544 (52%) reported forgoing care for any reason, 307 (29%) forwent care owing to fear of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, and 75 (7%) forwent care owing to financial concerns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents who were unemployed, compared with those who were employed, forwent care more often (121 of 186 respondents [65%] vs 251 of 503 respondents [50%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) and were more likely to attribute forgone care to fear of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (78 of 186 respondents [42%] vs 120 of 503 respondents [24%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.002) and financial concerns (36 of 186 respondents [20%] vs 28 of 503 respondents [6%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Respondents lacking health insurance were more likely to attribute forgone care to financial concerns than respondents with Medicare or commercial coverage (19 of 88 respondents [22%] vs 32 of 768 respondents [4%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Frequency of and reasons for forgone care differed in some instances by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and health status. This survey study found a high frequency of forgone care among US adults from March to mid-July 2020. Policies to improve health care affordability and to reassure individuals that they can safely seek care may be necessary with surging COVID-19 case rates.","Anderson, McGinty, Presskreischer, Barry","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.34882","20210121","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-22","",9756,""

"Approaches to assessing the impact of robotics in geriatric mental health care: a scoping review","The goals of this scoping literature review are to (1) aggregate the current research involving socially assistive robots in the setting of geriatric psychiatry and (2) examine the outcome measures used in these studies and determine where the gaps and needs are. In light of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the geriatric psychiatric population in particular is vulnerable to both the physical and mental toll COVID-19 may cause. Recently, socially assistive robots have gained attention for their ability to aid in the care of the geriatric psychiatry population and are being explored as a realistic way to deliver certain elements of psychiatric care that have the potential to be safe even in the setting of COVID-19. The results of this review indicate that robots are in the early stages of clinical applicability, they display usability for a range of psychiatric indications, and their impact on clinical care is notable. We project that in the next few years, robotic applications will be tailored to address clinical outcomes with a greater degree of precision and efficacy.","Kulpa, Rahman, Vahia","https://doi.org/10.1080/09540261.2020.1839391","20210121","Robotics; geriatrics; mental health; scoping review; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-22","",9760,""
"The effect of national public health interventions for COVID-19 on emergency general surgery in Northland, New Zealand","The New Zealand government instituted escalating public health interventions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. There was concern this would affect health seeking behaviour leading to delayed presentation and worse outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of these interventions on rate and severity of acute general surgical admissions in Northland, New Zealand. A retrospective comparative cohort study was performed. Two cohorts were identified: 28 February to 8 June 2020 and same period in 2019. Data for surgical admissions and operations and emergency department (ED) presentation were obtained from the hospital data warehouse. Three index diagnoses were assessed for severity. There were 650 acute general surgical admissions in 2019 and 627 in 2020 (P 0.353). Operations were performed in 226 and 224 patients respectively (P 0.829). ED presentations decreased from 11Ã¢â‚¬â€°398 to 8743 (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). No difference in severity of acute appendicitis (P 0.970), acute diverticulitis (P 0.333) or acute pancreatitis (P 0.803) was detected. Median length-of-stay, 30-day mortality and admission diagnosis were comparable. Despite a significant reduction in ED presentations, interventions for COVID-19 did not result in a difference in the rate or severity of acute general surgical admissions.","McGuinness, Harmston","https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.16562","20210121","COVID-19; acute general surgery; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-22","",9761,""
"Mental health status of pregnant and breastfeeding women during the COVID-19 pandemic - a multinational cross-sectional study","Evidence on perinatal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential determinants is limited. Therefore, this multinational study aimed to assess the mental health status of pregnant and breastfeeding women during the pandemic, and to explore potential associations between depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress, and women's socio-demographic, health and reproductive characteristics. A cross-sectional, web-based study was performed in Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the UK between 16 June and 14 July 2020. Pregnant and breastfeeding women up to three months postpartum who were older than 18 years were eligible. The online, anonymous survey was promoted via social media and hospital websites. The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were used to assess mental health status. Regression model analysis was used to identify factors associated with poor mental health status. In total, 9041 women participated (including 3907 pregnant and 5134 breastfeeding women). The prevalence of major depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Depression Scale Ã¢â€°Â¥13) was 15% and 13% in the pregnancy and breastfeeding cohort, respectively. Moderate to severe generalized anxiety symptoms (GADÃ¢â€°Â¥10) were found among 11% and 10% of the pregnant and breastfeeding women. The mean(Ã‚Â±SD) Perceived Stress Scale scores for pregnant and breastfeeding women were 14.1Ã‚Â±6.6 and 13.7Ã‚Â±6.6, respectively. Risk factors associated with poor mental health included having a chronic mental illness, a chronic somatic illness in the postpartum period, smoking, having an unplanned pregnancy, professional status, and living in the UK or Ireland. This multinational study found high levels of depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety among pregnant and breastfeeding women during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study findings underline the importance of monitoring perinatal mental health during pandemics and other societal crises to safeguard maternal and infant mental health.","Ceulemans, Foulon, Ngo, Panchaud, Winterfeld, Pomar, Lambelet, Cleary, O'Shaughnessy, Passier, Richardson, Hompes, Nordeng","https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.14092","20210121","Anxiety; SARS-CoV-2; breastfeeding; coronavirus: COVID-19; depression; pregnancy; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-22","",9762,""
"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the Brazilian community of rare diseases: A patient reported survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a reorganization of health systems to prioritize the fight against the virus. The adoption of social distancing interfered with the flow of existing policies, and may thus negatively affect the most vulnerable groups, such as the rare disease community. Aimming at characterizing the perception of the impact of COVID-19 on the health care of the Brazilian rare disease community, an online questionnaire addressed to patients with rare diseases and their caregivers was disseminated in the Brazilian territory between June 1st to July 5th, 2020. The questions dealt with the sanitary measures adopted; access to medical services; and mental suffering during the pandemic. The survey was answered by 1,466 participants (&lt;18 yo = 53.3%) representing 192 rare diseases. Regarding physical distancing, 1,372 (93.6%) participants did not leave their residence, or did so only when essential; 1,321 (90.1%) always wore masks when leaving home. 1,042 (71.1%) and 995 (67.9%) participants, respectively, referred medical genetics appointments and rehabilitation therapies were postponed/canceled. Telemedicine was experienced by 1,026 (70%), and 68.3% agreed this is a good strategy for health care. Patients with Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM, n = 624, 42.5%) appear to have more access to information and ability to overcome difficulties, and feel less threatened, lonely and depressed than the non-IEM group (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). There was an increment of the rare disease patients' vulnerability in the pandemic scenario.

"ESCAP CovCAP survey of heads of academic departments to assess the perceived initial (April/May 2020) impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child and adolescent psychiatry services","In April 2020, the European Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (ESCAP) Research Academy and the ESCAP Board launched the first of three scheduled surveys to evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) services in Europe and to assess the abilities of CAP centers to meet the new challenges brought on by the crisis. The survey was a self-report questionnaire, using a multistage process, which was sent to 168 heads of academic CAP services in 24 European countries. Eighty-two responses (56 complete) from 20 countries, representing the subjective judgement of heads of CAP centers, were received between mid-April and mid-May 2020. Most respondents judged the impact of the crisis on the mental health of their patients as medium (52%) or strong (33%). A large majority of CAP services reported no COVID-19 positive cases among their inpatients and most respondents declared no or limited sick leaves in their team due to COVID-19. Outpatient, daycare, and inpatient units experienced closures or reductions in the number of treated patients throughout Europe. In addition, a lower referral rate was observed in most countries. Respondents considered that they were well equipped to handle COVID-19 patients despite a lack of protective equipment. Telemedicine was adopted by almost every team despite its sparse use prior to the crisis. Overall, these first results were surprisingly homogeneous, showing a substantially reduced patient load and a moderate effect of the COVID-19 crisis on psychopathology. The effect on the organization of CAP services appears profound.

"REACT study protocol: resilience after the COVID-19 threat (REACT) in adolescents","COVID-19-related social isolation and stress may have significant mental health effects, including post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression. These factors are thought to disproportionately affect populations at risk of psychopathology, such as adolescents with a history of childhood adversity (CA). Therefore, examining which factors may buffer the impact of COVID-19-related stress and isolation in vulnerable adolescents is critical. The Resilience After the COVID-19 Threat (REACT) study assesses whether emotion regulation capacity, inflammation and neuroimmune responses to stress induced in the laboratory prior to the pandemic predict responses to COVID-19-related social isolation and stress in adolescents with CA. We aim to elucidate the mechanisms that enable vulnerable adolescents to maintain or regain good mental health when confronted with COVID-19. We recruited 79 adolescents aged 16-26 with CA experiences from the Resilience After Individual Stress Exposure study in which we assessed emotion regulation, neural and immune stress responses to an acute stress task. Our sample completed questionnaires at the start of the UK lockdown ('baseline'; April 2020) and three (July 2020) and 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months later (October 2020) providing crucial longitudinal information across phases of the pandemic progression and government response. The questionnaires assess (1) mental health, (2) number and severity of life events, (3) physical health, (4) stress perception and (5) loneliness and friendship support. We will use multilevel modelling to examine whether individual differences at baseline are associated with responses to COVID-19-related social isolation and stress. This study has been approved by the Cambridge Psychology Research Ethics Committee (PRE.2020.037). Results of the REACT study will be disseminated in publications in scientific peer-reviewed journals, presentations at scientific conferences and meetings, publications and presentations for the general public, and through social media.","Smith, Moreno-LÃƒÂ³pez, Davidson, Dauvermann, Orellana, Soneson, Ioannidis, Kaser, van Harmelen","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042824","20210121","COVID-19; child &amp; adolescent psychiatry; neurobiology; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-22","",9765,""
"COVID-19 and healthcare workers: a rapid systematic review into risks and preventive measures","The COVID-19 pandemic is demanding for occupational medicine and for public health. As healthcare workers (HCWs) fight impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on front lines, we must create safe work environments through comprehensive risk assessments, evaluation and effective implementation of counter-measures. We ask: 'What does current literature report on health risks at workplaces regarding COVID-19?' and 'What do current studies report on the effectiveness of enacted preventative recommendations?' As a snapshot of early HCW research, on 26 April 2020, we conducted a rapid systematic literature search in three databases (PubMed, Web of Science and PsycInfo) for COVID-19-related health outcomes and preventive measures in healthcare-associated workplaces. 27 studies were identified as relevant for exploring the risk of infection, 11 studies evaluated preventive measures. The studies described that SARS-CoV-2 impacts significantly on HCW's health and well-being, not only through infections (n=6), but also from a mental health perspective (n=16). 4 studies reported indirect risks such as skin injuries, one study described headaches to result from the use of personal protective equipment. Few studies provided information on the effectiveness of prevention strategies. Overall, most studies on health risks as well as on the effectiveness of preventive measures were of a moderate-to-low quality; this was mainly due to limitations in study design, imprecise exposure and outcome assessments. Due to widespread exposure of HCW to SARS-CoV-2, workplaces in healthcare must be as safe as possible. Information from HCW can provide valuable insights into how infections spread, into direct and indirect health effects and into how effectively counter-measures mitigate adverse health outcomes. However, available research disallows to judge which counter-measure(s) of a current 'mix' should be prioritised for HCW. To arrive at evidence-based cost-effective prevention strategies, more well-conceived studies on the effectiveness of counter-measures are needed.","Gross, Mohren, Erren","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042270","20210121","epidemiology; occupational &amp; industrial medicine; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-22","",9766,""
"Changes in anxiety, depression, and stress in one week and one month later after the Wuhan shutdown against the COVID-19 epidemic","To investigate the changes in Chinese residents' psychological state and its influencing factors after the Wuhan shutdown on 23 Jan. Two surveys were conducted on Feb 1-5 and Feb 20-24, separately, using an online self-administrated questionnaire among 3145 and 3814 participants, respectively. Subjective indicators of daily-life changes include level of attention, risk of infection, impact of daily life, self-perceived health status, and mental health help-seeking. And individual scores on changes in anxiety, depression, and stress were generated by 6-item, 4-item, and 3-item questions. A multivariate regression model was fitted in each survey, separately and combined. A total of 6959 residents participated in the study, with 32.78% male and 67.22% female, people living in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province accounted for 25.22% and 18.85%, respectively. One week after the Wuhan shutdown, their anxiety, depression, and stress had all increased.

"Multiple clinical risks for cannabis users during the COVID-19 pandemic","The pandemic caused by Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has been a great concern for public and mental health systems worldwide. The identification of risk groups is essential for the establishment of preventive and therapeutic strategies, as for substance users. During COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in the use of psychoactive substances during the lockdown, including cannabis. This commentary reviews relevant findings and discusses scientific evidence on the risks of worse clinical and psychiatric complications due to coronavirus disease COVID-19 in subjects who use cannabis. Although they are not included as a risk group in the health recommendations for that disease, they may have a more vulnerable respiratory system to viral diseases. There are certain similarities between the harmful cardiovascular and respiratory effects of cannabis use and those of smoking. Due to the different modes of smoking, cannabis chemicals are retained in the body for longe and may also contain other toxic substances such as tar, a substance found in tobacco and which has been associated with the development of lung cancer, bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema. Therefore, we discuss if individuals who use cannabis regularly might be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. This population deserves more clinical attention worldwide and this manuscript can help clinicians become more aware of cannabis risks during pandemics and develop specific intervention strategies.","Borgonhi, Volpatto, Ornell, Rabelo-da-Ponte, Kessler","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13722-021-00214-0","20210121","Cannabis; Clinical risks; Covid19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-22","",9768,""
"Temperament and character of patients with alcohol toxicity during COVID -Ã¢â‚¬â€°19 pandemic","Corona virus epidemic may be acts as a stressor or trauma that affects both physical health and mental health. People exhibited various reactive behaviors to confront with this stressful situation. In Iran, one of the common motives for alcohol consumption is to scape problems and cope with stresses. It has been shown that personality factors influence alcohol consumption, since they are associated with drinking motives. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between temperament and character and alcohol abuse. This cross-section study was conducted on 135 alcohol intoxicated patients admitted to emergency room in March 2020 and 255 participants who were randomly selected from public in Shiraz. A questionnaire consisted of TCI (Temperament and character inventory) and several questions about COVID-19 pandemic. It was completed by a trained interviewer using the matched answer technique. Demographic factors were self-reported. Among the alcohol intoxicated group, 117 (86.7%) were males and 18(13.3%) were females. The mean age of the participants was 32.43Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.81Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. Among control group, 99 (38.8%) were males and 156 (61.2%) were females. The mean age of control group was 33.12Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.77Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. Alcohol toxicity was mostly observed among the young males (male/female ratio was 6.45). According to temperament and character index, mean scores of novelty seeking, harm avoidant, and self-transcendence were higher in the alcohol toxicity group than normal population (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Mean scores of reward dependent, cooperativeness, and self-directedness were higher in normal population than the alcohol toxicity group (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The mean score of persistence was not significantly different between methanol intoxicated and normal population groups (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.718). Alcohol intoxicated patients had higher scores of novelty-seeking and self-transcendence and lower scores of reward-dependency scores, cooperativeness and self-directedness. These scores are associated with higher likelihood of personality disorders.","Estedlal, Mani, Vardanjani, Kamali, Zarei, Heydari, Lankarani","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03052-1","20210121","Alcohol; COVID-19; Iran; Temperament and character","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-22","",9769,""
"The Psychological Vulnerability of French University Students to the COVID-19 Confinement","Even before the current pandemic, university students were known to have high levels of hassles, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. In all probability, the advent of COVID-19 has substantially raised these levels. The present study measured the emotional state of university students during lockdown and identified the relevant situational and psychological factors. To this end, 1,297 French university students were assessed during lockdown, which lasted from 16 March to 11 May in France. Situational factors included the belief that lockdown was compromising their future job prospects, COVID-19 symptoms, and health concerns. Psychological factors included students' implicit theory of emotion, and the coping strategies they used during lockdown. We explored the extent to which these factors were associated with levels of hassles, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Results indicated that students' belief that lockdown was compromising their future job prospects was positively related to hassles (<i>r</i> = .34, <i>p</i> &lt; .001), while concerns about their own health and that of relatives were positively associated with anxiety (<i>r</i> = .37 and .34; <i>p</i> &lt; .001). In addition, use of the positive reframing coping strategy mediated the effect of students' implicit theory of emotion on their depressive symptoms. Even though the national lockdown is now over, the pandemic will continue to have a major impact on university students over the coming months. It is therefore essential for universities to provide them with adequate psychological support.","Le Vigouroux, Goncalves, Charbonnier","https://doi.org/10.1177/1090198120987128","20210121","anxiety; coronavirus; depression; hassles; lockdown; pandemic; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-22","",9770,""
"Confronting COVID-19 in under-resourced, African American neighborhoods: a qualitative study examining community member and stakeholders' perceptions","The purpose of this study was to examine perceptions of COVID-19 related to prevention, coping, and testing of African American residents in under-resourced communities in Alabama. Guided by the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, virtual focus groups were conducted in five urban and rural Alabama communities using secure Zoom meetings. Community residents and stakeholders (<i>N</i> = 36 total) participated; meetings were audio- and video-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed according to Thematic Analysis. Themes were organized by the PRECEDE portion of the model in Predisposing, Reinforcing, and Enabling barriers and facilitators in three focus areas: prevention, coping, and testing. Prevention barriers included apathy, difficulty with social distancing, lack of information, mixed messages from authority figures, and lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). Prevention facilitators included concerns about contracting COVID-19, clear and consistent messages from trusted sources, contact tracing, and the provision of PPE. Coping barriers included food insecurity, mental health issues, isolation, economic hardships, lack of health care access, and issues with virtual schooling and church services, which were exacerbated by the inability to connect to the internet. Facilitators to coping included religious faith, increased physical activity, and a sense of hope. Testing barriers included misunderstanding, fear, mistrust, testing restrictions, and location of testing sites. Facilitators to testing included incentives, clear information from trusted sources, convenient testing locations, and free tests. Gaining community members' perspectives can identify barriers and facilitators to prevention, coping, and testing and potentially improve outcomes. While addressing the social determinants of health (e.g. income, education, medical trust) would be an effective path by which to diminish health disparities related to COVID-19, there is an urgent need to mitigate the spread and severity of COVID-19 in vulnerable populations. Interventions should focus on downstream determinants, such as those emerging from our study.","Bateman, Schoenberger, Hansen, Osborne, Okoro, Speights, Fouad","https://doi.org/10.1080/13557858.2021.1873250","20210121","African American health; COVID-19; barriers to COVID-19 testing; coping; health disparities; qualitative research; social determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-22","",9771,""
"Clinician perspectives on methadone service delivery and the use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study","Objectives During the COVID-19 pandemic, opioid treatment programs (OTPs) in the U.S. were granted new flexibility in methadone dispensing and the use of telemedicine. To explore the impact of the pandemic and accompanying policy changes on service delivery, we asked OTP clinicians about changes in care patterns and perceptions of impacts on access and quality. Methods In Mayâ€“June 2020, we completed semistructured telephone interviews with 20 OTP clinicians (physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners) from 13 U.S. states. The study recruited participants through Medscape, an online platform where clinicians access clinical content. We used rapid thematic analysis, a qualitative approach, to summarize participants' expressed views related to the research objectives. Results Clinicians identified a range of changes to methadone and ancillary service delivery as a result of COVID-19. Most clinicians reported that OTPs were prescribing more take-home doses of methadone and providing psychosocial services and medication management via telemedicine. Many also reported reducing the frequency of urine toxicology screening and accepting fewer new patients. While some clinicians expressed support for the increased flexibility around dosing and use of telemedicine, others expressed concern about increased risk of medication diversion and overdose. Clinicians reported several advantages and disadvantages of the changes due to the pandemic and that continued reimbursement would be required to maintain telemedicine services. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically altered the delivery of methadone treatment in the U.S. This study's findings suggest that OTPs may have reduced their methadone treatment during the early months of the pandemic and that the flexibilities that policy changes offered may not have resulted in changes in care delivery for all patients. Careful consideration and additional analysis should inform which changes OTPs should maintain long-term.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108288","20210501","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-22","",9772,""
