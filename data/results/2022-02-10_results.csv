"EXPRESS: Shall We Dance? Recreational Dance, Well-Being and Productivity Performance During COVID-19: A Three-Country Study","Mental health issues are increasingly prevalent worldwide, emphasizing the need to research antecedents and consequences of well-being. Prior research shows that within organizations, higher levels of subjective well-being (SWB) promote productivity performance. Building on this research, the authors hypothesize that recreational dance positively influences productivity through higher SWB. Survey data from Brazil, Italy, and the United Kingdom reveal that recreational dancers are more productive than nondancers due to their higher intrinsic motivation and SWB. Dancing has an additional direct effect on productivity, beyond the mediating role of SWB. The results indicate well-being and productivity improvements in all three countries, although they show a moderating effect such that the relationship between recreational dance and SWB is stronger when social norms are perceived to be looser. This study indicates potentially far-reaching benefits that could be achieved by including recreational dance in corporate well-being programs. International dance organizations could market dance classes as a pathway to increase productivity at work and explore synergies with public health marketing to promote the benefits of recreational dance in joint international campaigns.","Vecchi, Michela, Elf, Patrick, Ueno, Akiko, Dilmperi, Athina, Dennis, Charles, Devereux, Luke","https://doi.org/10.1177/1069031X221079609","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of International Marketing;: 1069031X221079609, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26710,""
"Implementing Collaborative Care Management of Behavioral Health for Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease","Background Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are up to twice as likely to suffer from anxiety and/or depression. Collaborative care management (CoCM) is an evidenced-based approach to treating behavioral health disorders that has proven effective for a range of conditions in primary care and some specialty settings. This model involves a team-based approach, with care delivered by a care manager (case reviews and behavioral therapy), psychiatrist (case reviews and psychopharmacological recommendations), and medical provider (ongoing care including psychopharmacological prescriptions). We assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of CoCM in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with IBD. Methods Patients with psychological distress identified by clinical impression and/or the results of the Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were referred to the CoCM program. Data from our 9-month CoCM pilot were collected to assess depression and anxiety response and remission rates. We obtained provider surveys to assess provider acceptability with delivering care in this model. Results Though the coronavirus SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) pandemic interrupted screening, 39 patients enrolled and 19 active participants completed the program. Overall, 47.4% had either a response or remission in depression, while 36.8% had response or remission in anxiety. The gastroenterologists highly agreed that the program was a beneficial resource for their patients and felt comfortable implementing the recommendations. Discussion CoCM is a potentially feasible and well accepted care delivery model for treatment of depression and anxiety in patients with IBD in a specialty gastroenterology clinic setting.","Beran, C.; Sowa, N.

"A Markov regime-switching (MS) approach to modeling the effects of fiscal policies and COVID-19 pandemic on tourism destination competitiveness in Kenya","Purpose - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a catastrophic impact on the tourist activity in Kenya. Global lockdown has limited travel resulting to losses in the tourism sector. This paper discusses the specific role that fiscal policy plays to improve tourism competitiveness in Kenya. Specifically, the study examines how Kenyan government can revive the tourism economy to improve its competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach - A tourism demand model to explore relationship between fiscal policies and inbound tourism in Kenya is developed. This study uses a Markov regime-switching (MS) regression model to establish the relationships that exist between COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal policies and tourism revenue in Kenya. Findings-The estimation results of the Markov-switching dynamic regression showed that the coefficients of international tourists arrivals, domestic bed occupancy and international bed occupancy are positive and significant with p-values of 0.000 during the pandemic period. The findings show that the transitioning periods during the fiscal policy shifts had an effect on the international arrivals. Therefore, fiscal incentives were key in influencing tourism arrivals and bednights occupancies. Research limitations/implications - The theoretical implications show that to promote the state of high international and domestic tourist arrivals, the government should encourage more fiscal spending initiatives that encourage the increase in tourist arrivals and occupancies such as vaccinations against COVID-19 and promoting safe spaces for visitors within the destination is key towards reviving the sector. In order to curb the hysteresis effects of COVID-19 related depression and resultant impacts on GDP, there is a need to review the national fiscal policies and target fiscal policies on the cyclical effects of the COVID-19 impacts on international tourism market. Originality/value - This research develops an economic model that builds accurate relationships between fiscal policies, pandemics and tourism destination competitiveness as a means of informing competitive tourism management strategies and governance.","Kimunio, I.; Maingi, S.

"Treating COVID-19 patients with smell loss in the otolaryngology clinic: Approach, management and prognosis","A full year has passed since patients were first seen in their medical and otolaryngology clinics with reported acute onset and often profound smell and taste loss that were soon linked to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While studies vary in their prevalence, roughly 50% of patients with COVID-19 are estimated to suffer from viral-induced chemosensory dysfunction with approximately 5-25% experiences some extent of persistent smell and/or taste loss. The widespread screening of COVID-19 has allowed for a heightened clinical awareness in the early onset of one's olfactory dysfunction with a known viral etiology. Despite the high spontaneous recovery rate, persistent smell loss and qualitative olfactory dysfunctions such as parosmias have developed in an unfortunate subset of COVID-19 patients. Thus, consideration for early onset therapy may be appropriate and physicians have the opportunity to recommend treatment options for acute and chronic COVID-19 associated olfactory loss. Preliminary studies have suggested efficacy with the use of olfactory training as well as topical and oral steroids for olfactory loss, and topical sodium citrate for qualitative olfactory symptoms. Early longitudinal data have also suggested that the increased severity of smell dysfunction and the female gender may predispose to long term olfactory loss. Perhaps equally as important as the therapeutic management of smell loss is the counseling provided and the understanding of the impacts of olfactory dysfunction on quality of life and mental health. In this symposium talk, we will review the literature and discuss the approach and management that an otolaryngologist might provide to patients suffering from acute and chronic COVID-19 related olfactory loss.","Yan, C.

"A qualitative study of older adults' experiences of embedding physical activitywithin their home care services","Background: Physical activity programmes have been shown to improve older adults' functional capacity, independence and quality of life. Research around structured exercise programmes has been completed in different groups of community-dwelling older people, however few studies have focused on the older population receiving formal home care. In a feasibility study, we embedded physical activity within older adults existing home care services through the 'Care to Move' (CTM) programme. The aim of this qualitative study is to explore older adults' experiences of the CTM programme. Methods: We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with 13 older adults and one carer. Topics covered included participants overall experiences of the CTM programme, changes to their overall activity and participation, aspects of the programme that they liked or found valuable and issues that they found challenging. Interview transcripts were coded and analysed thematically to capture barriers and facilitators to programme delivery. Results: Four themes emerged: i) 'I'm feeling good about it', ii) 'safety and security is the name of the game', iii) 'we're a team as it stands', iv) 'it's [COVID] depressing for everybody at the moment'. Older adults identified benefits of CTM participation including improvements in physical and psychological wellbeing. However, frailty and multimorbidity influenced overall engagement. Participants expressed concerns around the logistics of programme delivery and competing healthcare assistant (HCA) interests. The broader role of HCA's in supporting the CTM programme was highlighted as well as the emotional support that HCAs provided to older adults. HCA continuity was identified as a barrier to ongoing programme engagement. The impact of COVID on older adults physical and mental health negatively impacted programme delivery. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that embedding the CTM programme within home support services is feasible. Restructuring of services, addressing HCA continuity, and adopting individual approaches to programme delivery may enhance the implementation of services.","Galvin, R.; Burton, E.; Cummins, V.; O'Sullivan, M.; Swan, L.; Doyle, F.; Sorensen, J.; Skelton, D.

"Health trajectories of frail, older people while cocooning during the covid-19 pandemic","Background: Cocooning, i.e. staying at home and reducing interaction with others, was a key part of the strategy to protect older people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, there are concerns this has had a negative impact on the physical and mental wellbeing of those who have been isolated. Methods: We completed a survey of 150 patients (55% female, mean age 79.8 years, averageClinical Frailty Scale 4.8) attending ambulatory medical services in a large university hospital. Questions were focused on: access to healthcare services, mental health, physical health, and attitudes to COVID-19 restrictions. Results: Almost 40% reported that their mental health was 'worse' or 'much worse' while cocooning, while over 40% reported a decline in their physical health. Over 57% had a scheduled healthcare-related visit cancelled while cocooning, most frequently hospital outpatient appointments. Worryingly, almost 1/6 reported not seeking medical attention for an illness that they would usually. Of these, half did not as they were worried about catching COVID and 46% did not as this service was not currently available to them. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic and lack of access to essential services, both medical and social, has had a devastating impact on older people. This is evident in both the acute presentations to hospital and the longer-term impact it has had on health and function. It is important that in the future clear policies are in place to enable older people to access care when they need it.","Bailey, L.; Ward, M.; DiCosimo, A.; Lavan, A.; Briggs, R.","https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab219.166","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Age and Ageing; 50(SUPPL 3), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26715,""
"An Exploration of Psychological Distress, Employment, and Housing Among Transgender and Gender Diverse Individuals During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Public Significance Statement The current study explored the ways that housing and employment instability brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to heightened psychological distress among a sample of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals collected using an online survey platform. Our findings indicate that TGD individuals experienced heightened levels of psychological distress directly related to employment and housing instability which is a crucial and timely concern given that TGD individuals experienced greater psychological distress, unemployment, and housing instability relative to the general population prior to the pandemic. Receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis or experiencing symptoms associated with COVID-19 also predicted heightened levels of psychological distress. It is recommended that additional TGD-specific protections be implemented and expanded upon in order to meet the current and impending needs of TGD individuals. Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals are faced with various societal factors that contribute to health disparities. As COVID-19 spreads, health disparities that existed prior to the pandemic have become exacerbated. The current study aims to address factors that may be negatively impacting TGD individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic by exploring their experiences related to symptoms of depression, symptoms of anxiety, employment, and housing. TGD participants (N = 342) were recruited from an online participant recruitment platform and answered questions related to their psychological well-being and changes in employment and housing since the start of the pandemic. Adverse changes in employment since the start of the pandemic were reported by almost 1/3 of participants and were associated with higher depression and anxiety. Changes in housing were reported by almost 1/4 of participants and were associated with higher anxiety. Experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis were also associated with higher anxiety. Findings indicate TGD individuals who experienced changes in employment and housing since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic experience greater levels of psychological distress. Findings may inform mental health providers and policymakers on the repercussions the pandemic has had on TGD individuals.","Smout, S. A.; Wall, C. S. J.; Mason, K. L.; Stanford, M. K.; O'Neill, K.

"COVID-19 Pandemic Mental Health Trajectories: Patterns From a Sample of Canadians Primarily Recruited From Alberta and Ontario","Public Significance Statement Public health responses to the pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) could adversely impact the mental health of Canadians. Understanding changes in Canadian mental health during the pandemic and the factors that confer risk and resilience could guide future pandemic public health policies. During the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Canadians experienced changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms that paralleled COVID-19 infection rates and Health Canada pandemic response recommendations. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious and novel virus that has prompted government officials to implement restrictive public health orders. It is hypothesized that pandemic-related restrictions may have a detrimental impact on mental health. Longitudinal data were collected through 13 assessments, repeated every 2 weeks for the initial 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were recruited through [Masked] University and social media. The final sample consisted of 280 adults from across Canada, with the majority of participants residing in Alberta (63%) and Ontario (20%). Sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 related risk factors, prepandemic and pandemic physical activity, and COVID-19 related risk factors were collected at study entry, and mental health (depressive symptoms, anxiety, and loneliness) were collected at each assessment. Multilevel modeling was used to identify mental health trajectories during the initial 6 months of the pandemic. Mental health symptoms tracked with rising cases of infection and subsequent public health restrictions during the pandemic. Specifically, anxiety and depressive symptoms demonstrated strong longitudinal quadratic trends. Both anxiety and depressive symptoms were high at study entry (May 2020) and decreased over the summer, followed by an increase in the fall and winter months. Loneliness was stable over the follow-up period. Age, sex, living alone, socioeconomic factors, and preexisting mental health conditions correlated with mental health symptoms during the pandemic's initial 6 months. This study characterizes within-person changes to mental health (anxiety, depressive symptoms, and loneliness) in a Canadian sample from May 2020 to January 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lowe, C.; Keown-Gerrard, J.; Ng, C.

"The role of meteorological variables and aerosols in the transmission of COVID-19 during Harmattan Season","The role of atmospheric parameters and aerosols in the transmission of COVID-19 within tropical Africa, especially during the harmattan season, has been under-investigated in published papers. The harmattan season within the West African region is associated with significant dust incursion from the Bodele depression and biomass burning. In this study, the correlation between atmospheric parameters (temperature and humidity) and aerosols with COVID-19 cases and fatalities within seven locations in tropical Nigeria during the harmattan period was investigated. COVID-19 infection cases were found to be significantly positively correlated with atmospheric parameters (temperature and humidity) in the southern part of the country while the number of fatalities showed weaker significant correlation with particulate matters only in three locations. The significant correlation values were found to be between 0.22 to 0.48 for particulate matter and -0.19 to -0.32 for atmospheric parameters. Although, temperature and humidity showed negative correlations in some locations, the impact is smaller compared to particulate matter. In December, COVID-19 cases in all locations showed strong correlation with particulate matter except in Kano State. It is suggested that a reduction in atmospheric particulate matter can be used as a control measure for the spread of COVID-19.","Ogunjo, S.; Olaniyan, O.; Olusegun, C.

"Perceptions of Macro- and Microlevel Factors Predict Covid-19 Health and Self-Reported Adherence to Safety Guidelines A Study Across Eight Countries","Introduction: Adherence to Covid-19 safety measures reduces the spread of the pathogen and lowers mortality rates. The present study examines microlevel (including sociodemographics, health risk factors, and mental health) and perceived macrolevel variables (including freedom, justice, and wealth) concerning self-perceived and self-reported Covid-19 safety measure adherence across eight countries. Methods: Self-reported adherence to Covid-19 safety measures and its potential predictors were assessed in representative samples from eight countries (total N = 7,437;Germany, France, Spain, Poland, Russia, Sweden, UK, US) by online surveys (end of May 2020 to the beginning of June 2020). Results: Self-reported adherence was positively predicted by female sex, higher age, higher social status, belonging to a Covid-19 risk group, being personally affected (physically, economically, and mentally), and positive mental health. Adherence was negatively predicted by depression and anxiety. Perceptions of governmental communication as credible and honest, government communication being guided by political interests, the feeling of being well informed, and perceived country-level freedom positively predicted self-reported adherence. Perceived country-level justice negatively predicted adherence, and perceived country-wide wealth was unrelated to it. Conclusions: Self-reported adherence to COVID-19 safety protocols is negatively predicted by depression, anxiety, and perceived justice, is positively predicted by perceived freedom, and not predicted by perceived country-level wealth.","Lavallee, K.

"Do we have enough recreational spaces during pandemics? An answer based on the analysis of individual mobility patterns in Switzerland","Densification of cities threatens the provision of public open space for people living in and around cities. The increasing evidence of the many benefits of recreational walking for physical and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted an urgent need for fostering the availability of public open space. In this context, urban planners need information to anticipate recreational needs and propose long-term, resilient solutions that consider the growing demand driven by increasing urban population and intensified in times of crisis such as the recent pandemic. In this paper, we harness the unique large MOBIS:COVID-19 GPS travel diary data on mobility behaviour collected during a normal baseline period and during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Canton of Zurich Switzerland. We estimate a sufficiency rate that allows to geolocate locations where the demand for public open space is higher than the available offer. In a second step, we explore if preference patterns for recreational areas have changed during the pandemic. Results indicate that the main cities and important towns in the case study area are saturated by current demand, and that the pandemic has amplified the problem. In particular, urban dwellers look for tranquil areas to recreate. Such information is crucial to guide decision-making processes for planning the cities of the future.","Marcelo, Galleguillos-Torres, Constance, Brouillet, Joseph, Molloy, Kay, Axhausen, David, Zani, Maarten, Van Strien, Adrienne, GrÃªt-Regamey","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104373","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Landscape and Urban Planning; 221:104373, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26721,""
"Anxiety and depression symptoms among medical residents in KSA during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives Medical residentsâ€™ direct contact with patients with COVID-19 places them at high risk of psychological disturbance. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms, and their relationship with the COVID-19 pandemic among medical residents in KSA. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between January and March of 2021. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) were used to screen for depressive disorders and generalized anxiety disorder, respectively. Results A total of 533 medical residents participated in the study;52% were men, and 58% were single. Most residents had direct contact with one or more patients with COVID-19. The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms was 65.8% and 58.3%, respectively. The study revealed that gender was a risk factor for diagnosis with COVID-19 among residents: male residents were diagnosed with COVID-19 to a greater extent than female residents. In addition, being a nonsmoker rather than a smoker was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 diagnosis. A multivariate regression analysis revealed that gender (female) and residency level (R5) were independently associated with anxiety symptoms. Similarly, the independent correlates of depression symptoms were gender (female) and specialty (family medicine). Conclusion A high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms was found among medical residents trained in KSA. The rates were significantly higher among female than male residents.","Alawad, Hossam S.; Amin, Hussein S.; Alfaris, Eiad A.; Ahmed, Abdullah M.; Alosaimi, Fahad D.; BaHammam, Ahmed S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtumed.2022.01.005","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Taibah University Medical Sciences;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26722,""
"Effectiveness of Telesimulation for Pediatric Minimally Invasive Surgery Essential Skills Training","Background In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing rules, access to in-person training activities had temporarily been interrupted, speeding up the implementation of telesimulation for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) essential skills training (T-ESTM, Telesimulation - Essential Skills Training Module) in our center. The aim of this study was to explore the effectiveness of T-ESTM. Methods T-ESTM was scheduled into 2 sessions of 3 hours through the ZoomÂ® virtual meeting platform.

"The role of telemedicine in the management of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: a systematic review","The first-line management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) is based on non-pharmacologic interventions such as the provision of guidance and medical support to caregivers. However, accessibility to specialized care and medical resources is often scarce. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has compromised the delivery of outpatient care (notably in order to minimize the risk of disease transmission), thus making it essential to provide other means of accessing care for these patient populations. The use of telemedicine (TM) may be a means of increasing access to specialist care for patients with disabilities and poor access to health services, such as those with BPSD. The aim of this study is to provide a review of the literature on the use of TM for treatment and follow-up of patients with BPSD and their caregivers. We searched the PUBMED, EMBASE and CINAHL for articles published between January 1st, 2000, and December 31st, 2020, on the applicability of TM support for people with BPSD and their caregivers. We included open-label studies, qualitative studies, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We did not include studies on the use of TM during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 22 publications were included and reviewed. TM was found to (i) be acceptable and feasible for both patients and caregivers, (ii) decrease the frequency and intensity of BPSD, and (iii) improve the caregiver's perceived wellbeing and mental health. Videoconferencing was effective for patient-centered interventions in nursing homes. Telephone-based interventions were more relevant when they were targeted at caregivers. The published studies are lacking in scope and high-quality studies are now needed to confirm these findings and assess TM's cost-effectiveness and ability to improve the management of patients with BPSD. In view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, remote solutions for assessing and monitoring individuals with BPSD are urgently needed - particularly those living in rural areas and so-called â€œmedical desertsâ€.","Nkodo, Jacques-Alexis, Gana, Wassim, Debacq, Camille, Aidoud, Amal, Poupin, Pierre, Camus, Vincent, FougÃ¨re, Bertrand","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2022.01.013","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26724,""
"Adolescent Carersâ€™ Psychological Symptoms and Mental Well-being During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Study Using Data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study","Purpose During the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescent carers in the UK may have experienced psychological distress due to increased caring burden and loss of a break from their caring role. This study investigated longitudinal association between adolescentsâ€™ caring status and mental health outcomes from 2018/2019 to Februaryâ€“March 2021. Methods The participants (n = 3,927) answered mental health questions in both the Millennium Cohort Study sweep 7 survey (age 17 years in 2018/2019) and at least one of three waves of the COVID-19 survey from May 2020 to Februaryâ€“March 2021. Caring status at the age of 17 years was assessed using a single question regarding whether the participant regularly looked after anyone who needed care, without being paid. Outcome measures were psychological symptoms, measured using the Kessler Distress Scale, and mental well-being, measured using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. Results Compared with 3,616 non-carers, 311 (7.9%) adolescent carers reported significantly higher Kessler Distress Scale and lower Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale scores during the pandemic. These associations were largely explained by psychosocial risk factors. Worse outcomes were associated with poor sleep quality, attempted suicide at baseline, low social support, and a strong feeling of loneliness during the pandemic. These factors were significantly more likely to be observed among adolescent carers than non-carers.

"A Randomized Controlled Trial of Internet-Based Self-Help for Stress During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the need for mental healthcare that can be delivered remotely and at scale to college students. This study evaluated the efficacy of online self-help for stress among students during the pandemic. Method College students with moderate or higher stress (N = 585) were recruited between November 2020 and February 2021, when COVID-19 was having a major impact on colleges. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either online self-help using cognitive-behavioral therapy and positive psychology principles to support resilience and coping with pandemic-related stressors (n = 301) or referral to usual care (n = 284). Stress (primary outcome), depression, and anxiety (secondary outcomes) were assessed at pre-treatment, one-month post-treatment, and three-month follow-up. Results Participants in the online self-help condition experienced significantly larger reductions in stress (d = -0.18, p = .035) and depression (d = -0.20, p = .018) from pre-treatment to post-treatment than participants in the referral group. Reductions in stress from pre-treatment to follow-up were also larger in the treatment vs. referral group (d = -0.23, p = .005). Groups did not differ in change in anxiety. More time using the self-help program predicted greater improvement in depression at post-treatment (d = -0.41, p = .001) and follow-up (d = -0.32, p = .007), though usage was unrelated to change in stress or anxiety. Conclusion Online self-help targeting resilience and coping during the pandemic appears efficacious for long-term alleviation of stress and short-term alleviation of depression symptoms among college students.

"The transmission of psychological distress and lifestyles from parents to children during COVID-19","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak had rapidly become a global health threat, and its impact on the mental health was transmitted among different populations, especially from parents to children. The study aimed to investigate Chinese parentsâ€™ influence on their children, in terms of mental health and lifestyles (screen time and physical exercise), during the COVID-19. Methods Self-reported online questionnaires of depression, anxiety, COVID-19 related worries, physical exercise, and screen time were completed by 3471 Chinese children and one of their parents (1514 fathers and 1957 mothers), during the COVID-19 epidemic in February 2020. Path analysis was used to examine the extent of transmission of psychological distress and whether lifestyles tied to transmission. Results During the quarantine, Chinese parentsâ€™ depression and anxiety both positively predicted their children's depression and anxiety;parentsâ€™ COVID-19 related worries, physical exercise and screen time separately had positive effects on children's COVID-19 related worries, physical exercise and screen time;parentsâ€™ depression and anxiety were positively influenced by their COVID-19 related worries, self-quarantine and quarantine of family members, relatives or friends;children's depression and anxiety positively predicted their non-suicidal self-injury and suicide ideation. Bootstrap analyses showed that parentsâ€™ COVID-19 related worries and lifestyles increased children's depression and anxiety via children's COVID-19 related worries and lifestyles, as well as parentsâ€™ depression and anxiety. Conclusions When families face to public events, parentsâ€™ psychological distress and lifestyles are related to children's psychological stress and lifestyles. Interventions of parentsâ€™ psychological distress and lifestyles would improve family resilience.","Zhang, Yeqing, Zhan, Nalan, Zou, Jiaqi, Xie, Dongjie, Liu, Mingfan, Geng, Fulei","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.02.007","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26727,""
"Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depression in primary care: A retrospective cohort study","Background : Population-based surveys indicate that many people experienced increased psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to determine if there was a corresponding increase in patients receiving services for anxiety and depression from their family physicians. Methods : Electronic medical records from the University of Toronto Practice Based-Research Network (UTOPIAN;NÂ =Â 322,920 patients) were used to calculate incidence rates for anxiety/depression related visits and antidepressant prescriptions before the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2018-February 2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (March-December 2020). Data from the pre-pandemic period were used to predict expected rates during the pandemic period which was compared to the observed rate. Results : The number of patients presenting with anxiety/depression symptoms in primary care varied across age groups, sex, and time since pandemic onset. Among the youngest patients (ages 10-18 years), there were fewer patients than pre-pandemic visiting for new episodes of anxiety/depression and being prescribed antidepressants in April 2020, but by the end of 2020 this trend had reversed such that incidence rates for anxiety/depression related visits were higher than pre-pandemic levels. Among older adults, incidence rates of anxiety/depression related visits increased in April 2020 with the onset of the pandemic, and remained higher than expected throughout 2020. Limitations : A convenience sample of 362 family physicians in Ontario was used. Conclusion : Demand for mental health services from family physicians varied by patient age and sex and changed with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. By the end of 2020, more patients were seeking treatment for anxiety/depression related concerns.","Stephenson, Ellen, O'Neill, Braden, Kalia, Sumeet, Ji, Catherine, Crampton, Noah, Butt, Debra A.; Tu, Karen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.02.004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26728,""

"Everyday challenges faced by polish teenagers during the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of selected demographic factors","The enforced restrictions, including physical isolation and school lockdowns after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, have brought about anxiety and uncertainty the younger generation. The main objective is to analyse the everyday challenges faced by adolescents in Poland during the time of social isolation in the COVID-19 pandemic. A nationwide, online survey of adolescents aged 11-18 (N=2408) was conducted in April 2020. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were undertaken. Differences in the everyday challenges experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic connected with gender, age and place of residence were analysed. Girls were significantly more likely than boys to perceive the limitations in contacts with others (friends and family) and the concerns about the health of relatives as a big difficulty. Among the youngest students (11-12 years of age), the lack of contact with friends and family and worries about their health and the fear of infection ranked higher than for other students. For the oldest (17-18) the lack of private time and space and not being able to meet one's boyfriend/ girlfriend were the most troublesome. The necessity to stay at home and the inconvenience resulting from the lack of outdoor exercise were ranked higher by urban students than by students living in rural areas. When planning campaigns in the near future to support the mental health of adolescents in the context of the pandemic it is recommended to include especially the youngest adolescents and those living in small and medium-sized cities.","Korzycka, BÃƒÂ³jko, Radiukiewicz, Dzielska, OblaciÃ…â€žska, FijaÃ…â€škowska","https://doi.org/10.34763/jmotherandchild.20212503SI.d-21-00026","20220209","Pandemic; adolescents; coronavirus; family; isolation; school","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26731,""

"A tranquil virtual reality experience to reduce subjective stress among COVID-19 frontline healthcare workers","The novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) has taken an immense physical, social, and emotional toll on frontline healthcare workers. Research has documented higher levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout among healthcare workers during the pandemic. Thus, creative interventions are needed now more than ever to provide brief, accessible support to frontline workers. Virtual reality is a rapidly growing technology with potential psychological applications. In this study, we piloted a three-minute Tranquil Cinematic-VR simulation of a nature scene to lower subjective stress among frontline healthcare workers in COVID-19 treatment units. We chose to film a nature scene because of the extensive empirical literature documenting the benefits of nature exposure and health. A convenience sample of frontline healthcare workers, including direct care providers, indirect care providers, and support or administrative services, were recruited from three COVID-19 units located in the United States. Inclusion criteria for participation included adults aged 18 years and older who could read and speak in English and were currently employed by the healthcare system. Participants viewed a 360-degree video capture of a lush, green nature preserve in an Oculus Go or Pico G2 4K head-mounted display. Prior to viewing the simulation, participants completed a brief demographic questionnaire and the visual analogue scale to rate their subjective stress on a 10-point scale, with 1 = 'Not at all stressed' to 10 = 'Extremely stressed.' We conducted paired t-tests to examine pre- and post-simulation changes in subjective stress as well as Kruskal-Wallis tests and Mann-Whitney U tests to examine differences by demographic variables. All analyses were conducted in SPSS statistical software version 28.0. We defined statistical significance as a p-value less than .05. A total of 102 individuals consented to participate in the study. Eighty-four (82.4%) participants reported providing direct patient care, 73 (71.6%) identified as women, 49 (48.0%) were between the ages of 25-34 years old, and 35 (34.3%) had prior experience with VR. The pre-simulation mean stress score was 5.5Ã‚Â±2.2, with a range of 1 to 10. Thirty-three (32.4%) participants met the 6.8 cutoff for high stress pre-simulation. Pre-simulation stress scores did not differ by any demographic variables. Post-simulation, we observed a significant reduction in subjective stress scores from pre- to post-simulation (mean change = -2.2Ã‚Â±1.7, t = 12.749, p &lt; .001), with a Cohen's d of 1.08, indicating a very large effect. Further, only four (3.9%) participants met the cutoff for high stress after the simulation. Post-simulations scores did not differ by provider type, age range, gender, or prior experience with virtual reality. Findings from this pilot study suggest that the application of this Tranquil Cinematic-VR simulation was effective in reducing subjective stress among frontline healthcare workers in the short-term. More research is needed to compare the Tranquil Cinematic-VR simulation to a control condition and assess subjective and objective measures of stress over time.","Beverly, Hommema, Coates, Duncan, Gable, Gutman, Love, Love, Pershing, Stevens","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262703","20220209","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26733,""
"Altered motor cortex physiology and dysexecutive syndrome in patients with fatigue and cognitive difficulties after mild COVID-19","Fatigue and cognitive difficulties are reported as the most frequently persistent symptoms in patients after mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed an extensive neurophysiological and neuropsychological assessment of such patients focusing on motor cortex physiology and executive cognitive functions. We enrolled 67 patients complaining of fatigue and/or cognitive difficulties after resolution of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and 22 healthy controls (HC). Persistent clinical symptoms were investigated by means of a 16-item questionnaire. Fatigue, exertion, cognitive difficulties, mood and ""well-being"" were evaluated through self-administered tools. Utilizing transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex (M1) we evaluated resting motor threshold (RMT), motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, cortical silent period (SP) duration, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), and short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI). Global cognition and executive functions were assessed with screening tests. Attention was measured with computerized tasks. Post COVID-19 patients reported a mean of 4.9 persistent symptoms, high levels of fatigue, exertion, cognitive difficulties, low levels of well-being and depressive symptoms. Compared to HC, patients presented higher RMTs, lower MEP amplitudes and longer SPs, concurring with reduced M1 excitability. LICI and SAI were also impaired, indicating altered GABA<sub>B</sub> - and cholinergic neurotransmission. SICI and ICF were not affected. Patients also showed poorer global cognition and executive functions as compared to HC and a clear impairment in sustained and executive attention. Patients with fatigue and cognitive difficulties following mild COVID-19 present altered excitability and neurotransmission within M1 and deficits in executive functions and attention.","Ortelli, Ferrazzoli, Sebastianelli, Maestri, Dezi, Spampinato, Saltuari, Alibardi, Engl, Kofler, Quartarone, Koch, Oliviero, Versace","https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.15278","20220209","Cognitive difficulties; Executive functions; Fatigue; Mild COVID-19; Primary Motor Cortex; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26734,""
"COVID-19 Mental Health Stressors of Health Care Providers in the Pandemic Acceptance and Commitment to Empowerment Response (PACER) Intervention: A Qualitative Study","Since the pandemic, more Canadians have reported poorer mental health. A vital group experiencing high level of stressors are health care providers (HCPs) caring for COVID-19 patients, carrying out public health responses, or working with vulnerable populations. The mental health of HCPs is negatively affected by the pandemic, not only at work but also at home and in the community. Intersecting stressors at multiple levels contribute to HCPs' experiences of fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. The aim of this qualitative study is to explore the pandemic stressors experienced by HCPs at work, at home and in the community before participating in the Pandemic Acceptance and Commitment to Empowerment Response (PACER) online intervention. Informed by a social ecological approach, we use a qualitative reflective approach to engage 74 HCPs in diverse roles. Data were collected during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic (June 2020 to February 2021) in Canada. Informed by a social ecological framework, five overarching themes were identified in our thematic analysis: 1) personal level stressors that highlight HCPs identities and responsibilities beyond the workplace; 2) interpersonal level stressors from disrupted social relationships; 3) organizational stressors that contributed to unsettled workplaces and moral distress; 4) community and societal stressors attributed to vicarious trauma and emotional labour; and 5) the multilevel and cumulative impacts of COVID-19 stressors on HCPs' health. COVID-19 is not merely a communicable disease but a social and political phenomenon that intensifies the effects of social inequities. Current understanding of pandemic stressors affecting HCPs is largely partial in nature. While workplace stressors of HCPs are real and intense, they need to be explored and understood in the context of stressors that exist in other domains of HCPs' lives such as family and community to ensure these experiences are not being silenced by the 'hero' discourses or overshadowed by professional demands.","Sato, Adumattah, Abulencia, Garcellano, Li, Fung, Poon, Vahabi, Wong","https://doi.org/10.2196/35280","20220209","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26735,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological well-being of migrants and refugees settled in Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated health inequalities worldwide, having a disproportionately harsh impact on unprivileged populations such as migrants and refugees. These populations are often more exposed to the virus, but less protected, while at the same time being at higher risk of suffering from poor living and working conditions, limited access to healthcare, and discrimination by the host society, all of which is challenging to their mental health. Empirical evidence on how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting migrants and refugees is required to design effective actions aimed at ensuring health equity. Therefore, this paper aims to analyse how the pandemic has impacted the psychological well-being of migrants and refugees living in Spain. This study was carried out within the framework of the ApartTogether study sponsored by the World Health Organization. Data collection was carried out during March-November 2020, through an online survey completed by 241 participants (age: <i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°37 years; 129 women). The results indicate that 78.7% of participants had suffered a decrease in their psychological well-being since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with number of difficulties and worries experienced being the best individual predictors of this outcome. Enjoying social connections and perceiving positive treatment from the host society were positively associated with psychological well-being at a relational and community level, respectively. Based on these findings, we outline priority areas of psychosocial interventions aimed at guaranteeing the mental health of migrants and refugees in the face of the pandemic in Spain.","Garrido, Paloma, BenÃƒÂ­tez, Skovdal, Verelst, Derluyn","https://doi.org/10.1080/13557858.2022.2035692","20220209","COVID-19; ecological approach; mental health; migrants; psychological well-being; refugees","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26736,""
"Moral injury and psychiatrists in public community mental health services","This study aims to provide a clinical update on moral injury from the perspective of a public sector community psychiatrist, and to outline approaches to addressing the issues raised. Although not considered a mental illness, moral injury is an important condition for psychiatrists to have an awareness of, as it is associated with psychological distress and/or impairments in emotional, social or behavioural functioning. Potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) for community psychiatrists may include staff shortages and deficient resources rendering it difficult to provide an acceptable standard of professional care; time constraints negatively impacting teaching, supervising and mentoring medical students; cost-prohibition regarding preferred medication choices; lack of gender and cultural diversity of available psychiatrists; and work environments not conducive to psychiatrists speaking out about their concerns. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated PMIEs for some community psychiatrists. Whether or not a PMIE transitions to a moral injury may be influenced by the individual's resilience and the quality of emotional, psychological and administrative support they receive before, during and after the potentially precipitating event. Preventative strategies to mitigate susceptibility to a moral injury may be implemented at both a systems level and individual level, and include collective healthcare advocacy action.","Maguire, Looi","https://doi.org/10.1177/10398562211062464","20220209","moral distress; moral injury; potentially morally injurious event","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26737,""
"Effects and implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on medicine use by employees of a Brazilian public university: a cross-sectional study","During the COVID-19 pandemic, universities have had to adopt remote education, a strategy that caused sudden changes of routine for everyone involved in academia. To assess the profile of medicine use by the employees of a Brazilian public university during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional study at a Brazilian public university. Employees were invited to answer an online self-administered questionnaire, containing questions on sociodemographic features, medicine use, mental health and lifestyle habits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The outcome variable was the use of medicines stratified according to occupation. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate (Poisson regression) statistical analyses were performed. A total of 372 employees participated in the study and use of medicine was reported by 53.2%.

"Suicide and Telehealth Treatments: A PRISMA Scoping Review","This PRISMA scoping review explored worldwide research on the delivery of suicide-specific interventions through an exclusive telehealth modality. Research over telehealth modalities with suicidal individuals highlights the importance of facilitating participants' access to treatments despite location and circumstances (e.g., rural, expenses related to appointments, etc.). The review sought evidence of outcomes of trials or projects in which both the patient and therapist attended sessions conjointly and openly discussed suicide over a telehealth modality (e.g., phone, zoom). To explore this topic the authors searched for research trials and quality improvement projects using Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Ovid PsycINFO, EBSCO Social Services Abstracts, and Web of Science on 3/3/2021. Nine different articles were included that each spanned distinct treatments, with eight being research studies and one being a quality improvement project. Publications featuring ongoing or upcoming research in which complete study results were not available did not meet inclusion criteria for this review.

"Lessons learned from psychosocial support and mental health surveys during the 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°years since the Great East Japan Earthquake: Establishing evidence-based disaster psychiatry","Post-disaster mental health and psychosocial support have drawn attention in Japan after the 1995 Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, with mental health care centers for the affected communities being organized. After the catastrophe, a reconstruction budget was allocated to organize mental health care centers to provide psychosocial support for communities affected by the 2007 ChÃ…Â«etsu offshore earthquake, the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, and the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake. There were several major improvements in post-disaster mental health measures after the Great East Japan Earthquake. The Disaster Psychiatric Assistance Team system was organized after the earthquake to orchestrate disaster response related to the psychiatric health system and mental health of the affected communities. Special mental health care efforts were drawn to the communities affected by the nuclear power plant accident through Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high yield Explosives, being succeeded by measures against the coronavirus pandemic. As another new movement after the Great East Japan Earthquake, the number of surveys involving communities affected by disasters has soared. More than 10 times the number of scientific publications were made in English during the decade following the Great East Japan Earthquake, compared with the previous decades. In this review, we examined the results and issues acquired in the 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°years since the Great East Japan Earthquake, proposing evidence-based disaster psychiatry as the direction of future mental health measures related to emergency preparedness and response.

"Investigating the prevalence of anxiety and depression during the first COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom: Systematic review and meta-analyses","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health. Specifically, the stringent lockdown restrictions have heightened anxiety and depression. Therefore, monitoring and supporting the mental health of the population during these unprecedented times is an immediate priority. In this systematic review and meta-analyses, articles that explored the prevalence of anxiety and depression during the first COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom were included. We searched the databases Embase, Medline (PubMed), Web of Science, and PsycINFO for cross-sectional studies. We conducted meta-analyses of prevalence rates using a random-effects model, and the heterogeneity of studies was examined using the I<sup>2</sup> index. Fourteen studies involving 46,158 participants were included in the review. The studies use clinical cut-off scores on anxiety and depression measures to define cases. While the prevalence of anxiety was 31.00% (95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26.00 to 35.00), the prevalence of depression was 32.00% (95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°29.00 to 35.00). The prevalence of anxiety pre-pandemic was 4.65%, indicating a 26.35% increase. Whereas the prevalence of depression pre-pandemic was 4.12%, indicating a 27.88% increase. Moreover, participants experienced a slightly greater prevalence of depression than anxiety by 1.00%. To conclude, the first COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom increased the prevalence of anxiety and depression among the general population, compared to pre-pandemic data. Hence, it is vital that policymakers and mental health services maximize their efforts to monitor mental health and provide interventions to support those in need. Clinical implications Awareness of the high prevalence of anxiety and depression during the first lockdown in the United Kingdom can inform policy development that substantial effort, time, and funding of mental health services are required to support those in need. Similarly, awareness of the prevalence of anxiety and depression in the United Kingdom can contribute to the development of nation-specific interventions and initiatives. Limitations The current review focuses on the UK general population which does not allow the findings to be generalized to the global population. The indirect comparison of the current prevalence rates with the corresponding pre-pandemic prevalence rates obtained from a different study sample increases individual differences, weakening the reliability of the findings.","Dettmann, Adams, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjc.12360","20220209","COVID-19; United Kingdom; anxiety; depression; lockdown; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26742,""
"Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on trauma care: a nationwide observational study","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic severely disrupted society and the health care system. In addition to epidemiological changes, little is known about the pandemic's effects on the trauma care chain. Therefore, in addition to epidemiology and aetiology, this study aims to describe the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on prehospital times, resource use and outcome. A multicentre observational cohort study based on the Dutch Nationwide Trauma Registry was performed. Characteristics, resource usage, and outcomes of trauma patients treated at all trauma-receiving hospitals during the first (W1, March 12 through May 11) and second waves (W2, May 12 through September 23), as well as the interbellum period in between (INT, September 23 through December 31), were compared with those treated from the same periods in 2018 and 2019. The trauma caseload was reduced by 20% during the W1 period and 11% during the W2 period. The median length of stay was significantly shortened for hip fracture and major trauma patients (ISSÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°16). A 33% and 66% increase in the prevalence of minor self-harm-related injuries was recorded during the W1 and W2 periods, respectively, and a 36% increase in violence-related injuries was recorded during the INT. Mortality was significantly higher in the W1 (2.9% vs. 2.2%) and W2 (3.2% vs. 2.7%) periods. The imposed restrictions in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to diminished numbers of acute trauma admissions in the Netherlands. The long-lasting pressing demand for resources, including ICU services, has negatively affected trauma care. Further caution is warranted regarding the increased incidence of injuries related to violence and self-harm.","Driessen, van Ditshuizen, Waalwijk, van den Bunt, IJpma, Reininga, Fiddelers, Habets, Homma, van den Berg, Bloemers, Schipper, Leenen, de Jongh","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00068-022-01891-5","20220209","Impact; Outcome; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26743,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic outbreak on mental health of the hospital front-line healthcare workers in Chile: a difference-in-differences approach","Most of the evidence about impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) comes from symptom questionnaires. It is important to evaluate main mental health diagnoses in hospital front-line HCW's during the early acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. An individual-level cross-sectional study using administrative data was conducted. A Difference-in-Difference (DiD) approach was used to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sick leave rates of depression, anxiety and acute stress reaction among hospital front-line HCW's in comparison with other private insured workers. DiD estimates showed a significant reduction of depression (17%), anxiety (8%) and acute stress reaction (8%) sick leave rate, in the front-line HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reduction of the three mental disorders sick leave rates was higher in men than women. Except for depression, front-line HCW's from the Santiago region's sick leave rates of anxiety and acute stress reaction decreased more than other regions'. Opposite to our hypothesis the results suggests a remarkable resilience level and compromise of front-line HCW's. To address threats to the mental health of HCW's is key to promotes programs for their psychological well-being and safety.","Olivares-Tirado, Zanga-Pizarro","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdac008","20220209","COVID-19; Chile; healthcare workers; mental disorders; resilience; sick leave","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26744,""
"Remote-delivered cardiac rehabilitation during COVID-19: a prospective cohort comparison of health-related quality of life outcomes and patient experiences","Enforced suspension and reduction of in-person cardiac rehabilitation (CR) services during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic restrictions required rapid implementation of remote delivery methods, thus enabling a cohort comparison of in-person vs. remote-delivered CR participants. This study aimed to examine the health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes and patient experiences comparing these delivery modes. Participants across four metropolitan CR sites receiving in-person (December 2019 to March 2020) or remote-delivered (April to October 2020) programmes were assessed for HRQL (Short Form-12) at CR entry and completion. A General Linear Model was used to adjust for baseline group differences and qualitative interviews to explore patient experiences. Participants (n = 194) had a mean age of 65.94 (SD 10.45) years, 80.9% males. Diagnoses included elective percutaneous coronary intervention (40.2%), myocardial infarction (33.5%), and coronary artery bypass grafting (26.3%). Remote-delivered CR wait times were shorter than in-person [median 14 (interquartile range, IQR 10-21) vs. 25 (IQR 16-38) days, P &lt; 0.001], but participation by ethnic minorities was lower (13.6% vs. 35.2%, P &lt; 0.001). Remote-delivered CR participants had equivalent benefits to in-person in all HRQL domains but more improvements than in-person in Mental Health, both domain [mean difference (MD) 3.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28, 5.82] and composite (MD 2.37, 95% CI 0.15, 4.58). From qualitative interviews (n = 16), patients valued in-person CR for direct exercise supervision and group interactions, and remote-delivered for convenience and flexibility (negotiable contact times). Remote-delivered CR implemented during COVID-19 had equivalent, sometimes better, HRQL outcomes than in-person, and shorter wait times. Participation by minority groups in remote-delivered modes are lower. Further research is needed to evaluate other patient outcomes.","Candelaria, Kirkness, Farrell, Roach, Gooley, Fletcher, Ashcroft, Glinatsis, Bruntsch, Roberts, Randall, Gullick, Ladak, Soady, Gallagher","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurjcn/zvac006","20220209","COVID-19; Cardiac rehabilitation; Health-related quality of life; Patient experiences; Remote delivery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26745,""
"Determinants of sanitary measures and lockdown compliance among health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic","<i>Introduction:</i> COVID-19 pandemic forced several countries to establish sanitary and lockdown measures to prevent the spreading of the virus. Only necessary workers were allowed to work, including health workers in hospitals. <i>Objectives</i>: This study explores the association between some variables and sanitary measures compliance among health workers during a pandemic. <i>Method</i>: A total of 299 Health workers were recruited online using social networks. Participants completed questionnaires evaluating personality, coping, Anxiety and depression, psychological flexibility and sanitary measures compliance. <i>Results</i>: Correlations indicated most observant participants were more likely to present efficient coping and more based on problem solving. Also, Honesty-Humility as a personality trait was positively correlated to a better compliance. Regressions indicated the perceived utility of sanitary measures was the strongest predictor for compliance among health workers. Honesty-Humility and sanitary risks perception were predictors for compliance. <i>Conclusions</i>: This study conducted among health workers points indicates variables associated with higher compliance. Our results suggest compliance and non-compliance as health behaviours or risk behaviours are linked to perceived threats. This perception is linked to health workers' knowledges, their coping strategies, and personality. <i>Introduction:</i> La pandÃƒÂ©mie COVID-19 a obligÃƒÂ© de nombreux pays Ãƒ mettre en place des mesures sanitaires et de confinement afin dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢en ralentir la propagation.

"Stress-The hidden pandemic for school children and adolescents in India during COVID-19 era","The effects of coronavirus are not just physical but also psychological in all age groups and more so common among children. Some children may have had experience of quarantine restrictions during this COVID-19 pandemic. Due to increased digital connections 'emotional contagion' where the distress and fear experienced by one spread to another person may also be common in children. The present study aims to determine whether COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown has caused stress and affected mental health of children and youth. The current study assessed stress in children and youth between 9 and 18 years age based on Short Self-Rating Questionnaire (SSRQ) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study design was anÃ‚Â observational study,Ã‚ a descriptive cross-sectional study using online survey. Total 369 schools children participated in the survey. Score Scale and analysis was done to categorize the stress levels as Low, Moderate and Severe. Data analysis based on the total score levels (Delhi+Mathura zone, <i>n</i>=369) showed 30.08% (<i>n</i>=111) students with Low stress level, 62.87% (<i>n</i>=232) within Moderate stress level and 7.08% (<i>n</i>=26) with severe stress level.

"Online Emotion Regulation for an Adolescent With Misophonia: A Case Study","Misophonia is a novel diagnosis characterised by extreme and uncontrollable autonomic reactions and emotional responses to selective auditory stimuli, which can significantly impair an individual's daily life. No agreed diagnostic criteria are currently available for misophonia, and any therapeutic guidance is yet to be formalised. In this case study, a tailored psychological intervention based on the cognitive model and developed around emotion regulation principles and techniques was adopted to treat misophonia in a 16-year-old female from the United Kingdom. The treatment lasted for 15 weeks and was delivered online due to the ongoing COVID-19 social distancing regulations. The results showed that the intervention was feasible and acceptable, and effective at reducing levels of misophonic symptoms from severe to moderate/mild while also improving emotion dysregulation and overall anxiety and depression. Particular improvements were observed for specific skills such as acceptance and awareness of emotional responses and increased access to emotion regulation strategies. These findings also translated into a number of reported daily life improvements in the client's psychological and social well-being. As the current evidence base on misophonia continues to develop, more methodologically rigorous research is warranted to build on the present findings and inform the adoption of further psychotherapeutic approaches to treat this new condition.","Zarotti, Tuthill, Fisher","https://doi.org/10.1891/JCP-2021-0015","20220209","adolescent; cognition; emotion regulation; misophonia; psychotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26749,""

"AVK overdose in Covid-19 infected patients","During the Covid-19 pandemic, four patients were admitted to a healthcare centre. They were treated with vitamin K antagonists (AVK). We observed a substantial increase in their International Normalised Ratio (INR). The mean age of these patients was 90 (Ã‚Â± 8 years). All had different usual long-term therapy treatments but had fixed doses of AVK to reach a stable INR. No changes to the background regimen were implemented. One patient presented a cough whereas the three others were asymptomatic. In the context of the pandemic, a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was carried out for each patient. The results of the RT-PCR rests were all positive and were associated with a substantially increased INR. Mr H. was admitted with an INR of 2.25 which increased to 5.93 the day after RT-PCR positivity. AVK treatment was stopped but the INR one day after was 7.89. Ms J. presented INR values between 1.96 and 4.58, 10 days later. a PCR test was conducted and AVK treatment was stopped, but the INR still increased to 5.85. The INR of Mr R. increased from 1.82 to 8.05, 24Ã¢â‚¬â€°hours after a positive PCR result. Ms F. presented a gradual increase in INR from 1.5 to 3.36, 72Ã¢â‚¬â€°hours after a positive PCR result and three days after discontinuation of AVK. This study suggest a link between the Covid-19 infection and an increased INR. It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces hypercoagulability in severe forms. Inversely, these four cases show a haemorrhagic risk as the INR increases. There could be a risk of overdose when patients are treated with AVK and are positive for Covid-19. This raises the question of discontinuing AVK and substituting it with another anticoagulant, or performing INR checks more frequently in the context of Covid-19. Moreover, an unexpected increase in INR should indicate the need to conduct a Covid-19 RT-PCR test in the context of this pandemic context.","Moine, Vasse, Jegaden, Boufares, Besson, Dodille, Jerome, Bonan, Ducasse","https://doi.org/10.1684/pnv.2022.1012","20220209","AVK; INR; PCR; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26751,""

"A cross-sectional investigation of the mental health and wellbeing among individuals who have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 international border closure in Australia","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the Australian government implementing strict international border closures. However, research has not yet investigated the mental health status of individuals impacted negatively by these international border closures. The present study was a cross-sectional online survey of 3968 adults who reported being negatively affected by the border closure during June and July 2021. Psychological distress was measured with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), stress with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and wellbeing with the Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF). In total, 3968 participants reported being negatively affected by the current restrictions (63.4% in Australia, 36.6% overseas). The vast majority of respondents (83.6%) reported high or very high levels of psychological distress (mean K10 scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°22), and 74.8% reported poor mental wellbeing, with similar risk profiles for participants in Australia or overseas. The most common scenarios of affected individuals included 1) wanting to enter Australia (30.8%), 2) wanting to leave Australia (29.6%) and 3) wanting someone to enter Australia (25.6%). Reasons included wanting to be with partners, family and friends (81.1%), for employment/economic reasons (4.9%), study (4.1%), personal safety/health (2.6%) or holiday (1.4%). While psychological distress was extremely high across all groups, separated partners and those with interrupted study experienced the highest distress (mean K10Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°35.7, nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°155). The data suggests a highly elevated mental health risk profile among individuals who report being negatively affected by current Australian international border closures. The results provide valuable data to inform future policy decisions and have clear implications regarding effective service provision for this vulnerable group.","Ali, Iasiello, van Agteren, Mavrangelos, Kyrios, Fassnacht","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-022-00807-7","20220209","COVID-19; Coronavirus; International border closures; Mental health; Psychological distress; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26753,""
"Primary emotions as predictors for fear of COVID-19 in former inpatients with Major Depressive Disorder and healthy control participants","There are reports of an increase in depressive symptoms and fear during the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular in patients with depression. This study investigates factors related to fear of COVID-19 in former inpatients suffering from depression and healthy controls by assessing variables typically associated with depression and anxiety disorders, i.e. stressful life events (SLEs), the primary emotions SADNESS, PLAY and SEEKING as well as dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies with respect to suppression and reappraisal. Data of nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°44 former inpatients suffering from depression and nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°49 healthy controlsÃ‚Â were collected. The study had a longitudinal design with two measurement points. Before the pandemic, SLEs, primary emotions, emotion regulation and depression severity were assessed. During the pandemic, COVID-19 associated stressors and life events, emotion regulation, depression severity and fear of COVID-19 were assessed. Fear of COVID-19 and depression severity during the pandemic were significantly higher in former inpatients than in healthy controls. Depression diagnosis, SLEs and depression severity before the pandemic were significant positive predictors of fear of COVID-19. The primary emotion PLAY was a significant negative predictor of fear of COVID-19. Depression severity did not change significantly in healthy controls. The results show that risk factors for depression might be risk factors for high fear of COVID-19. In addition, a playful personality could help preventing mental stress in pandemic situations. Thus, positivity based interventions could counteract elevated fear scores during a pandemic.","Sanwald, Widenhorn-MÃƒÂ¼ller, Montag, Kiefer, Gahr, Kammer, SchÃƒÂ¶nfeldt-Lecuona","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03677-2","20220209","COVID-19; Corona; Depression; Emotion regulation; Fear; Primary emotions; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26754,""
"Persistent, new-onset symptoms and mental health complaints in Long COVID in a Brazilian cohort of non-hospitalized patients","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections lead to acute- and chronic Long COVID (LC) symptoms. However, few studies have addressed LC sequelae on brain functions. This study was aimed to examine if acute symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) would persist during LC, and if memory problems would be correlated with sleep, depressive mood, or anxious complaints. Our work followed a cohort of 236 patients from two public hospitals of the Federal District in mid-western Brazil. Patients' interviews checked for clinical symptoms during acute and LC (5-8Ã‚Â months after real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RT-qPCR). Most cases were non-hospitalized individuals (86.3%) with a median age of 41.2Ã‚Â years. While myalgia (50%), hyposmia (48.3%), and dysgeusia (45.8%) were prevalent symptoms in acute phase, fatigue (21.6%) followed by headache (19.1%) and myalgia (16.1%) commonly occurred during LC. In LC, 39.8% of individuals reported memory complaints, 36.9% felt anxious, 44.9% felt depressed, and 45.8% had sleep problems. Furthermore, memory complaints were associated with sleep problems (adjusted OR 3.206; 95% CI 1.723-6.030) and depressive feelings (adjusted OR 3.981; 95% CI 2.068-7.815). The SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to persistent symptoms during LC, in which memory problems may be associated with sleep and depressive complaints.","Titze-de-Almeida, da Cunha, Dos Santos Silva, Ferreira, Silva, Ribeiro, de Castro Moreira Santos JÃƒÂºnior, de Paula BrandÃƒÂ£o, Silva, da Rocha, Xavier, Titze-de-Almeida, Shimizu, Delgado-Rodrigues","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-022-07065-3","20220209","Brazil; COVID-19; Depression; Long COVID; Memory; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26755,""
"Trends in Stroke Presentations before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Meta-Analysis","There are reports of decline in the rates of acute emergency presentations during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic including stroke. We performed a meta-analysis of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on rates of stroke presentations and on rates of reperfusion therapy. Following the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines, we systematically searched the literature for studies reporting changes in stroke presentations and treatment rates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Aggregated data were pooled using meta-analysis with random-effect models. We identified 37 observational studies (n=375,657). Pooled analysis showed decline in rates of all strokes (26.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 22.4 to 29.7) and its subtypes; ischemic (25.3%; 95% CI, 21.0 to 30.0), hemorrhagic (27.6%; 95% CI, 20.4 to 35.5), transient ischemic attacks (41.9%; 95% CI, 34.8 to 49.3), and stroke mimics (45.6%; 95% CI, 33.5 to 58.0) during months of pandemic compared with the pre-pandemic period. The decline was most evident for mild symptoms (40% mild vs. 25%-29% moderate/severe). Although rates of intravenous thrombolytic (IVT) and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) decreased during pandemic, the likelihood of being treated with IVT and EVT did not differ between the two periods, both in primary and in comprehensive stroke centers (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.24 and OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.09, respectively). Rates of all strokes types decreased significantly during pandemic. It is of paramount importance that general population should be educated to seek medical care immediately for stroke-like symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic. Whether delay in initiation of secondary prevention would affect eventual stroke outcomes in the long run needs further study.","Ishaque, Butt, Kamtchum-Tatuene, Nomani, Razzaq, Fatima, Vekhande, Nair, Akhtar, Khan, Saqqur, Shuaib","https://doi.org/10.5853/jos.2021.01571","20220208","COVID-19; Fibrinolysis; Hospitalization; Meta-analysis; Stroke; Thrombectomy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26756,""

"Loss of Mental Health Support Among College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Purpose. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health concerns among college students. At the same time, pandemic response measures have made it more challenging for many students to access mental health support. However, little is known about the extent of mental health support loss among college students, or which students have lost support. This study investigated the scope of mental health support loss during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large university sample, as well as the factors associated with loss of support. Methods. Students completed an online questionnaire between March and May of 2020. Researchers examined the extent of mental health support loss in this sample and how support loss differed by a variety of demographic and mental health symptom variables. Methods were pre-registered at https://osf.io/m83hz. Results. Of n = 415 respondents, 62% reported loss of mental health support. Loss of support was associated with more severe depression symptoms (p < .001), more severe anxiety symptoms (p < .001), the presence of suicidal ideation (p < .001), and sexual minority identity (p = .017). Conclusions. Colleges and universities should be aware that many students have lost access to mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that students with more severe mental health symptoms, as well as sexual minority students, may be particularly vulnerable. Colleges and universities should make efforts to connect these students with sources of mental health support.","Isaac Ahuvia et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E005A-6E2-CD7","20220209","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; covid-19; support loss; treatment access; treatment loss; mental health; student; mental health support; college","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-10","",26759,""
