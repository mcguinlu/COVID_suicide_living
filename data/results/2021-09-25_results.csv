"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological health of individuals with mental health conditions: A mixed methods study","This study explored how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected individuals with mental health conditions. Participants were 477 adults (82% female) who reported a past-year mental health condition. They completed an online survey that included an open-ended question. Mixed methods analysis was conducted. While all mental health conditions were moderately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, self-reported impact on anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms was greater than for all other mental health symptoms. Thematic analysis revealed five themes: (1) the contribution of the pandemic to worsening mental health; (2) life interruptions due to the pandemic; (3) increased loneliness/isolation; (4) upsides of the pandemic; and (5) normalization of the anxieties previously experienced by those with mental health conditions. Individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions reported a worsening of symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and organizations must focus on supporting and increasing access to treatment for this population.","Miller, Mehak, Trolio, Racine","https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.23250","20210924","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; depression; mental health symptoms; mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18236,""
"[Addicted During Pandemic? - COVID-19 and Addictive Disorders]","To describe changes in consumer behavior, particularly in Germany, and the population groups affected due to in-creased substance use or are at greater risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 and are also in danger of suffering from a more severe course of disease. The literature search used databases from PubMed and PubPsych, along with expert opinions. A slight increase in daily use of alcohol and tobacco was seen, whereas the consumption of illegal drugs decreased in European countries. There was a drop in consumption among occasional users whereas among intensive users, there was an increase in consumption. Adults and children spent more time on media and internet activities during the pandemic. Anxiety, depression and stress could be the reason for the increased behavorial changes. People already suffering from an addiction were not only psychologically burdened but were also at higher risk of a SARS-CoV-2 infection or a severe progression of the disease. These results suggest possible societal trends which should be validated by larger representative surveys in the near future. Protecting risk groups and utilizing pandemic-adapted prevention measures are necessary. ZIEL: Es soll dargestellt werden, inwiefern sich das Konsumverhalten insbesondere in Deutschland verÃƒÂ¤ndert hat und welche BevÃƒÂ¶lkerungsgruppen von gesteigertem Konsum, erhÃƒÂ¶htem Infektionsrisiko und der Gefahr eines problematischeren Krankheitsverlaufs von COVID-19 betroffen sind. Mittels Literaturrecherche wurden in den Datenbanken PubMed und PubPsych zur Beantwortung der Fragestellungen geeignete Befragungen und ExperteneinschÃƒÂ¤tzungen ausgewÃƒÂ¤hlt. Bei Alkohol und Tabak ist ein leichter Anstieg des alltÃƒÂ¤glichen Gebrauchs zu beobachten, wÃƒÂ¤hrend der Konsum illegaler Drogen in Europa etwas abnimmt. Insgesamt ist bei Gelegenheitskonsumierenden eher ein RÃƒÂ¼ckgang und bei Hochkonsumierenden ein Anstieg des Konsums zu verzeichnen.

"Symptom networks of COVID-19-related versus other potentially traumatic events in a global sample","The potential mental health consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are widely acknowledged; however, limited research exists regarding the nature and patterns of stress responses to COVID-19-related potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and the convergence/divergence with responses to other (non-COVID-19-related) PTEs. Network analysis can provide a useful method for evaluating and comparing these symptom structures. The present study includes 7034 participants from 86 countries who reported on mental health symptoms associated with either a COVID-19-related PTE (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1838) or other PTE (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5196). Using network analysis, we compared the centrality and connections of symptoms within and between each group. Overall, results show that the COVID-19-related network includes transdiagnostic symptom associations similar to networks tied to PTEs unrelated to the pandemic. Findings provide evidence for a shared centrality of depression across networks and theoretically consistent connections between symptoms. Network differences included stronger connections between avoidance-derealization and hypervigilance-depression in the COVID-19 network. Present findings support the conceptualization of psychological responses to pandemic-related PTEs as a network of highly interconnected symptoms and support the use of a transdiagnostic approach to the assessment and treatment of mental health challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Williamson, Hoeboer, Primasari, Qing, Coimbra, Hovnanyan, Grace, Olff","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102476","20210924","COVID-19; Global mental health; Network analysis; Stress responses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18238,""

"Family functioning as a moderator in the relation between perceived stress and psychotic-like experiences among adolescents during COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has increased psychological stress among adolescents, and the relation between perceived stress (PS) and psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) has been well-established. However, little is known about the role of family functioning (FF) in this relation, especially when adolescents experienced the extended lockdown period with family members. A total of 4807 adolescents completed this retrospective paper-and-pencil survey after school reopening between May 14th and June 6th, 2020 in Hunan Province, China. We measured PS with the Perceived stress scale (PSS-10), PLEs with the eight positive items from Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE-8), and FF with the Family APGAR scale. We conducted subgroup analysis based on three FF levels (good, moderate, and poor) determined by previous studies. Finally, correlation and moderation analysis were performed to detect the effect of FF in the relation between PS and PLEs after adjusting for demographic variables. Adolescents with poor FF had higher levels of PS and higher prevalence of PLEs compared to those with good FF (both pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). FF was negatively associated with both PS (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.34, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) and PLEs (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.29, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Higher FF significantly attenuated the effect of PS on PLEs after adjusting for sex and age (effectÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.011, bootstrap 95% CI -0.018, -0.005). Our findings indicate that well-functioned family could protect against stress-induced PLEs among adolescents during this crisis. Thus family system could be an early interventional target for distressing psychotic-like experiences in youngsters.","Wu, Zou, Wang, Xiang, Zhu, Long, Tao, Palaniyappan, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2021.152274","20210924","Adolescent mental health during COVID-19; Family functioning; Perceived stress; Psychotic-like experiences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18240,""
"Parents' right strategy on preventing youngsters' recent suicidal ideation: a 13-year prospective cohort study","Suicide remains the second leading cause of death among youths. Family-related factors are considered important determinants of children's suicidal ideation, whereas their short-/long-term influence is seldom quantified. We aim to confirm the simultaneous/lagged effects of family-related factors on the occurrence of recent suicidal ideation from childhood to young adulthood (aged from 10 to 22Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old). Data were derived from a longitudinal prospective cohort study. Participants included 2065 students who were followed up for 13Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. Generalized estimating equations were used to clarify the influential effects of family-related factors on suicidal ideation during the past month. The peak of the rate of recent suicidal ideation arrived during junior high school years. Family interaction, family support, family involvement, and parental punishment had simultaneous effects on recent suicidal ideation. Family involvement, parental conflict, and psychological control had lagged and lasting effects on suicidal ideation. Notably, the lasting protective effects of family involvement were more obvious than simultaneous effects. Providing parents with sustained support and education to improve their ""positive parenting literacy"" can help with their children's mental health development. This is especially the case during COVID-19 quarantine periods when families spend the most time together at home.","Chiang, Lin, Li, Lee, Zhang, Lee, Chang, Wu, Yang","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2021.1979490","20210924","Suicidal ideation; adolescent; children; cohort study; family factors; generalized estimating equations; latent growth curve modeling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18241,""

"Suicidal Phenomenon in Pandemic Times The Trentino's Reality","Suicide is a major public health problem; according to the latest WHO data, it is among the top twenty causes of death in the world. After the sudden and unexpected spreading of a global pandemic in 2020, many mental health researchers have launched alarms about a possible suicide rates' rise, due to the inevitable consequences of the ongoing social and health emergency. However, recent articles in scientific literature have disconfirmed this thesis. Trentino also seems not to deviate from this dynamic: preliminary data, collected in an unconventional, and not yet official way, have been able to show that in 2020 the suicide rate remained stable. The finding that excludes up to date such a rise in rates does not unfortunately provide any guarantee that the situation will remain constant over time, and that there cannot be significant differences regarding gender, ethnicity, religious faith, sexual orientation or social class in determining a different impact of the current crisis on the suicidal phenomenon. Further studies and insights into the processing of the data in our possession are needed. Difficulties and uncertainties connected to the covid-19, with which it is now clear that the community will have to ""learn to live together"", could also in the medium and long term constitute a prolonged stress-generating element with a greater negative impact on the mental health of the population. It is essential, in light of the particular social and health situation we are experiencing, to carry out with even greater effectiveness, precision and continuity actions such as those promoted within the Invito alla Vita Project for the prevention of suicide, in order to guarantee the most effective prevention of this serious phenomenon. The psychological and social implications of the covid-19 pandemic will only be fully assessable in a few years, when the crisis will be effectively over. Only then we will be able to understand if the efforts put in place at a global level, and in particular in the province of Trento, have been effective in the managing of the suicidal phenomenon.","di Napoli","https://www.google.com/search?q=Suicidal+Phenomenon+in+Pandemic+Times.+The+Trentino's+Reality.","20210924","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18243,""
"Suicidality and COVID-19: Data from an Emergency Setting in Italy","Suicidality is a widespread phenomenon with a dramatic burden worldwide. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic determined a relevant impact on mental health, due to the infection itself and its socio-economic consequences. The present study is aimed at analyzing the prevalence of suicidality during the Covid-19 pandemic among subjects requiring a psychiatric consultation in an emergency setting. Socio-demographic and clinical information was collected at the emergency department of the General Hospital of Perugia from June 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020 to January 31<sup>st</sup>, 2021. Data was entered into an electronic datasheet and retrospectively analysed. Pearson's bivariate correlation was performed in order to assess significant associations between suicide-related variables and specific socio-demographic and clinical features (p&lt;0.05). Among 447 subjects included in the analysis, 109 (24.4%) showed suicidality-related phenomena, particularly suicide attempts (SA) (n=44, 9.8%), suicidal ideation (SI) (n=41, 9.2%), non suicidal self-injury (NSSI) (n=31, 6.9%), that in some cases co-occurred. A statistically significant association was detected between NSSI and living with marital family (p=0.024) and between suicidality-related phenomena and adjustment disorders (p=0.018). None of the examined subjects reported a previous positivity for Covid-19 and neither did their relatives. The present study confirms the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on suicide-related phenomena.

This observational study examined practitioners of psychiatric rehabilitation and therapeutic communities, focusing on the emotional aspects of patient care, in particular the fatigue of compassion, empathy and lack of hope, aspects that could be directly linked to the burnout of health professionals, as found in other similar studies. In this study, self-administered scale data was collected in 87 healthcare professionals recruited from 3 different psychiatric rehabilitation communities.

The results obtained after the administration of the following rating scales, ProQOL, BHS, SAVE-9, BDI-II and BEES, showed an overall increase in scores in all professional figures, a significant fatigue of compassion, while the percentage burnout is not present in several groups. The presence of high levels of hope, satisfaction of compassion is indicative of a moderate level of empathy in some professional figures; these high levels can protect workers from the risk of developing work-related stress and depressive symptoms. The data obtained with this study are not similar to those of previous studies, although they may indicate the importance of factors such as hope, empathy in the care of the patient with psychic disorders in rehabilitation communities, underlining the need for interventions aimed at the emotional management of the care relationship as a tool to improve care and prevent burnout even during times of high stress, such as managing a pandemic.","Vacca, MinÃƒÂ², Colizzi, Solomita, Longo, Franza, Tavormina","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Emotional+Impact+of+the+Operator+in+the+Care+of+Patients+With+Mental+Disorders+during+the+Pandemic:+Measure+of+Interventions+on+Compassion+Fatigue+and+Burn-Out.","20210924","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18247,""

The aim of this study was to examine what types of practical and emotional problems the general population is suffering from during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to construct an empirically derived inventory based on the findings. A total of 396 participants from the general public, with practical and/or emotional problems, accessed a self-guided digital problem-solving intervention for a period of one week to report and solve problems they experienced. Prior to accessing the intervention, participants completed a short self-assessment regarding symptoms of depression and anxiety. Content analysis was used to account for the types of problems participants reported. A set of items for an inventory was later proposed based on the problem categories derived from the analysis. A majority of participants had either clinically relevant symptoms of depression or anxiety. The problems reported were categorized as 13 distinct types of problems. The most common problem was difficulties managing daily activities. Based on the categories, a 13-items inventory was proposed. The 13 types of problems, and the proposed inventory, could be valuable when composing assessments and interventions for the general population during the ongoing pandemic or similar crises with societal restrictions.

Interventions targeting the fear of COVID-19 in the context of an individual's perceptions will likely enhance QoL during the pandemic.","Hayes, Apputhurai, Mikocka-Walus, Barreiro-de Acosta, Bernstein, Burgell, Burisch, Bennebroek Evertsz, Ferreira, Graff, Trindade, Gearry, Lo, Mokrowiecka, Moser, Petrik, Stengel, Knowles","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10880-021-09823-y","20210924","COVID-19 pandemic; Common sense model; Fear; Inflammatory bowel disease; Psychological distress; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18253,""
"Birth Satisfaction During the Early Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to describe birth satisfaction in women who gave birth in U.S. hospitals during the earliest months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-July 2020).Study Design and Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 747 postpartum women who gave birth in the United States during the early COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. Participants in the United were recruited via social media. They completed a questionnaire that included demographic, health, and obstetric experience questions, and the Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA) models, and nonparametric correlations were performed.Results: Higher birth satisfaction scores were associated with higher income, marriage, white race, vaginal birth, having a birth partner present, and sufficient support during birth. Factors negatively associated with birth satisfaction were separation from infant, unplanned cesarean birth, neonatal intensive care unit admission, hypertension, preeclampsia, hemorrhage, depression, and anxiety.Clinical Implications: Presence of birth partners, sufficient birth support, and minimizing separation of mother and infant improve birth satisfaction. Obstetric complications, including unplanned cesarean birth, negatively affect birth satisfaction. There are racial disparities in birth satisfaction. It is critical to develop further interventions to end racism in maternal health care.","Mollard, Kupzyk","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMC.0000000000000777","20210924","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18254,""
"Quarantine: use with care","This editorial discusses the psychological effects of isolation and quarantine in terms of both the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic and previous epidemics in the past 20 years. Although much of the literature is based on healthcare settings, there is emerging evidence from home or hotel quarantine, particularly concerning international travellers. Regardless of setting, depression, anxiety, anger and stress-related disorders are especially common but can vary according to demographic features and the characteristics of quarantine. Psychological effects may be minimised by clear and consistent advice from authorities, adequate supplies to meet basic needs, and minimising both the duration and the associated financial burden. There should also be adequate protection from possible infection and thus the resulting fear of contracting COVID-19 while in quarantine.","Kisely","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.1018","20210924","Stigma and discrimination; anxiety disorders; depressive disorders; ethics; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18255,""

"Associations between Mental Health, Alcohol Consumption and Drinking Motives during COVID-19Ã‚Â Second Lockdown in Ireland","The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has impacted the lives of people worldwide since March 2020. Social restrictions aimed at flattening the curve may be associated with an increase in mental health problems and have raised concerns regarding their effect on alcohol consumption. The objective of this study was to characterize changes in alcohol use during lockdown in Ireland and associations with drinking motives and psychopathological symptoms. We collected data from 713 adults (aged 18-60) during the second lockdown period (October/December 2020). By means of an online survey, participants self-reported their alcohol use before COVID and during lockdown. Motives to drink and psychopathological symptoms were also recorded. Our findings showed that 66% decreased their alcohol consumption, while 15% increased their alcohol consumption. An older age and coping motives were the strongest predictors of increased alcohol use during lockdown. Depression and hostility were the specific psychopathological dimensions associated with drinking to cope. Older adults who drink to cope-mainly with depression symptomatology-are an important at-risk population, in line with predictions from alcohol self-medication frameworks. Future research is needed to incorporate strategies into the public mental health ecosystem.","Carbia, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Cabrerizo, Cryan, Dinan","https://doi.org/10.1093/alcalc/agab067","20210924","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18257,""
"Caregiver wellbeing during Covid-19: does being hopeful play a role?","Background Informal (unpaid) carers represent a core component of health and social care systems. However, their experiences, health impacts and care needs during Covid-19 have been largely overlooked. This study aimed to explore the health and wellbeing impacts of Covid-19 on carers and the contribution of hopefulness. Methods Data were collected from an online survey hosted on the Qualtrics platform. Results Three hundred and sixty-nine participants consented to the survey. Data are reported on 186 participants with an 80% or higher completion rate. Most participants (&gt; 80%) reported poor sleep quality, while nearly half the sample met case threshold for anxiety (46.2%) and 29% for depression. Mood disturbance in carers was associated with higher levels of sleep disturbances. Positive wellbeing in carers was best predicted by having a more hopeful outlook and fewer symptoms of depression. Limitations A cross-sectional survey-based design that is unable to offer no definitive conclusions about the direction of the results. The study was also limited by having carer participants as the only informants. Conclusions Though informal carers are found in all areas of society, their experiences and health correlates during Covid-19 have not attracted much research attention. The additional and unique challenges of the pandemic for the health and wellbeing needs of carers must not be overlooked as is sadly so often the case. Instead, the experiences of carers and their needs should be prioritised, publicised, and matched by needs-led interventions. Identifying carers and enquiring about their wellbeing would be a laudable first step.","Onwumere, Kuipers, Wildman, Mason, Stahl","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100239","20210924","COVID-19; Care recipients; Caregivers; Carers; Families; Hope","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18258,""

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated non-pharmaceutical interventions on other notifiable infectious diseases in Germany: An analysis of national surveillance data during week 1-2016 - week 32-2020","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) affect healthcare seeking behaviour, access to healthcare, test strategies, disease notification and workload at public health authorities, but may also lead to a true change in transmission dynamics. We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic and NPIs on other notifiable infectious diseases under surveillance in Germany. We included 32 nationally notifiable disease categories with case numbers &gt;100/year in 2016-2019. We used quasi-Poisson regression analysis on a weekly aggregated time-series incorporating trend and seasonality, to compute the relative change in case numbers during week 2020-10 to 2020-32 (pandemic/NPIs), in comparison to week 2016-01 to 2020-09. During week 2020-10 to 2020-32, 216,825 COVID-19 cases, and 162,942 (-35%) cases of other diseases, were notified. Case numbers decreased across all ages and notification categories (all <i>p</i>&lt;0Ã¢â‚¬Â¢05), except for tick-borne encephalitis, which increased (+58%). The number of cases decreased most for respiratory diseases (from -86% for measles, to -12% for tuberculosis), gastro-intestinal diseases (from -83% for rotavirus gastroenteritis, to -7% for yersiniosis) and imported vector-borne diseases (-75% dengue fever, -73% malaria). The less affected infections were healthcare associated pathogens (from -43% infection/colonisation with carbapenem-non-susceptible <i>Acinetobacter</i>, to -28% for Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> invasive infection) and sexually transmitted and blood-borne diseases (from -28% for hepatitis B, to -12% for syphilis). During the COVID-19 pandemic a drastic decrease of notifications for most infectious diseases and pathogens was observed. Our findings suggest effects of NPIs on overall disease transmission that require further investigation.

"Hospitalization for self-harm during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in France: A nationwide retrospective observational cohort study","Little is known to date about the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on self-harm. The number of hospitalizations for self-harm (ICD-10 codes X60-X84) in France from 1st January to 31st August 2020 (including a two-month confinement) was compared to the same periods in 2017-2019. Statistical methods comprised Poisson regression, Cox regression and Student's <i>t</i>-test, plus Spearman's correlation test relating to spatial analysis of hospitalizations. There were 53,583 self-harm hospitalizations in France during January to August 2020. Compared to the same period in 2019, this represents an overall 8Ã‚Â·5% decrease (Relative Risk [95% Confidence Interval]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0Ã‚Â·91 [0Ã‚Â·90-0Ã‚Â·93]).This decrease started in the first week of confinement and persisted until the end of August. Similarly, decrease was found in both women (RR=0Ã‚Â·90 [0Ã‚Â·88-0Ã‚Â·92]) and men (RR=0Ã‚Â·94 [0Ã‚Â·91-0Ã‚Â·95]), and in all age groups, except 65 years and older. Regarding self-harm hospitalizations by means category, increases were found for firearm (RR=1Ã‚Â·20 [1Ã‚Â·03-1Ã‚Â·40]) and for jumping from heights (RR=1Ã‚Â·10 [1Ã‚Â·01-1Ã‚Â·21]). There was a trend for more hospitalizations in intensive care (RR=1Ã‚Â·03 [0Ã‚Â·99-1Ã‚Â·07]). The number of deaths at discharge from hospital also increased (Hazard RatioÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1Ã‚Â·19 [1Ã‚Â·09-1Ã‚Â·31]).

"Prediction of Mental Health in Medical Workers During COVID-19 Based on Machine Learning","Mental health prediction is one of the most essential parts of reducing the probability of serious mental illness. Meanwhile, mental health prediction can provide a theoretical basis for public health department to work out psychological intervention plans for medical workers. The purpose of this paper is to predict mental health of medical workers based on machine learning by 32 factors. We collected the 32 factors of 5,108 Chinese medical workers through questionnaire survey, and the results of Self-reporting Inventory was applied to characterize mental health. In this study, we propose a novel prediction model based on optimization algorithm and neural network, which can select and rank the most important factors that affect mental health of medical workers. Besides, we use stepwise logistic regression, binary bat algorithm, hybrid improved dragonfly algorithm and the proposed prediction model to predict mental health of medical workers. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is 92.55%, which is better than the existing algorithms. This method can be used to predict mental health of global medical worker. In addition, the method proposed in this paper can also play a role in the appropriate work plan for medical worker.","Wang, Li, Sun, Zhang, Wang, Dong, Guo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.697850","20210924","COVID-19; artificial intelligence; machine learning; mental health; neural network; prediction; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18262,""
"Level of anxiety among healthcare providers during COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia: cross-sectional study","The burden of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted widely on the healthcare providers physically and mentally. Many healthcare providers are exposed to psychological stressors due to their high risk of contracting the virus. This study aimed to measure the level of anxiety among healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. In addition, this study aimed to measure the level of anxiety based on demographic characteristics. A cross-sectional survey was employed to recruit a convenience sample of healthcare providers. A pencil and paper self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data from demographic and generalized anxiety disorder GAD-7 data. However, this study received written informed consent from participants of the study. In addition, the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Dr. Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Group (IRB Log No. RC20.06.88-03). A total of 650 participants were recruited, results of GAD-7 showed that 43.5%, 28.9% and 27.5% of healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia experienced mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicated that age, health specialty, nationality, and sleeping disorders before COVID-19 were associated with anxiety levels. The generalized anxiety among healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia was mild. Older healthcare providers were found to have a higher level of anxiety compared to other participating healthcare providers. Several factors may contribute to a higher level of anxiety including age, socioeconomic status, marital status, having chronic conditions, and sleeping disorder before the COVID-19 pandemic. To further understand the level of anxiety among healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia, longitudinal and mixed-method research is needed.","Al Mutair, Al Mutairi, Alabbasi, Shamsan, Al-Mahmoud, Alhumaid, Arshad, Awad, Rabaan","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.12119","20210924","Anxiety; COVID-19; Health care facilities; Healthcare provider; Mental health; Saudi Arabia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18263,""
"Psychological Burden During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany","After the first COVID-19 case was diagnosed in Germany, various measures limiting contact between people were introduced across the country. The implementation of these measures varied between jurisdictions and potentially had a negative impact on the psychological well-being of many people. However, the prevalence, severity, and type of symptoms of psychological burden has not been documented in detail. In the current study, we analysed various self-reported symptoms of psychological burden in a German sample. The dataset was collected between April 8th and June 1st, 2020, through an online survey measuring psychological burden using the ICD-10-symptom rating scale. More than 2,000 individuals responded to the survey, with a total of 1,459 complete datasets. Data was then sampled to compare (1) the new data to an existing demographically comparable reference dataset including a total of 2,512 participants who did not undergo any kind of contact restrictions or other pandemic measurements, and (2) psychological burden in two different German states. In line with recent observations from Germany, Italy, China, Austria and Turkey, we found a high prevalence of depressive symptoms in comparison to the reference sample. Furthermore, we found a high prevalence of eating disorder and compulsion symptoms. Especially younger adults and women reported a higher symptom severity compared to other groups during our measurement period.

"Fear of COVID 19 Infection Across Different Cohorts: A Scoping Review","<b>Background:</b> Psychological stressors like panic, fear, phobia, etc., are being substantially reported during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the prior outbreaks, fear of being infected was reported as the prominent suicide stressor. Therefore, fear of infection has become a concern in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic because it worsens emotion, cognition, and behavioral responses. Understanding the extent of fear of COVID-19 infection in various cohorts would aid in gauging the mental health services, which was a remedy in the present review. <b>Methods:</b> Adhering to Arksey and O'Malley's framework for conducting a scoping review, a systematic search was performed in the month of September 2020 in several databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, etc. Considering the inclusion criteria, a total of 14 articles were included in the present review. <b>Results:</b> All of the included studies were conducted via online platforms, whereas all but one of the studies were cross-sectional in nature (including a mixed-method study, and a comparative study). Most of the studies were conducted among the general population (<i>n</i> = 12), within March and May 2020 (<i>n</i> = 9), from Asian countries (<i>n</i> = 7), and considered a self-developed item for fear of COVID-19 assessment (<i>n</i> = 8; whereas the Fear of COVID-19 Scale was used in 6-studies). The prevalence of fear of COVID-19 was reported to be 18.1-45.2%, although no cutoff point or criteria was mentioned for such a prevalence estimation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. However, females, younger adults, urban residents, divorcees, healthcare workers, those in quarantine settings, those in suspicion of being infected, and those with mental health problems, etc., were found to be at an increased risk of COVID-19 fear. <b>Conclusions:</b> Being one of the first reviews in this context, the findings are anticipated to be helpful to predict the possible solutions for reducing fear of COVID-19 and facilitate further studies on strategies of how to alleviate such a stressful situation.","Quadros, Garg, Ranjan, Vijayasarathi, Mamun","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.708430","20210924","COVID-19 and psychological impact; COVID-19 fear; Covid-19 panic; fear of COVID-19; fear of infection; mental health; prevalence and risk factors; scoping review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18265,""
"How Negative Is Negative Information","Daily, we face a plenty of negative information that can profoundly affect our perception and behavior. During devastating events such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, negative messages may hinder reasoning at individual level and social decisions in the society at large. These effects vary across genders in neurotypical populations (being more evident in women) and may be even more pronounced in individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression. Here, we examine how negative information impacts reasoning on a social perception task in females with breast cancer, a life-threatening disease. Two groups of patients and two groups of matched controls (<i>N</i> <sub>TO</sub> <sub>TAL</sub> = 80; median age, 50 years) accomplished a psychometrically standardized social cognition and reasoning task receiving either the standard instruction solely or additional negative information. Performance substantially dropped in patients and matched controls who received negative information compared to those who did not. Moreover, patients with negative information scored much lower not only compared with controls but also with patients without negative information. We suggest the effects of negative information are mediated by the distributed brain networks involved in affective processing and emotional memory. The findings offer novel insights on the impact of negative information on social perception and decision making during life-threatening events, fostering better understanding of its neurobiological underpinnings.","Simoes, Sokolov, Hahn, Fallgatter, Brucker, Wallwiener, Pavlova","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2021.742576","20210924","breast cancer; depression and anxiety; devastating events; gender impact; negative information; neural networks; social cognition; social reasoning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18266,""
"Mental Health, Work Satisfaction and, Quality of Life Among Healthcare Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic in an Indonesian Sample","During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals (HCP) might experience mental health problems and work-related stress, which can lead to less satisfaction at work and decreased health and quality of life in the long period. This study aims to explore the role of mental health and workplace satisfaction on the quality of life in health professionals who are involved in handling the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was a cross-sectional approach using purposive sampling techniques. The online survey was conducted from May through September 2020. A total of 200 respondents from the West Java province in Indonesia were included. Data on mental health, work satisfaction, and quality of life were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and multivariate regression analysis. Responses to open questions regarding concerns and strengths were analyzed using thematic analysis. An increased mental health symptom experienced by healthcare professionals was associated with decreased health status (ÃŽÂ²=-0.724, p=0.001) and self-perceived health (ÃŽÂ²=-0.59, p=0.001). Further, serving patients with COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ²=-0.133, p=0.024) was related to lower health status. Five themes emerged regarding concerns about being exposed to COVID-19, namely 1) fear of transmitting the virus, 2) the impact of COVID-19 on family life, 3) death and isolation, 4) personal safety, and 5) social stigma. Five themes emerged regarding the source of encouragement and strength, ie. 1) religiosity, 2) social support systems, 3) the moral responsibility of the profession, 4) following health and safety protocols, and 5) acceptance and positive attitudes towards the future. Mental health problems impacted the quality of life. Serving patients with COVID-19 could predict lower health status. HCPs' concerns and sources of strength when exposed to COVID-19 are discussed. Our results give a better understanding of the factors that can decrease and improve HCPs' quality of life, therefore can be used to design psychological interventions to lower HCP's psychological problems and improving their quality of life.","Iskandarsyah, Shabrina, Djunaidi, Siswadi","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S330676","20210924","COVID-19; mental health; pandemic; quality of life; work satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18267,""
"Communicating COVID-19 Vaccine Safety: Knowledge and Attitude Among Residents of South East, Nigeria","The fight against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has continued to threaten human existence globally, has led to the development of vaccines in order to control the rate of infection and death associated with the disease. Media messages on the COVID-19 vaccine are geared towards raising audience awareness and understanding of health risks, knowledge and attitudes about the vaccine safety. The study examined the knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine safety media messages amongst residents of South East, Nigeria. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among 399 respondents (18-47 years) in both urban and rural communities of South East, Nigeria from May 6th to July 4th, 2021. The survey was carried out using structured self administered questionnaire containing the respondents' demographics, knowledge and attitudes towards media messages regarding COVID-19 vaccine safety. The data were analysed using the SPSS version 26 software. Result was presented in frequencies, percentages and charts showing the interrelatedness of the variables examined. Regression ANOVA was used to test hypotheses on the extent to which level of exposure to COVID-19 media messages predict their knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine safety at <i>P</i>&lt;0.05 level of significance. Data indicate respondents are apprehensive of taking the COVID-19 vaccine. Approximately, 91% of respondents are between the ages of 18 and 27 years. Meanwhile, 26.1% of the respondents agreed that media messages on COVID-19 vaccine is very assuring and convincing as regards human safety; 42.4% disagreed on the safety of COVID-19 vaccine safety messages; 26.1% rated vaccine messages as moderate as regards human safety, while 5.5% rated the vaccine messages as poor. Knowledge of respondents regarding the safety of the vaccine was low and respondents' attitude was negative in South East, Nigeria. The implication is indicative of the failure of the main stream media in educating the general public on pertinent health issues relevant to them. Knowledge regarding media messages on COVID-19 vaccine safety is low. Messages on COVID-19 vaccine safety were not sufficient and convincing. Consequently, there is a negative attitude towards the vaccine. Hence, improving knowledge and adoptive attitude amongst respondents amidst COVID-19 is critical.","Anorue, Ugwu, Ugboaja, Nwabunze, Ugwulor-Onyinyechi, Njoku","https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S329183","20210924","COVID-19; attitude; knowledge; media advocacies; safety; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18268,""
"Resilience and mental health in individuals with spinal cord injury during the COVID-19 pandemic","Cross-sectional, observational study. To understand how resilience, access to personal care attendants (PCAs) and medical supplies, and concerns about medical rationing, finances, and social isolation are related to overall and mental health in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Community dwelling adults (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°187) with SCI. Data were collected online between May 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020. Outcomes were overall and mental health, depression and anxiety symptoms, and quality of life (QoL). Predictors were resilience, access to PCAs and medical supplies, and concerns about medical rationing, finances, and social isolation. Incomplete injury, concern about medical rationing, medical supply disruption, and social isolation predicted a greater perceived impact of the pandemic on overall heath. Younger age, decreased resilience, and concern about medical rationing and social isolation predicted greater perceived impact of the pandemic on mental health. Decreased resilience and concern about medical rationing and finances predicted increased anxiety symptoms. Incomplete injury, believing that medical rationing was occurring, decreased resilience, and concern about finances and social isolation predicted increased depressive symptoms. Decreased resilience and concern about finances, medical rationing, and social isolation predicted lower QoL. The negative effects of the pandemic on the overall and mental health of individuals with SCI may be ameliorated by resilience. In future crises, it may be beneficial to screen individuals for resilience so that those with decreased resilience are offered the appropriate resources to enhance resilience and improve overall wellbeing.","Mikolajczyk, Draganich, Philippus, Goldstein, Erin Andrews, Pilarski, Wudlick, Morse, Monden","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41393-021-00708-3","20210924","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18269,""
"Substance and Internet use during the COVID-19 pandemic in China","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has adversely influenced human physical and mental health, including emotional disorders and addictions. This study examined substance and Internet use behavior and their associations with anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online self-report questionnaire was administered to 2196 Chinese adults between February 17 and 29, 2020. The questionnaire contained the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), questions on demographic information, and items about substance and Internet use characteristics. Our results revealed that males consumed less alcohol (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and areca-nut (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.012) during the pandemic than before the pandemic. Age, gender, education status, and occupation significantly differed among increased substance users, regular substance users, and nonsubstance users. Time spent on the Internet was significantly longer during the pandemic (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and 72% of participants reported increased dependence on the Internet. Compared to regular Internet users, increased users were more likely to be younger and female. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that age &lt;33 years (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.034, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), increased substance use (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.439, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and increased Internet use (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.914, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) were significantly associated with depression. Moreover, anxiety was significantly related to female gender (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.065, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), ""unmarried"" status (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.480, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.017), nonstudents (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.946-3.030, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and increased substance use (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.291, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Although there was a significant decrease in social substance use during the pandemic, more attention should be paid to increased Internet use. Increased Internet use was significantly associated with both anxiety and depression, and increased substance use was related to depression. Professional support should be provided to vulnerable individuals to prevent addiction.","Huang, Chen, Huang, Shao, Liao, Lin, Li, Qi, Cai, Shen","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01614-1","20210924","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18270,""
"Comparison of deliberate self-harm incidents attended by Helicopter Emergency Medical Services before and during the first wave of COVID-19 in the East of England","There is significant interest in the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) attend the most seriously unwell and injured patients in the community; their data therefore present an early opportunity to examine self-harm trends. The primary aim was to compare the incidence of deliberate self-harm incident (DSH-I) encounters by HEMS before and during the first wave of COVID-19. Data were obtained from all three East of England HEMS: total number of activations and stand-downs, number of DSH-I activations and stand-downs, self-harm mechanism and number of 'severe' DSH-I patient encounters, in two 61-day periods: 1 March to 30 April in 2019 (control) and 2020 (COVID-19). Severe DSH-I was defined as cardiac arrest and/or died prehospital. Proportions were compared with a Fisher's exact test. There were a total of 1725 HEMS activations: n=981 (control) and n=744 (COVID-19), a decrease of 24.2% during COVID-19. DSH-I patient encounters increased by 65.4%: n=26 (control) and n=43 (COVID-19). The proportion of encounters that were DSH-I and severe DSH-I both significantly increased during COVID-19: p=0.002 and p=0.001, respectively. The absolute number of hangings and falls from height both approximately tripled during COVID-19, whereas the number of other mechanisms remained almost constant. Despite a reduction in overall HEMS patient encounters, there were significant increases in both the proportion of DSH-Is and their severity attended by HEMS during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the East of England.","Stevens, Price, Hazlerigg, McLachlan, Barnard","https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2020-210393","20210924","mental health; prehospital care; self harm; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18271,""
"Different Reflections of the Face Mask: Sleepiness, Headache and Psychological Symptoms","The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant physical and mental effects on healthcare workers. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between wearing face masks and headache, sleepiness, mood, and anxiety symptoms in healthcare workers. A survey was administered to 365 healthcare workers working during the pandemic. The Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale were used to assess depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and daytime sleepiness, respectively. Participants were also asked about for new-onset headaches. Almost half of the participants (47.6%) reported new-onset headaches, and 23.2% reported excessive daytime sleepiness. The frequencies of depressive and anxiety symptoms were 43.7% and 59.2%, respectively. Sleepiness scores and new-onset headache frequency were higher in women and those using filtering facepiece respirators. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between mask-wearing duration, depressive and anxiety symptoms scores, and sleepiness score. The present study has shown that many healthcare workers wearing face masks suffered from sleepiness, headaches, and psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings indicate the importance of improving working conditions and planning psychological interventions for healthcare workers.","Cigiloglu, Ozturk, Ganidagli, Ozturk","https://doi.org/10.1080/10803548.2021.1984712","20210924","COVID-19; Face mask; headache; healthcare workers; sleepiness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18272,""
"Stress level and general mental state in Polish pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to mental state worsening. Mental health disorders in pregnancy are known to have adverse outcomes both for mothers and their children. It is the first study in Poland to investigate the impact of the pandemic on stress level and general mental state in pregnant women. Three hundred sixteen pregnant women completed an online survey containing four instruments. The main research questions were investigated with Bayesian regression analyses. We found that 37% of pregnant women presented with some mental state disorders and almost 46% with elevated emotional tension. Seventeen % had elevated stress level, 11% elevated intrapsychic stress level and 13% elevated outward stress level. Both 'being scared of lack of social support...' and 'being scared of infection...' have an impact on stress level, however the first factor is a more substantial stressor. Multiple pregnant women during the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presented with mental state disorders and elevated stress levels. As mental state disorders contribute to adverse neonatal outcomes and maternal mortality, it is imperative to focus on pregnant women's psychological and psychiatric conditions during the pandemic. It seems crucial to use screening tests to make early psychiatric diagnoses.","Mikolajkow, MaÃ…â€šyszczak","https://doi.org/10.1080/02646838.2021.1976402","20210924","COVID-19; Stress; coronavirus; mental health; pregnancy; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-25","",18273,""
