"The prevalence, incidence and risk factors of mental health problems and mental health services use before and 9 months after the COVID-19 outbreak among the general Dutch population A 3-wave prospective study","Objectives. Gain insight in the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence, the incidence and risk factors of mental health problems among the Dutch general population and different age groups in November-December 2020, compared to the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors in the same period in 2018 and 2019. More specifically, the prevalence, incidence and risk factors of anxiety and depression symptoms, sleep problems, fatigue, disabilities due to health problems, use of medicines for sleep problems, medicines for anxiety and depression, and mental health services use. Methods. We extracted data from the LISS (Longitudinal Internet studies for the Social Sciences) panel that is based a probability sample of the Dutch population of 16 years and older by Statistics Netherlands. We used three waves of the longitudinal Health module held in November-December 2018 (T1), November-December 2019 (T2) and November-December 2020 (T3), and selected respondents who were 18 years and older at T1. Data were weighted using 16 demographics profiles of the Dutch adult population (Nstudy sample=4,064). The course of mental health problems was examined with repeated measures multivariate logistic regression analyses, and the differences in incidence with multivariate logistic regression analyses. In both types of analyses, we controlled for sex, age, marital status, employment status, education level and physical disease. Results. The repeated measures multivariate logistic regression analyses among the total study sample did not reveal a significant increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms, sleep problems, fatigue, disabilities due to health problems, use of medicines for sleep problems, medicines for anxiety and depression, and mental health services use in November-December 2020, compared to November-December 2018 and 2019 (that is, T3 did not differ from T1 and T2). Among the four different age categories (18-34, 35-49, 50-64, and 65 years old and older respondents), 50-64 years respondents had a significantly lower prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms at T3 than at T1 and T2, while T1 and T2 did not differ. A similar pattern among 65+ respondents was found for mental health services use. We found no indications that the incidence of examined health problems at T2 (no problem at T1, problem at T2) and T3 (no problem at T2, problem at T3) differed. Risk factors for mental health problems at T2 were mostly similar to risk factors at T3; sex and age were less associated with sleep problems at T3, compared to T2. Conclusions. The prevalence, incidence and risk factors of examined mental health problems examined nine months after the COVID-19 outbreak appear to be very stable across the end of 2018, 2019 and 2020 among the Dutch adult population and different age categories, suggesting that the Dutch adult population (20 years and older) in general is rather resilient given all disruptions due to this pandemic.","Peter G van der Velden; Miquelle Marchand; Marcel Das; Ruud Muffels; Mark Bosmans","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21251952","20210302","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11320,""
"Factors Associated with Serious Psychological Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan","Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have a negative impact on mental health, leading to higher suicide rates in many countries. However, little is known about the factors associated with worsened mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: To investigate the factors associated with serious psychological distress (SPD) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional study using a large-scale internet survey conducted between August 25 and September 30, 2020, in Japan. Exposures: Demographics (age, gender, marital status, family composition, and caregiving burden), socio-economic status (income level, employment type, educational attainment); the experience of domestic violence (DV), the state of emergency, fear of COVID-19, and stigma related to COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of SPD, defined as Kessler 6 scale score [&ge;]13. Results: Among 25,482 individuals included in this study, 2,556 (10%) met the criteria of SPD. Overall, women (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.59; 95%CI, 1.17-2.16; P=0.003), ages 15-29 (aOR compared with ages 45-59, 2.35; 95%CI, 1.64-3.38; P<0.001), low income (aOR compared with intermediate income, 1.70; 95%CI, 1.16-2.49; P=0.007), those who provide caregiving to family members (aOR, 5.48; 95%CI, 3.51-8.56; P<0.001), experiencing DV (aOR, 5.72; 95%CI, 3.81-8.59; P<0.001), and fear of COVID-19 (aOR, 1.96; 95%CI, 1.55-2.48; P<0.001) were associated with a higher prevalence of SPD. Among women aged 15-29 years who experienced the highest rate of SPD, caregiving, DV, fear of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related stigma were associated with a higher likelihood of SPD; whereas economic situation (income level and employment type) and social isolation (marital status) were not associated with the prevalence of SPD. Conclusions and Relevance: Economic situation, caregiving burden, DV, and fear of COVID-19 were independently associated with SPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among young women--who have a higher risk of suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan--similar factors, except economic situation, were associated with a higher rate of SPD. Targeted interventions based on age and gender may be more effective in mitigating the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population's mental health.","Takashi Yoshioka; Ryo Okubo; Takahiro Tabuchi; Satomi Odani; Tomohiro Shinozaki; Yusuke Tsugawa","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252458","20210301","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11321,""
"Estimating the burden of post-COVID-19 syndrome in a population-based cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals: Implications for healthcare service planning","Objective To assess the prevalence of impaired health status and physical and mental health symptoms among individuals at least six months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to characterise their healthcare utilisation.<BR> Design Population-based prospective cohort study.<BR> Setting Zurich SARS-CoV-2 Cohort, Zurich, Switzerland.<BR> Participants 431 adults from the general population with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reported to health authorities between 27 February 2020 and 05 August 2020.<BR> Main outcome measures We assessed the proportion of individuals reporting not having fully recovered since SARS-CoV-2 infection, the proportion reporting fatigue (assessed by Fatigue Assessment Scale), dyspnoea (assessed by mMRC dyspnoea scale) or depression (assessed by DASS-21) at six to eight months after diagnosis. We further evaluated the proportion of individuals with at least one healthcare contact since their acute illness. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with the main outcomes.<BR> Results Symptoms were present in 385 (89%) participants at diagnosis and 81 (19%) were initially hospitalised. At six to eight months, 111 (26%) reported not having fully recovered. 233 (55%) participants reported symptoms of fatigue, 96 (25%) had at least grade 1 dyspnoea, and 111 (26%) had DASS-21 scores indicating symptoms of depression. 170 (40%) participants reported at least one general practitioner visit related to COVID-19 after acute illness, and 10% (8/81) of initially hospitalised individuals were rehospitalised. Individuals that have not fully recovered or suffer from fatigue, dyspnoea or depression were more likely to have further healthcare contacts. However, a third of individuals (37/111) that have not fully recovered did not seek further care.<BR> Conclusion In our population-based study, a relevant proportion of individuals suffered from longer-term consequences after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings indicate that a considerable number of individuals affected by post-COVID-19 syndrome is to be expected, and that a wide range of additional healthcare services and integrative approaches will be required to support the recovery of these individuals. Thus, the timely planning of resources and services for post-COVID-19 care will be necessary alongside public health measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.<BR> Registration ISRCTN14990068","Dominik Menges; Tala Ballouz; Alexia Anagnostopoulos; Helene E Aschmann; Anja Domenghino; Jan S Fehr; Milo A Puhan","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.27.21252572","20210301","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11322,""
"We are not alone: Melatonin and vitamin d may be good company during covid-19 pandemic","Loneliness and social isolation are associated with depression, anxiety and a progressive loss of higher cognitive faculties, mainly in older adults  In the current pandemic situation, with serious restrictions that limit interactions with members of our social circles, these cognitive alterations are becoming progressively more obvious in young adults, adolescents and even children  With the addition of eating disorders, sleep disturbances, and lack of exposure to solar radiation due to confinement, the condition can be considerably worse  Fortunately, there are two allies which from a psychological point of view, have many common features and could help to reverse some of the effects of social isolation;these molecules are melatonin and vitamin D  Their complementary functions on circadian rhythmicity may be useful in reestablishing mood balance  Thus, we suggest a re-education in new hygienic-dietary habits, especially related to the maintenance of adequate levels of melatonin and vitamin D, which may help prevent and possibly reverse the cognitive and psychological disorders until social contact is reestablished  Â© 2021, Rangsit University  All rights reserved","MenÃ©ndez, S.

"COVID-19: lessons and experiences from South Africa's first surge","On 5 March 2020, South Africa recorded its first case of imported COVID-19. Since then, cases in South Africa have increased exponentially with significant community transmission. A multisectoral approach to containing and mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 was instituted, led by the South African National Department of Health. A National COVID-19 Command Council was established to take government-wide decisions. An adapted World Health Organiszion (WHO) COVID-19 strategy for containing and mitigating the spread of the virus was implemented by the National Department of Health. The strategy included the creation of national and provincial incident management teams (IMTs), which comprised of a variety of work streams, namely, governance and leadership; medical supplies; port and environmental health; epidemiology and response; facility readiness and case management; emergency medical services; information systems; risk communication and community engagement; occupational health and safety and human resources. The following were the most salient lessons learnt between March and September 2020: strengthened command and control were achieved through both centralised and decentralised IMTs; swift evidenced-based decision-making from the highest political levels for instituting lockdowns to buy time to prepare the health system; the stringent lockdown enabled the health sector to increase its healthcare capacity. Despite these successes, the stringent lockdown measures resulted in economic hardship particularly for the most vulnerable sections of the population.","Moonasar, Devanand; Pillay, Anban; Leonard, Elizabeth; Naidoo, Raveen; Mngemane, Shadrack; Ramkrishna, Wayne; Jamaloodien, Khadija; Lebese, Lebogang; Chetty, Kamy; Bamford, Lesley; Tanna, Gaurang; Ntuli, Nhlanhla; Mlisana, Koleka; Madikizela, Lindiwe; Modisenyane, Moeketsi; Engelbrecht, Christie; Maja, Popo; Bongweni, Funeka; Furumele, Tsakani; Mayet, Natalie; Goga, Ameena; Talisuna, Ambrose; Ramadan, Otim Patrick Cossy; Pillay, Yogan","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004393","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Glob Health;6(2)2021 02.; Publication details: BMJ Glob Health;6(2)2021 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11339,""
"Addressing the critical need for long-term mental health data during the COVID-19 pandemic: Changes in mental health from April to September 2020","Despite the large amounts of research currently being conducted and the high number of editorials warning about the potential mental health impacts, there is a stunning lack of mental health data on the effects of the pandemic. Yet, the pandemic may have sizable impacts on psychological distress and health behaviors -these effects may be long-lasting and may disproportionately affect some demographic groups more than others. Data came from a longitudinal international study of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults' psychological distress and wellbeing (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1567). We found high rates of depression (55% were diagnosable with probable depression at baseline), anxiety (65%), and risk for PTSD (51%). More than one-third of participants who reported that they drank alcohol indicated that their drinking had increased since the start of the pandemic. Over time, depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts and behaviors increased significantly, but acute stress symptoms decreased. Specific demographic groups (people of color and sexual and gender minorities) appeared to be at high risk of distress across analyses. Our findings suggest high rates of depression, anxiety, acute stress, and other signs of distress like isolation, hopelessness, and use of substances to cope - even at five-month follow-up. Our findings suggest a need to prioritize availability of, and access to, mental health care during both the pandemic and the recovery.","Veldhuis, Nesoff, McKowen, Rice, Ghoneima, Wootton, Papautsky, Arigo, Goldberg, Anderson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106465","20210301","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11340,""

A sample of two-hundred-three responses depicted that there is a significant and positive correlation between perceived stress and depressive tendencies. Further, working from-for home significantly acts as a mediator between the two variables. Moreover, there is no significant interaction between family status and working from-for home on depressive tendencies. However, there is a significant interaction between marital status and working from-for home on depressive tendencies.

"Adolescent Girls and Alcohol Use: Increasing Concern During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Adolescence is a time known for risky behaviors and often the initiation of alcohol use. Readily available, alcohol is often one of the drugs of choice for adolescents. Whereas in the past 30 years, the overall consumption of alcohol is down, the data in the past 10 years have shown more girls are binge drinking and meeting criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD). The alarm of early alcohol use is the association with problems with the substances later in life. Historically, men and male adolescents consumed more alcohol than females. Recent studies indicate girls' alcohol use surpasses boys, whereas women now are developing AUD at the same rate as men. The consequences of early use can result in women's increased risk for multiple cancers, having a more severe form of AUD with less alcohol consumption as well as premature death. To further exacerbate this growing concern, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created a perfect storm for increased use of alcohol to cope with the stress of living in an uncertain world. Normal daily activities have been halted with the uncertainty of school closures, zoom classroom sessions, and living in mandated social isolation. All nurses need to be screening for how families under their care have been managing stress. The time is opportune to educate and support parents in engaging their children in conversations around substance use. Parents can be supported to increase awareness of their own coping mechanisms and strengthen positive coping. Adolescents need support to strengthen interpersonal skills as well as make informed decisions concerning when and how they engage in alcohol consumption. This article will illuminate the growing need for all healthcare providers to assess and guide adolescents' coping skills during COVID with a focus on mental health, high-risk behavior, and alcohol use.","Smith, Bryant, Fogger","https://doi.org/10.1097/JAN.0000000000000388","20210301","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11343,""
"Implementing an Integrated Multi-Technology Platform for Drug Checking: Social, Scientific, and Technological Considerations","The illicit drug overdose crisis in North America continues to devastate communities with fentanyl detected in the majority of illicit drug overdose deaths. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened concerns of even greater unpredictability in the drug supplies and unprecedented rates of overdoses. Portable drug-checking technologies are increasingly being integrated within overdose prevention strategies. These emerging responses are raising new questions about which technologies to pursue and what service models can respond to the current risks and contexts. In what has been referred to as the epicenter of the overdose crisis in Canada, a multi-technology platform for drug checking is being piloted in community settings using a suite of chemical analytical methods to provide real-time harm reduction. These include infrared absorption, Raman scattering, gas chromatography with mass spectrometry, and antibody-based test strips. In this Perspective, we illustrate some advantages and challenges of using multiple techniques for the analysis of the same sample, and provide an example of a data analysis and visualization platform that can unify the presentation of the results and enable deeper analysis of the results. We also highlight the implementation of a various service models that co-exist in a research setting, with particular emphasis on the way that drug checking technicians and harm reduction workers interact with service users.

"Major bleeding complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia","As patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) have high rates of thrombosis, high doses of thromboprophylaxis have been proposed. The associated bleeding risk remains unknown. We investigated major bleeding complications in ICU COVID-19 patients and we examined their relationship with inflammation and thromboprophylaxis. Retrospective monocentric study of consecutive adult patients admitted in ICU for COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. Data collected included demographics, anticoagulation status, coagulation tests and outcomes including major bleeding and thrombotic events. Among 56 ICU COVID-19 patients, 10 (18%) patients had major bleeding and 16 (29%) thrombotic events. Major bleeding occurred later than thrombosis after ICU admission [17(14-23) days versus 9(3-11) days respectively (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.005)]. Fibrinogen concentration always decreased several days [4(3-5) days] before bleeding; D-dimers followed the same trend. All bleeding patients were treated with anticoagulants and anticoagulation was overdosed for 6 (60%) patients on the day of bleeding or the day before. In the whole cohort, overdose was measured in 22 and 78% of patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation during fibrinogen increase and decrease respectively (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Coagulation disorders had biphasic evolution during COVID-19: first thrombotic events during initial hyperinflammation, then bleeding events once inflammation reduced, as confirmed by fibrinogen and D-dimers decrease. Most bleeding events complicated heparin overdose, promoted by inflammation decrease, suggesting to carefully monitor heparin during COVID-19. Thromboprophylaxis may be adapted to this biphasic evolution, with initial high doses reduced to standard doses once the high thrombotic risk period ends and fibrinogen decreases, to prevent bleeding events.","Godier, Clausse, Meslin, Bazine, Lang, Huche, Cholley, Hamada","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-021-02403-9","20210301","Anticoagulant; Bleeding; COVID-19; Fibrinogen; Inflammation; Thrombosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11345,""

An increase in adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) has been widely predicted, but empirical evidence is still scarce. This study aimed to (1) generate representative data on pandemic-related stress, parental stress, general stress, parental subjective and mental health, and the occurrence of ACEs; (2) identify risk factors for an increase in ACEs, and (3) provide qualitative data on parents' experiences. A representative survey was conducted in Germany in August 2020 with 1024 parents of underage children (M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°41.70, 50.9% female). More than 50% of parents reported being stressed by social distancing and the closure of schools and childcare facilities. Parental stress increased significantly during the pandemic (dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.21). Subgroups of parents also reported very high levels of depressive symptoms (12.3%) and anxiety (9.7%). Up to one-third of the sample reported ACEs in the child's lifetime. In this group, 29.1% reported an increase in children witnessing domestic violence during the pandemic, and 42.2% an increase verbal emotional abuse. These families were characterized by higher parental stress, job losses, and younger parent and child age. Positive aspects of the pandemic related primarily to personal or family life (e.g. slower pace of life, increase in family time). While some parents coped well, a particularly negative pattern was observed in a subgroup of families that experienced an increase in ACEs.

"COVID-19: Association Between Increase of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia During Lockdown and Caregivers' Poor Mental Health","From March 2020, the support and care systems for caregivers and people with dementia (PWD) were suspended or dramatically changed due to the lockdown during the world pandemic of COVID-19. Thus, these changes in living conditions have had deleterious consequences on the behavior of PWD and subsequently on their caregivers' mental health, the two being linked. Our study aimed to examine changes in behavior among PWD and to look for associations between the evolution of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and caregivers' mental health in the context of COVID-19. The study was conducted among caregivers of PWD living at home in France. Caregivers were interviewed via an anonymous cross-sectional online survey during the first lockdown between April 15 and June 15, 2020. Three hundred and eighty-nine caregivers accompanying a relative living at home participated in the study; 43.3%of the PWD presented a worsening of BPSD during the lockdown. With multivariate logistic regressions, a significant association was observed between &quot;more BPSD&quot; and burden, anxiety and depression, between &quot;BPSD equivalent&quot; and anxiety and depression, and between &quot;emerging BPSD&quot; and only depression. The lockdown seems to have an impact on behavioral disorders in PWD and these disorders are associated with poorer mental health of caregivers. Our findings suggest attention should be given to caregivers of PWD who have BPSD before lockdown and the need for continued consultations and professional help in case of new lockdowns.","Pongan, Dorey, Borg, Getenet, Bachelet, Lourioux, Laurent, Rey, Rouch","https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-201396","20210301","Behavioral disorder; COVID-19; caregivers; lockdown; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11348,""

"Associations Between Employment Changes and Mental Health: US Data From During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Objectives:</b> To examine associations of changing employment conditions, specifically switching to working from home (WFH) or job loss, with mental health, using data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Data from 2,301 US adults in employment prior to COVID-19 were collected April 3rd-7th, 2020. Participants reported whether their employment remained unchanged, they were WFH when they had not been before, or they had lost their job due to the pandemic. Outcomes were symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness, and positive mental health (PMH) assessed using validated questionnaires. Linear regression quantified associations of employment changes with mental health outcomes, controlling for age, sex, race, BMI, smoking status, screen time, physical activity, marital status, chronic conditions, and current COVID-19 containment strategies being followed. <b>Results:</b> Compared to participants whose employment remained unchanged, those who switched to WFH did not differ in any measures of mental health (all <i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¥ 0.200). Participants who had lost their job reported higher symptoms of depression (<i>g</i> = -0.200, 95%CI = -0.333 to -0.067; <i>p</i> = 0.003), anxiety (<i>g</i> = -0.212, -0.363 to -0.061; <i>p</i> = 0.008), and stress (<i>g</i> = -0.348, -0.482 to -0.214; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and lower PMH (<i>g</i> = -0.212, -0.347 to -0.078; <i>p</i> = 0.002). Loneliness did not differ between groups (<i>p</i> = 0.087). <b>Conclusion:</b> This study demonstrates (1) that concerns around potential adverse mental health effects, particularly increases in loneliness, should not preclude WFH in the general population, while considering each individual's personal circumstances, and (2) the acute adverse association of job loss with mental health. Tailored and sensitive interventions may be required to prevent deteriorations in mental health associated with job loss during periods of societal stress.","McDowell, Herring, Lansing, Brower, Meyer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.631510","20210301","anxiety; coronavirus; depression; employment; lonelineness; positive mental health; stress; working from home (WFH)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11355,""
"The Investor Psychology and Stock Market Behavior During the Initial Era of COVID-19: A Study of China, Japan, and the United States","A highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infection, COVID-19, has dramatically changed the world with a tragically large number of human lives being lost. The epidemic has created psychological resilience and unbearable psychological pressure among patients and health professionals. The objective of this study is to analyze investor psychology and stock market behavior during COVID-19. The psychological behavior of investors, whether positive or negative, toward the stock market can change the picture of the economy. This research explores Shanghai, Nikkei 225, and Dow Jones stock markets from January 20, 2020, to April 27, 2020, by employing principal component analysis. The results showed that investor psychology was negatively related to three selected stock markets under psychological resilience and pandemic pressure. The negative emotions and pessimism urge investors to cease financial investment in the stock market, and consequently, the stock market returns decreased. In a deadly pandemic, the masses were more concerned about their lives and livelihood and less about wealth and leisure. This research contributes to the literature gap of investors' psychological behavior during a pandemic outbreak. The study suggests that policy-makers should design a plan to fight against COVID-19. The government should manage the health sector's budget to overcome future crises.","Naseem, Mohsin, Hui, Liyan, Penglai","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.626934","20210301","COVID-19; financial sustainability; investor psychology; masses psychology; stock market behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11356,""
"The Relationship Between the Duration of Attention to Pandemic News and Depression During the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019: The Roles of Risk Perception and Future Time Perspective","Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, people have been exposed to a flood of media news related to the pandemic every day. Studies have shown that media news about public crisis events have a significant impact on individuals' depression. However, how and when the duration of attention to pandemic news predicts depression still remains an open question. This study established a moderated mediating model to investigate the relationship between the duration of attention to pandemic news and depression, the mediating effect of risk perception, and the moderating effect of future time perspective on the relationship. In early February 2020, 701 individuals from 29 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities across China were asked to self-report their duration of attention to pandemic news, level of depression, risk perception, and future time perspective during the COVID-19 outbreak. Results show that there is a significant positive correlation between the duration of attention to news on COVID-19 and depression; risk perception mediates the association between the duration of attention to pandemic news and depression; and future time perspective plays a moderating role between risk perception and depression. The findings of the present study provide theoretical implications and practically throw some light on alleviating the public's depression during pandemic periods. We highlight that the individual's hope for a better future, focusing on positive news, and time perspective balance during an epidemic disease are also beneficial to promoting positive emotion and reducing depression.","Wu, Li, Lyu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.564284","20210301","COVID-19; depression; duration of attention to pandemic news; future time perspective; risk perpection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11357,""
"The Effects of COVID-19 Lockdown 10 on Working Patterns, Income, and Wellbeing Among Performing Arts Professionals in the United Kingdom (April-June 2020)","This article reports data collected from 385 performing arts professionals using the <i>HEartS Professional Survey</i> during the COVID-19 Lockdown 1.0 in the United Kingdom. Study 1 examined characteristics of performing arts professionals' work and health, and investigated how these relate to standardized measures of wellbeing. Study 2 examined the effects of the lockdown on work and wellbeing in the respondents' own words. Findings from Study 1 indicate a substantial reduction in work and income. 53% reported financial hardship, 85% reported increased anxiety, and 63% reported being lonelier than before the crisis. 61% sought support on finances while only 45% did so on health and wellbeing. Multiple regression analyses, using the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Social Connectedness Scale, and Three-Item Loneliness Scale as outcome variables, indicate that perceived financial hardship was associated with lower wellbeing and higher depression and loneliness scores. Higher self-rated health was associated with higher wellbeing and lower depression scores. More physical activity before lockdown was associated with higher wellbeing and social connectedness scores, as well as lower loneliness scores, and an increase in physical activity during lockdown compared with before, as well as older age, were associated with higher wellbeing and social connectedness scores, and lower depression and loneliness scores. Thematic inductive analysis of 341 open responses in Study 2 identified five overarching themes characterizing the effects of Lockdown 1.0: <i>lost or uncertain work and income</i>, including canceled work, financial concerns, and uncertainties for the future; <i>constraints of lockdown working</i>, including challenges of working at home, struggles with online work and skill maintenance, and caring responsibilities; <i>loss and vulnerability</i>, including reduced social connections, lack of support, vulnerability, feelings of loss and grief, and concern for others; <i>detrimental effects on health and wellbeing</i>, including anxiety, low or unstable mood, poorer physical health, and lack of motivation; and <i>professional and personal opportunities</i>, including coping well or living more healthily, more time and less pressure, new possibilities and activities, enhanced social connections, and new skills. Lockdown 1.0 had profound effects on performing arts professionals, but our findings reveal some opportunities and compelling links between positive wellbeing and physical activity.","Spiro, Perkins, Kaye, Tymoszuk, Mason-Bertrand, Cossette, Glasser, Williamon","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.594086","20210301","COVID-19; depression; loneliness; performing arts; social connection; survey; wellbeing; work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11358,""
"Orde ab Chao Method for Disruptive Innovations Creation (With COVID-19 Pandemic Case Application)","This paper introduces a novel method for the creation of ideas for disruptive innovations. It provides an application of innovation management techniques to specifics of disruptive technologies, which stand behind the Industry 4.0 (and Society 4.0) changes that are taking place at present. Centered around the Ordo ab Chao technique, the paper presents how contemporary disruptive technologies can attain reflections in the complex creative process that has to lead to disruptive ideas and innovations. Quite some innovative thinking techniques already exist. However, they fail to place emphasis on creation of ideas that are tied to emerging disruptive technologies so as to further deploy them in a focused, yet innovative manner. Hence, this paper presents an effective technique that facilitates creation of disruptive ideas with a focused potential for real-life implementations. Practical application of the method related to challenges in higher education processes amid the COVID-19 pandemic is also demonstrated. Based on the understanding of existing disruptive technologies, the technique is used for the adaptation and improvements of distance-learning processes to further add value for students and our society in general. In brief, the Ordo ab Chao technique is a promising tool for systematic development of disruptive solutions, representing a creative synergy between cutting-edge technologies and innovation management approaches.","Likar, Trcek","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.581968","20210301","disruptive innovations; disruptive technologies; forced connections; innovations management; methodological adaptation; products and services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11359,""
"Epidemic Risk Perception, Perceived Stress, and Mental Health During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Moderated Mediating Model","The aim of the present study was to investigate relationships among epidemic risk perception, perceived stress, mental health (depression and anxiety), future time perspective, and confidence in society during the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in China. Especially, we wonder that whether perceived stress mediates associations between epidemic risk perception and mental health and that whether future time perspective and confidence in society moderate the link between perceived stress and mental health. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 693 Chinese adults aged 18-60 years. The results showed that epidemic risk perception was positively related to perceived stress, depression, and anxiety. The correlations between epidemic risk perception and depression and anxiety were reduced when perceived stress was included, suggesting that perceived stress mediated these relationships. Moreover, the boundary conditions for the associations among perceived stress, depression, and anxiety were found in the study. Specifically, positive future time perspective could buffer the negative effects of perceived stress on depression, and confidence in society could weaken the negative effects of perceived stress on anxiety. Based on these findings, practical guidance and theoretical implications are provided for the public to maintain mental health during COVID-19 pandemic. Limitations and future directions are also discussed.","Li, Lyu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.563741","20210301","anxiety; confidence in society; coronavirus disease; depression; epidemic risk perception; future time perspective; perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11360,""
"The Impacts of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Suicide: A Lexical Analysis","<b>Background:</b> Although COVID-19 is a public health emergency, its consequences for the mental health of the population are still scarce. Likewise, its impact on critical situations such as suicide is still poorly explored in the literature. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze in a pioneering way, through lexical and content analysis techniques, the possible impacts of the new COVID-19 pandemic on suicide behavior. <b>Methods:</b> A lexical analysis, whose sample (not probabilistic, i.e., for convenience) was made up of full-length papers (abstracts) and short communications, about suicide behavior in COVID-19 pandemic, in PubMed and Virtual Health Library (VHL) was carried out following a lexical and content analysis using the software IRaMuTeQ, version 0.7 alpha 2. <b>Results:</b> The most frequent active words were suicide behavior (<i>n</i> = 649), covid (<i>n</i> = 439), health (<i>n</i> = 358), mental (<i>n</i> = 268), and social (<i>n</i> = 220). Four lexical classes were found and organized into two large groups: the first group, formed by the classes 2 (&quot;methods for psychological treatment&quot;) and 3 (&quot;strategies to minimize the COVID-19 impacts&quot;), was the most representative, totaling 50.6% of the text segments and second group formed by classes 1 (&quot;signs of clinical depression&quot;) and 4 (&quot;COVID-19 pandemic as a public health problem&quot;) with 49.4% of the text segments. <b>Conclusion:</b> Facing suicide behavior, the direct effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the negative feelings and trigger of previous psychiatric illnesses; the measures to deal with the pandemic such as social isolation, decrease in the number of professionals, the opening hours of health establishments, and decrease in the demand for medications; and competing phenomena such as the spread of fake news and lack of empathy are aggressive and potentiating factors of suicidal ideation.","GonÃƒÂ§alves JÃƒÂºnior, de Sales, Moreno, Rolim-Neto","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.593918","20210301","coronavirus infections; mental health; pandemic; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11361,""
"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on Cognitive Function: A Systematic Review","The prevalence and etiology of COVID-19's impact on brain health and cognitive function is poorly characterized. With mounting reports of delirium, systemic inflammation, and evidence of neurotropism, a statement on cognitive impairment among COVID-19 cases is needed. A substantial literature has demonstrated that inflammation can severely disrupt brain function, suggesting an immune response, a cytokine storm, as a possible cause of neurocognitive impairments. In this light, the aim of the present study was to summarize the available knowledge of the impact of COVID-19 on cognition (i.e., herein, we broadly define cognition reflecting the reporting on this topic in the literature) during the acute and recovery phases of the disease, in hospitalized patients and outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 status. A systematic review of the literature identified six studies which document the prevalence of cognitive impairment, and one which quantifies deficits after recovery. Pooling the samples of the included studies (total sample <i>n</i> = 644) at three standards of quality produced conservative estimates of cognitive impairment ranging from 43.0 to 66.8% prevalence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients only, as no studies which report on outpatients met criteria for inclusion in the main synthesis. The most common impairment reported was delirium and frequent reports of elevated inflammatory markers suggest etiology. Other studies have demonstrated that the disease involves marked increases in IL-6, TNFÃŽÂ±, and IL-1ÃŽÂ²; cytokines known to have a profound impact on working memory and attention. Impairment of these cognitive functions is a characteristic aspect of delirium, which suggests these cytokines as key mediators in the etiology of COVID-19 induced cognitive impairments. Researchers are encouraged to assay inflammatory markers to determine the potential role of inflammation in mediating the disturbance of cognitive function in individuals affected by COVID-19.","Alnefeesi, Siegel, Lui, Teopiz, Ho, Lee, Nasri, Gill, Lin, Cao, Rosenblat, McIntyre","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.621773","20210301","COVID-19; brain health; cognitive function; cytokines; delirium; depression; neuroinflammation; neurotropism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11362,""

"Fear of COVID-19 and Depression: A Comparative Study Among the General Population and Healthcare Professionals During COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis in Bangladesh","The COVID-19 pandemic affects individuals' mental health that can result in fear of getting COVID-19 infection and depression. As there is no prior study available, we evaluated these mental health outcomes and associated factors among the general population and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Bangladesh. This nationwide cross-sectional study comprised 3388 individuals including 834 HCPs. The measures included socio-demographics, healthcare, and patient-care related information, the Bangla Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Bangla Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors. Just over one-quarter of the participants were depressed, and was significantly associated with COVID-19 fear. Regression analyses showed that, both in general population and HCPs, depression and fear of COVID-19 were strongly predicted by being female; however, depression was inversely associated with being married. Particularly, among the HCPs, being restless while examining a patient with flu-like symptoms and while examining a patient returning from abroad was found to be significant predictor for both depression and fear of COVID-19. HCPs who were using single protective equipment for a week had greater depression and those who felt insecure due to the pandemic had a high level of COVID-19 fear. The findings identified major psychological impacts among the participants, suggesting the urgent need to promote mental wellbeing in both general population and medical professionals.","Sakib, Akter, Zohra, Bhuiyan, Mamun, Griffiths","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00477-9","20210301","Bangladesh; COVID-19; Depression; Fear; Healthcare professionals; Psychological impacts","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11364,""

"Inhibition of ACE2 Expression by Ascorbic Acid Alone and its Combinations with Other Natural Compounds","Angiotensin-converting enzyme II or ACE2 is an integral membrane protein present on many types of cells, including vascular endothelial cells and lung alveolar epithelial cells. This receptor serves as the entry point for SARS-coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs), including a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Limited availability of these receptors can thwart cellular entry of this virus. We tested the effects of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) on cellular expression of ACE2 at the protein and RNA levels in human small alveolar epithelial cells and microvascular endothelial cells. In addition, we investigated whether combinations of ascorbic acid with other natural compounds can affect ACE2 expression. The results show that ascorbic acid itself has moderate but consistent lowering effects on ACE2 expression at the cellular, protein, and RNA levels. Some natural compounds were effective in lowering ACE2 cellular expression, with the highest inhibitory effects observed for baicalin (75%) and theaflavin (50%). Significantly, combinations of these and other test compounds with ascorbic acid further decreased ACE2 expression. The highest impact of ascorbate on ACE2 expression was noted when combined with theaflavin (decrease from 50% to 87%), zinc (decrease from 22% to 62%), and with 10-undecenoic acid (from 18% to 53%). Ascorbic acid showed moderate additional benefits in decreasing ACE2 expression when combined with N-acetylcysteine and baicalin. Our study provides valuable experimental confirmation of the efficacy of micronutrients in controlling ACE2 expression-the coronavirus cellular &quot;entry&quot; point. It further validates the importance of nutrient interactions in various aspects of cellular metabolism and in considering potential therapeutic applications of nutrient-based approaches. The study shows that ascorbic acid and its combination with some natural compounds could be included in developing preventive and therapeutic approaches toward the current pandemic.","Ivanov, Goc, Ivanova, Niedzwiecki, Rath","https://doi.org/10.1177/1178633721994605","20210301","ACE2; Ascorbic acid; COVID-19; coronavirus; natural compounds","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11366,""
"Pulmonary Rehabilitation in a Post-COVID-19 World: Telerehabilitation as a New Standard in Patients with COPD","Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is effective in reducing symptoms and improving health status, and exercise tolerance of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly impacted PR programs and their delivery to patients. Owing to fears of viral transmission and resultant outbreaks of COVID-19, institution-based PR programs have been forced to significantly reduce enrolment or in some cases completely shut down during the pandemic. As a majority of COPD patients are elderly and have multiple co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease and diabetes, they are notably susceptible to severe complications of COVID-19. As such, patients have been advised to stay at home and avoid social contact to the maximum extent possible. This has increased patients' vulnerability to physical deconditioning, depression, and social isolation. To address this major gap in care, some traditional hospital or clinic-centered PR programs have converted some or all of their learning contents to home-based telerehabilitation during the pandemic. There are, however, some significant barriers to this approach that have impeded its implementation in the community. These include variable access and use of technology (by patients), a lack of standardization of methods and tools for evaluation of the program, and inadequate training and resources for health professionals in optimally delivering telerehabilitation to patients. There is a pressing need for high-quality studies on these modalities of PR to enable the successful implementation of PR at home and via teleconferencing technologies. Here, we highlight the importance of telerehabilitation of patients with COPD in the post-COVID world and discuss various strategies for clinical implementation.","Tsutsui, Gerayeli, Sin","https://doi.org/10.2147/COPD.S263031","20210301","COPD; COVID-19; pulmonary rehabilitation; telerehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11367,""
"Psychometric properties of the Brazilian version of the fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S)","COVID-19 can bring several psychological problems to patients and non-patients, which highlights the need for a better understanding of outcomes that can emerge due the occurrence of the virus. One of these variables is fear, present in situations of continuous uncertainty. Fear is a key variable for mental health and tracking it and its correlates might help to develop proper education and prevention programs. Currently, Brazil is one of the epicentres of the COVID-19 pandemic, with its public health system scrapped and not being able to contain the amount of infected people. Therefore, a proper measure to screen the fear of COVID-19 will help to provide improvements in mental health in such contexts. For that, two studies were performed. In Study 1 (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°230) we assessed the factorial structure of the measure through exploratory factor analysis, and item parameters using item response theory. In Study 2 (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°302), we assessed whether the structure would replicate in an independent sample and through confirmatory factor analysis, besides assessing convergent validity using Structural Equation Modelling and proposing a shorter version of the measure. Both long and short versions presented a reliable unidimensional structure and similar patterns of correlations with depression, anxiety, and stress. Overall, our results showed that the FCV-19S and its short version are useful measures to the assessment of fear of COVID-19 in Brazil.","de Medeiros, Reis, GuimarÃƒÂ£es, da Silva, Monteiro, Coelho, GuimarÃƒÂ£es, Martins, de FranÃƒÂ§a","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01476-2","20210301","Brazil; COVID-19; Fear; Measure; Psychometric","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11368,""

Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate relationships between mental health problems, loneliness, hope and self-compassion among Japanese medical workers, and compare with the general population. Online self-report measures regarding those four constructs were completed by 142 medical workers and 138 individuals in the general population. T-tests and multiple regression analysis were performed. Medical workers had higher levels of mental health problems and loneliness, and lower levels of hope and self-compassion than the general population.

"Safety and effectiveness concerns of lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19 affected patients: a retrospective series","Originally developed for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the antiviral combination lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is being repurposed for treating the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) despite minimal experience in this markedly different population and an in-vitro derived EC50 against SARS-CoV-2 several hundred-fold greater than for HIV. We present a case series including a case of severe hyponatremia and a 32-fold overdose raising safety and effectiveness concerns in COVID-19 patients. We measured LPV trough concentrations in 12 patients and reviewed their clinical charts for side effects known to occur in HIV patients. Compared to established LPV trough concentrations in HIV patients, concentrations in COVID-19 patients were 3-fold greater (19.37Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.12Ã¢â‚¬â€°mcg/mL versus 6.25Ã¢â‚¬â€°mcg/mL). In addition, cholestasis and dyslipidemia toxicity thresholds were exceeded in 12/12 and 11/12 patients respectively. No patients achieved the presumed therapeutic concentration. Side effects included gastrointestinal symptoms (5/12), electrolyte imbalances (4/12), liver enzyme disturbances (5/12) and triglyceride elevations (2/12). No patients reached presumed therapeutic LPV concentrations despite experiencing side effects and exceeding cholestasis and dyslipidemia toxicity thresholds. This raises concerns for the safety and effectiveness of LPV/r. Clinicians should consider closely monitoring for side effects and not necessarily attribute them to COVID-19.","Lepage, Rozza, Kremer, Grunbaum","https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2020.1842882","20210301","COVID-19; Lopinavir/ritonavir; SARS-CoV-2; case series; safety profile","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11371,""

"Results of a Randomized Trial Testing the Efficacy of Tele-Savvy, an Online Synchronous/Asynchronous Psychoeducation Program for Family Caregivers of Persons Living with Dementia","Family caregivers will grow in number as dementia prevalence increases, underscoring the continued importance of equipping these individuals for their new roles and ameliorating the adverse effects of caregiving. A three-armed, waitlist, randomized trial design tested Tele-Savvy, an online adaptation of a successful in-person psychoeducation program, the Savvy Caregiver. Tele-Savvy is delivered over 43 days to groups of 6-8 caregivers in seven weekly synchronous sessions accompanied by 36 brief asynchronous video lessons. We enrolled 23 cohorts of 15 eligible caregivers (N=261), randomized 2:2:1 to active, attention control, and usual care arms. We assessed caregiver psychological well-being and caregiving mastery at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Multilevel linear models assessed outcomes over the three time points examined. The trial was slightly truncated, with DSMB approval, because of the apparent confounding psychological effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) restrictions. Study findings indicate statistically and clinically significant benefits to Tele-Savvy arm caregivers (with moderate to large effect sizes) in the areas of depression, perceived stress, reaction to care-recipients' behaviors and enhancement of caregiver mastery. Expected benefits for caregiver burden and anxiety were not found. Findings attest to program efficacy and the viability of employing distance means to improve family caregivers' emotional well-being and sense of mastery in the caregiving role over a 6-month period. Next steps entail finding alternate ways to deliver the program to those with connectivity and/or time constraint problems.","Hepburn, Nocera, Higgins, Epps, Brewster, Lindauer, Morhardt, Shah, Nash, Griffiths","https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnab029","20210228","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; Caregiver Stress; Mastery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11374,""
"Differences and similarities between the impact of the first and the second COVID-19-lockdown on mental health and safety behaviour in Germany","Governmental restrictions of daily life are key elements in reducing the transmission of COVID-19, but they have also put a strain on people's mental health. Preventive policies differ all over the world as well as over different periods of time, and depend mostly on current infection rates. In Germany, there were two periods of restraint of varying severity, during which the government used different combinations of containment and mitigation measures to protect risk groups and to lower the number of hospitalizations. In two online studies, we aimed to determine differences and similarities in COVID-19-related fear, generalized anxiety, depression and distress levels, as well as in the adherence to safety behaviour between the first lockdown in March and April and the second lockdown in November. This study showed continued high psychological burden and even increased levels of depression symptoms, as well as less safety behaviour in the second phase of restrictions. The results hint at a prolonged negative impact on people's mental health and their safety behaviour despite lesser restrictions in the second lockdown, which may be interpreted as pandemic fatigue and hence strengthens the argument for a low-threshold access to psychological care.","Moradian, BÃƒÂ¤uerle, Schweda, Musche, Kohler, Fink, WeismÃƒÂ¼ller, Benecke, DÃƒÂ¶rrie, Skoda, Teufel","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab037","20210228","COVID-19; depression; lockdown; mental health; pandemic fatigue","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11375,""
"The Mood-5 (M5): A New Scale for Detecting COVID-19 Psychological Burden in Post-acute and Long-term Care Residents","Background: Older adults are at high risk for developing serious somatic and psychological symptoms from the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Available instruments may not be sensitive to concerns about COVID-19 in post-acute and long-term care (PA/LTC) and have unknown utility for telehealth. Objective: We investigated the psychometric properties of the Mood-5 Scale (M5) as a rapid self-assessment of COVID-19 psychological burden in PA/LTC residents. Methods: Residents (N = 131, age Ã¢â€°Â¥ 50) in 20 Maryland, USA PA/LTC settings were evaluated in-person or via telehealth (33%) during a four-week COVID-19 period (05/11/2020 - 06/05/2020). COVID psychological burden was rated by psychologists who independently reviewed clinical documentation. Psychometric analyses were performed on the M5 in relation to psychological tests, COVID-19 psychological burden, and diagnostic data collected during the evaluation. Results: The M5 demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (a = .77). M5 scores were not confounded by demographic variables or telehealth administration (ps &gt; 0.08). Convergent validity for the M5 was established via positive associations with anxiety (r = 0.56, p &lt; 0.001) and depressive (r = 0.49, p &lt; 0.001) symptoms. A M5 cutoff of 3 demonstrated strong sensitivity (.92) and adequate specificity (.75) for identifying COVID-19 psychological distress in PA/LTC residents (AUC = .89, PPV = .79, NPV = .91). Conclusions: The M5 is a reliable and valid mood self-assessment that can identify residents with significant psychological burden associated with COVID-19. It can be completed in less than one minute and is appropriate for in-person and virtual visits.","Mansbach, Mace, Tanner","https://doi.org/10.2196/26340","20210228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11376,""
"The mental health impact of COVID-19 outbreak: a Nationwide Survey in Iran","Disease outbreak not only carries the risk of death to the public due to the infection, but it also can lead to unbearable psychological impact on the mental health of the individuals. This study aims to explore and evaluate the burden of psychological problems on the Iranian general population during the outbreak of COVID-19. A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted among the general population of Iran age 15 and above. Demographic variables, depression, and anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and General Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaires. Among the 8591 participants, the mean age was 34.37 (Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.25) years and 66.4% were female while 33.6% were male. Based on our results, 1295 (15.1%) and 1733 (20.1%) of the general populationÃ‚Â had clinically significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Based on the demographic variables, female gender was associated with a higher risk for developing depression and anxiety symptoms, whereas getting information about the disease from medical journals and articles, being older, and being married were considered as associated protective factors. In terms of depression, being a healthcare worker was an associated risk factor. On the other hand, for anxiety, having higher education was a protective factor while a higher number of individuals in a household was considered as a risk factor. This study identified a major mental health problem in the Iranian population during the time of the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, establishing a targeted mental health support program during the time of public emergencies, such as the disease outbreak, is advised.","Shahriarirad, Erfani, Ranjbar, Bazrafshan, Mirahmadizadeh","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-021-00445-3","20210228","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Epidemiology; Outbreak","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11377,""
"Two tales of one city: Unequal vulnerability and resilience to COVID-19 by socioeconomic status in Wuhan, China","Although disasters such as pandemics are events that are random in nature, individuals' vulnerability to natural disasters is inequitable and is shaped by their socioeconomic status (SES). This study examines health inequality by SES amid the COVID-19 pandemic and its underlying mechanisms in Wuhan, China's epicenter. Using survey data collected in the city during the lockdown period from February 20 to March 6, 2020, we identify two ways in which SES shapes health inequalities-vulnerability and resilience to COVID-19. First, higher SES is associated with a lower risk of infection for both survey respondents and their family members. Second, higher SES reduces mental distress during the pandemic, and this protective effect is particularly strong for individuals who contract the virus or who have family members infected with the disease. Mediation analysis further illustrates that SES shapes the risk of infection and mental distress primarily through three channels: access to daily essential and protective supplies, employment status, and the community environment. These findings lend support to the fundamental cause theory that links socioeconomic differentials to health inequality in a unique context. The outbreak of COVID-19 magnifies pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities.","Wu, Li, Lu, Hout","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rssm.2021.100584","20210301","COVID-19; Health inequality; Infection; Mental health; Socioeconomic status (SES)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11378,""

"ADHD symptoms predict lower adaptation to the COVID-19 outbreak: financial decline, low adherence to preventive measures, psychological distress, and illness-related negative perceptions","Objective. The COVID-19 outbreak created numerous multidimensional stressors, to which people show different levels of vulnerability. The current paper examines whether ADHD symptoms are associated with poorer adaptation. Method. 2055 adults participated in an online survey after the first quarantine in Israel. Participants completed scales probing adaptation indicators: financial status, adherence to preventive measures, mental health, and COVID-19 related perceptions. Background measures, including the level of ADHD symptoms, were collected. Results. Adaptation indicators negatively correlated with the level of ADHD symptoms. Financial decline explained a small portion of the link between ADHD and decreased mental health; background risk-taking, anti-social, and pro-social behavior partially explained the link between ADHD and non-adherence to preventive measures; COVID-19 related perceptions also partially explained the same link. Conclusion. The current study suggests that people with ADHD are more vulnerable to the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore deserve special attention and care.","Yehuda Pollak et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46052-1B5-17A","20210302","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11383,""
"Was the COVID-19 pandemic associated with a change in the pace of self-inflicted injury deaths?: A time series analysis of suicide and accidental injury mortality data","The COVID-19 pandemic struck in the context of growing self-inflicted injury rates and appears to have increased nation-wide levels of distress. This study describes mortality trends in Maryland during the first six months of the pandemic and adds to the current literature by accounting for characteristics of pre-pandemic mortality trends and by distinguishing differences in mortality trends based on cause (e.g., overdose) and manner (e.g., suicidal) of death. We obtained data for all unnatural deaths in Maryland from January 2003 to August 2020 from the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. We grouped decedents based on cause and manner of death (e.g., suicidal poisoning). We used ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and/or seasonal time series modeling to project the expected rate of self-inflicted mortality during March through August 2020. We compared expected mortality rates based on these self-inflicted injury models to the observed during the pandemic period mortality to investigate the hypothesis that self-inflicted injury deaths would increase at a more rapid pace than observed prior to the pandemic. The models forecasting accidental overdose deaths fit the data well (model R2 = .90, model BIC = 3.77). There were more deaths by accidental poisoning and fewer deaths by accidental falls in March and May 2020 than predicted by pre-COVID-19 models. Most self-inflicted suicidal and accidental injury deaths appear to continue to occur at the same rate during the early months of the pandemic. This research is limited by its use a limited dataset that captured mortality in one state for six months. This study may not capture longer-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or the association between the pandemic and rarer events (e.g., firearm deaths.)

"Direct and indirect effects of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and emotion regulation strategy use on mental health during Covid-19","Background. Covid-19 and associated restrictions have been linked to negative mental health outcomes across the globe. Cognitive emotion regulation strategies constitute means to mitigating negative affect and are associated with prefrontal and limbic brain regions. Methods. Variations in cognitive emotion regulation strategy use, anxiety and depression in 43 adults (31<U+2640>, average age=35.14Â±9.20y) and emotional and behavioral problems in 26 children (10<U+2640>, average age=10.69Â±2.52y) were tested seven times following Covid-19 onset (March-December 2020). Relationships between pre-pandemic brain structure, use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies and mental well-being were tested using multiple regression and mediation models. Results. Covid-19 and associated restrictions were linked to heightened, but varying levels of anxiety and depression across 2020. While adaptive strategies were most employed, maladaptive strategies explained the highest variation in negative mental health outcomes (i.e., anxiety and depression). Adaptive strategies had a positive, maladaptive strategies a negative effect, however, this direction varied for some strategies when considering long-term effects. Emotion regulation strategy use mediated the association between pre-pandemic brain structure (i.e., cortical thickness) in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and well-being, with prefrontal-amygdala coupling as a possible driving factor. Additionally, early well-being measures were crucial for later well-being. Conclusion. Our findings support the use of early intervention strategies for mental health consequences due to the pandemic. Due to substantial personal and societal costs associated with mental health disorders, such as anxiety and depression, an early identification of risk factors for the development and treatment response are of utmost importance.","Plamina Dimanova et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46230-484-515","20210301","PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; mental health; prefrontal cortex; covid-19; emotion regulation; neuroimaging","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11385,""
"Changes in the Era of COVID-19: What Can We Learn from the Acceleration of Opioid Overdose Deaths in Maryland over 15 years","This study tracks the number of accidental opioid overdose deaths (OOD) in Maryland from 2003-2020 and evaluates longitudinal trends, with a focus on increased mortality in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. All Marylanders with positive toxicology findings for opioids at the time of death from January 2003 through August 2020 (n = 1276) were included in analyses. Data were provided by the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) which evaluates all unexpected deaths in the state. We explored longitudinal trends in the data and found a simple seasonal pattern. The number of OOD during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic was similar to the number of predicted by pre-pandemic data period. We compared opioid overdose decedents from spring 2019 with those who died in the spring of 2020 to assess the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with changes in manner of death and risk factors for opioid overdose. The likelihood of an overdose death being ruled intentional was lower during the pandemic, and there was a shift in patterns of substance use which may have reflected disrupted access to preferred substances of abuse and medication assisted treatment during the lockdown. More research that includes nationally representative data, extends beyond the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and addresses mechanisms that drive change in substance use and treatment in the context of multiple national emergencies is needed.v","Alison Athey et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46097-8C3-051","20210301","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; opioid; covid-19; overdose; postmortem","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-02","",11386,""
