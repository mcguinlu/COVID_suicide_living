"Telepsychiatry Netiquette: Connect, Communicate and Consult","Globally, telepsychiatry has been around since the 1950s  It is in the COVID era that it has gained the relevance and much-needed momentum amongst mental health care professionals  Given the restrictions imposed by the global lockdown owing to the fear of contracting the virus, the ease of access and safety offered by telepsychiatry makes it both appealing and ?the new normal ? Despite some hesitation from mental health professionals, there is adequate research to support the role of telehealth services in the management of various mental health disorders  As with any formal system, the practice of telepsychiatry is regulated by professional guidelines to show the way forward to both health provider and seeker  The manuscript examines the ways telepsychiatry is redefining our virtual conduct  It emphasizes the evolving ?netiquette? needed to navigate online consultations  It also elucidates the challenges faced by health professionals, and possible ways of maneuvering and circumventing the same  Telepsychiatry, a dynamic process which is interactive and personalized, adds a third dimension to the practice of modern medicine  It is here to stay  So, it is not a question of ?if? instead ?how soon? we can adapt to and get conversant with this revolutionary mode of connection, communication, and consultation, which will make all the difference","Kumar, Mohan Sunil; Krishnamurthy, Sharmitha; Dhruve, Nitya; Somashekar, Bettahalasoor; Gowda, Mahesh R.","https://doi.org/10.1177/0253717620958170","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine;2020.; Publication details: Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-07","",5535,""

"Understanding the genetic contribution of the Human Leukocyte Antigen system to common major psychiatric disorders in a world pandemic context","The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a complex genetic system that encodes proteins which predominantly regulate immune/inflammatory processes  It can be involved in a variety of immuno-inflammatory disorders ranging from infections to autoimmunity and cancers  The HLA system is also suggested to be involved in neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity, especially through microglia regulation and synaptic pruning  Consequently, this highly polymorphic gene region has recently emerged as a major player in the etiology of several major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder and with less evidence for major depressive disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  We thus review here the role of HLA genes in particular subgroups of psychiatric disorders and foresee their potential implication in future research  In particular, given the prominent role that the HLA system plays in the regulation of viral infection, this review is particularly timely in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic","Tamouza, Ryad; Krishnamoorthy, Rajagopal; Leboyer, Marion","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.09.033","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Brain, Behavior, and Immunity;2020.; Publication details: Brain, Behavior, and Immunity;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-07","",5551,""

The aim of this study was to investigate and synthesize the current evidence on KAPs regarding COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a systematic search on PubMed/LitCovid, Scopus, and Web of Sciences databases for papers in the English language only, up to 1 Jul 2020. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist developed for cross-sectional studies to appraise the quality of the included studies. All stages of the review conducted by two independent reviewers and potential discrepancies solved with a consultation with a third reviewer. We reported the result as number and percentage. PROSPERO registration code: (CRD42020186755). Results: Fifty-two studies encompassing 49786 participants were included in this review. 45.76% of the participants were male. The mean age of the participants was 32.6 years. 44.2% of the included studies were scored as good quality, 46.2% as fair quality, and remaining (9.6%) as low quality. 30.76% examined all three components of the KAPs model. The knowledge component was reported as good, fair, and poor in 59%, 34%, and 7%, respectively. Of the studies that examined the attitude component, 82% reported a positive attitude, 11% a fairly positive attitude, and 7% a negative attitude. For the practice component, 52% reported good practice, 44% fair practice, and 4% poor practice. Conclusion: This systematic review showed that the overall KAP components in the included studies were at an acceptable level. In general, knowledge was at a good level, the attitude was positive and practice was at a fairly good level. Using an integrated international system can help better evaluate these components and compare them between countries.","Saeede Saadatjoo; Maryam Miri; Soheil Hassanipour; Hosein Ameri Sr.; Morteza Arab-Zozani","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.04.20206094","","Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-07","",5556,""
"The relative effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on early Covid-19 mortality: natural experiment in 130 countries","Background Concurrent non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented around the world to control Covid-19 transmission. Their general effect on reducing virus transmission is proven, but they can also be negative to mental health and economies, and transmission behaviours can also change in absence of mandated policies. Their relative impact on Covid-19 attributed mortality rates, enabling policy selection for maximal benefit with minimal disruption, is not well established. Methods We exploited variations in nine non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in 130 countries (3250 observations) in two periods chosen to limit reverse causality: i) prior to first Covid-19 death (when policymakers could not possibly be reacting to deaths in their own country); and, ii) 14-days-post first Covid-19 death (when deaths were still low, on average). We examined associations with daily deaths per million in each subsequent 24-day period (the time between virus transmission and mortality) which could only be affected by the policy period. A mean score of strictness and timeliness was coded for each intervention. Days in each country were indexed in time by first reported Covid-19 death to proxy for virus transmission rate. Multivariable linear regression models of Covid-19 mortality rates on all concurrent interventions were adjusted for seasonality, potential confounders, and potential cross-country differences in their mortality definitions. Robustness was checked by removing countries with known data reporting issues and with non-linear, negative binomial, models. Results After adjusting for multiple concurrent interventions and confounders, and accounting for both timing and strictness of interventions, earlier and stricter school (-1.23 daily deaths per million, 95% CI -2.20 -0.27) and workplace closures (-0.26, 95% CI -0.46 -0.05) were associated with lower Covid-19 mortality rates. Only controlling for strictness international travel controls, and only controlling for timing later restrictions on gatherings, were also associated with lower Covid-19 mortality. Other interventions, such as stay-at-home orders or restrictions on public transport, were not significantly associated with differences in mortality rates across countries. Findings were robust across multiple statistical approaches. Conclusions Focusing on compulsory, particularly school closing, not voluntary reduction of social interactions with mandated policies appears to have been the most effective strategy to mitigate early Covid-19 mortality.","Jonathan Stokes; Alex James Turner; Laura Anselmi; Marcello Morciano; Thomas Hone","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.05.20206888","","Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-07","",5557,""

In this micro-review, a systematic search through PubMed was performed for a comprehensive investigation of suicide risk factors during the pandemic. On this basis, we put forward considerations and advice for preventing pandemic related suicide, including staying socially connected through online platform or apps during period of quarantine, reducing unemployment, dispelling rumors and misinformation in time, and maintaining evidenced-based management of psychiatric symptoms. More importantly, early detection and timely intervention of individuals with psychiatric disorders and suicide behaviors will be effective to reduce the number of suicides, with specific measurements of using validated scales to perform regular suicide risk screening, improving the availability of mental health services, and providing appropriate and evidence-based interventions for individuals in demand.

"Changes in the clustering of unhealthy movement behaviors during the COVID-19 quarantine and the association with mental health indicators among Brazilian adults","Our aim was to analyze the prevalence of unhealthy movement behavior clusters before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to investigate whether changes in the number of unhealthy behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine were associated with mental health indicators. Data of 38,353 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior research were used. For movement behaviors, participants reported the frequency and duration of physical activity and daily time on TV viewing and computer/tablet use before and during the pandemic period. Participants also reported the frequency of loneliness, sadness (feeling sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety feelings (feeling worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period. Sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, country region, and time adhering to the quarantine were used as correlates. We used descriptive statistics and logistic regression models for the data analysis. The prevalence of all movement behavior clusters increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The cluster of all three unhealthy movement behaviors increased from 4.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.9-5.4) to 26.2% (95% CI: 24.8-27.7). Younger adults, people with higher academic achievement, not working or working at home, and those with higher time in quarantine presented higher clustering. People that increased one and two or three unhealthy movement behaviors were, respectively, more likely to present loneliness (odds ratio [OR] = 1.41 [95% CI: 1.21-1.65] and OR = 1.71 [95% CI: 1.42-2.07]), sadness (OR = 1.25 [95% CI: 1.06-1.48] and OR = 1.73 [95% CI: 1.42-2.10]), and anxiety (OR = 1.34 [95% CI: 1.13-1.57] and OR = 1.78 [95% CI: 1.46-2.17]) during the COVID-19 quarantine.

"Burden and management of type 2 diabetes in rural United States","In the United States, rural areas have a higher burden of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) compared to urban areas. However, there is limited information on risk factors and interventions that improve the primary prevention and management of T2DM in rural areas. To synthesize current knowledge on T2DM in rural areas and to guide healthcare providers and policy makers, we reviewed five scientific databases and the grey literature over the last decade (2010-2020). We described classification systems for rurality and the T2DM burden based on rurality and region (West, South, Midwest, and Northeast). We highlighted risk factors for T2DM in rural compared to urban areas, and summarized interventions to screen and manage T2DM based on opportunistic screening, T2DM self-management, community-based initiatives, as well as interventions targeting comorbidities and T2DM. Several studies identified the co-existence of T2DM and depression/psychological symptoms, which could reduce adherence to non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic management of T2DM. We highlighted the role of technology in education and counselling of patients with geographic and financial barriers to accessing care, which is exacerbated by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease-19 pandemic. We identified knowledge gaps and next steps in improving T2DM care in rural areas. There is an urgent need for interventions tailored to rural areas given that rural Americans currently experience a disproportionate burden of T2DM and are encumbered by its associated morbidity, mortality, and loss in economic productivity.","Dugani, Mielke, Vella","https://doi.org/10.1002/dmrr.3410","20201006","primary prevention; rural health; type 2 diabetes mellitus; urban-rural disparities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-07","",5562,""

"Health anxiety and attentional bias toward virus-related stimuli during the COVID-19 pandemic","After the COVID-19 worldwide spread, evidence suggested a vast diffusion of negative consequences on people's mental health. Together with depression and sleep difficulties, anxiety symptoms seem to be the most diffused clinical outcome. The current contribution aimed to examine attentional bias for virus-related stimuli in people varying in their degree of health anxiety (HA). Consistent with previous literature, it was hypothesized that higher HA would predict attentional bias, tested using a visual dot-probe task, to virus-related stimuli. Participants were 132 Italian individuals that participated in the study during the lockdown phase in Italy. Results indicated that the HA level predicts attentional bias toward virus-related objects. This relationship is double mediated by the belief of contagion and by the consequences of contagion as assessed through a recent questionnaire developed to measure the fear for COVID-19. These findings are discussed in the context of cognitive-behavioral conceptualizations of anxiety suggesting a risk for a loop effect.

At least 100 doctors have died from COVID-19 nationwide. Full large-scale social restriction was a temporary measure, followed by an early transition to the new normal era during the never-ending first wave in the country. Workers in industrial, retail, transport, and tourism fields suffered a significant decrease in work. Many countries are, however, in dilemma of protecting the health of the citizens and prioritising economy. Health should be prioritised because it is an important aspect of our lives for our economy. Poor health is estimated to reduce global gross domestic product (GDP) by 15% annually through premature deaths and potential loss of productivity of the working-age citizens. Pandemics also depress economy through decrease in both supply and demand. Data from flu pandemic a century ago suggested the importance of aggressiveness and speed of intervention. Taiwan's early action led to beneficial effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection rate and economy recovery. The target of enhancement of containment measures, provision of personal protective equipments, and testing and isolation facilities should be achieved earlier and be more than the projected demand.","Setiati, Azwar","https://www.google.com/search?q=Dilemma+of+Prioritising+Health+and+the+Economy+During+COVID-19+Pandemic+in+Indonesia.","20201006","COVID-19; Dilemma; Economy; Health; Indonesia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-07","",5565,""

Consensus suggestions can standardise care, thereby improving outcomes and facilitating future research. An International Task Force was composed and agreement regarding courses of action was measured using the Convergence of Opinion on Recommendations and Evidence (CORE) process. 70% agreement was necessary to make a consensus suggestion. The Task Force made consensus suggestions to treat patients with acute COVID-19 pneumonia with remdesivir and dexamethasone but suggested against hydroxychloroquine except in the context of a clinical trial; these are revisions of prior suggestions resulting from the interim publication of several randomised trials. It also suggested that COVID-19 patients with a venous thromboembolic event be treated with therapeutic anticoagulant therapy for 3Ã¢â‚¬â€¦months. The Task Force was unable to reach sufficient agreement to yield consensus suggestions for the post-hospital care of COVID-19 survivors. The Task Force fell one vote shy of suggesting routine screening for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.

"The Mental Health of Frontline Health Care Providers During Pandemics: A Rapid Review of the Literature","This rapid review addresses two key questions posed by the COVID-19 pandemic: What are the anticipated mental health sequelae for frontline health workers? and What are best practices during health emergencies to address the mental health needs of these workers? This review synthesized the literature on the mental health sequelae for health workers during major pandemics and epidemics that occurred in the 21st century (severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola virus disease, and swine flu) and interventions used to address related mental health sequelae. PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO were searched with terms related to these epidemics/pandemics. Of 3,876 articles retrieved, 94 were included in this review. Across these studies, most health workers exhibited some adverse psychological experiences during outbreaks, with stress and anxiety being most common. Psychological distress decreased over time. Some studies reported insomnia, burnout, and posttraumatic stress for a subset of individuals up to 3 years after the disease outbreak. Few interventions have been implemented to address providers' mental health needs, and these strategies have not been evaluated systematically. Systems-level interventions may alleviate distress for most providers without the need for specialized mental health intervention. Psychotherapeutic support and referral to specialty care should be available to health workers with severe and intense adverse psychological outcomes during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence-based interventions are urgently needed to better serve health workers both during and following epidemics/pandemics.","Magill, Siegel, Pike","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000274","20201006","Coronavirus/COVID-19; Frontline workers; Health providers; Mental health; Pandemic; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-07","",5567,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Gastrointestinal Motility Testing in Asia and Europe","The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has high infection and mortality rates, and has become a pandemic. The infection and mortality rates are lower in Asian countries than in European countries. This study aimed to conduct a survey on the effects of COVID-19 on the capacity to perform gastrointestinal motility tests in Asian countries compared with European countries. We used the questionnaire previously established by our team for researchers in European countries. The correlation between the decreased rate of gastrointestinal motility and function tests, and the infection/mortality rates of COVID-19 and stringency of a government's interventions in each country was analysed and protective measures were assessed. In total, 58 gastroenterologists/motility experts in Asian countries responded to this survey. The infection/mortality rates of COVID-19 and Stringency Index had a significant impact on the testing capacity of oesophageal manometry and catheter-based pH monitoring. In European countries, most facilities used filtering facepiece 2/3 (FFP2/3) masks during oesophageal motility studies. Meanwhile, in Asian countries, most facilities used surgical masks. The total infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 can affect the rate of gastrointestinal motility testing and the type of protective equipment that must be used.","Mori, Schol, Geeraerts, Huang, Jandee, Gonlachanvit, Tseng, Lu, Kamiya, Kim, Lee, Kuribayashi, Tack, Suzuki","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9103189","20201006","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; anorectal manometry; breath tests; catheter-based pH-monitoring; infection prevention; motility disorders of the gastrointestinal tract; oesophageal manometry; wireless pH-monitoring (BravoÃ‚Â®)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-07","",5568,""

After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak, global measures were implemented with the aim of containing its progression. On March 20, 2020, the mandatory preventive quarantine began in Argentina. As a result of these events, previous studies conducted in the framework of this pandemic in China, have shown psychological consequences. The aim of this study is to explore, through a self-administered electronic survey, attitudes and fears regarding COVID-19, the development of depressive symptoms and the pattern of alcohol consumption among the argentinian population during quarantine (n = 759). As a result, we observed that fear of COVID-19 was greater in 55 to 59 years old people, with an abrupt drop above 70; that depressed mood and the increased of alcohol consumption were more frequent in youngest subjects, and that depressed mood was also frequent among subjects who lost their jobs during quarantine. Finally, we observed an elevated degree of agreement with the quarantine measure, even in some people who suffered a decrease in their income greater than 80% during quarantine. These results are useful for obtaining information about risk groups, enabling specific preventive and therapeutic strategies could be designed.

"[COVID-19 and the reality of people with disabilities in Argentina: possibilities of complying with the considerations of the World Health Organization]","In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO published considerations regarding people with disabilities. The aim of this work was to know if these considerations can be fulfilled and if there are differences in their fulfillment between age groups.

Statistical analysis was according to the nature of the variables, X2 with Fisher's correction was used to determine the differences between groups. 309 surveys were collected from 18 provinces of Argentina. 230(74.4%[69.1-79.1]) were answered by caregivers and 79(25.5%[20.7-30.7]) by people with disabilities. Persons with disabilities were 138(44.7%[39.0-50.4]) children and adolescents and 171(55.3%[49.5-60.9]) adults and older adults. People with disabilities were able to comply with the WHO recommendations regarding reducing exposure to COVID-19 and to be prepared in case of contracting it. There were difficulties in the number of caregivers needed, since 266(66.6%[61.0-71.8]) have this possibility, and difficulties in 55(32.1%[25.1-39.6]) adults and older adults that do not carry out educational-therapeutic activities. There are feelings of anxiety, distress, or depression in people with disabilities and their caregivers. In Argentina, it is possible to comply with the WHO recommendations to avoid exposure to the virus and to be prepared in case of infection. Challenges remain to be solved in terms of accompanying people with disabilities in their physical and mental health.

"Basketball jones: Fan passion, motives, and reactions to the suspension of the National Basketball Association season due to COVID-19","The suspension of the 2019-2020 National Basketball Association (NBA) season due to the COVID-19 pandemic meant that NBA fans were unable to engage in an activity that they loved in the midst of a global health crisis. In this research, we assessed if fan responses to the suspension and the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with different types of fan passion and motives. Shortly after the NBA season suspension, NBA fans (N = 395) completed online surveys assessing harmonious and obsessive passion for being an NBA fan, motives for watching games, and various attitudes and responses to the suspension and COVID-19. We found that both fan passion and motives predicted responses to the suspension and COVID-19, particularly obsessive passion which predicted greater levels of distress, coping responses, and negative attitudes toward both the suspension and COVID-19. These findings have implications for both the passion and fan motives literatures.","Benjamin J. I.

"The Hazardous Workplace, Work-related Stress, and Unhealthy Behaviors among Healthcare Workers: The Relationships with Depressive and Insomnia symptoms during COVID-19","We aimed to investigate the relationship between mental health problems and unhealthy behaviors among healthcare workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using an online survey, we collected data on healthcare workersâ€™ consideration of their work unit as hazardous. Furthermore, workersâ€™ depression, insomnia, and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Insomnia Severity Index, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, respectively. Healthcare workersâ€™ work-related stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic were measured using the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic - 9 (SAVE-9) scale. As a result, work-related stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic was related to being female, to regarding one's work as a dangerous workplace, and depressive symptoms. Unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking and drinking as coping behaviors during the pandemic, were related to being male, young, experiencing depression, and having insomnia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to closely observe the patterns of work-related stress and anxiety reactions among healthcare workers to reduce their burnout.","Ju Kab Lee et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46057-70E-E8B","20201007","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; health personnel; occupational stress; save-9; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-07","",5572,""
"COVID-19 and the Future of US Fertility: What Can We Learn from Google?","We use data from Google Trends to predict the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on future births in the United States. First, we show that periods of above-normal search volume for Google keywords relating to conception and pregnancy in US states are associated with higher numbers of births in the following months. Excess searches for unemployment keywords have the opposite effect. Second, by employing simple statistical learning techniques, we demonstrate that including information on keyword search volumes in prediction models significantly improves forecast accuracy over a number of cross-validation criteria. Third, we use data on Google searches during the COVID-19 pandemic to predict changes in aggregate fertility rates in the United States at the state level through February 2021. Our analysis suggests that between November 2020 and February 2021, monthly US births will drop sharply by approximately 15%. For context, this would be a 50% larger decline than that following the Great Recession of 2008-2009, and similar in magnitude to the declines following the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918-1919 and the Great Depression. Finally, we find heterogeneous effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across different types of mothers. Women with less than a college education, as well as Black or African American women, are predicted to have larger declines in fertility due to COVID-19. This finding is consistent with elevated caseloads of COVID-19 in low-income and minority neighborhoods, as well as with evidence suggesting larger economic impacts of the crisis among such households.","Joshua Wilde et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46186-A32-3DA","20201007","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population; prediction; covid-19; statistical learning; fertility; machine learning; births; google","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-07","",5573,""
