"Coping Strategies and Trauma-Related Distress of College Students During Covid-19","Present-day college students are particularly impacted by the disconcerting effects of Covid-19 because of their vulnerability towards mental health struggles. The current study identified coping strategies used by students in the United States and how those strategies are associated with trauma-related distress. Results showed acceptance, emotional processing, and social support were the most commonly used coping strategies. Furthermore, avoidance coping related to higher distress than more helpful approaches (e.g., humor). Demographic findings revealed that Black students used more religious coping than did White and Asian students. Additionally, older and upper-year students used substances to cope more than did other students, including those with higher grade point averages. Our discussion focuses on how the findings of the present study can be used to enhance student support, resiliency, academic performance, and retention.","Straup, Madison L.; Prothro, Kalyn, Sweatt, Abigail, Shamji, Jabeen F.; Jenkins, Sharon R.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Coping+Strategies+and+Trauma-Related+Distress+of+College+Students+During+Covid-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of college student retention : research, theory & practice : Duplicate, marked for deletion;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38539,""
"The Effect of Occupational Stress and Concerns about the COVID-19 Pandemic on Secondary Traumatic Stress Syndrome among Iranian Frontline Nurses: A Mediating Model","Objective: With the increasing effects of stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and occupational stress on the mental health of frontline nurses, it is imperative to further investigate how these stresses affect nurses' mental health and secondary traumatic stress syndrome. This research aimed to investigate the relationship of nurses' occupational stress and concerns about COVID-19 with secondary traumatic stress syndrome, and also to investigate the mediating effect that concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic have on the relationship between nurses' occupational stress and secondary traumatic stress syndrome. Method: A cross-sectional design was adopted. The population of the study was defined as all front-line nurses in Shiraz hospitals, from which 225 nurses of two corona care hospitals were selected using convenience sampling. The degree of secondary traumatic stress, concerns about the COVID-19, and nurses' occupational stress were assessed using Bride's Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS), an adopted version of Level of Concerns about the COVID-19 questionnaire, and the Nurses' Occupational Stressor Scale (NOSS) among Hospital-based Healthcare Workers. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the relationships among variables. Results: Results showed that nurses' occupational stresses presented a direct effect on nurses' level of concern about the COVID-19 pandemic (ÃŸ = 0.85, P &lt; 0.001), and concern about the COVID-19 pandemic was directly related to frontline nurse's secondary traumatic stress syndrome (ÃŸ = 0.83, P &lt; 0.001). In addition, nurses' level of concern about the COVID-19 pandemic fully mediated the effects of nurses' occupational stresses on their secondary traumatic stress (ÃŸ = 0.70, P &lt; 0.001). This indirect effect has explained 68% of the variance in nurses' secondary traumatic stress. Conclusion: These results emphasized the indirect effect of nurses' occupational stresses on secondary traumatic stress syndrome via mediating the level of concern about COVID-19. Therefore, to reduce the secondary traumatic stress of nurses who have dealt directly with COVID-19 patients, it seems necessary to pay serious attention to the sources of their occupational stress, which probably existed even before this pandemic and increased their concerns in pandemic conditions.","Shirazi, Maryam Safari, Sadeghzadeh, Marziyeh, Abbasi, Moslem, Yousefi, Marziyeh, Hedayati, Arvin","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Effect+of+Occupational+Stress+and+Concerns+about+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+on+Secondary+Traumatic+Stress+Syndrome+among+Iranian+Frontline+Nurses:+A+Mediating+Model","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Iranian Journal of Psychiatry; 17(4):369-378, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38540,""
"Mental health assessment of Spanish frontline healthcare workers during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic AnÃ¡lisis de la salud mental de trabajadores sanitarios espaÃ±oles de primera lÃ­nea durante la pandemia por SARS-CoV-2","Background and objective The Covid-19 pandemic continues challenging health systems globally, exposing healthcare workers to constant physical and psychological stressors. To date, several studies have already shown the catastrophic impact on the mental health of medical personnel during the early period of the pandemic. Nevertheless, literature evidences the dearth of works that evaluate the effect over time, understanding the pandemic as a sustained extreme stressor. The present study examines the effect of the pandemic on the mental health of Covid-19 frontline healthcare workers at six months follow-up. Material and methods A total of 141 frontline healthcare workers from two tertiary hospitals were recruited between July and November 2020. Healthcare workers were evaluated psychologically at baseline and six months follow-up (January to May 2021) using psychometric tests for the assessment of acute stress (VASS, PSS-10, PCL-5), anxiety (STAI) and depression (PHQ-2) Results Overall, there was a general worsening of the mental health between the two psychological assessments, especially regarding depression and predisposition to perceiving the situations as a threat. Nurses and nurse aides showed poorer mental health while physicians improved over time. Reduced working hours and higher physical exercise resulted in better mental health among healthcare workers. Women and nursing staff were the most affected by psychological distress at baseline and six months follow-up. Conclusion Reduced working hours, adequate resting periods, physical exercise, and efficient intervention strategies are of utmost importance in preventing, controlling, and reducing psychological distress among healthcare workers when coping with critical scenarios such as the current pandemic.","SangrÃ , Pau Sobregrau, Ribeiro, ThaÃ­s Castro, Esteban-SepÃºlveda, Silvia, PagÃ¨s, Esther GarcÃ­a, Barbeito, Beatriz LÃ³pez, Llobet, Jordi AguilÃ³, Moya-Prats, JosÃ© LuÃ­s Pomar, PÃ©rez, LuÃ­s Pintor, Mir, Sira AguilÃ³","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+health+assessment+of+Spanish+frontline+healthcare+workers+during+the+SARS-CoV-2+pandemic+AnÃ¡lisis+de+la+salud+mental+de+trabajadores+sanitarios+espaÃ±oles+de+primera+lÃ­nea+durante+la+pandemia+por+SARS-CoV-2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medicina clinica (English ed.); 159(6):268-277, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38541,""
"Exploring opportunities to expand groundwater use for livelihood enhancement and climate change adaptation in Laos","This project aimed to identify and prioritize opportunities for sustainable development of groundwater resources with specific focus on the lowland plains and upland plateaus of Laos. It addressed this aim through three key objectives: (1) establish the potential to develop groundwater for irrigation in key hydrogeological settings in Southern Laos;(2) assess the opportunities that solar-powered pumping technologies may provide smallholder farmers seeking to engage in more profitable, market-oriented agriculture;and (3) enhance the capacity of current and emerging groundwater professionals in Laos. Two areas with promising aquifer development potential were selected in Southern Laos: a drought-prone lowland area underlain by sandstone aquifers in Savannakhet province (Outhomphone district);and a wetter, upland basaltic area on the Bolaven Plateau (Pakxong district). For the first objective, a preliminary hydrogeological assessment was undertaken based on the collation and analysis of existing (limited) data supplemented by data from a network of around 40 to 50 monitoring wells in each district and other hydrogeological measurements collected during two field campaigns. For the second objective, the opportunities for solar-powered groundwater pumping to provide an alternative to conventional grid electricity or fuel pumps was explored through policy analysis and the evaluation of a demonstration project as well as actual field operations. The third and final objective involved a cross-cutting effort to enhance capacity of current or emerging groundwater professionals. For Outhoumphone, where the need for dry season access to reliable groundwater sources is high, the sandstone aquifers present are likely sufficiently replenished but inadequately productive to provide a substantial resource for expanding dry season irrigation. Drillers in the area report well instability, saline water and drilling failure as common technical challenges. With adequate field investigations these challenges may be overcome and supplies for commercial agriculture could become feasible. For Pakxong, where the basaltic aquifers are more productive and reliable, field observations show that more entrepreneurial farmers have already started to develop groundwater for high value commercial crops. There is clear scope to expand irrigation development. Drillers report high success rates for wells and this is supported by the aquifer testing undertaken during this research. Even though policies on solar technologies in agriculture are limited, the solar industry appears to be expanding rapidly, with over twenty solar companies based in Laos;most of which are also servicing the agricultural sector. A demonstration site operated by the National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute in Vientiane Capital provides firsthand experience of solar pumping and data is emerging on its functioning and performance. Rapid assessments of six solar pumping sites on the Vientiane Plain show that better-off farmers and investors with the means to afford the upfront capital cost are accessing water on demand at effectively little or no marginal cost. Although the situation is evolving rapidly, solar water pumping for agriculture still remains an emerging technology in Laos and hence the long term technical performance, economic viability and potential impacts on the groundwater resources remain entirely unanswered at the present time. A one-week hydro-geophysics training course took place in Pakxong in November 2020 that involved 14 attendees from government agencies and the national university. Training was provided in fieldwork and analysis in new techniques to investigate groundwater using geophysical equipment, site wells, drilling and aquifer testing and aquifer conceptualization. In-situ guidance was provided by in-country team members supported by higher level oversight provided remotely by trainers based in Australia due to travel restrictions associated with COVID-19.

"Addressing COVID-19 Misinformation and Resiliency Among Latinos Living With HIV: Formative Research Guiding the Latinos Unidos Microgame Intervention","Besides the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) itself, the indirect and unprecedented effects of mitigation strategies including shelter-in-place orders and social distancing combined with the widespread COVID â€œinfodemicâ€ disseminated by media interacted synergistically to worsen already compromised mental health outcomes of Latino people living with HIV (PLWH). This funded project directly addresses the sources of health disparity in Miami Dade County: mental health and misinformation by developing a culturally tailored resilience and media literacy intervention for Latinos living with HIV. Extant research on resilience strategies and media literacy skills have documented their effectiveness in assisting individuals make realistic appraisals and informed decisions that could benefit their health outcomes and improve health-related challenges. We utilized a community-based approach by collaborating with two local community partners (Open Arms and Borinquen) and conducting 27 qualitative interviews with Latino PLWH, infectious disease providers, and community health workers who directly informed content of the Latino Unidos microgame intervention.

"Suppression of stress by aroma: alterations in the expression of brain factors","Stress such as uncertainty about the future, including the problem of new coronavirus infection, is a very serious problem not only for physical health but also for mental health. It is certain that stress is one of the risk factors for developing mental disorders. We have found stress-responsive biomarker (stress marker) candidates through studies on the process from stress to disease onset. Recently, we have been trying to prove the stress-suppressing effect of aroma with brain factors. We analyzed how aroma affects behavioral changes due to stress and the expression of stress marker candidates in the brain. In this article, the data on aroma that we have accumulated so far will be introduced. Specifically, we will describe changes happened in experimental animals when they smelled coffee beans, lavender, cypress, a-pinene, and thyme linalool. When considering the biological effects of aroma, it is inevitable that not only the olfactory pathway but also odor molecules act through the bloodstream by nasal and transdermal absorption. The brain transferability of odor molecules may be a bottleneck in analyzing the biological effects of volatile components. Thus, we would like to discuss on this issue.","Masuo, Y.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Suppression+of+stress+by+aroma:+alterations+in+the+expression+of+brain+factors","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Aroma Research; 21(4):316-325, 2020.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38546,""

"Substance use, racial/ethnic identity, and suicidal ideation during COVID-19 lockdown in an international adult sample","Although research has examined disparities in suicidal ideation across multiple groups, few investigations have analyzed such disparities in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, there is limited research on differences within and across countries, further limiting the extent to which meaningful comparisons can be made. Therefore, this study examines risk and protective factors of suicidal ideation during COVID-19 lockdown in adults across five countries. Adults (NÂ =Â 2,509) from the United States, Italy, Spain, Saudi Arabia, and India completed a survey to measure suicidal ideation, recent drug use, and sociodemographic factors. Prevalence of suicidal ideation was assessed using simple and multivariable logistic regression models, and severity of suicidal ideation was analyzed via a multinomial multivariable logistic regression. Cohen's d statistics were reported for all analyses to report effect size. In the United States subsample, racial/ethnic minorities endorsed a significantly greater prevalence of suicidal ideation compared to their White peers (aORÂ =Â 2.31, 95% CI: 1.26â€“4.27, dÂ =Â 0.46). However, no significant racial differences in suicidal ideation were found in other countries. Past 90-day illicit drug use was associated with greater prevalence (aORÂ =Â 1.38, 95% CI: 1.06â€“1.80, dÂ =Â 0.18) and severity (aRRRÂ =Â 2.17, 95% CI: 1.33â€“3.53, (aRRRÂ =Â 0.43) of suicidal ideation during COVID-19 lockdown. This study further highlights the social disparities that exist in suicidal ideation during COVID-19 lockdown in international samples, for which greater medical and mental health interventions are critical. As such, targeted multicomponent interventions that address substance use are important for reducing the rising prevalence and severity of COVID-related suicidal ideation.","Jadir, Deeshpaul S.; Anderson-Carpenter, Kaston D.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Substance+use,+racial/ethnic+identity,+and+suicidal+ideation+during+COVID-19+lockdown+in+an+international+adult+sample","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of psychiatric research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38548,""

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Extension professionals have worked hard to address emerging issues that communities face, possibly impacting the amount of anxiety they experience. This study determined the prevalence of anxiety symptoms among Extension professionals in the United States. Participants from 24 states completed a survey containing the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2) screener. Almost one-quarter of Extension professionals had a GAD-2 score greater than three, an indicator of anxiety with a possibility of generalized anxiety disorder, which is similar to that of the general population. Also, female and male Extension professionals were about equal in the prevalence of anxiety symptoms, which is contrary to the literature.

"The Contributions of Social Stressors and Coping Resources to Psychological Distress Among Those Who Experienced Furlough or Job Loss Due to COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated a global economic recession resulting in widespread unemployment and worker furloughs. Using national survey data (n = 2,000), this study examines whether and how employment-based discrepancies in financial strains, anticipatory stressors, and personal coping resources contribute to elevated psychological distress among those who experienced involuntary job displacement due to COVID-19. Disaggregating displaced workers into those who were furloughed and those who lost their job due to the pandemic, I find that both groups report more depressive symptoms and anger than the stably employed and respondents whose unemployment is not COVID-related. Greater financial strains and smaller reserves of coping resources contribute in varying degrees to heightened levels of distress found among displaced workers, however, anticipatory stress about economic security is the predominant factor driving disparities in psychological distress. These findings, and the central role of anticipatory stressors in shaping employment-based differences in mental health during the pandemic, are discussed.","Grace, Matthew K.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Contributions+of+Social+Stressors+and+Coping+Resources+to+Psychological+Distress+Among+Those+Who+Experienced+Furlough+or+Job+Loss+Due+to+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Work and occupations;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38550,""

"Prevalence of anxiety and depression among Palestinian university students: a cross-sectional study during COVID-19 pandemic","Background Anxiety and depression are more common among university students than in the general population. It is reported internationally that the COVID-19 pandemic increased the prevalence of anxiety and depression among students. This study aimed to measure the prevalence of anxiety and depression among university students in Palestine and to explore the association between anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based descriptive study was carried out on university students. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale were used to evaluate anxiety and depression, respectively. Chi-square was used to evaluate the risk factors associated with the levels of anxiety and depression. The association between anxiety and depression was evaluated using Pearson correlation. Results A total of 1049 students were enrolled in the study. The prevalence of depression among them was 55.8%, 26.4%, and 9.8% for severe, moderate, and mild depression, respectively. Depression symptoms were significantly variable based on studentsâ€™ field and year of study, sleeping period, smoking, and food source. The prevalence of anxiety was 16.1%, 30.7%, and 36.1% for severe, moderate, and mild anxiety, respectively. Anxiety symptoms were significantly variable based on studentsâ€™ gender, year of study, sleeping period, smoking, and place of residence. A strong positive correlation was observed between the CES-D and GAD-7 scores (R = 0.707).

This study aims to analyse the results of an outpatient neuropsychological intervention program for post-COVID-19 syndrome. Method In June 2020 Institut Guttmann started an outpatient post-COVID-19 neurorehabilitation program, including respiratory therapy, physiotherapy, and neuropsychological rehabilitation. Before and after the program, the cognitive-emotional state of all participants is assessed. Six months after treatment, a follow-up assessment is administered (which includes a collection of information on various aspects of daily life). Results The sample analysed consisted of 123 patients (mean age: 51 years, SD: 12.41). Seventy-four per cent (n = 91) had cognitive impairment and underwent cognitive treatment (experimental group);the remaining 26% (n = 32) constituted the control group. After the intervention, the experimental group improved in working memory, verbal memory (learning, recall and recognition), verbal fluency and anxious-depressive symptomatology. The control group showed changes in immediate memory, verbal memory (learning and recognition) and depressive symptomatology, although the effect size in the latter two was smaller than in the experimental group. Six months after treatment, 44.9% of the patients were unable to perform their pre-COVID-19 work activity, and 81.2% reported difficulties in their activities of daily living. Conclusions Neuropsychological rehabilitation is an effective tool to treat the cognitive-emotional deficits present in post-COVID-19 syndrome.

Method: From February to April 2020, we asked medical staff in 4 referral hospitals in Iran to voluntarily complete online questionnaires including: Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and the Coping Strategies Questionnaire-28. Univariate and multiple logistic regressions were applied to identify the associations of coping strategies and mood states. Results: 258 people filled out the online questionnaire. Of them, 39.9% and 39.1% reported anxiety and depression, respectively, with age as a risk factor. Overall, participants used more emotion-based coping strategies. Anxiety and depression were associated with applying more of emotion-based and less of problem-based coping mechanisms. The findings remained stable even after adjustment for confounding variables including age, gender and direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Providing social support to health workers, planning to reduce their perceived stigma, and educating them about how to use more effective coping mechanisms can be beneficial in reducing the psychological impact on this segment of the population in the event of COVID-19.","Etesam, Farnaz, Bafrani, Melika Arab, Akbarpour, Samaneh, Tarighatnia, Helia, Rajabi, Gilda, Dolatshahi, Mahsa, Vahabi, Zahra","https://www.google.com/search?q=Depression,+Anxiety+and+Coping+Responses+among+Iranian+Healthcare+Professionals+during+the+Coronavirus+Disease+(COVID-19)+Outbreak","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Iranian Journal of Psychiatry; 17(4):446-454, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38554,""

"Persistence in Indigenous language work during the COVID-19 pandemic","Through the COVID-19 pandemic, Indigenous communities have persisted in Indigenous language revitalization and reclamation efforts. This research utilized a scan of social media, a survey, and interviews, conducted in the summer and fall of 2020 and primarily focused on Canada, to explore: What shifts to support Indigenous language work occurred during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic? and What were the impacts of these shifts on Indigenous language revitalization and reclamation? This article discusses six cross-cutting themes: (a) shifting and adapting language work to ensure community health and safety, (b) building capacity to make necessary shifts and adaptations, (c) facing challenges in shifting online, (d) promoting Indigenous languages online and in community, (e) creating and sharing language resources as alternative or increased activity, and (f) (re-)envisioning language education and pedagogy in a pandemic time.

"Advancing Public Health and Preventive Medicine","Largely because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States experienced a decrease in life expectancy from 2019 to 2020, with a disproportionate burden among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black populations.1 COVID-19 has also illustrated and continues to show the ""fault lines"" in public health, including inadequate surveillance systems, underfunding of public health and primary care, structural inequities, misand disinformation, and the intrusion of partisan politics into public health practice.2,3 In addressing the many opportunities and challenges for public health and preventive medicine, Matthew Boulton and Robert Wallace have assembled an impressive set of 186 chapters across 11 sections, authored by world-class experts on each topic. Global Health, Health Disparities & Vulnerable Populations, Nutrition & Physical Activity, and Mental Health & Substance Use. Across the many sections and chapters in this book, competencies can be mapped to academic course work, clinical rotations, short courses, practica, and on-the-job training programs for professionals in public health and preventive medicine.8,9 IMPLEMENTING KNOWN SOLUTIONS As described in multiple chapters, but particularly in the chapter on implementation science, the decades of scientific progress in medicine and public health have too often not been translated into equitable improvements in population health.10 By influencing how scientific evidence is scaled up into practice, implementation science has great potential to accelerate progress toward achieving public health goals by seeking to understand and influence how scientific evidence is put into practice.11 Evidence in multiple forms, but particularly evidence-based interventions, is the foundation of implementation science and progress in public health.12 FOCUSING ON HEALTH EQUITY Concepts of health disparities and health equity are more prominently featured in this new edition, across many chapters but particularly in section 3 on health disparities and vulnerable populations.","Brownson, Ross C.

"Evaluation of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and their relationship with subclinical myocardial dysfunction by left ventricular global longitudinal","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a great impact on patientsâ€™ physical problems as well as psychological status. However, there is limited data about the impact of psychological problems on cardiac function during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between mental health disorders and subclinical early myocardial systolic dysfunction by left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) imaging in patients recovered from COVID-19. Methods Of the 108 participants, 71 patients had recovered from COVID-19;the members of the study group were prospectively recruited to the study after COVID-19 recovery. Comparisons were made with a risk-factor matched control group (n=37). The psychological status of the subjects, namely, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), and the Impact of Events Scale (IES-R) at follow-up visits, were assessed via questionnaire forms. The relationship between the psychological parameters and LVGLS values was subsequently evaluated. Results Overall, 45.0% of patients with COVID-19 had some degree of anxiety after recovery. A significant negative correlation was found between LVGLS and DASS-21 total score, DASS-21 anxiety subscale score, IES-R total score, and IES-R intrusion subscale score (r= -0.251, p=0.02;r= -0.285, p=0.008;r= -0.291, p=0.007;and r= -0.367, p=0.001, respectively). Furthermore, the DASS-21 total score was identified as an independent predictor of LVGLS (ÃŸ= -0.186, p=0.03).

"COVID-19 anxiety, depression and stress in Latin American health professionals: characteristics and associated factors","Due to the pandemic, an increase in mental health problems has been reported in members of the health personnel, with the self-report being an initial way of evaluating it. The objective was to determine the factors associated with the perception of repercussions in the mental sphere in health professionals in Latin America before COVID-19. An analytical cross-sectional study was carried out between June and August 2020 in Latin America. The perception of repercussions was measured through an instrument previously validated in Peru, which was taken virtually from 406 doctors, nurses and others;this was crossed versus other variables. The main concern was returning home and infecting their family (22% strongly agree), followed by feeling the abuse because they do not give them the necessary amount of personal protective equipment (13% strongly agree) and perceiving mental exhaustion for all the activities they did (12% strongly agree). In the multivariate analysis, the older there was a lower perception of mental repercussion (aPR: 0.98;95% CI: 0.97-0.99;p value = 0.012);In addition, those who had a greater perception of repercussions in the mental sphere also had more anxiety at a low level (aPR: 1.84;95% CI: 1.14-2.98;p value = 0.013) and post-traumatic stress (aPR: 2.28;95% CI: 1.61-3.22;p value &lt;0.001), adjusted for depression and stress. Despite being an exploratory analysis, important associations were found in the mental sphere;which should continue to be investigated in larger studies.","Aveiro-Robalo, T. R.; Chavez, F.

The objective was to determine the socio-occupational factors associated with suffering from anxiety, depression and stress in health professionals in the Peruvian highlands during the pandemic. Cross-sectional study. Doctors and other professionals at the Ramiro Priale Priale National Hospital in the Peruvian highlands were surveyed virtually. Depression, anxiety and stress were measured with the DASS-21 scale;these were associated with different socio-labour variables. More severe depression was found at older ages and if a family member had been ill at home, but less severe depression was found among those who had children, those who had more years of professional practice and those who had social security. Those who had children had less anxiety;less severe anxiety and those who had a relative away from home who became ill;on the other hand, those who worked more hours per day had more moderate anxiety, severe anxiety if the respondent had become ill and both types if a family member had died had more moderate anxiety. Those who worked more hours per day and those who had a deceased family member had more stress. The most relevant characteristics of health workers with mental health problems were older age, family history of COVID-19, history of death of a family member from COVID-19 and longer working hours.","Ambrosio, F.; Torres-Santo, G.; Jesus Infante Rivera, L. de, Rodriguez-Alarcon, J.

"The Relationship between the Severity of the COVID-19 Disease, Temperament and Psychological Factors","Objective: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic negatively affects public mental health around the world. Individuals' reactions to COVID-19 vary depending on their temperament, individual differences, and personality traits. Therefore, the current study is conducted to assess the association of demographical features, Persian temperament, and psychological characteristics with the severity of COVID-19. Method: An online survey was sent to COVID-19 patients to collect their demographic information, COVID-19 symptoms, and clinical data. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DAAS-21) questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Spiel Berger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI), and Persian general and brain temperament Questionnaire were also completed by 258 participants (127 men and 131 women) 45 days after recovery from COVID-19. Non-parametric analysis was used for statistical analysis. Results: Results showed the significant relationship of demographic factors such as weight, age and gender with the severity of the COVID-19 (P &lt; 0.05). Mean scores of brain temperament (warm/cold) in the severe group were significantly lower than the moderate and mild groups (P &lt; 0.05). There was a significant increase in the dry/wet temperament of the brain in the severe and moderate groups compared to the mild group (P &lt; 0.05). The results of DASS-21 showed a significantly higher anxiety in patients with severe COVID-19 compared with moderate and mild groups (P &lt; 0.05). The severe group was found to be significantly different compared to moderate group in the results of BDI-II (P &lt; 0.05). The result of STAI (state and trait) showed a significant difference between the severe group and the mild and moderate groups. The score of PSQI between the moderate and mild groups was significant (P &lt; 0.05).

"Understanding eating behaviours, mental health and weight change in young adults: protocol paper for an international longitudinal study","Understanding the complexities of change in eating behaviours, mental health, well-being and weight is crucial to inform healthcare and service provision, particularly in light of the exacerbating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to address the need for more comprehensive cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence, by tracking eating behaviours, mental health, health related behaviours and weight over a 12-month period, in a sample of young adults (18-35 years) in the UK and Australia. Online surveys administered via the Prolific online research platform will be used for data collection at baseline, 6 months and 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. The survey (approximately 45Ã¢â‚¬â€°min) measures demographics, the impact of COVID-19, body mass index (BMI), weight management and health service usage, eating behaviours, personality, mental health, and health-related behaviours. An optional substudy component at each time point aims to validate self-reported weight in the main survey through images. Study inclusion criteria are; aged 18-34 years at baseline, BMI Ã¢â€°Â¥20Ã¢â‚¬â€°kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and residing in the UK or Australia. A target of 500 participants at baseline was set, recruited through Prolific, and with recruitment stratified by BMI, sex and country. The proposed analyses include creating static predictive models using baseline data (eg, using latent class analysis, factor analysis or similar), and mapping changes longitudinally (eg, using multivariate regressions). These analyses will enable changes in the study measures to be identified, as well as predictors and outcomes of change. Ethical approval was granted by Leeds Beckett University, UK (reference number 86004) and the University of Newcastle, Australia (reference number H-2022-0110). Study findings will be disseminated through scientific journals, conferences, institute websites and social media, and briefings tailored to policy, practice and the public, with the intention to help inform the future development of health and well-being care and support for young adults across Australia and the UK.","Whatnall, Fozard, Kolokotroni, Marwood, Evans, Ells, Burrows","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-064963","20220930","MENTAL HEALTH; NUTRITION &amp; DIETETICS; PSYCHIATRY","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38566,""
"Associations between psychological inflexibility and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic: A three-level meta-analytic review","An increasing number of research has documented the positive associations between psychological inflexibility (PI) and mental health problems (i.e., depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms) during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the documented associations have been inconsistent. This review thus aimed to quantitatively summarize primary research to gain better estimates of these associations. A systematic literature review was conducted in six databases and three-level meta-analytic models were used to statistically synthesize effect sizes and to examine moderators of the associations between PI and depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms. A total of 22 studies yielded 63 effect sizes on associations between PI and depressive, anxiety, or stress symptoms. The results of three separate meta-analyses revealed a large and significant association between PI and depressive (rÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.580, 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI [0.549; 0.775]), anxiety (rÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.548, 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI [0.468; 0.761]), and stress symptoms (rÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.548, 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI [0.506; 0.725]). The association between PI and depressive symptoms is stronger for males than for females, and the association between PI and stress symptoms varies by type of measure that primary studies use to assess PI and stress symptoms. Temporal or causal conclusions are not allowed due to cross-sectional nature of the associations included in meta-analyses. Clinical samples with high levels of stress were underrepresented. PI seems an important risk factor for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, and should therefore be targeted in interventions addressing mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Yao, Xu, Chan, Chen, Assink, Gao","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.09.116","20220930","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Psychological inflexibility; Stress; meta-analytic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38567,""

Among students with binary gender classifications, 54/149 (36%) had GAD-7 scores in the moderate or severe anxiety range (scoresÃ¢â€°Â¥10), with a greater proportion among females than males (47% vs 21%, P&lt;0.001). Compared to students with GAD-7&lt;10, those with Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10 were more likely to strongly agree that the pandemic changed them significantly (51% vs 28%, p = 0.05), made them mature faster (44% vs 16%, p = 0.004), and affected their personal growth negatively (16% vs 6%, p = 0.004). Prominent themes that emerged from open-ended responses on regrets during the pandemic included missing out on school social or sports events, missing out being with friends, and attending family events or vacations. In this survey of high school students conducted 2 years after the onset of COVID-19 in the United States, 47% of females and 21% of males reported moderate or severe anxiety symptoms as assessed by the GAD-7. Whether heightened anxiety results in functional deficits is still uncertain, but resources for assessment and treatment should be prioritized.","Yin, Parikka, Ma, Kreniske, Mellins","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275292","20220930","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38570,""
"The Lived Experiences of New Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Their Contributions to Nursing Education and Professional Development","Background The COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on new nurses' transition to the staff nurse role in hospital settings. New staff nurses were not prepared to care for COVID-19 patients based on their previous nursing education. Method A qualitative descriptive design with purposive sampling was used for this study. Twenty-nine new nurses were recruited. They were interviewed using a semi-structured guide to elicit data that were coded and analyzed using content analysis. Results Five themes were identified: ""You might have to risk your own life to save others,"" ""I wish I had developed a thicker skin,"" ""There is real world and there is nursing school,"" ""Learning how to handle your own mental health,"" and ""What I would tell them."" Conclusion New nurses described their preparedness from baccalaureate education to clinical practice as insufficient in certain areas that were needed in the care of COVID-19 patients. Nurse educators who teach in pre-licensure and hospital orientation programs can revise or expand on the themes voiced by new nurses in order to improve their transition to the staff nurse role. <b>[<i>J Contin Educ Nurs</i>. 2022;53(10):451-459.]</b>.","Suplee, Jerome-D'Emilia, Linz","https://doi.org/10.3928/00220124-20220907-06","20220930","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38571,""
"Maternal Functioning and Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b><i>Background:</i></b> Our objective was to understand maternal functioning and psychological distress among mothers of young children in the United States during April/May 2020, early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Participants were 862 moms of children aged 0-3 years old who completed an online survey. We examined maternal functioning (maternal competency and self-care subscales from the Barkin Index of Maternal Functioning) and psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress subscales of the DASS-21), and then examined interaction effects of COVID-19 impact and socioeconomic status (SES; represented by income and education). <b><i>Results:</i></b> Mothers' reports of higher maternal functioning correlated with lower psychological distress and both sets of factors varied substantially by SES and COVID-19 Impact. Higher COVID-19 Impact was associated with lower functioning and greater distress. Higher income and education were associated with better maternal self-care, but not maternal competency. Although we expected high SES to buffer mothers from a higher impact of COVID-19, we found that mothers with high SES reported a lower level of maternal competence and more stress than low-SES mothers. Interactions between COVID-19 impact and SES predicting maternal functioning and psychological distress revealed that when COVID-19 impact was low, high SES was associated with high functioning scores and less distress. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> This work challenges the assumptions that a stressful event will be uniformly experienced by mothers of young children as well as the stress-buffering role of higher SES. This study highlights the importance of considering SES when characterizing maternal functioning and psychological distress during times of high stress. Further research is needed to examine the processes contributing to these discrepancies.","Lax, Novak, Webster","https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2021.0588","20220930","COVID-19; functioning; mothers of young children; psychological distress; socioeconomic status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38572,""
"Evaluating Evidence-Informed Behavioral Health Models to Improve HIV Health Outcomes: Quantitative Findings from the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program Special Projects of National Significance Black Men Who Have Sex with Men Initiative","The Black Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) Initiative was implemented at eight sites to engage and retain Black MSM in HIV medical care and supportive services (SS) by addressing their behavioral health (BH) care needs. Using a pre-post design and generalized logistic mixed-effects models adjusting for patient-level random effects, site, baseline age, and baseline mental health status, we evaluated whether participants experienced increased postintervention attainment of (1) Awareness of HIV medical care, BH care, and SS; (2) Screening, referral, linkage, receipt, and engagement in HIV care, BH care, and SS; and (3) Retention, antiretroviral therapy prescription, and suppressed viral load. Among 758 evaluated participants, the proportion of participants who were aware of, screened for, screened positive for, and referred to BH and SS, retention in care (72% to 79%), and viral load suppression (68% to 75%) increased between baseline and postintervention. Among participants who screened positive and received BH services were statistically more likely to be linked to [OR, 1.34 (95% CI: 1.08-1.66)] and retained in [OR, 1.36 (95% CI: 1.00-1.83)] care. Among those who screened positive and received SS were statistically more likely to be retained in care [OR, 1.54 (95% CI: 1.07-2.22)]. Measures of linkage to care declined significantly during the study period, perhaps because of COVID-19 that delayed in-person care. This study suggests that interventions designed to increase utilization of BH services and SS can be effective at improving retention in care and viral load suppression among Black MSM, at least among those currently using HIV services.","Shah, Reist, Sawyer, Chiao, Hodge, Jones, Rein","https://doi.org/10.1089/apc.2022.0095","20220930","AIDS; HIV; mental health; patient care; racial","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38573,""
"Reflection of Types of Prosocial Behavior During COVID-19 in Collectivistic Asian Countries-India and Indonesia","COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has widened the gap between victims and non-victims in society. Understanding how individuals support and assist COVID-19 sufferers in a pandemic crisis is critical. Thus, this study aims to qualitatively evaluate the prosocial intention and types of prosocial behavior toward COVID-19 victims by low socioeconomic individuals from India and Indonesia's collectivistic societies. We conducted semi-structured and in-depth interviews during the lockdown from March to May 2020, via phone and in-person, using a purposive selection of respondents (total <i>n</i> = 50). The data were analyzed using the qualitative synthesis method. Five themes were discovered: 1) too scared to help, 2) love to help but scared: moral dilemma, 3) informing authority who knows how to handle, 4) caring, sharing, and supporting, but with a distance, and 5) helping at one's personal health risk. This study highlights that prosocial intentions range from minor acts of kindness to self-harm and out-of-bounds acts of kindness for COVID-19 victims.","Shukla, Mishra, Agustino","https://doi.org/10.1177/10497323221129260","20220930","COVID-19; collectivistic society; low socioeconomic; prosocial intention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38574,""

Understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted TNB older patients (65 years and over) offers critical guidance for successful health services reform and continued delivery systems change. Using qualitative data from 47 semi-structured individual interviews, I investigate how TNB older Americans-as a medically and socially vulnerable population in the United States-manage their health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicated a need for enhancing health services and resources for TNB older adults while creating a culture of age-friendly and gender-affirming healthcare. Four primary themes emerged: (1) exacerbated mental health challenges, (2) disrupted social relationships and support, (3) adopting cost-effective health management strategies, and (4) incorporating family care partners in health management. Such themes were shaped by respondents' privileged and marginalized social locations, such as access to financial security, social support, and adequate medical care. Although these research findings should not be generalized to the TNB older adult population, they suggest that broader patterns of inequity affect how TNB older Americans manage their health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lampe","https://doi.org/10.1177/23337214221127753","20220930","aging; caregiving and management; gender/sexuality; health equity; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38575,""
"Assessment of the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate medical students in India","Medical students who are prone to psychological stress due to their overburdened curriculum, are at an increased risk of getting adversely affected by the pandemic. The present study was planned to assess the anxiety level among undergraduate medical students across the country using generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7). In this online survey, anonymous data was collected through Google forms from undergraduate students from all the phases of MBBS course across the country from August 15, 2020, to October 15, 2020. Section I collected various demographic information, section II included GAD-7 questionnaire for assessing anxiety and section III had open- ended questions about their impending fear, uncertainties, and apprehensions. The data was expressed in percentage and association among the variables was determined using Chi-square test. Thematic analysis of the open-ended responses was done. Among the sample of 1208 students, 81% were from urban areas. During the pandemic, 77% were residing with their parents and 71% parents having stable jobs. Eighty percent students had no relative diagnosed with COVID-19, whereas 52% students had family members with comorbidity. The GAP score showed mild, moderate, and severe anxiety in 27, 24, and 16% students, respectively. Anxiety was significantly associated with rural setting and with COVID-19 positive or comorbid family member (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Open ended responses revealed that majority of the students were finding it difficult to cope with the academic stress at home but still did not want to join back. With such a high incidence of anxiety among medical students, it is pertinent to safeguard the mental health and implement efficient approaches to upkeep the scholastic, physical, emotional, and professional well-being of medical students during such vulnerable times.","Shreevastava, Mavai, Mittal, Verma, Kaur, Bhandari","https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_1273_21","20220930","Anxiety; COVID-19; generalized anxiety disorder-7; medical students; psychological stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38576,""
"Examining the impact of sex differences and the COVID-19 pandemic on health and health care: findings from a national cross-sectional study","To examine the association of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the association of sex, and the joint association of sex and the COVID-19 pandemic with health communication, physical activity, mental health, and behavioral health. We drew data from the National Cancer Institute's 2020 Health Information National Trends Survey. We described and compared the characteristics of social determinants of health, physical activity, mental health, alcohol use, patterns of social networking service use, and health information data sharing. Analyses were weighted to provide nationally representative estimates. Multivariate models (multiple linear regression, multiple logistic regression, and multinomial logistic model) were used to assess the sole and joint association with sex and pandemic. In addition, we applied the Bonferroni correction to adjust <i>P</i> values to decrease the risks of type I errors when making multiple statistical tests. Females were more likely to use mobile health and health communication technologies than males, and the difference increased after the pandemic. The association between sex and mental health was significant after the COVID-19 pandemic. Females were more likely to experience depression or anxiety disorders. Both males and females had a slight decrease in terms of the quantity and intensity of physical activity and females were less likely to perform moderate exercise and strength training regularly. Males were likely to drink more alcohol than females. The COVID-19 pandemic amplifies the differences between males and females in health communication, physical activity, mental health, and behavioral health. Intersectional analyses of sex are integral to addressing issues that arise and mitigating the exacerbation of inequities. Responses to the pandemic should consider diverse perspectives, including sex and gender.","Ye, Ren","https://doi.org/10.1093/jamiaopen/ooac076","20220930","COVID-19 pandemic; health disparity; health impact; multiple hypothesis testing; multivariate model; patient-generated health data; sex differences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38577,""
"Understanding and addressing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in low and middle income countries and in people with severe mental illness: Overview and recommendations for Latin America and the Caribbean","Despite the speedy development of vaccines for COVID-19, their rollout has posed a major public health challenge, as vaccine hesitancy (VH) and refusal are high. Addressing vaccine hesitancy is a multifactorial and context-dependent challenge. This perspective focuses on VH in the world region of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and includes people suffering from severe mental illness, therefore covering populations and subpopulations often neglected in scientific literature. We present an overview of VH in LAC countries, discussing its global and historical context. Vaccine uptake has shown to widely vary across different subregions of LAC. Current data points to a possible correlation between societal polarization and vaccination, especially in countries going through political crises such as Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. Poor accessibility remains an additional important factor decreasing vaccination rollout in LAC countries and even further, in the whole Global South. Regarding patients with severe mental illness in LAC, and worldwide, it is paramount to include them in priority groups for immunization and monitor their vaccination coverage through public health indicators.","Faria, de Matos, Llado-Medina, Pereira-Sanchez, Freire, Nardi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.910410","20220930","COVID-19; Latin America and the Caribbean; mental health; severe mental illness; vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38578,""
"A Reflection on the Relationship Between Place and Health:: Understanding Undergraduate Student Experiences and Priorities During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Environment and setting have a large influence on matters of population health, and college is a critical place for students, shaping both health and education. College students across the nation were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes at universities left many anxious, isolated, and coping with social, emotional, and educational impacts. <b>Objective:</b> To perform a data analysis of the qualitative responses garnered through the Student Return to Campus Survey administered at the University of Delaware (UD) in Spring 2020, and to identify common themes of student experiences and priorities during the pandemic years to inform future recommendations for health crisis management. <b>Methods:</b> The study utilized secondary data analysis from an online student experience survey of 2,941 Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior students from the 2020-2021 academic year. <b>Results:</b> Qualitative analysis revealed a set of common outstanding themes influencing the college pandemic experience, including: Quality and Accessibility of Education in a Virtual Learning Environment; Quality of Student Life; Mental Health During the Pandemic; Thoughts and Attitudes About Vaccination Policies, Masking, Testing, and COVID Guidelines; Priorities and Considerations About the Return to Campus; and Overall Feelings About the Pandemic at UD. <b>Conclusions:</b> Student experiences were influenced by academic, social, emotional, and financial factors, which were often described with great intensity, and were at times contradictory. Students emphasized struggles with transitioning to and with virtual learning, the quality of campus resources, financial responsibilities, family health, and personal health. The results also shed light on the importance of communication with the campus community and the desire for students to express opinions during a crisis. <b>Health Policy Implications:</b> The results of this study have implications for crisis management for college campuses and planning for future responses to unanticipated events and ongoing COVID-19 mitigation efforts.","Rao, Hoffman, Bleakley, Karpyn","https://doi.org/10.32481/djph.2022.08.012","20220930","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38579,""
"Mapping the perception-space of facial expressions in the era of face masks","With the advent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-Corona Virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, the theme of emotion recognition from facial expressions has become highly relevant due to the widespread use of face masks as one of the main devices imposed to counter the spread of the virus. Unsurprisingly, several studies published in the last 2 years have shown that accuracy in the recognition of basic emotions expressed by faces wearing masks is reduced. However, less is known about the impact that wearing face masks has on the ability to recognize emotions from subtle expressions. Furthermore, even less is known regarding the role of interindividual differences (such as alexithymic and autistic traits) in emotion processing. This study investigated the perception of all the six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise), both as a function of the face mask and as a function of the facial expressions' intensity (full vs. subtle) in terms of participants' uncertainty in their responses, misattribution errors, and perceived intensity. The experiment was conducted online on a large sample of participants (<i>N</i> = 129). Participants completed the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale and the Autistic Spectrum Quotient and then performed an emotion-recognition task that involved face stimuli wearing a mask or not, and displaying full or subtle expressions. Each face stimulus was presented alongside the Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW), and participants had to indicate what emotion they believed the other person was feeling and its intensity using the GEW. For each combination of our variables, we computed the indices of 'uncertainty' (i.e., the spread of responses around the correct emotion category), 'bias' (i.e., the systematic errors in recognition), and 'perceived intensity' (i.e., the distance from the center of the GEW). We found that face masks increase uncertainty for all facial expressions of emotion, except for fear when intense, and that disgust was systematically confused with anger (i.e., response bias). Furthermore, when faces were covered by the mask, all the emotions were perceived as less intense, and this was particularly evident for subtle expressions. Finally, we did not find any evidence of a relationship between these indices and alexithymic/autistic traits.","Verroca, de Rienzo, Gambarota, Sessa","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.956832","20220930","COVID-19; alexithymia; autistic traits; emotion recognition; face mask; facial expressions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38580,""
"The differential impact of COVID-19 on mental health: Implications of ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disability status in the United States","The COVID-19 pandemic's effects on mental health interact with preexisting health risks and disparities to impact varying populations differently. This study explored the relationship between demographic variables (e.g., ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disability status), distress and mental health (e.g., depression, anxiety, somatic complaints, and pandemic distress), and vulnerability factors for COVID-19 (e.g., personal health vulnerabilities, community members' health vulnerabilities, and environmental exposure risks at work or home). An online cross-sectional study was conducted from 18 June to 17 July 2020, reflecting the impact of early phase COVID-19 pandemic and related shelter-in-place measures in the United States. Participants were adults residing in the United States (<i>N</i> = 594), with substantial subsamples (<i>N</i> Ã¢â€°Â¥ 70) of American Indian, Asian American, African-American, and Hispanic and/or Latinx participants, as well as people with disabilities and sexual minorities. Outcomes measured were depression, hopelessness, somatic complaints, anxiety-related disorders, locus of control (LOC), and a novel measure of pandemic-related distress. Data were analyzed using analyses of covariance (ANCOVA), chi-square test, and correlation coefficients. Generally, younger individuals, and those with less financial power-across all identities-suffered more distress. When controlling for age, lower financial power was associated with higher scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (CESD-R; <i>r</i> = -0.21, <i>p</i> = &lt; 0.001), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS; <i>r</i> = -0.17, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15; <i>r</i> = -0.09, <i>p</i> = 0.01), Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders for Adults Panic Disorder (SCARED-A PD; <i>r</i> = -0.14, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), SCARED-A generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; <i>r</i> = -0.13, <i>p</i> = 0.002), SCARED-A obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; <i>r</i> = -0.08, <i>p</i> = 0.04), and the COVID-19 Pandemic Distress restriction/disconnection scale (C19PDS; <i>r</i> = -0.10, <i>p</i> = 0.009). In addition, disparities were found, in general, for marginalized identities by gender, sexual orientation, and disability status. Importantly, each ethnicity subsample showed a unique pattern of relationships between COVID-19 risk variables and mental health symptoms. The results support the hypothesis that any pandemic may amplify preexisting social and financial disparities. Overall, interventions at the clinical, governmental, or health equity level should take into consideration the needs of vulnerable groups.","Brooks, Patton, Maroukel, Perez, Levanda","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.902094","20220930","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; minorities; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38581,""
"Associations of Anxiety during the COVID-19 Pandemic with Patient Characteristics and Behaviors in CKD Patients: Findings from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with anxiety and depression. Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased stressors on patients with CKD, assessments of anxiety and its predictors and consequences on behaviors, specifically virus mitigation behaviors, are lacking. From June to October 2020, we administered a survey to 1873 patients in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, asking participants about anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined associations between anxiety and participant demographics, clinical indexes, and health literacy and whether anxiety was associated with health-related behaviors and COVID-19 mitigation behaviors. The mean age of the study population was 70 years (SD=9.6 years), 47% were women, 39% were Black non-Hispanic, 14% were Hispanic, and 38% had a history of cardiovascular disease. In adjusted analyses, younger age, being a woman, Hispanic ethnicity, cardiovascular disease, household income &lt;$20,000, and marginal or inadequate health literacy predicted higher anxiety. Higher global COVID-19-related anxiety scores were associated with higher odds of reporting always wearing a mask in public (OR=1.3 [95% CI, 1.14 to 1.48], <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) and of eating less healthy foods (OR=1.29 [95% CI, 1.13 to 1.46], <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), reduced physical activity (OR=1.32 [95% CI, 1.2 to 1.45], <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), and weight gain (OR=1.23 [95% CI, 1.11 to 1.38], <i>P</i>=0.001). Higher anxiety levels related to the COVID-19 pandemic were associated not only with higher self-reported adherence to mask wearing but also with higher weight gain and less adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors.

"Effects of yoga practice on physiological distress, fatigue and QOL in patients affected by breast cancer undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy","In this study we want to evaluate the efficacy of yoga practice on dysfunctional stress, inflammation and QOL in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy. Patients with stage 0 to III breast cancer were recruited before starting radiotherapy (XRT) and were randomly assigned to yoga group (YG) two times a week during XRT or control group (CG). Self-report measures of QOL, fatigue and sleep quality, and blood samples were collected at day 1 of treatment, day 15, end of treatment and 1, 3 and 6Ã‚Â months later. Cortisol blood level, IL6, IL10, IL1RA, TNFÃŽÂ± and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio were analyzed as measures of dysfunctional stress and inflammation. Patients started XRT and yoga classes in October 2019. Due to COVID-19 pandemic we closed the enrollment in March 2020. We analysed 24 patients, 12 YG and 12 CG. The analysis of blood cortisol levels revealed an interaction (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.04) between yoga practice and time, in particular YG had lower cortisol levels at the end of XRT respect to CG (p<i>-</i>adjÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02). The analysis of IL-1RA revealed an interaction effect (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.04) suggesting differences between groups at some time points that post-hoc tests were not able to detect. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effects of yoga in a cancer population studying inflammation markers, cortisol trend and QOL during and until 6Ã‚Â months after XRT. This study suggests that yoga practice is able to reduce stress and inflammation levels over time. Besides including a larger number of patients to increase the power, future studies should consider other inflammatory or pro inflammatory factors and long-term yoga program to gain more evidence on yoga practice benefits.","Micheletti, Serra, Tesei, Azzali, Arienti, Ancarani, Corelli, Romeo, Martinelli","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tipsro.2022.09.005","20220930","BFI, brief fatigue inventory; BH, Benjamini-Hochberg; BP, bodily pain; Breast cancer; CG, control group; EF, emotional functioning; GH, general health; LMR, lymphocyte-monocyte ratio; MCS, mental component scale; MH, mental health; Oncology; PCS, physical component scale; PF, physical functioning; PSQI, Pittsburgh sleep quality index; Physiological distress; QOL, quality of life; RE, role emotional; RP, role physical; Radiotherapy; SF, social functioning; VT, vitality; XRT, Radiotherapy; YG, yoga group; Yoga","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38583,""

Self-reported PTSD and depression prevalence at T1 were 34.6% and 21.6% respectively. While depressive symptoms worsened as the lockdown time increased, while PTSD symptoms decreased. After adjusting for confounding factors, sleep disturbance and sleep deprivation at T1 were significantly associated with increased PTSD and depressive symptoms at T2. Furthermore, sleep disturbance and sleep deprivation also predicted the new onset and persistence of PTSD and depression. Sleep disturbance predicts the development and persistence of PTSD and depression. Early assessment and treatment of sleep disturbance may be an important strategy for prevention and intervention of PTSD and depression in adolescents after experiencing the special public health emergency.","Wang, Zhao, Zhai, Ye, Bu, Fan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.986934","20220930","COVID-19; college students; depression; posttraumatic stress disorder; sleep disturbance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38584,""
"Meta-analysis of the prevalence of anxiety and depression among frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","To systematically review the prevalence of anxiety and depression among frontline healthcare workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Computers were used to search CNKI, VIP, WanFang Data, PubMed, and other Chinese and English databases. The search period was limited to December 2019 to April 2022. Cross-sectional studies collected data on the prevalence of anxiety and depression among frontline healthcare workers since the onset of COVID-19. The STATA 15.1 software was used for the meta-analysis of the included literature. A total of 30 studies were included, with a sample size of 18,382 people. The meta-analysis results showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the total prevalence of anxiety among frontline healthcare workers was 43.00%, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.36-0.50, and the total prevalence of depression was 45.00%, with a 95% CI of 0.37-0.52. The results of the subgroup analysis showed that prevalence of anxiety and depression in women, married individuals, those with children, and nurses was relatively high. Frontline healthcare workers with a bachelor's degree or lower had a higher prevalence of anxiety. The prevalence of depression was higher among frontline healthcare workers with intermediate or higher professional titles. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of anxiety and depression among frontline healthcare workers was high. In the context of public health emergencies, the mental health status of frontline healthcare workers should be given full attention, screening should be actively carried out, and targeted measures should be taken to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection among frontline healthcare workers. http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier: CRD42022344706.","Chen, Wang, Geng, Fang, Zhu, Chen, Yao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.984630","20220930","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; frontline healthcare workers; meta-analysis; prevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38585,""
"Stigma toward people with COVID-19 among Bangladeshi older adults","The onset of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and its overwhelming physical and mental health burden can result in stigmatization toward the disease and those affected. This study aimed to measure the prevalence of COVID-19-related stigma and its associated factors among older people in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,045 Bangladeshi older adults aged 60 years and above through telephone interviews in September 2021. The outcome was measured using an eight-point Stigma Scale, adapted to the Bengali language. Level of stigma was indicated by the cumulative score of the eight-items, ranging from 0 to 8, with a higher score indicating a higher level of stigma. On average, participants had stigmas on three of the eight items, and 62.6% had a high stigma score. The most prevalent stigmas were as follows: COVID-19 is a punishment from God (79.3%), patients with previous COVID-19 must be isolated (67.3%), and people infected with COVID-19 did not meet hygiene standards (63.9%). Participants who lived in rural areas (ÃŽÂ²: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.95) and who perceived needing additional care during the pandemic (ÃŽÂ²: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.60) had a higher average stigma score, whereas stigma scores were lower among unemployed/retired participants (ÃŽÂ²: -0.22, 95% CI: -0.45 to 0.00). The study findings suggest implementing interventions to raise awareness through appropriate health literacy interventions and mass media campaigns.","Mistry, Ali, Yadav, Huda, Rahman, Saha, Rahman, Lim, Ghimire","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.982095","20220930","Bangladesh; COVID-19; aged; older adults; stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38586,""
"Stress, anxiety and depression in dental students - impact of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic","With the emergence of COVID-19, dental medicine students were faced with a new reality, as a modification of the learning methods in Dentistry colleges happened. This study aim was to characterize the possible effects of Covid-19 pandemic in terms of anxiety, depression, and stress among Dentistry students. This cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2020 and May 2021. A total of 1115 participants from a universe of approximately 3000 students from the 7 University institutions that teach the master's degree in Dentistry in Portugal, agreed to participate. An online self-reported questionnaire was applied, through Google FormsÃ‚Â® platform. The questionnaire was divided in 3 sections: the students' sociodemographic characterization, pedagogical aspects, and questions about anxiety, depression, and stress using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress-21 Scale (DASS-21). Normal levels of anxiety, depression, and stress, were found in 41%, 36.7%, 22.7% of the participants, respectively. Being female was the most significant and strong predictor of anxiety and stress, and for depression, not feeling fulfilled in the course they were in was the most significant variable. The participants presented high values Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹ of anxiety, depression, and stress, during the pandemic state. Gender and not feeling fulfilled in the course were important predictors.","JosÃƒÂ©, Caldas, de Azevedo, Ferreira Lobo Pereira","https://doi.org/10.1111/eje.12858","20220930","DASS-21; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; dental student; depression; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38587,""
"Predictors of nonresponse and drop-out among children and adolescents receiving TF-CBT: investigation of client-, therapist-, and implementation factors","There is a paucity of evidence about effective implementation strategies to increase treatment response and prevent drop-out among children receiving evidence-based treatment. This study examines patient, therapist, and implementation factors and their association to nonresponse and drop-out among youth receiving Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT). Youth (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1240) aged 6-18 (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.6) received TF-CBT delivered by 382 TF-CBT therapists at 66 clinics. Odds ratio analyses were used to investigate whether pretreatment child (age, gender, number of trauma experiences, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), therapist (education), and implementation strategy factors (high-low, low-low, low-high intensity therapist and leadership training respectively) or tele-mental health training during the Covid-19 pandemic are associated with nonresponse (above clinical PTSS level post-treatment) and drop-out (therapist-defined early termination). Fidelity checks were conducted to ensure that TF-CBT was used consistently. One fourth of the children (24.4%) were nonresponders and 13.3 percent dropped out. Exposure to three or more traumatic experiences were related to nonresponse and drop-out. Higher baseline PTSS was related to a higher probability of nonresponse. There was no effect of therapist education or child gender on nonresponse and drop-out, whereas children over 15Ã‚Â years had a higher likelihood of both. After controlling for baseline PTSS, the effect of age on nonresponse was no longer significant. Drop-out was related to fewer sessions, and most dropped out during the first two phases of TF-CBT. Fidelity was high throughout the different implementation phases. High-intensity therapist training was related to a lower probability of both nonresponse and drop-out, whereas low therapist and leadership training were related to a higher likelihood of both. Multivariate analysis revealed higherÃ‚Â child age and higher PTSS baseline scores as significant predictors of nonresponse, and number of trauma experiences (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3) at baseline as the only predictor of drop-out. High-intensity therapist training seem key to prevent patient nonresponse and drop-out. Leadership training might positively affect both, although not enough to compensate for less intensive therapist training. More complex cases (higher PTSS and exposure to more traumas) predict nonresponse and drop-out respectively, which underscores the importance of symptom assessment to tailor the treatment. The lack of predictive effect of therapist education increases the utilization of TF-CBT. Retrospectively registered in ClinicalTrials, ref. nr.

"Worsening general health and psychosocial wellbeing of Australian hospital allied health practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic","ObjectiveTo describe self-reported general and psychological health for allied health practitioners at an Australian acute public health service over three time points within the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.MethodsThis study collected data from cross-sectional online surveys at three time points: May-June 2020 (T1), October-November 2020 (T2) and November-December 2021 (T3). The self-report questionnaire consisted of demographic questions, a general health question and the 21-item version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21).ResultsA total of 308 responses were received (T1 nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°135, T2 nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°78, T3 nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°95) from representatives of eight allied health professions. The proportion of allied health practitioners reporting poor general health significantly increased over time, as did mean scores on all DASS-21 sub-scales. General health status was also significantly associated with DASS-21 subscale scores. Anxiety scores increased significantly between T1 and T2, while depression scores increased significantly between T2 and T3. Significant increases in stress scores were recorded across all time intervals. Between T1 and T3, the proportion of allied health practitioners reporting moderate, severe, or extremely severe symptoms increased for depression (10.3-30.9%), anxiety (5.2-18.2%) and stress (13.3-36.3%).ConclusionThe general and psychological health of allied health practitioners appears to be worsening as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Organisational strategies to support the health of the allied health workforce in acute care settings must address the cumulative effects of prolonged pressure on their general and psychosocial health. Support strategies need to be responsive to changes in psychological wellbeing at different phases of the pandemic.","Hitch, Booth, Wynter, Said, Haines, Rasmussen, Holton","https://doi.org/10.1071/AH22110","20220929","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38589,""
"Selenium","A variety of diseases are produced by oxidative stress in the human body. Arthritis, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, loss of memory, depression, arteriosclerosis, cancer, ageing and diabetes have elements of oxidative stress in them. Selenium has several benefits on human health. It has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunological activities. Various multivitamin/multimineral formulations containing selenium are available in the market. Selenium is an ingredient of sodium selenite, selenium-enriched yeast and selenomethionine. Despite numerous benefits on human health selenium can also lead to toxicity in excess amounts. Metallic taste in mouth, smell of garlic, skin rashes and lesions, nausea, abnormalities of the nervous system, irritability and mottled teeth are certain complications associated with selenium. Selenium is very important for human health and helps in optimum functioning of the body but it can be disastrous to human health if it is consumed in excess amounts.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-819096-8.00017-3","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-01","",38590,""
