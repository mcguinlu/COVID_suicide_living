"Developing a model for predicting impairing physical symptoms in children 3 months after a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-test: The CLoCk Study","Abstract Importance: Predictive models can help identify SARS-CoV-2 patients at greatest risk of post-COVID sequelae and direct them towards appropriate care. Objective: To develop and internally validate a model to predict children and young people most likely to experience at least one impairing physical symptom 3 months after a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-test and to determine whether the impact of these predictors differed by SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Design: Potential pre-specified predictors included: SARS-CoV-2 status, sex, age, ethnicity, deprivation, quality of life/functioning (5 EQ-5D-Y items), physical and mental health, and loneliness (all prior to SARS-CoV-2 testing), and number of physical symptoms at testing. Logistic regression was used to develop the model. Model performance was assessed using calibration and discrimination measures; internal validation was performed via bootstrapping; the final model was adjusted for overfitting. Setting: National cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive and PCR-negative participants matched according to age, sex, and geographical area. Participants: Children and young people aged 11-17 years who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in England, January to March 2021. Main outcome measure: one or more physical symptom 3 months after initial PCR-testing which affected physical, mental or social well-being and interfered with daily living. Results: A total of 50,836 children and young people were approached; 7,096 (3,227 test-positives, 3,869 test-negatives) who completed a questionnaire 3 months after their PCR-test were included. 39.6% (1,279/3,227) of SAR-CoV-2 PCR-positives and 30.6% (1,184/3,869) of SAR-CoV-2 PCR-negatives had at least one impairing physical symptom 3 months post-test. The final model contained predictors: SARS-COV-2 status, number of symptoms at testing, sex, age, ethnicity, self-rated physical and mental health, feelings of loneliness and four EQ-5D-Y items before testing. Internal validation showed minimal overfitting with excellent calibration and discrimination measures (optimism adjusted calibration slope:0.97527; C-statistic:0.83640). Conclusions and relevance: We developed a risk prediction equation to identify those most at risk of experiencing at least one impairing physical symptom 3 months after a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-test which could serve as a useful triage and management tool for children and young people during the ongoing pandemic. External validation is required before large-scale implementation.","Manjula Nugawela; Terence Stephenson; Roz Shafran; Bianca Lucia De Stavola; Shamez Ladhani; Ruth Simmons; Kelsey McOwatt; Natalia Rojas; Emily Y Cheung; Tamsin Ford; Isobel Heyman; Esther Crawley; Snehal M Pinto Pereira","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.01.22273117","20220405","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29639,""
"Concerns and coping mechanisms during the first national COVID-19 lockdown: an online prospective study in Portugal","Objectives The aim of this study was to explore concerns and coping mechanisms during the first national COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal. The general population provided statements via an open comment box as part of an online prospective study. Study design Internet-based open cohort study. Methods Individuals aged =16 years were eligible to participate in this study. Inductive content analysis was performed on completed questionnaires submitted between 23â€“29 March 2020 and 27 Aprilâ€“3 May 2020 (corresponding with the early and late phases of the first national lockdown, respectively). Results Data suggest the prominence of behavioural and emotional responses to COVID-19;namely, self-compliance with measures promoted by the government;adopting practices of self-care and supporting/protecting others;and enacting hope (both currently and for the future). Concerns were related to the perception of vulnerabilities for oneself, family and others, and to challenging situations presenting in society (e.g. physical and mental health, academic/professional careers, income, social inequality, potential discrimination and stigmatisation, inconsistent information and negative approach to the news), coupled with criticism, scepticism or doubts about government policy and performance of the healthcare system. Expressions of fear and worry, and non-compliance with mitigation measures by others (e.g. close relatives, employees, general population) emerged as additional concerns. Conclusions Continuous assessment of behavioural and emotional responses to the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to support effective communication and public health policies that are sensitive to the concerns, motivations and expectations of the population. Awareness of changing public opinions enables governments to continue to effectively mobilise the population to take recommended actions to reduce transmission of COVID-19.","Silva, S.; Machado, H.; de Freitas, ClÃ¡udia, Lucas, Raquel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2022.03.014","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Public Health;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29640,""
"Awareness and perceived helpfulness of mental health peer workers in a representative sample of the australian public","The aim of the current study was to explore awareness and perceived helpfulness of mental health peer workers in Australia, and factors associated with knowledge and perceptions. As part of a broader longitudinal study of mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic, a survey of a nationally representative sample of NÂ =Â 812 Australians was conducted in June 2020. Investigation of peer work comprised two areas: 1) whether they had accessed or were aware of peer workers;and 2) perceived helpfulness of peer workers. Only participants who indicated awareness of peer workers were asked about helpfulness. Seventy-five participants (9.2%) reported accessing a peer worker, but over half the sample were not aware they existed (nÂ =Â 448). Mean helpfulness ratings indicated that participants believed peer work is somewhat or very helpful. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, age was associated with both greater awareness and perceived helpfulness;awareness was also associated with social impairment, and helpfulness with positive social support. Awareness of peer workers across the general community is limited, but peer workers are viewed favourably. Particularly in the context of increased need for mental support due to COVID-19, this suggests an opportunity to increase the workforce with an acceptable addition to clinical support.","Banfield, Michelle, Shou, Yiyun, Morse, Alyssa R.; Gulliver, Amelia, Calear, Alison L.; McCallum, Sonia, Farrer, Louise, Dawel, Amy, Batterham, Philip J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psycom.2022.100042","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research Communications;: 100042, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29641,""
"Managing uncertainty and responding to difficult emotions: Cancer patientsâ€™ perspectives on clinician response during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective Patients undergoing cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic have experienced stress and uncertainty with respect to disruptions in cancer care and COVID-19 related risks. We examined whether cliniciansâ€™ responsiveness to patientsâ€™ uncertainty and difficult emotions were associated with better health and well-being. Methods Patients were recruited from cancer support communities and a market research firm. Respondents assessed clinicians communication that addressed uncertainty and difficult emotions. Health status measures included mental and physical health, coping during the pandemic, and psychological distress. Results 317 respondents participated in the study. Patientsâ€™ perceptions of their clinicians responsiveness to patient uncertainty and negative emotions were associated with better mental health, physical health, coping, and less psychological distress (all p-values &lt;.001). Respondents with greater self-efficacy and social support also reported better health. Conclusion Even when controlling for patientsâ€™ personal and health-related characteristics, cliniciansâ€™ communication addressing patientsâ€™ uncertainty and difficult emotions predicted better health, better coping, and less psychological distress. Access to social support and self-efficacy also were associated with better health status. Practice Implications Cliniciansâ€™ communication focused on helping with uncertainty and difficult emotions is important to cancer patients, especially during the pandemic. Clinicians should also direct patients to resources for social support and patient empowerment.","Street, Richard L.; Treiman, Katherine, Wu, Qiwei, Kranzler, Elissa C.; Moultrie, Rebecca, Mack, Nicole, Garcia, Reese","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2022.03.029","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Patient Education and Counseling;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29642,""
"Investigating predictors contributing to the expression of schizotypy during the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major disruptions to social and other forms of functioning, which may influence schizotypy expression. The current study aimed to explore possible distal and proximal predictors contributing to schizotypy in a sample of the Australian general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy (COLLATE) project is an online mental health study aimed at tracking key mental health indicators over the progression of the pandemic. Adults residing in Australia were invited to take part using non-discriminative snowball sampling. Demographic-clinical information was collected for 850 participants in either October 2020 or January 2021. To assess schizotypy facets, the Launay-Slade Hallucinations Scale-Extended (LSHS-E) and Peters Delusions Inventory (PDI-21) were used to measure hallucination and delusion proneness respectively. Generalised linear models (with gamma and negative binomial distributions) were employed. Age, negative emotions and loneliness significantly contributed to both hallucination and delusion proneness;gender, education and religiosity also significantly contributed to delusion proneness, in the final regression models. Our study corroborated the specific contribution of loneliness, amongst other factors, in the prediction of schizotypy facets. Tackling loneliness represents a public health challenge that needs to be urgently addressed, especially in the face of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Toh, Wei Lin, Sumner, Philip J.; Meyer, Denny, Neill, Erica, Phillipou, Andrea, Tan, Eric J.; Van Rheenen, Tamsyn E.; Rossell, Susan L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.03.060","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29643,""
"Associations of lockdown stringency and duration with Google searches for mental health terms during the COVID-19 pandemic: A nine-country study","Objectives We examined the associations of lockdown stringency and duration with Google searches for four mental health concepts (i.e., â€œAnxiety,â€ â€œDepression,â€ â€œSuicide,â€ â€œMental Healthâ€) in nine countries (i.e., Hungary, India, Iran, Italy, Paraguay, Serbia, South Africa, Spain, Turkey) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We retrieved national-level data for each country from Google Trends and the Global Panel Database of Pandemic Policies. In our primary analysis, we used data from all countries to estimate a set of multilevel regression models examining associations of overall lockdown stringency and lockdown duration with relative search volumes for each mental health term. We repeated the models after replacing overall lockdown stringency with each of the lockdown stringency components. Results A negative association was found between overall lockdown stringency and â€œDepression.â€ Lockdown duration and the most stringent stay-at-home requirements were negatively associated with â€œAnxiety.â€ Policies that recommended or required the cancelation of public events evidenced negative associations with â€œDepression,â€ whereas associations between policies that required some or all levels of schooling to close and â€œDepressionâ€ were positive. Policies that recommended or required workplaces to close and those that enforced quarantines on non-citizens arriving from high-risk regions or closed borders entirely were negatively associated with â€œSuicide.â€œ Conclusions Lockdown duration and some lockdown policies during the COVID-19 pandemic were generally associated with significantly lower, rather than higher, Google searches for selected mental health terms. These findings could be used alongside other evidence to develop future lockdown strategies that are sensitive to mental health issues during public health crises.","de la Rosa, Pedro A.; Cowden, Richard G.; de Filippis, Renato, Jerotic, Stefan, Nahidi, Mahsa, Ori, Dorottya, Orsolini, Laura, Nagendrappa, Sachin, Pinto da Costa, Mariana, Ransing, Ramdas, Saeed, Fahimeh, Shoib, Sheikh, Turan, Serkan, Ullah, Irfan, Vadivel, Ramyadarshni, Ramalho, Rodrigo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.03.026","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29644,""
"IMPLEMENTATION OF A OSTEOARTHRITIS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN THE UNITED STATES","Purpose: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic and disabling condition affecting morbidity and mortality. Despite its high prevalence and the availability of international management guidelines, nearly half of patients do not receive recommended treatments. OA Management Programs (OAMPs) are an alternative care model to reduce barriers and enhance the receipt of evidence-based care. This study was designed to evaluate the fidelity and feasibility of an OAMP in a United States academic medical center and understand its patients' baseline characteristics. Methods: The OAMP, which opened on July 1, 2017, is focused on knee and hip osteoarthritis. A multi-disciplinary group, including patients with OA, designed the clinic model and operations based on international OAMP implementation recommendations considering local factors. The intended treatment dose was 1-6 appointments over 4-12 months with no more than two months between visits. At each appointment, patients had the opportunity to meet with a care team comprised of a medical provider (physician or advanced practice provider), registered dietitian, physical therapist, and mental health counselor. All providers had completed OA clinical competency training. Telemedicine video visits were also available after June 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients are asked to complete the patient questionnaires before their visit through a patient portal in the electronic health record. They are also provided with a tablet computer to complete the VR-12 and the HOOS and/or KOOS while in the clinic waiting room. For this study, a database was created for all adult patients who had at least one clinic visit from July 1, 2017, to January 15, 2021. Data was collected by an electronic health record data pull and a manual audit of visit notes. Primary outcomes related to clinic feasibility and fidelity included clinic operations and expansion, treatment duration, and number and type of appointments attended. Secondary outcomes included patients' baseline characteristics. Results: The 938 eligible patients attended an average of 2.7 visits over a mean of 114.4 days (Â±5.9). Patients utilized the OAMP differently: 371 (39.5%) of patients attended 1 visit, 348 (37.1%) attended 2-3, and 232 (24.7%) attended 4 or more. A total of 175 (18.66%) completed at least one telemedicine visit. Patient referrals came predominantly from primary care (61%%) and orthopedics (20.3%);8.6% were self-referred. The average time between seeking care and the first appointment is just over six weeks. Due to patient demand, the program has expanded from seeing six patients per week to seeing more than 40 patients per week. The expansion has required hiring and training an increased number of clinicians, starting with four clinicians in different specialties to 11 clinicians. The average patient was 62.2 years (Â±10.2), and most were female (72%). Nearly all were Caucasian (91.3%). Medicare (51.4%) was the most common type of insurance, followed by commercial insurance (38.3%). Half of the patients were employed (49%), while 32% were retired. At the initial visit, the average BMI was 40.9 (Â±10). The average Charlson Comorbidity Index score (CCI) was 2.1 (Â±1.3), indicating moderate severity of comorbid conditions. The baseline pain rating was moderate at 4.44 (Â±2.37) on a 1-10 pain scale. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Hip Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) pain scores were 47.9 (Â±18) and 44.9 (Â±23.6), respectively showing moderate baseline levels of pain. Veterans-Rand 12 scores were low at the initial visit. The VR-12 physical and mental subscales were 25.66 (Â±7.35) and 48.15 (Â±10.76) lower than expected for an adult population. The average number of repetitions obtained from the 30-second chair rise test was 10.65 (Â±3.49), which is lower than age and gender norms. The completion rate of self-administered patient questionnaires was low, with less than half of patients completing all questionnaires at the initial visit. Conclusions: Baseline data reveals patie ts with high levels of pain, low function, and multiple comorbid conditions who are willing to attend multiple visits. The program has continued to expand to meet increased patient demand. Patient utilization of the clinic varied, with some patients attending only one appointment and others returning numerous times. Despite being invited back within two months, a subset of patients returned for a second appointment more than six months after their initial appointment. Completion rates of the self-questionnaires (HOOS/KOOS, VR-12) were low despite having options of how to complete these. The low completion rate indicates that instruments should be selected judiciously with careful consideration for which should be administered at every clinic visit. Clinic operations and growth are feasible with variable fidelity. The next steps will be an evaluation of patient utilization of the clinic and its impact on patients outcomes.","Miller, K.; Yu, T.

"Effectiveness of family connections intervention for family members of persons with personality disorders in two different formats: Online vs face-to-face","Introduction Personality disorders (PD) have a serious impact on the lives of individuals who suffer from them and those around them. It is common for family members to experience high levels of burden, anxiety, and depression, and deterioration in their quality of life. It is curious that few interventions have been developed for family members of people with PD. However, Family Connections (FC) (Hoffman and Fruzzetti, 2005) is the most empirically supported intervention for family members of people with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Aim The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of online vs face-to-face FC. Given the current social constraints resulting from SARS-CoV-2, interventions have been delivered online and modified. Method This was a non-randomized pilot study with a pre-post evaluation and two conditions: The sample consisted of 45 family members distributed in two conditions: FC face-to-face (20) performed by groups before the pandemic, and FC online (25), performed by groups during the pandemic. All participants completed the evaluation protocol before and after the intervention. Results There is a statistically significant improvement in levels of burden (<U+03B7> 2Â =Â 0.471), depression, anxiety, and stress (<U+03B7> 2Â =Â 0.279), family empowerment (<U+03B7> 2Â =Â 0.243), family functioning (<U+03B7> 2Â =Â 0.345), and quality of life (Âµ2 <U+03B7> 2Â =Â 0.237). There were no differences based on the application format burden (<U+03B7> 2Â =Â 0.134);depression, anxiety, and stress (<U+03B7> 2Â =Â 0.087);family empowerment (<U+03B7> 2Â =Â 0,27), family functioning (<U+03B7> 2Â =Â 0.219);and quality of life (<U+03B7> 2Â =Â 0.006), respectively). Conclusions This study provides relevant data about the possibility of implementing an intervention in a sample of family members of people with PD in an online format without losing its effectiveness. During the pandemic, and despite the initial reluctance of family members and the therapists to carry out the interventions online, this work shows the effectiveness of the results and the satisfaction of the family members. These results are particularly relevant in a pandemic context, where there was no possibility of providing help in other ways. All of this represents a great step forward in terms of providing psychological treatment.","GuillÃ©n, V.; Fonseca-Baeza, S.; FernÃ¡ndez de Felipe, I.; Botella, C.; BaÃ±os, R.; GarcÃ­a-Palacios, A.; Marco, J.

"â€˜You can't walk through water without getting wetâ€™ UK nursesâ€™ distress and psychological health needs during the Covid-19 pandemic: A longitudinal interview study","Background Pre-COVID-19 research highlighted the nursing profession worldwide as being at high risk from symptoms of burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicide. The World Health Organization declared a pandemic on 11th March 2020 due to the sustained risk of further global spread of COVID-19. The high healthcare burden associated with COVID-19 has increased nursesâ€™ trauma and workload, thereby exacerbating pressure on an already strained workforce and causing additional psychological distress for staff. Objectives The Impact of COVID-19 on Nurses (ICON) interview study examined the impacts of the pandemic on frontline nursing staff's psychosocial and emotional wellbeing. Design Longitudinal qualitative interview study. Settings Nurses who had completed time 1 and 2 of the ICON survey were sampled to include a range of UK work settings including acute, primary and community care and care homes. Interviewees were purposively sampled for maximum variation to cover a broad range of personal and professional factors, and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, including redeployment. Methods Nurses participated in qualitative in-depth narrative interviews after the first wave of COVID-19 in July 2020 (n=27) and again at the beginning of the second wave in December 2020 (n=25) via video and audio platform software. Rigorous qualitative narrative analysis was undertaken both cross-sectionally (within wave) and longitudinally (cross wave) to explore issues of consistency and change. Results The terms moral distress, compassion fatigue, burnout and PTSD describe the emotional states reported by the majority of interviewees leading many to consider leaving the profession. Causes of this identified included care delivery challenges;insufficient staff and training;PPE challenges and frustrations. Four themes were identified: (1) â€˜Deathscapesâ€™ and impoverished care (2) Systemic challenges and self-preservation (3) Emotional exhaustion and (4) (Un)helpful support. Conclusions Nurses have been deeply affected by what they have experienced and are forever altered with the impacts of COVID-19 persisting and deeply felt. There is an urgent need to tackle stigma to create a psychologically safe working environment and for a national COVID-19 nursing workforce recovery strategy to help restore nurse's well-being and demonstrate a valuing of the nursing workforce and therefore support retention.","Maben, J.; Conolly, A.; Abrams, R.; Rowland, E.; Harris, R.; Kelly, D.; Kent, B.; Couper, K.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2022.104242","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Nursing Studies;: 104242, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29648,""

"eP490: A united front on tackling a pandemic â€“ the true value of industry and government partnerships","Introduction: The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, in late 2019 put every country on high alert and led to major changes in global diagnostic testing capability in infectious disease. From the outset it was apparent that local health authorities were under-prepared and under-staffed to cope with the rapid onset and spread of the disease. Demand for SAR-CoV-2 testing soared, highlighting the limitations of capacity in existing infectious disease laboratories along with requests from governments to support growing testing need. We partnered with US and UK Governments to establish, supply, staff and operate three large-scale, high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing facilities. These were ultimately established in Valencia, CA, offering testing of up to 150k samples per day, and in Loughborough and Newport, UK, offering a combined testing of up to 70k samples per day. The biggest challenge faced globally was the unprecedented scale of testing required and the timeframe to deliver a reliable and sensitive high-throughput assay. The benefits of industry and government partnerships become evident along with having a dedicated supply chain to feed the reagent and consumable needs for high-throughput testing as well as a highly accurate test with a fast turnaround time. Experts from multiple divisions, including R&D, Genomics, Enterprise, and regional centres were bought into the project, resulting in the establishment of SARS-CoV-2 testing within the three facilities in approximately eight weeks. Clinical testing experts in high-throughput, newborn screening, and rare disease testing, built molecular testing pipelines for the facilities based around the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays and sequencing. Laboratories were setup to meet the requirements set by various regulatory and accreditation agencies such as Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, College of American Pathologies, the UK National Health Service validation group and ISO15189. Methods: Underpinning the testing was the massive IT and bioinformatics effort to enable reporting of the testing outcomes to the relevant authorities. We were able to deploy a novel LIMS system that is used throughout the laboratories to maintain sample chain of custody from arrival at the facility to reporting of results and incorporating interpretive software to support clinical interpretation of the resulting RT-PCR data. The LIMS systems are constantly undergoing improvement to support interpretation and troubleshooting. Local experts in clinical interpretation and reporting were onboarded to augment data analysis and ensure high-quality and reliable reporting whilst ensuring that clinical governance remains at the centre of all activities. Results: Before any SARS-CoV-2 testing was able to commence, several significant challenges were overcome by combining the expertise of our global teams with the local knowledge and support of the respective Governments. Experts in logistics and program management were able to convert three empty facilities with no pre-existing laboratory infrastructure into fully functional clinical testing laboratories within eight weeks. Our assay manufacturing capacity was majorly expanded to accommodate the requirements of SARS-CoV-2 testing, with all three facilities operating on automated platforms and utilizing chemistry with a dedicated secure supply chain. The final major challenge was rapid onboarding and training of staff for the facilities, and a year out, the two active facilities are currently employing over 600 individuals. Conclusion: To date the three facilities have performed over 12 million SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays and SARS-CoV-2 testing will continue into 2022. The number of cases is again growing globally, and with the emergence of new variants and continual uncertainty about the impact on existing vaccines, there is an ongoing requirement for this scale of testing. From the experience of the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, the benefits of industry and government collaboration or the public has become much clearer, including greater access to large-scale testing options, significant reductions in time-to-testing and reporting and the rapid deployment of modern, cutting edge technology in diagnostic and monitoring programmes and eventually reduced costs to health services from mass-production. Ultimately the longevity of the individual testing facilities is unclear, but the future of large-scale clinical testing has changed forever and the legacy of this is the clear benefit to everybody when industry and governments work together to provide the public high quality and reliable testing operations.","Jarvis, I.; Chin, E.; Rosendorff, A.; Bean, L.; Dallaire, S.; Best, J.; Wilbraham, S.; Romigh, S.; Borandi, P.

"To ignore or not to ignore: The differential effect of coping mechanisms on depressive symptoms when facing adolescent cyberbullying","Cyberbullying among adolescents has negative consequences for their mental health, especially when it comes to depressive symptoms. Previous studies highlight individual protective factors such as coping strategies;however, there are no studies that examine the harmful effects of cyberbullying and the implications of different coping strategies on depressive symptoms in the context of a pandemic in diverse regional and national samples. We used two independent samples (the first consisted of 463 adolescents, 73.4% females, and the second had 694 adolescents, 85.45% females, all 15â€“19 years old). We ran moderation models through ordinary least squares regressions on depressive symptoms. Our results found that victims have higher levels of depression. Disconnecting from social media is associated with depressive symptoms when the frequency of cyberbullying is low. Ignoring the situation is associated with lower depressive symptoms when the cyberbullying frequency is low. Our study adds evidence of the importance and specificity of coping strategies while facing cyberbullying in a context of an adolescent's increased virtual interactions. â€¢ Disconnecting from social media is associated with more depressive symptoms when the frequency of cyberbullying is low. â€¢ Disconnecting from social media in a high frequency of cyberbullying predicted decreases in depressive symptoms. â€¢ Ignoring the situation was associated with less depressive symptoms when the frequency of cyberbullying was low. â€¢ Ignoring the situation was associated with higher depressive symptoms when the frequency of cyberbullying was high.","Varela, Jorge J.; HernÃ¡ndez, CristÃ³bal, Berger, Christian, Souza, Sidclay B.; Pacheco, Emanuel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2022.107268","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Computers in Human Behavior; 132:N.PAG-N.PAG, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29651,""
"Impact of regional transport on total OX (NO2+ O3) concentrations observed at a tropical rural location","In general, local emissions and long-range transport will dictate the pollution levels over a given place. The former source will be based on the location whether it is urban/rural but there are no boundaries to the latter source. During most of the time in a year, long-range transport will decide the pollution levels. Here we present the experimental evidence for regional (long-range) transport impacts on the total OX (NO2Â +Â O3) concentration at a tropical rural location. Two major independent events of the year 2020 in India, the COVID-19 lockdown and Deep depression in Bay of Bengal (BoB2) have been used to demonstrate the known fact of mixing of aged and freshly emitted ozone precursors on the total OX concentration and their influence on observed total OX. COVID-19 lockdown event happened in the summer season whereas the BoB2 event happened during the post-monsoon period. Air mass transport during events at the observational site is completely different which brings the regional transport influence. Further, total OX observed has no local contribution and is controlled entirely by the regional contribution. These observations have been well supported by the CWT analysis and wind circulation patterns during the events. This study provides a clear demonstration of the regional pollution transport influence on the total OX at a rural environment (which control the oxidative capacity of the rural atmosphere). Thus, caution is advised in designating the location as rural/urban based on local emissions alone.","Jain, Chaithanya D.; Ratnam, M. Venkat, Madhavan, B. L.; Sindhu, S.; Kumar, A.

"Smart technologies to tackle COVID 19","In Just a few months' time, The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly favored digital transitions and Iemerging technologies to deal with the emergency health situations, the shift towards remote working and mobility restrictions. The use of cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), big data, telemedicine, block chain, 5G technology, smart applications, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), robotics, geospatial technology, drones are substantially important for COVID-19 detecting, monitoring, diagnosing, screening, surveillance, mapping, tracking, and creating awareness. The smart technologies are transforming healthcare and the smart phone applications that connect large populations can be configured to tackle emergency situations. The patients have moved dramatically toward on line channels. Technology and social media companies are already on their own mission to achieve global spread, reaching a point where everyone on this planet who wants one can have a digital and online presence. The crisis has demonstrated that it is impossible to ignore technological advancements and the digital opportunities that can support the long-term sustainable development of each country. Digital transformation is changing the face of healthcare, however, to effectively use these technologies, we first need to fully understand the challenges that the healthcare sector experiences from multiple perspectives, including patients, healthcare professionals, management and public health.","Gouget, B.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12291-021-01019-3","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian Journal of Clinical Biochemistry; 36(SUPPL 1):S14-S15, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29653,""

"Advancing effective school behavioral health","Reviews the development of the Southeastern School Behavioral Health Community (SSBHC, see www.schoolbehavioralhealth.org), a regional community of practice focused on improving and expanding school behavioral health (SBH) programs involving clinicians from the mental health system joining schools' multitiered systems of support (MTSS). The community was strengthened by a Eugene Washington Engagement Award from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), and this support also enabled the conduct of eight focus groups, each including diverse representatives (e.g., teachers, mental health clinicians, family members, youth, systems leaders) in locations around South Carolina. Focus groups included five critical theme areas focusing on improving collaboration, school-wide strategies, cultural humility, overall program quality, and implementation support. Three final focus groups focused on priority populations of students connecting to juvenile justice or child welfare systems, or from military families. This introductory chapter to the book briefly reviews these eight themes, reviews methodology for qualitative analyses of focus group data, and discusses the advancement of SBH in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"A critical consideration of 'mental health and wellbeing' in education: Thinking about school aims in terms of wellbeing","This paper examines ideas about mental health, wellbeing and school education to illustrate important issues in the relationship between mental health and education. The Covid crisis has amplified the pre-existing mental health problems of children and young people in England and recognition of the opportunities in schools to address these. The paper gives an overview of child and adolescent mental health services and how they position the role of schools. It examines prominent concepts of mental health and their relationship to wellbeing, setting this in a discussion of 'mentally healthy' schools, mental health in special educational needs and whole-school approaches. This analysis shows how the relationship between mental health and wellbeing has not been adequately worked out, using this as the basis for arguing for the dual-factor mental health model which separates mental illness/disorder from wellbeing as two related dimensions. The paper then translates the dual-factor model into a two-dimensional framework that represents the distinctive but related aims of school education (wellbeing promotion) and mental health services (preventing, coping, helping mental health difficulties). This framework involves a complex conception of wellbeing, with schools playing an important role in promoting wellbeing (beyond emotional wellbeing), tiered models and establishing school-wide social emotional learning. It is about a whole-school curriculum approach that involves considering what is to be learned and how it is taught. It contributes to a more nuanced concept of wellbeing that has a place for meaningful learning and challenge.","Norwich, B.; Moore, D.; Stentiford, L.; Hall, D.","https://doi.org/10.1002/berj.3795","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: British Educational Research Journal;: 18, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29656,""
"THE EFFECT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON DEATH ANXIETY OF NURSING STUDENTS","Background: It is required to determine death anxiety of nursing students so that they who will become healthcare professionals can cope with the fast-spreading and high-mortality diseases such as COVID-19 infection upon graduation, can communicate with infected and dying patients, and can provide patients with the necessary support and care. The purpose of this study is to determine the death anxiety experienced by nursing students due to COVID-19, the related factors. Subjects and methods: This descriptive and correlational study was completed between June and September 2020. The data were collected by using the Socio-demographic and COVID-19 Pandemic Information Form and Death Anxiety Scale (DAS). The student nurses who agreed to participate in the study were asked to fill out an online questionnaire that was sent by the researchers. The study was conducted with 115 nursing students. Results: The DAS mean scores of the nursing students were found to be 8.01 +/- 1.96 When the correlation between DAS scores of the nursing students and their knowledge and attitudes regarding COVID-19 pandemic was examined, it was determined that as their anxiety levels about transmission of coronavirus increased, DAS scores also increased (p=0.037). The scores of death anxiety scale decreased as the level of students' attention to events other than coronavirus, their level of comforting themselves and their belief mentioning that they would heal if they catch coronavirus increased (p&lt;0.05). No statistically significant correlation was found between DAS scores and other knowledge and attitudes of nursing students regarding COVID-19 pandemic (p&lt;0.05).

"PRE-PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT: BI-SCREENING FOR DEPRESSION AMONG BREAST CANCER PATIENTS","Objective: This study aimed to evaluate depression among Jordanian patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study targeted female Jordanian patients with breast cancer who were receiving active treatment at King Abdullah University Hospital in Jordan. The severity of depression was assessed using the PHQ-9 scale, followed by analysis of the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) serum levels. Results: A total of 300 patients participated in this study (mean age 45.3 years). Of the 300 participants, 41% (n = 123) were classified as depressed (PHQ-9 5), and 59% (n = 177) were classified as nondepressed (PHQ-9 &lt; 5). The prevalence of depression was 41.6% according to the PHQ-9 scale. Of these, 20.8%, 66.6%, and 13.6% had mild, moderate, and severe depression, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the likelihood of depression was higher with increased age, being married, and having a higher education (p &lt; 0.05). Somatic presentation of depression, mainly sleep problems and loss of energy, were the most prevalent symptoms among patients. An inverse association was found between PHQ-9 scores and BDNF levels. ROC curve analysis for BDNF serum, predicting depression, yielded the following indices: AUC = 0.737 (95% CI 0.645-0.830), with 90.1% sensitivity and 82.5% (1-specificity). Patients with mild depression had a significantly higher level of BDNF serum than those with moderate or severe depression. Conclusions: A substantial number of Jordanian patients with breast cancer have been suffering from depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Evaluation of an After-School Program for African-American and Hispanic Male Youth: Please Call Me Mister","The novel coronavirus significantly impacted the lives of people worldwide. In the United States, the lives of children and youth were disrupted with school closures and lack of access to afterschool programs they previously attended. African American and Hispanic boys attending an after-school program in Franklin County, Kentucky, called Please Call Me Mister, were among the young people affected. A study was conducted to assess the impact of the afterschool program. The boys were surveyed at the start of the program in November 2017 and again in November 2020 to assess their injury risk, substance use, future orientation, resilience, and exposure to cyberbullying. It was anticipated that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated stay-at-home orders would negatively impact program outcomes. Program participants showed outstanding resilience and resistance to most negative behaviors with the exception of marijuana use that increased though not significantly. Their level of depression decreased, but remained at a level that warrants concern. The data collected suggest that the Please Call Me Mister program that continued remotely throughout the pandemic had an overall, long-term, positive impact on program participants. Key Take Away Points â€¢Afterschool programs offer benefit for improving behavioral outcomes among African American and Hispanic male program participants. â€¢Long-term participation in after-school program may positively impact participantsâ€™ resilience. â€¢The potential negative mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic were lessened due to African American and Hispanic malesâ€™ involvement in an afterschool program.","Walston, Herman, Meshack, Angela, Smoot-Baker, Ashlie","https://www.google.com/search?q=Evaluation+of+an+After-School+Program+for+African-American+and+Hispanic+Male+Youth:+Please+Call+Me+Mister","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Family Strengths; 21(1):3, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29660,""

"High school experiences of student advisory in fostering resilience","This study explored the extent to which a student advisory program in a large public high school fostered adolescent resilience. To address the void in scholarly literature, this study explored how adults and students experienced and perceived a student advisory program designed to foster adolescent resilience. Resilience is vital in the context of adolescent suicide and suicidal ideation combined with a worldwide pandemic. Resilience is a necessary skill as students navigate adolescent life coping with stress and dealing with daily challenges. This investigation lasted for one school year and included interviews and carefully reviewed documents. Ten students and seven adults who had participated in the advisory program for two years were interviewed in this qualitative case study, using a structured protocol that drew out nuanced versions of adult and student perceptions relating to this topic. The findings revealed five themes: (a) the role of caring adults in creating connections, (b) the development of connectedness to a positive school climate, (c) the meaning of groups, (d) the influence of student advisory on academics and resilience, and (e) the impressions of student advisory. The findings are significant in understanding the potential challenges to engaging in this work. The structure of the advisory program was designed to offset risk factors while focusing on protective factors to foster resiliency. An advisory program that incorporates teachers as mentor advisors cultivating strong, caring relationships between students as a primary focus may contribute to adolescent's protective factors.

"The Students' Point of View on the Teaching of Anatomy at the Universidad del Norte, Colombia, Amid the Covid-19 Pandemic","The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted long-standing educational practices. In Colombia, online learning depends on academic and non-academic factors, and this dependence makes e-learning even more difficult. This paper aimed to study the students' viewpoint of Anatomy teaching at Universidad del Norte, Colombia, during the Covid-19 pandemic. One hundred sixteen students answered a questionnaire about their opinions on several topics related to online learning of Anatomy. The strongest correlation observed showed that the students agree that online anatomy classes make the subject more difficult to learn when compared to face-to-face lectures. Negative attitudes toward motivation, lack of personal contact with classmates, and complaints about being taught without laboratory sessions with cadavers were among the principal negative attitudes in students. After almost one year, motivation to participate in online classes went down;however, students improved their judgment about remote anatomy learning and their views about using authentic anatomy images during online sessions and substituting real anatomy images for apps. Anatomy sessions will have to adapt their learning tools to e-learning as time constraints allow, creating a new environment for students to participate, learn, and take advantage of this change.","Martinez, E.

"SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic and its impact on the mental health of psychiatric patients compared to mentally healthy people","Introduction/Objective. Data on the psychological consequences of social isolation imposed by the global public health threat of the SARS-CoV-2 viral pandemic are limited. Mentally healthy people and psychiatric patients react to stress in different ways. This study aims to examine the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 viral pandemic on the mental health of psychiatric patients compared to mentally healthy people. Methods. The study is designed as a cross-sectional study. It was conducted during April, May and June 2020 at the end and immediately after the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 viral pandemic in Serbia. Participants were divided into two groups - a clinical group of patients with mental disorders and a control group composed of healthy volunteers. A self-assessment questionnaire was used to collect data on the presence of anxiety and symptoms of depression and behavioral disorders that indicate increased levels of stress - such as insomnia, sedative abuse. Results. Anxiety, fear, panic attacks (80%), depressive symptoms (70%), sleep problems (81%) and sedative abuse (82%) were the most commonly reported psychiatric symptoms in the study group. Healthy subjects in the control group had statistically significantly less frequent presence of symptoms and signs associated with mental problems, although in this group the prevalence of symptoms of mental disorders is not negligible (anxiety, fear, panic attacks (40%), depressive symptoms (22%) and sedative abuse (10%)). Conclusion. The results support the negative impact of the SARS-CoV-2 viral pandemic on the mental health of psychiatric patients. It can be expected that the most pronounced effects of the pandemic on mental health in the general population will be visible in the future.","Kuljancic, D.; Bosnjak, M. C.; Vejnovic, A.

"Suicide attempt in COVID 19 public health crisis","Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shaken the health systems worldwide. Severe depression and anxiety symptoms are expected to be the most prevalent psychopathological presentations connected with global health crisis like the COVID 19 pandemic. Untreated depression and severe anxiety are noticed to be the most prevalent accompanying medical conditions in social, public health crisis which very frequently result in a suicide attempt . This paper aims to present a case report where the ""trigger"" for a suicide attempt was the current situation during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The suicide attempt was a poisoning with Anti-HIV drugs. Case report. A 28 year old male, student, homosexually oriented, HIV positive, single, with previously diagnosed general anxiety disorder was admitted to the emergency centre because of the self-poisoning for suicidal purposes. After detoxification and initial management at the emergency centre, the patient was admitted to psychiatric clinic where support and cognitive behavioral therapy was administered in combination with antidepressants which eventually led to a satisfactory improvement in his mental state. The suicide attempt followed a difficult period in the patient's personal and emotional life, and socioeconomic problems that are a direct consequence of the Covid 19 pandemic. Several times the patient tried to seek help at the local health centre, but was unable to make an appointment because his family doctor worked in Covid 19 Centre. Conclusion. One of the leading reasons for the increased number of attempted and committed suicides is the unrecognition and lack of treatment of mental disorders symptoms especially in such a public health crisis like Covid 19 pandemic is globally.","Kuljancic, D.; Bosnjak, M.

"COVID-19 and the Increase in Domestic Violence","Has COVID-19 caused a disaster within a disaster? While many were focused on saving the lives of those stricken by the virus, other were being killed by their intimate partners. What happens when there is nowhere to run? How can one reach out for help, when everyone they would have reached out to is also isolated? How can one find out if theyâ€™re being abused, if the resources they used to have access to have been depleted? Once the jobs are taken away, homes;internet;cell phones;cars and the like are soon to follow. What happens when one loses their identity as they know it? Depression and a lack of self-control become more visible, where they once were able to be hidden. When there is a lack of self-control and a lack of resources to help sustain self-control, some seek to address mounting issues the best way they know how.

"Diagnosis and therapeutic relationships: The perspectives of service users with a borderline personality disorder diagnosis","This thesis begins with a literature review exploring how individuals who have a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) experience the therapeutic relationship during psychological therapy. A systematic literature search identified 15 papers which were synthesised using a meta-ethnographic approach. Three third order themes emerged;valuing a therapeutic relationship, building a connection (based on trust), and coming together to navigate the therapeutic relationship. These findings highlight the importance of the therapeutic relationship across psychological therapies for people with a BPD diagnosis and that positive therapeutic relationships are needed for successful therapy. Clinical implications are discussed.The research paper explores service-user perceptions of how receiving a diagnosis of BPD affects wellbeing. Nine participants were interviewed, and data were analysed using a constructivist grounded theory method. A model was developed which highlighted two key processes that influenced participants' wellbeing. Firstly, the way in which the diagnosis was communicated, as this laid foundations for participants' perceptions of the diagnosis. Secondly, participants' experiences of the perceived advantages and disadvantages of living with the diagnosis, which included the responses of services, the influence on participants' social relationships and impact of stigma. The findings are discussed in relation to the existing literature surrounding mental health diagnosis and contributes by highlighting the specific processes and mechanisms which occur for people who receive a diagnosis of BPD. From the developed model clinical implications and areas of future research are proposed.The critical appraisal focuses on the findings of the empirical paper and processes of carrying out a grounded theory investigation. Issues around conducting research during the Covid-19 pandemic are also considered.

"ATTITUDES TOWARDS EHEALTH DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: UNTANGLING THE GORDIAN KNOT IN GREECE, BULGARIA AND ROMANIA IN HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND STUDENTS?","Background: Until recent times, healthcare specialists lagged behind other fields in terms of computer networks and software usage, partly because they were uncomfortable with information and communication technologies. The rapid development of personal wearables, their easier connections with smartphones and other similar devices, and the possibilities of online or cloud storage of personal medical data led to improvements of eHealth services in terms of ease of access and reduced costs of delivery. Subjects and methods: The current research aimed to fill a research gap regarding attitudes towards eHealth during the COVID-19 pandemic in three Balkan countries: Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania. A total number of 775 adult participants (healthcare professionals and students in the field) were contacted in the winter of 2020 and asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their eHealth attitudes. Results: The Greek participants had the most negative attitudes toward eHealth services. This may be due to forced use of eHealth applications during the pandemic crisis and the need for mastering the necessary technical skills to use them. Conclusions: It should be noted that in the scientific literature no research is found on this topic, therefore it is the first study aimed to assessing and comparing attitudes towards eHealth in these countries.","Giannouli, V.; Stoyanova, S.; Drugas, M.; Ivanova, D.","https://www.google.com/search?q=ATTITUDES+TOWARDS+EHEALTH+DURING+THE+COVID-19+PANDEMIC:+UNTANGLING+THE+GORDIAN+KNOT+IN+GREECE,+BULGARIA+AND+ROMANIA+IN+HEALTHCARE+PROFESSIONALS+AND+STUDENTS?","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatria Danubina; 33:S415-S419, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29671,""

Virtanen, Roberto Ariel Abeldano Zuniga, Joseph Chukwudi Okeibunor and Annie Lu Nguyen (BMC Psychiatry, 2022[Jan][21], Vol 22[48]). In the original article, affiliation 7 is incorrectly assigned to Eshrat Ara. The correct affiliations are given in erratum. (The following  of the original article appeared in record 2022-26374-001). Background: Nigeria is a country with high risk for traumatic incidences, now aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to identify differences in COVID-19 related post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among people living and not living with HIV;to assess whether PTSS were associated with COVID-19 pandemic-related anger, loneliness, social isolation, and social support;and to determine the association between PTSS and use of COVID-19 prevention strategies. Methods: The data of the 3761 respondents for this analysis was extracted from a cross-sectional online survey that collected information about mental health and wellness from a convenience sample of adults, 18 years and above, in Nigeria from July to December 2020. Information was collected on the study's dependent variable (PTSS), independent variables (self-reported COVID-19, HIV status, use of COVID-19 prevention strategies, perception of social isolation, access to emotional support, feelings of anger and loneliness), and potential confounder (age, sex at birth, employment status). A binary logistic regression model tested the associations between independent and dependent variables. Results: Nearly half (47.5%) of the respondents had PTSS. People who had symptoms but were not tested (AOR = 2.20), felt socially isolated (AOR = 1.16), angry (AOR = 2.64), or lonely (AOR = 2.19) had significantly greater odds of reporting PTSS (p &lt; 0.001). People living with HIV (AOR = 0.39), those who wore masks (AOR = 0.62) and those who had emotional support (AOR = 0.63), had lower odds of reporting PTSS (p &lt; .05). Conclusion: The present study identified some multifaceted relationships between post-traumatic stress, HIV status, facemask use, anger, loneliness, social isolation, and access to emotional support during this protracted COVID-19 pandemic. These findings have implications for the future health of those affected, particularly for individuals living in Nigeria. Public health education should be incorporated in programs targeting prevention and prompt diagnosis and treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder at the community level.

"Social Media as Contractual Networks: A Bottom Up Check on Content Moderation","Is there any limit to social media platforms' ostensibly unfettered discretion to indefinitely suspend users' accounts or remove content? The fierce debate over the exercise of discretionary power by platforms to terminate users ' accounts and remove content has primarily focused on free speech ramifications and the constitutional restraints on top-down legal interventions. While suspension and removal decisions by platforms often trigger questions situated in public law, they also raise important challenges to private law. Cutting the livelihood of small businesses, independent creators and political activists, termination and removal decisions may carry irreparable financial and reputational harms. When moderating content, digital platforms exercise discretionary powers conferred under boilerplate contracts defining their Terms of Service. So far, platforms have successfully invoked contractual provisions as a shield against lawsuits of users claiming that unjustified suspension was a breach of contract. This Article argues that courts have often erroneously dismissed users' claims because they have misinterpreted the agreement between platforms and users as dyadic, namely involving two contracting parties. The interpretation of such contracts as establishing bilateral/vertical obligations only, undermines the true intention of the contracting parties and overlooks the plethora of rights and obligations created by such contracts to multiple stakeholders. The purpose of this Article is to highlight this blind spot in current contractual analysis and offer courts an interpretive framework for addressing contractual claims involving digital platforms. We argue that platforms' contracts should be interpreted as contractual networks. This analytical framework is based on a growing body of literature which focuses on interrelated contractual obligations among independent agents who share a common goal. Users in social media platforms, we argue, collaborate in creating the shared economic and social value generated by social media. By framing the contractual relationship between platforms and users as a contractual network, courts are called to consider this complexity and the extent to which removals or terminations meet the contractual expectations of the networks' members and advance their common goal. This approach to contract interpretation may facilitate a bottom-up check on content moderation via private ordering thus increasing platforms' accountability. Specifically, if users could effectively raise contractual claims against platforms and hold them accountablefor capricious, biased, or unfair removal decisions, they could pressure platforms to align content moderation policies with the shared interests of the community of users. To that end, contract law could empower users by offering a decentralized and diversified check over the platforms' content moderation practices. Holding platforms accountable for content moderation practices via private ordering could also facilitate more diversity and exploration, enabling the emergence of different models for moderating digital content and promoting a more pluralist public discourse.","Elkin-Koren, Niva, De Gregorio, Giovanni, Perel, Maayan","https://www.google.com/search?q=Social+Media+as+Contractual+Networks:+A+Bottom+Up+Check+on+Content+Moderation","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Iowa Law Review; 107(3):987-1049, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29673,""
"The relationship of the COVID-19 pandemic, physical activity and the mental health of NCAA collegiate baseball players","The COVID-19 pandemic could pose many issues expanding beyond the direct effects of those infected with the disease. One adverse effect of the pandemic could be on mental health. While there have been many studies attempting to identify possible effects on mental health, there is no current research identifying its presence. Physical activity is one potential variable that could influence mental health, as available research shows a strong relationship. NCAA collegiate baseball athletes are a population where these effects should be investigated, especially as the prevalence of mental health conditions continue to rise. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of the COVID-19 pandemic, level of physical activity, and the mental health of NCAA collegiate baseball players. A cross-sectional, survey-based design was created to achieve this purpose. Current mental health was evaluated in a questionnaire and change in physical activity across three time periods (current [March 2021-April 2021], September 2020-December 2020, April 2020-August 2020) were compared to a reference period of September 2019-December 2019. A total of 19 subjects participated in this study with 16 complete responses, resulting in an average age of 20.58 +/- 1.66 yrs. Subjects reported symptoms of mental health conditions/topics, with an increase in those currently experiencing anxiety (50%), depression (33%), sleep issues (61%), and energy level concerns (61%) compared to available research. Subjects level of physical activity remained mostly the same across all three time periods. Proportion of subjects reporting a mental health condition/topic did not show a statistically significant relationship with the proportion of subject participation in various levels of physical activity. Future research should continue investigating the relationship of mental health and physical activity in relation to the pandemic and the importance of establishing a baseline mental health survey.

"THE FIRST WAVE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND ITS IMPACT ON THE LEVEL OF DISTRESS IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER, A MULTICENTRIC STUDY","Background: Information on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), later termed coronavirus disease (COVID-19), first emerged by the end of 2019. As the pandemic spread, cancer patients were immediately recognized as a high-risk population with regard to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, epidemiological measures, like social distancing and lockdowns, additionally burdened patients with cancer. Even outside pandemic breast cancer patients are prone to psychological distress with prevalence ranging approximately 20-40%. This multicentric study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the level of distress among breast cancer patients in Croatia while the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Subjects and methods: Fife hundred forty-five breast cancer patients were offered to participate in the study. A total of two hundred and one patient, with disease stages ranging I-IV, completed the questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of disease and socio-demographic characteristics followed by the Distress Thermometer and a problem list. The cut off value of 4 was used to define the high level of distress within Distress Thermometer. Results: High distress level was reported in 54.2% of patients. The most significant problems reported by the participants of our study affected emotions, causing worry, sadness, depression, fear, and nervousness. Additionally, specific practical problems emerged (e.g., child care, housing, and work/school), most probably partly due to the lockdowns and social distancing. Interestingly enough, none of the socio-demographic or disease characteristics were linked to the level of distress. Conclusions: During first wave of COVID-19 pandemic more than half of breast cancer patients, undergoing active oncologic treatment, experienced a high level of distress. Therefore, distress driven by the COVID-19 pandemic should be promptly addressed and additional psychological and social support, targeting specific practical and emotional problems, should be provided for those patients. All the more so as global COVID-19 pandemic far exceeded the duration of the first wave.","Budisavljevic, A.; Kelemenic-Drazin, R.; Plavetic, N. D.; Fucak, I. K.; Silovski, T.; Dobric, V.

"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on surgeons and surgical residents' caseload, surgical skills, and mental health in Kuwait","The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in governments implementing new regulations to divert healthcare resources, which in return led to the postponement of elective and semi-elective surgical procedures. Henceforth, many surgeons and surgeons in training reported feeling redundant, which ultimately resulted in psychological distress. This study aims to assess the psychological impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and outline the effect it had on surgical training. The following study is a cross-sectional study conducted in Kuwait. Data was collected by distributing a questionnaire to surgeons and surgeons in training electronically. The survey included questions aimed at assessing both the effect of the pandemic on surgical training and the psychological impact it had on surgeons, assessing the latter using the DASS-21 screening tool. The response rate for the following study was 52%, with the majority being junior male surgeons. The majority of surgeons in training reported postponement of their scheduled academic teaching sessions and pre-assigned surgical rotations, 78.9% and 65.8% respectively. In terms of the psychological impact of the pandemic, the majority of the participants reported an element of depression and stress, 61.2% and 55%, respectively, while approximately half, 48.1%, had symptoms associated with anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on the psychological well-being of a significant proportion of surgeons and associated surgical training programs.","Alsafran, Albloushi, Quttaineh, Alfawaz, Alkhamis, Alkhayat, Alsejari, Alsabah","https://doi.org/10.1159/000524436","20220405","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29678,""
"The humoral response to SARS-COV-2 vaccines in MS patients: A case series exploring the impact of DMT, lymphocyte count, immunoglobulins, and vaccine type","Certain disease modifying therapies may negatively impact the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Many MS related clinical, demographic, and immunological characteristics can also affect vaccine response but those have not been fully explored. This study aimed to investigate potential correlations between clinical, demographic, and immunological variables in MS patients to post-vaccination spike protein antibody positivity rates and levels. Patients with MS and related neuroimmunological disorders who requested verification of the immune response to the SARS-COV-2 vaccine were tested for the spike protein antibody from January to October 2021. We performed an exploratory analysis to compare patients with positive versus negative spike protein antibody. Fifty patients (mean age 53 Ã‚Â±12, 78% females) were included. There were 29 patients with positive post-vaccination spike protein antibody (58%) and 21 with negative antibody (42%). Patients with negative antibody were more likely to have been on B-cell therapy (86% vs 31%, P=.001) while positive patients were more likely to have been on a fumarate (31% vs 4.8%, P=.03). Thirty percent of positive patients on fumarate therapy had mild lymphopenia. No differences existed between groups in gender, age, race, disease phenotype, vaccine brand, and lymphocyte counts. Among patients on B-cell therapy, 33% had a positive spike protein antibody. There was an association between detectable CD19 cells at time of vaccination and positive humoral response to vaccination (P=0.049). There was no relationship between subgroups in terms of vaccine timing relative to B-cell therapy dose. Hypogammaglobulinemia was not associated with seroconversion rates, however it was associated with decreased quantitative spike protein antibody levels (p=0.045). B-cell therapy is associated with a negative humoral response to SARS-COV-2 vaccines. Patients on B-cell depleting therapy with detectable CD19 counts at the time of vaccination were associated with a positive humoral response. There was no relationship between hypogammaglobinemia and seroconversion rate, however it was associated with decreased spike protein antibody levels. The fumarates are associated with positive humoral response even in the presence of mild lymphopenia.","Jakubecz, Zhang, Woodson, Serra, Abboud","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2022.103785","20220405","COVID19; DMT; Multiple sclerosis; SARS-CoV2; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29679,""
"Characterisation of the long-term physical and mental health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol","As of July 2021, there has been more than 185 million documented cases of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infections and more than 4 million deaths globally. Despite more than 90% of documented cases being classified as ""recovered"" from SARS-CoV-2 infection, a proportion of patients reported a wide variety of persisting symptoms after the initial onset or acute phase of the infection, often referred to as ""Long Covid"". As data on the symptomatology of post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection gradually becomes available, there is an urgent need to organise and synthesise the data in order to define what constitutes Long Covid and assist with its management in clinical and community settings. This protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search strategy will be developed in accordance with the Cochrane highly sensitive search guidelines. The following electronic databases will be searched for studies to include in the systematic review and meta-analysis: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science (Web of Knowledge), Science direct, EMBASE, Mednar, Psych INFO, and EBSCOhost. Dual screening will be applied at every screening stage. Two reviewers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full text of potentially eligible studies following the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria in order to select studies to include in the review. As heterogeneity is anticipated between the included studies, data will be pooled in a meta-analysis using a random effects model. A clustering analytic approach will be applied to identify symptoms groupings and assign the symptoms into clusters. R statistical software will be used for the meta-analysis. Highly heterogenous data will be synthesised narratively. The studies will be assessed, for quality using quality assessment tools appropriate for each study design. Two reviewers will independently undertake the quality of studies assessments.

Differences in preventive measures against the virus spread between countries may differentially affect the mental health of the populations. Here we aimed to characterize distinct psychological-distress and related-symptoms trajectories associated with the pandemic and explore risk/protective factors. In this longitudinal study, data from 832 Argentineans were collected every 3-5Ã‚Â months, between April 2020-August 2021. Mean psychological-distress levels and related-symptoms tended to increase over time. However, latent-class analysis identified four distinct psychological-distress trajectories. Most individuals had consistently good mental health (Resilient). Two classes showed psychological-distress worsening during the initial phase of the pandemic and recovered at different time points (Fast Recovery; Slow Recovery). The remaining class maintained a mild -level of psychological-distress and began to deteriorate in March 2021 (Deteriorating) continuously. Individuals who are younger, female, have pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses, or have high neuroticism or lower resilience were more likely to experiencing fluctuations in psychological-distress. The mental health trajectory during the pandemic had a complex dynamic. Although most participants remained resilient, a vulnerable group was detected, which deteriorated over time and should be considered by health-services.","FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Crivelli, Guimet, Allegri, Picco, Pedreira","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-09663-2","20220405","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29685,""
"Housing environment and mental health of Europeans during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-country comparison","Many studies have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. Throughout the pandemic, time spent at home increased to a great extent due to restrictive measures. Here we set out to investigate the relationship between housing conditions and the mental health of populations across European countries. We analyzed survey data collected during spring 2020 from 69,136 individuals from four cohorts from Denmark, France, and the UK. The investigated housing conditions included household density, composition, and crowding, access to outdoor facilities, dwelling type, and urbanicity. The outcomes were loneliness, anxiety, and life satisfaction. Logistic regression models were used, and results were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis, living alone was associated with higher levels of loneliness (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.08, 95% CI 1.87-5.07), and lower life satisfaction (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.27, 95% CI 1.05-0.55), compared to living with others. Not having access to an outdoor space and household crowding were suggestively associated with worse outcomes. Living in crowded households, living alone, or lacking access to outdoor facilities may be particularly importantÃ‚Â inÃ‚Â contributing to poorÃ‚Â mental health during a lockdown.

"Olfactory Loss and Beyond: A Practical Review of Chemosensory Dysfunction","Our ability to smell and taste is dictated by 3 chemosensory systems with distinct physiologic mechanisms - olfaction, gustation, and chemesthesis. Although often overlooked, dysfunction of these special senses may have broad implications on multiple facets of patients' lives -including safety, nutritional status, quality of life, mental health, and even cognitive function. As ""loss of smell or taste"" emerged as a common symptom of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the importance of intact chemosensory function has been thrust into the spotlight. Despite the growing recognition of chemosensory dysfunction, this already highly prevalent condition will increasingly impact a larger and more diverse population, highlighting the need for improved awareness and care of these patients. Comtemporary review of chemosensory function and assessments. Although patient-reported chemosensory function measures highlight the ease of screening of chemosensory dysfunction, self-reported measures underestimate both the prevalence and degree of chemosensory dysfunction and do not adequately distinguish between olfaction, gustation, and chemesthesis. Meanwhile, psychophysical assessment tools provide opportunities for more accurate, thorough assessment of the chemosenses when appropriate. Primary care providers are uniquely situated to identify patients burdened by chemosensory dysfunction and raise patient and provider awareness about the importance of chemosensory dysfunction. Identification of chemosensory dysfunction, particularly olfactory dysfunction, may raise suspicion for many underlying medical conditions, including early detection of neurodegenerative conditions. Furthermore, identification and awareness of patients with chemosensory dysfunction may help primary care providers to identify those who may benefit from additional therapeutic and safety interventions, or consultations with specialists for more detailed evaluations and management.","Claus, Leland, Tai, Schlosser, Kamath, Lane, Rowan","https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2022.02.210373","20220405","Aging; Anosmia; Dementia; Geriatrics; Olfaction Disorders; Otolaryngology; Preventive Care; Quality of Life; Smell; Taste","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29687,""
"Hospital-Based Healthcare Worker Perceptions of Personal Risk Related to COVID-19: One Year Follow-Up","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted health care workers (HCW). Most research focused on the adverse mental health effects during the initial surge of cases; and yet little is known about approximately how workers are faring 1 year into the pandemic. The objective of this study is to examine stress, burnout, and risk perception in an academic medical system, 1 year after the start of the pandemic. HCW across care specialties participated in online surveys in Spring 2020 and Spring 2021. The surveys included questions related to workplace stress and risk perception related to COVID-19. Correlates of stress and burnout were explored using multivariable linear regression models. Professional Quality of Life Scale (PROQOL) questions were added to the second survey. While HCW reported significantly fewer concerns about the risk of COVID-19 transmission to themselves and their families during the 2021 survey (compared with 2020), the percentage of workers who reported feeling excess stress at work or considered resigning stayed the same. One year into the pandemic, 57% of study participants met criteria for moderate or high levels of traumatic stress and 75% met criteria for moderate or high levels of burnout. As compared with participants who cared for no COVID-19 deaths, participants who cared for COVID-19 patients who died had significantly higher traumatic stress (1 to 10: Coef. = 2.7, <i>P</i> = <i>.007</i>; &gt;10: Coef. = 6.7, <i>P</i> &lt; <i>.001</i>) and burnout scores (1 to 10: Coef. = 2.7, <i>P</i> = <i>.004</i>; &gt;10: Coef. = 2.6, <i>P</i> = <i>.036</i>). While Although perceptions of risk declined over the course of the year, levels of stress still remained high despite high vaccination rates. Those who witnessed more COVID-19 deaths were more likely to report increased burnout and post-traumatic stress. As our nation continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic and new variants emerge it is imperative to focus on recovery strategies for high burnout groups to ensure the wellbeing of our health care workforce.","Yamane, Zarabian, Devine, Benjenk, Farrar, Park, Kim, Davison, Heinz","https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2022.02.210272","20220405","COVID-19; Caregivers; Critical Care; Emergency Medicine; Health Personnel; Linear Models; Mental Health; Nurses; Pandemics; Perception; Quality of Life; Workplace","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29688,""
"Economic change and population health: lessons learnt from an umbrella review on the Great Recession","Worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered the sharpest economic downturn since the Great Recession. To prepare for future crises and to preserve public health, we conduct an overview of systematic reviews to examine the evidence on the effect of the Great Recession on population health. We searched PubMed and Scopus for systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses focusing specifically on the impact of the Great Recession on population health (eg, mental health). Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed throughout this review and critical appraisal of included systematic reviews was performed using Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews. Twenty-one studies were identified and consistently showed that the Great Recession was most risky to health, the more a country's economy was affected and the longer strict austerity policies were in place. Consequently, a deterioration of health was highest in countries that had implemented strict austerity measures (eg, Greece), but not in countries that rejected austerity measures (eg, Germany). Moreover, the impact of the Great Recession fell disproportionately on the most vulnerable groups such as people in unemployment, at risk of unemployment and those living in poverty. The experiences of the last economic crisis show that it is possible to limit the consequences for health. Prioritising mental healthcare and prevention, foregoing austerity measures in the healthcare system and protecting vulnerable groups are the most important lessons learnt. Moreover, given the further aggravating social inequalities, a health in all policies approach, based on a comprehensive Health Impact Assessment, is advised.","Backhaus, Hoven, Di Tecco, Iavicoli, Conte, Dragano","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-060710","20220405","COVID-19; health policy; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29689,""

"Gatekeeper training for vendors to reduce pesticide self-poisoning in rural South Asia: a study protocol for a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial","Pesticide self-poisoning kills an estimated 110Ã¢â‚¬â€°000-168Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 people worldwide annually. Data from South Asia indicate that in 15%-20% of attempted suicides and 30%-50% of completed suicides involving pesticides these are purchased shortly beforehand for this purpose. Individuals who are intoxicated with alcohol and/or non-farmers represent 72% of such customers. We have developed a 'gatekeeper' training programme for vendors to enable them to identify individuals at high risk of self-poisoning (gatekeeper function) and prevent such individuals from accessing pesticides (means restriction). The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the gatekeeper intervention in preventing pesticide self-poisoning in Sri Lanka. Other aims are to identify method substitution and to assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. A stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial of a gatekeeper intervention is being conducted in rural Sri Lanka with a population of approximately 2.7 million. The gatekeeper intervention is being introduced into 70 administrative divisions in random order at each of 30 steps over a 40-month period. The primary outcome is the number of pesticide self-poisoning cases identified from surveillance of hospitals and police stations. Secondary outcomes include: number of self-poisoning cases using pesticides purchased within the previous 24 hours, total number of all forms of self-harm and suicides. Intervention effectiveness will be estimated by comparing outcome measures between the pretraining and post-training periods across the divisions in the study area. The original study protocol has been adapted as necessary in light of the impact of the COVID-19.

"Working from home in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional results from the Employees Working From Home (EWFH) study","To investigate the impacts, on mental and physical health, of a mandatory shift to working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross sectional, online survey. Online survey was conducted from September 2020 to November 2020 in the general population. Australian residents working from home for at least 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°days a week at some time in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographics, caring responsibilities, working from home arrangements, work-related technology, work-family interface, psychosocial and physical working conditions, and reported stress and musculoskeletal pain. 924 Australians responded to the online questionnaire. Respondents were mostly women (75.5%) based in Victoria (83.7%) and employed in the education and training and healthcare sectors. Approximately 70% of respondents worked five or more days from home, with only 60% having a dedicated workstation in an uninterrupted space. Over 70% of all respondents reported experiencing musculoskeletal pain or discomfort. Gendered differences were observed; men reported higher levels of family to work conflict (3.16Ã‚Â±1.52Ã¢â‚¬â€°to 2.94Ã‚Â±1.59, p=0.031), and lower levels of recognition for their work (3.75Ã‚Â±1.03Ã¢â‚¬â€°to 3.96Ã‚Â±1.06, p=0.004), compared with women. For women, stress (2.94Ã‚Â±0.92Ã¢â‚¬â€°to 2.66Ã‚Â±0.88, p&lt;0.001) and neck/shoulder pain (4.50Ã‚Â±2.90Ã¢â‚¬â€°to 3.51Ã‚Â±2.84, p&lt;0.001) were higher than men and they also reported more concerns about their job security than men (3.01Ã‚Â±1.33Ã¢â‚¬â€°to 2.78Ã‚Â±1.40, p=0.043). Preliminary evidence from the current study suggests that working from home may impact employees' physical and mental health, and that this impact is likely to be gendered. Although further analysis is required, these data provide insights into further research opportunities needed to assist employers in optimising working from home conditions and reduce the potential negative physical and mental health impacts on their employees.","Oakman, Kinsman, Lambert, Stuckey, Graham, Weale","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052733","20220405","COVID-19; mental health; risk management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29692,""
"For a structured response to the psychosocial consequences of the restrictive measures imposed by the global COVID-19 health pandemic: the MAVIPAN longitudinal prospective cohort study protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictive measures have caused important disruptions in economies and labour markets, changed the way we work and socialise, forced schools to close and healthcare and social services to reorganise. This unprecedented crisis forces individuals to make considerable efforts to adapt and will have psychological and social consequences, mainly on vulnerable individuals, that will remain once the pandemic is contained and will most likely exacerbate existing social and gender health inequalities. This crisis also puts a toll on the capacity of our healthcare and social services structures to provide timely and adequate care. The MAVIPAN (Ma vie et la pandÃƒÂ©mie/ My Life and the Pandemic) study aims to document how individuals, families, healthcare workers and health organisations are affected by the pandemic and how they adapt. MAVIPAN is a 5-year longitudinal prospective cohort study launched in April 2020 across the province of Quebec (Canada). Quantitative data will be collected through online questionnaires (4-6 times/year) according to the evolution of the pandemic. Qualitative data will be collected with individual and group interviews and will seek to deepen our understanding of coping strategies. Analysis will be conducted under a mixed-method umbrella, with both sequential and simultaneous analyses of quantitative and qualitative data. MAVIPAN aims to support the healthcare and social services system response by providing high-quality, real-time information needed to identify those who are most affected by the pandemic and by guiding public health authorities' decision making regarding intervention and resource allocation to mitigate these impacts. MAVIPAN was approved by the Ethics Committees of the Primary Care and Population Health Research Sector of CIUSSS de la Capitale-Nationale (Committee of record) and of the additional participating institutions.

"Perceptions and Experiences of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Since March 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 pandemic has affected the global community, but poses unique challenges for individuals with cancer. Patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies undergo aggressive therapies followed by hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as a potential curative treatment. HCT recipients can be immunocompromised for extended periods of time, and even pre-pandemic, transplant patients reported depression and anxiety due to restrictions and infection prevention measures they had to adhere to as part of transplant precautions. This study aimed to understand psychological distress and capture perspectives on coping strategies and access to healthcare in the HCT population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adult patients who received a transplant or were awaiting transplant and had a scheduled appointment at the transplant clinic were eligible to participate in this cross-sectional study. Participants completed an online survey that included questionnaires, clinical data and demographic information. Fifty-four participants completed the survey. HCT participants reported relatively high psychological distress during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, but indicated use of healthy coping mechanisms to deal with stress. Study data informs healthcare providers that psychological distress and mental health warrants increased attention during periods of heightened stress. Education and resources on healthy, beneficial coping strategies should be provided to support HCT patients. Nurses and advanced nurse practitioners are well poised to interact with HCT patients and provide necessary support or appropriate referral during routine clinical interactions, preparing patients for prolonged effects of the pandemic and similar future events.","Mohanraj, Elswick, Buch, Knight, Guidry","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soncn.2022.151257","20220405","COVID-19; coping; distress; hematopoietic cell transplantation; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29694,""
"Impacts of the psychological stress response on nonsuicidal self-injury behavior in students during the COVID-19 epidemic in China: the mediating role of sleep disorders","The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 had a great impact on the physical and mental health of people all over the world, especially for students whose physical and mental development was not yet mature. In order to understand the physical and mental conditions of students during the epidemic period and provide a theoretical basis for coping with psychological problems in public health emergencies, this study explored the mediating role of sleep disorders in the effect of the psychological stress response (PSR) on non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), along with the moderating role of emotional management ability (EMA). The SRQ-20, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, NSSI Behavior Questionnaire, and Emotional Management Questionnaire were used to investigate the mental health of Chinese students in April 10-20 (Time point 1, T1) and May 20-30 (Time point 2, T2), 2020. A total of 1,955 students (MageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°19.64Ã‚Â years, 51.4% male) were examined at T1 and 342 students (MageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20.06Ã‚Â years, 48.2% male) were reassessed at T2. Overall, the detection rate of PSR and NSSI were 17.60% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°344) and 24.90% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°486) respectively in the T1 sample, and were 16.37% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°56) and 25.44% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°87), in the T2 sample. We also found that sleep disorders played a mediating role in the effect of PSR on NSSI in the T1 and T2 samples. In addition, EMA was shown to regulate the effect of PSR on sleep disorders and the effect of sleep disorders on NSSI in the T1 samples. We found that PSR resulting from public health emergency might lead to NSSI behaviors in individuals. PSR may also cause sleep disorders, which can bring about NSSI. However, these effects were also moderated by the EMA. This research expands our understanding of PSR and NSSI in students during the pandemic.","Xiao, Wang, Hu, He, Ruan, Chen, Peng","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00789-6","20220405","COVID-19; Emotional management ability; Nonsuicidal self-injury behavior; Psychological stress response; Sleep disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29695,""
"A comparison of stress, symptoms, physical activity, and adiposity among women at midlife before and during the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic presented challenges that disproportionately impacted women. Household roles typically performed by women (such as resource acquisition and caretaking) became more difficult due to financial strain, fear of infection, and limited childcare options among other concerns. This research draws from an on-going study of hot flashes and brown adipose tissue to examine the health-related effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among 162 women aged 45-55 living in western Massachusetts. We compared women who participated in the study pre- and early pandemic with women who participated mid-pandemic and later-pandemic (when vaccines became widely available). We collected self-reported symptom frequencies (e.g., aches/stiffness in joints, irritability), and assessments of stress, depression, and physical activity through questionnaires as well as measures of adiposity (BMI and percent body fat). Additionally, we asked open-ended questions about how the pandemic influenced women's health and experience of menopause. Comparisons across pre-/early, mid-, and later pandemic categories were carried out using ANOVA and Chi-square analyses as appropriate. The Levene test for homogeneity of variances was examined prior to each ANOVA. Open-ended questions were analyzed for yes/no responses and general themes. Contrary to our hypothesis that women would suffer negative health-related consequences during the COVID-19 pandemic, we found no significant differences in women's health-related measures or physical activity across the pandemic. However, our analysis of open-ended responses revealed a bi-modal distribution of answers that sheds light on our unexpected findings. While some women reported higher levels of stress and anxiety and lower levels of physical activity, other women reported benefitting from the remote life that the pandemic imposed and described having more time to spend on physical activity or in quality time with their families. In this cross-sectional comparison of women during the pre-/early, mid-, and later-pandemic, we found no significant differences across means in multiple health-related variables. However, open-ended questions revealed that while some women suffered health-related effects during the pandemic, others experienced conditions that improved their health and well-being. The differential results of this study highlight a need for more nuanced and intersectional research on risk, vulnerabilities, and coping among mid-life women.","Sievert, Shreyer, Boudreau, Witkowski, Brown","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40695-022-00075-w","20220405","COVID-19; Depression; Menopause; Midlife; Physical activity; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29696,""
"Development and validation of COVID-19 Impact Scale","As the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic is prolonged, psychological responses to the pandemic have changed, and a new scale to reflect these changes needs to be developed. In this study, we attempt to develop and validate the COVID-19 Impact Scale (CIS) to measure the psychological stress responses of the COVID-19 pandemic, including emotional responses and difficulty with activities of daily living. We recruited 2152 participants. Participants completed the CIS, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), and other mental health related measures. The factor structure, reliability, and validity of the CIS were analyzed. In addition, the validity of the scale was confirmed by its relationships to the existing measures assessing fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, subjective well-being, and suicidal ideation. Using exploratory factor analysis (N<sub>1</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1076), we derived a one-factor structure. In confirmatory factor analysis (N<sub>2</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1076), the one-factor model showed good to excellent fitness. The CIS was positively correlated with depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, fear of COVID-19 and negatively correlated with subjective well-being. The FCV-19S did not show significant correlations with subjective well-being or suicidal ideation, and FCV-19S's explanatory powers on depression and anxiety were lower than those of the CIS. These results support that the CIS is a valid assessment of emotional problems and deterioration of the quality of life caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the limitations of this study and future research directions are discussed.","Min, Kim, Moon, Lee, Kim, Ko","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00793-w","20220405","COVID-19 pandemic; Factor analysis; Impact of COVID-19; Mental health; Scale development; Scale validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29697,""
"A randomised controlled trial investigating the clinical and cost-effectiveness of Alpha-Stim AID cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) in patients seeking treatment for moderate severity depression in primary care (Alpha-Stim-D Trial)","Major depression is the second leading cause of years lost to disability worldwide and is a leading contributor to suicide. However, first-line antidepressants are only fully effective for 33%, and only 40% of those offered psychological treatment attend for two sessions or more. Views gained from patients and primary care professionals are that greater treatment uptake might be achieved if people with depression could be offered alternative and more accessible treatment options. Although there is evidence that the Alpha-Stim Anxiety Insomnia and Depression (AID) device is safe and effective for anxiety and depression symptoms in people with anxiety disorders, there is much less evidence of efficacy in major depression without anxiety. This study investigates the effectiveness of the Alpha-Stim AID device, a cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) treatment that people can safely use independently at home. The device provides CES which has been shown to increase alpha oscillatory brain activity, associated with relaxation. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of Alpha-Stim AID in treatment-seeking patients (aged 16 years upwards) with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms in primary care. The study is a multi-centre parallel-group, double-blind, non-commercial, randomised controlled superiority trial. The primary objective of the study is to examine the clinical efficacy of active daily use of 8 weeks of Alpha-Stim AID versus sham Alpha-Stim AID on depression symptoms at 16 weeks (8 weeks after the end of treatment) in people with moderate severity depression. The primary outcome is the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at 16 weeks. All trial and treatment procedures are carried out remotely using videoconferencing, telephone and postal delivery considering the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. This study is investigating whether participants using the Alpha-Stim AID device display a reduction in depressive symptoms that can be maintained over 8 weeks post-treatment. The findings will help to determine whether Alpha-Stim AID should be recommended, including being made available in the NHS for patients with depressive symptoms. ISRTCN ISRCTN11853110 .

"Gender-based violence experiences among Palestinian women during the COVID-19 pandemic: mental health professionals' perceptions and concerns","In a geopolitically at-risk environment, such as Palestine, gender-based violence (GBV) is still a crucial problem rooted in discriminatory laws and traditional habits exacerbated by the ongoing Israeli military occupation. Moreover, the lack of updated data makes it difficult to grasp the magnitude of the phenomenon entirely; the purpose of the current study was to explore mental health professionals' perceptions and concerns on GBV among Palestinian women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in the study were 30 Mental Health Professionals (MHP) selected using convenience and snowball sampling techniques from among MHP in northern West Bank, Palestine. A thematic content analysis revealed seven main themes of GBV during the pandemic. Palestinian MHP reported that the increased number of GBV cases among women during the COVID-19, quarantine, physical distancing measures, and closure of non-essential services significantly heightened the risks of GBV among Palestinian women. Moreover, Palestinian women involved with or married to older men or married at a very young age were at risk of GBV more than others. Results of qualitative analysis also showed that Israeli occupation and the political violence characterizing the area for decades (including restriction of movement, house demolitions, separation of family members, etc.) have also exacerbated and increased GBV in the occupied Palestinian territories. Improving intervention skills and supervision services among Palestinian MHP to help women who face GBV is recommended. Moreover, additional research should be conducted to explore the risk and potential factors of GBV, agency, and coping strategies to deal with GBV.","Mahamid, Veronese, Bdier","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13031-022-00444-2","20220405","COVID-19 pandemic; Gender-based violence; Mental health professionals; Palestinian women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29699,""
"Impact of post-COVID conditions on mental health: a cross-sectional study in Japan and Sweden","Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, people have undermined their mental health. It has been reported that post-COVID conditions at a certain rate. However, information on the mental health of people with post-COVID conditions is limited. Thus, this study investigated the relationship between post-COVID conditions and mental health. Design of the present study was an International and collaborative cross-sectional study in Japan and Sweden from March 18 to June 15, 2021. The analyzed data included 763 adults who participated in online surveys in Japan and Sweden and submitted complete data. In addition to demographic data including terms related to COVID-19, psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress were measured by using the fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder-7 item (GAD-7), and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Of the 135 COVID-19 survivors among the 763 total participants, 37.0% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°50/135) had COVID-19-related sequelae. First, the results of the Bonferroni-corrected Mann Whitney U test showed that the group infected SARS-CoV-2 with post-COVID conditions scored significantly higher than those without one and the non-infected group on all clinical symptom scales (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). Next, there was a significant difference that incidence rates of clinical-significant psychiatric symptoms among each group from the results of the Chi-squared test (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Finally, the results of the multivariate logistic model revealed that the risk of having more severe clinical symptoms were 2.44-3.48 times higher among participants with post-COVID conditions. The results showed that approximately half had some physical symptoms after COVID-19 and that post-COVID conditions may lead to the onset of mental disorders. The ethics committee of Chiba University approved this cross-sectional study (approval number: 4129).

"Sex differences in the experience of COVID-19 post-traumatic stress symptoms by adults in South Africa","The COVID-19 pandemic has created multiple mental health challenges. Many residents in South Africa face pre-existing elevated levels of stress and the pandemic may have had varying impacts on sub-populations. The aims of this study were to determine: 1) the factors associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and 2) sex differences in the factors associated with PTSS in adults residing in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study participants aged 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and above, were recruited for this cross-sectional study through an online survey implemented from June 29, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The outcome variable was PTSS; explanatory variables were sex at birth, COVID-19 status, social isolation and access to emotional support. Confounders considered were age, education level completed and current work status. Logistic regressions were used to determine the association between the outcome and explanatory variables after adjusting for confounders. There were 489 respondents. Among all respondents, those who were older (AOR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95 - 0.99) and had access to emotional support from family and relatives (AOR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.14 - 0.53) had significantly lower odds of PTSS. Respondents who felt socially isolated had higher odds of PTSS (AOR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.08 - 1.27). Females had higher PTSS scores and higher odds of PTSS compared to males (AOR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.41-3.39). Females (AOR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.08 - 0.95) and males (AOR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.59) who had access to emotional support had significantly lower odds of PTSS than those who had no support. Females (AOR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.04 -1.27) and males (AOR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.59) who felt socially isolated had higher odds of PTSS compared to those who did not feel socially isolated. Compared to males, females had higher scores and higher odds of reporting PTSS during the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to emotional support ameliorated the odds of having PTSS for both sexes, while feeling socially isolated worsened the odds for both sexes.","Nzimande, El Tantawi, ZuÃƒÂ±iga, Opoku-Sarkodie, Brown, Ezechi, Uzochukwu, Ellakany, Aly, Nguyen, Folayan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-03883-6","20220405","COVID-19; Post-traumatic stress symptoms; Sex; South Africa","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29701,""
"Political Trust, Mental Health, and the Coronavirus Pandemic: A Cross-National Study","We investigate whether older adults who place greater trust in their political leadership fare better in terms of mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also test if and how the trust-wellbeing relationship varies across individual- and country-level moderators. Based on cross-national data consisting of over 13,000 older adults in 66 countries, we estimate a series of multilevel models. <i>Within</i> countries, political trust is significantly negatively associated with depressive symptoms. And this association is stronger for those who are subjectively less healthy. <i>Between</i> countries, the trust-depression link at the individual level is stronger in more ""fragile"" states. These findings are robust to a host of confounders including the experienced level of anxiety stemming from COVID-19.

"Growing couch potatoes? The impact of COVID-19 in the light of personal values in Hungary","The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has unprecedentedly affected consumer behaviour. This paper reflects on changes in food consumption, buying, and training (working out) habits using a representative sample of 1000 Hungarian consumers and identifies consumer segments with unique needs based on personal sources of motivation. The widely known Schwartz Portrait Value Questionnaire was used to characterize individual value profiles. Employing k-medians clustering, three clusters were identified. ""Business-as-usual People"" managed to maintain their daily routines. The frequency of buying local food decreased the least among them. The sedentary lifestyle of the next cluster, ""Inactive savers"", appears to have been accompanied by a lower level of food intake. Accordingly, this group was possibly less subject to the negative impacts of obesity, but more in need of psychological support to avoid devastating mental health outcomes. The third cluster initially appeared to encompass ""Couch Potatoes"" based on their COVID-induced lifestyles. However, the analysis of the value portraits of the latter showed that they were not couch potatoes at all, but rather active and proactive ""Stay-at-home Businesspeople"" who may benefit from guidance regarding how to manage the increase in housekeeping and childcare, and how to become more physically active in the home environment. The results are valuable from both a scientific and practical perspectives.","Szente, FertÃ…â€˜, Benedek","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40100-022-00217-8","20220405","Consumer segment; Coronavirus; Hungary; Local food; Lockdown; Portrait values questionnaire","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29703,""

The method used is based on the collection of tweets under the hashtag #COVIDVaccine while the nltk toolkit parses the texts, and the tf-idf algorithm generates the keywords. Both n-gram keywords and hashtags mentioned in the tweets are collected and counted. The results indicate that the sentiments are divided into positive and negative emotions, with the negative ones dominating.","Sarirete","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-022-03805-0","20220405","COVID-19 vaccine; Sentiment analysis; Tweets; n-gram; nltk toolkit; tf-idf algorithm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29704,""
"Anxiety and Coping Strategies during the Covid-19 Pandemic among Students at a Multi- Campus University in Uganda","Background Uganda has had the longest COVID-19-induced closures of schools world over of over 20 months, according to a recent UNICEF report, which has greatly affected learning and mental health of University students. This study assessed levels of anxiety, challenges and coping strategies of students at a university in Uganda during the COVID-19 pandemic lock down. Methods We conducted an online, descriptive, cross-sectional study between 26th June and 26th July 2021 using mixed quantitative and qualitative methods among students of Busitema University in Eastern Uganda. The survey assessed anxiety levels of students using General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale, and its associations using the Chi-Square or Fischer's exact test and multivariate logistic regression. We also explored the challenges and coping strategies employed by students through in-depth interviews. Results A total of 338 students participated, 213 (63%) were male with median age of 23 years (21-25), majority from Faculty of health sciences (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°153, 45%). Overall, 179 (53%) of the students had anxiety which was mostly mild anxiety (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°127, 38%). Students concerned about inadequate internet facilities to support online learning were twice more likely to have anxiety (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.7; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.021). Among those with anxiety, avoidance coping strategies had higher scores with a median of 8 (3-12) compared to other strategies (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). In-depth interviews revealed challenges with online learning, academic progress, and changes to daily routine and fear of contracting COVID-19 and getting vaccinated. Conclusion The largest number of students had anxiety especially those from faculty of health sciences and engineering of which most used avoidance strategies to cope up with the anxiety. This highlights areas where the university authorities should gear effort to design appropriate strategies to maintain mental health of students even after the pandemic.","Ojilong, Kanyike, Nakawuki, Lutwama, Nakanwagi, Nekaka","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1446865/v1","20220405","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29705,""
"Training for mental health professionals in responding to experienced and anticipated mental health related discrimination (READ-MH): protocol for an international multisite feasibility study","<b>Background:</b> Mental health and other health professionals working in mental health care may contribute to the experiences of stigma and discrimination among mental health service users, but can also help reduce the impact of stigma on service users. However the few studies of interventions to equip such professionals to be anti-stigma agents those took place in High-Income Countries. This study assesses the feasibility, potential effectiveness and costs of Responding to Experienced and Anticipated Discrimination training for health professionals working in mental health care (READ-MH) across Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). <b>Methods:</b> This is an uncontrolled pre-post mixed methods feasibility study of READ-MH training at seven sites across five LMICs (China, Ethiopia, India, Nepal, and Tunisia). Outcome measures: knowledge based on course content; attitudes to working to address the impact of stigma on service users; and skills in responding constructively to service users' reports of discrimination. The training draws upon the evidence bases for stigma reduction, health advocacy and medical education and is tailored to sites through situational analyses. Its content, delivery methods and intensity were agreed through a consensus exercise with site research teams. READ-MH will be delivered to health professionals working in mental health care immediately after baseline data collection; outcome measures will be collected post-training and three months post-baseline, followed by qualitative data collection. Fidelity will be rated during delivery of READ-MH, and data on training costs will be collected. Quantitative data will be assessed using generalised linear mixed models. Qualitative data will be evaluated by thematic analysis to identify feedback about the training methods and content, including the implementability of the knowledge and skills learned. Pooled and site-specific training costs per trainee and per session will be reported. <b>Ã¯Â»Â¿Conclusions:</b> The training development used a participatory and contextualized approach. Evaluation design strengths include the diversity of settings; the use of mixed methods; the use of a skills-based measure; and knowledge and attitude measures aligned to the target population and training. Limitations are the uncertain generalisability of skills performance to routine care, and the impact of COVID-19 restrictions at several sites limiting qualitative data collection for situational analyses.","Henderson, Ouali, Bakolis, Berbeche, Bhattarai, Brohan, Cherian, Girma, Gronholm, Gurung, Hanlon, Kallakuri, Kaur, Ketema, Lempp, Li, Loganathan, Maulik, Mendon, Mulatu, Ma, Romeo, Venkatesh, Zgueb, Zhang, Thornicroft","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1466318/v1","20220405","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29706,""
"A review of the global climate change impacts, adaptation, and sustainable mitigation measures","Climate change is a long-lasting change in the weather arrays across tropics to polls. It is a global threat that has embarked on to put stress on various sectors. This study is aimed to conceptually engineer how climate variability is deteriorating the sustainability of diverse sectors worldwide. Specifically, the agricultural sector's vulnerability is a globally concerning scenario, as sufficient production and food supplies are threatened due to irreversible weather fluctuations. In turn, it is challenging the global feeding patterns, particularly in countries with agriculture as an integral part of their economy and total productivity. Climate change has also put the integrity and survival of many species at stake due to shifts in optimum temperature ranges, thereby accelerating biodiversity loss by progressively changing the ecosystem structures. Climate variations increase the likelihood of particular food and waterborne and vector-borne diseases, and a recent example is a coronavirus pandemic. Climate change also accelerates the enigma of antimicrobial resistance, another threat to human health due to the increasing incidence of resistant pathogenic infections. Besides, the global tourism industry is devastated as climate change impacts unfavorable tourism spots. The methodology investigates hypothetical scenarios of climate variability and attempts to describe the quality of evidence to facilitate readers' careful, critical engagement. Secondary data is used to identify sustainability issues such as environmental, social, and economic viability. To better understand the problem, gathered the information in this report from various media outlets, research agencies, policy papers, newspapers, and other sources. This review is a sectorial assessment of climate change mitigation and adaptation approaches worldwide in the aforementioned sectors and the associated economic costs. According to the findings, government involvement is necessary for the country's long-term development through strict accountability of resources and regulations implemented in the past to generate cutting-edge climate policy. Therefore, mitigating the impacts of climate change must be of the utmost importance, and hence, this global threat requires global commitment to address its dreadful implications to ensure global sustenance.","Abbass, Qasim, Song, Murshed, Mahmood, Younis","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19718-6","20220405","Antimicrobial resistance; Biodiversity; COVID-19; Climate change; Mitigation measures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29707,""
"Exploring Female University Students' Participation in Physical Activity in Saudi Arabia: A Mixed-Methods Study","The importance of physical activity in improving physical and mental health has been emphasized in many studies. Researchers in Saudi Arabia have reported an increase in physical inactivity among Saudis, especially among University female population. Current efforts in the field in Saudi Arabia have yet to explore barriers and facilitators that influence female University student's participation in physical activity. This study aims to provide an assessment of the situation regarding physical activity among female University students in Saudi Arabia. This mixed method study preceded a participatory action research initiative. The first part of the mixed method consisted of a cross-sectional survey of 375 female University students in Saudi Arabia who completed the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. The second part consisted of semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 14 female University students and 16 female exercise trainers. Results showed that most participants (91%) spent more time in walking activity compared to moderate (66%) and vigorous activity (57%) for at least 10 min at a time over a period of 7 days. Results showed that 70% of participants did not meet the WHO recommendation of 150 min per week of moderate activity, while around 62% of participants did not meet the WHO recommendation of 75 min per week of vigorous activity. Barriers to participation included limited facilities for physical activities, academic workload, gender role, and the need to adhere to cultural standards. Facilitators included valuing positive results, general health concerns, and family support. Knowledge gained from this study might support organizations and public health authorities to develop physical activity interventions that better address Saudi women's perceived needs. These findings are an important contribution to current knowledge in light of recent advances in women's rights in Saudi Arabia.","Aljehani, Razee, Ritchie, Valenzuela, Bunde-Birouste, Alkhaldi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.829296","20220405","Saudi Arabia; cultural norms in Saudi Arabia; physical activity barriers and motivators; socioecological framework; women's physical activity; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Humans; Saudi Arabia; Students; Universities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29708,""
"Health Literacy and Health Outcomes in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients: An Explorative Study","This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between health literacy (HL) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) severity. Pulmonary function test, sociodemographic features, Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, COPD assessment test (CAT), and the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire were used. The study examined 13,760 patients who underwent a pulmonary function test. Out of 13,760 patients, 673 patients had FEV1/FVC values less than 70%. Those with FEV1/FVC&lt; 0.70 (<i>n</i> = 336) after the reversibility test were included in the study. There was a significant decrease in HL and an increase in COPD severity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the risk of severe COPD was 2.74 times higher in patients in the poor income level than in patients in the good income level. In patients with inadequate HL, the risk of developing severe COPD was 1.80 times higher. A significant difference was found in HL index scores among the groups in terms of education level and income level (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, respectively). The most difficult topics for patients with COPD were periodic health examinations, good practices in mental health, and adult vaccinations. Patients with COPD were found to be at a HL level well below the expected level. The risk of severe COPD increased with poor income and inadequate HL. Healthcare providers should be careful in accessing, understanding, and interpreting the health information of patients with inadequate HL. Therefore, patient education should be prioritized in the follow-up and in the treatment of patients with COPD. Physicians should pay maximum attention to patients with COPD in the regular use of drugs, their proper use, in taking preventive measures, and in adult vaccination.","Azkan Ture, Bhattacharya, Demirci, Yildiz","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.846768","20220405","COPD; GOLD classification; HLS-EU-Q; disease severity; health literacy; COVID-19; Health Literacy; Humans; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29709,""
"Centering the Strengths of American Indian Culture, Families and Communities to Overcome Type 2 Diabetes","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a critical Indigenous health inequity rooted in experiences of colonization and marginalization including disproportionate exposure to stressors, disruption of traditional family and food systems, and attacks on cultural practices that have led to more sedentary lifestyles. Thus, an important step in redressing inequities is building awareness of and interventions attuned to unique Indigenous contexts influencing T2D and Indigenous culture as a pathway to community wellbeing. Using a dynamic, stage-based model of intervention development and evaluation, we detail the creation and evolution of a family-based, culturally centered T2D preventive intervention: Together on Diabetes (later Together Overcoming Diabetes) (TOD). The TOD program was built by and for Indigenous communities via community-based participatory research and has been implemented across diverse cultural contexts. The TOD curriculum approaches health through a holistic lens of spiritual, mental, physical and emotional wellness. Preliminary evidence suggests TOD is effective in reducing diabetes risk factors including lowering BMI and depressive symptoms, and the program is viewed favorably by participants and community members. We discuss lessons learned regarding collaborative intervention development and adaptation across Indigenous cultures, as well as future directions for TOD.","Walls, Chambers, Begay, Masten, Aulandez, Richards, Gonzalez, Forsberg, Nelson, Larzelere, McDougall, Lhotka, Grass, Kellar, Reid, Barlow","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.788285","20220405","American Indian/Alaska Native; CBPR; Native American; diabetes; interventionÃ¢â‚¬â€œbehavioral; prevention; American Indians or Alaska Natives; COVID-19; Community-Based Participatory Research; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Risk Factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-06","",29710,""
