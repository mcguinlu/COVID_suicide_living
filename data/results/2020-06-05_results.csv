"Rapid Systematic Review: The Impact of Social Isolation and Loneliness on the Mental Health of Children and Adolescents in the Context of COVID-19","Objective Disease containment of COVID-19 has necessitated widespread social isolation  We aimed to establish what is known about how loneliness and disease containment measures impact on the mental health in children and adolescents  Method For this rapid review, we searched MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, and Web of Science for articles published between 01/01/1946 and 03/29/2020  20% of articles were double screened using pre-defined criteria and 20% of data was double extracted for quality assurance  Results 83 articles (80 studies) met inclusion criteria  Of these, 63 studies reported on the impact of social isolation and loneliness on the mental health of previously healthy children and adolescents (n=51,576;mean age 15 3) 61 studies were observational;18 were longitudinal and 43 cross sectional studies assessing self-reported loneliness in healthy children and adolescents  One of these studies was a retrospective investigation after a pandemic  Two studies evaluated interventions  Studies had a high risk of bias although longitudinal studies were of better methodological quality  Social isolation and loneliness increased the risk of depression, and possibly anxiety at the time loneliness was measured and between 0 25 to 9 years later  Duration of loneliness was more strongly correlated with mental health symptoms than intensity of loneliness  Conclusion Children and adolescents are probably more likely to experience high rates of depression and probably anxiety during and after enforced isolation ends  This may increase as enforced isolation continues  Clinical services should offer preventative support and early intervention where possible and be prepared for an increase in mental health problems","Loades, Maria Elizabeth; Chatburn, Eleanor; Higson-Sweeney, Nina; Reynolds, Shirley; Shafran, Roz; Brigden, Amberly; Linney, Catherine; McManus, Megan Niamh; Borwick, Catherine; Crawley, Esther","https://www.google.com/search?q=Rapid+Systematic+Review:+The+Impact+of+Social+Isolation+and+Loneliness+on+the+Mental+Health+of+Children+and+Adolescents+in+the+Context+of+COVID-19","","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-05","",1661,""
"How to deal with COVID-19 epidemic-related lockdown physical inactivity and sedentary increase in youth? Adaptation of Ansesâ€™ benchmarks","Faced with the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, regulatory measures aiming to prevent interpersonal contaminations have been undertaken and among these, lockdown  Due to strong restrictions out-of-home movements, we hypothesize that overall physical activity will decrease and sedentary behavior increase  This could result in highest exposure to the well-known risk related to insufficient physical activity  To mitigate physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors health-related risks related to children and adolescents lockdown and school closure, Anses (French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health &amp; Safety) has adapted, within the first days of the public authoritiesâ€™ prescription, its former benchmarks  This paper supports and comments Ansesâ€™ Opinion by raising the questions of whether, why, and how to deal with short- or medium-term lockdown-related physical inactivity and sedentary behavior increases  Short-term and unknown long term-impacts on mental health and well-being, physical fitness and eating behaviors clearly appearing for children and adolescents as being the main issues of concern are highlighted  Targeting the compensations of the physical inactivity increase, the types, frequencies and durations of physical activity, are adapted to restricted environment  Sedentary behavior limitation and frequent interruptions becomes a priority  Overall, considering children and adolescents, the emerging risk justifies proposing specific adaptations and type of activities in order to ensure maintaining health underpinned, at least partly, by physiological equilibrium and physical fitness and avoid the installation of new unhealthy habits or routines that young people could keep after lockdown","Margaritis, IrÃ¨ne; Houdart, Sabine; El Ouadrhiri, Youssef; Bigard, Xavier; Vuillemin, Anne; DuchÃ©, Pascale","https://www.google.com/search?q=How+to+deal+with+COVID-19+epidemic-related+lockdown+physical+inactivity+and+sedentary+increase+in+youth?+Adaptation+of+Ansesâ€™+benchmarks","","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-05","",1662,""

"Challenges faced by mental health providers and patients during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic due to technological barriers","Background The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been responsible for the devastation of hundreds of thousands of lives directly and has caused disruptions globally  Vulnerable populations, specifically those suffering from serious mental illness and homelessness, are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 infection resulting in medical complications and psychiatric destabilization  In addition, mental health has become increasingly relevant throughout the country given the psychological distress people have been facing due to the spread of COVID-19 and the toll of a more restricted way of living  Although the healthcare industry has quickly integrated novel ways of treating patients with mental illness with technological advances, these technologies are not applicable to different populations equally  There is a clear disparity that is represented within the public county health systems, which leads to a widening gap between those who receive adequate treatment for mental illness and those who do not  Aims The aims of this paper were to provide a commentary on the benefits of technology-based psychiatric and psychological interventions based off experience in a public health system and based off a relevant, thorough literature review  In addition, we aim to highlight the importance of accessibility of these interventions for vulnerable populations and provide recommendations for integrating these services expeditiously  Methods Literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar  Conclusions Based off data collected from experience in a public health system and literature review, we conclude that although the COVID-19 pandemic has initiated significant innovation to integrate technology for psychiatric care, this innovation is not equally accessible for vulnerable populations suffering from mental health disorders  Within a public county health system, there are barriers with providing mental healthcare to vulnerable populations  These barriers, which are applicable throughout the United States, serve as a rationale for the need of innovative solutions for the integration of these services in not only emergency situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but also in daily non-emergent operations to sufficiently address the needs for those needing mental healthcare","Ojha, Rashi; Syed, Saba","https://www.google.com/search?q=Challenges+faced+by+mental+health+providers+and+patients+during+the+coronavirus+2019+pandemic+due+to+technological+barriers","","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-06-05","",1664,""
